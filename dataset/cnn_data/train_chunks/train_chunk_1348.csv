"If you're planning to detox this January and need some advice then look no further than the queen of lean, Gwyneth Paltrow. The actress turned health guru has famously tried a number of detoxes and written a book about her healthy eating habits. Now on her lifestyle website Goop, she has revealed the secret to detox success for anyone keen to cut back in 2015. Scroll down for video . Queen of lean: Gwyneth Paltrow is famous for her healthy diet . The website offers a food plan with recipes and explains the benefits of detoxing for those who have made a New Year resolution to get healthy. Mother-of-two Gwyneth, 42, writes: 'Okay. Time to give that liver a break. January always signifies detox time for us, and this year is no different. 'The more we research, the more concerned about environmental toxins we become. We asked Bruce Lourie if it would be possible during our annual cleanse to not only drop some accumulated weight, but to get rid of some of the heavy metals, fire retardants, and pesticides in our systems, too (it is!).' What you can eat: Hummus is allowed as a snack with rice cakes, left, while halibut with green vegetables is an evening meal on the detox . She adds that she recommends a number of wellness centres in the U.S. that have helped her detox in the past. She said: 'I checked out some spots in Los Angeles to aid and abet us in our attempts: Tikkun, a little day spa in Santa Monica where they take detox to the next level, and The Springs LA, a beautiful new wellness center in a warehouse in downtown LA where the practitioners were remarkable and I grabbed delicious vegan snacks on the way out. I may move in there. 'There is more in the guides online, like Surya Spa, a full Panchakarma healing cleanse I did last spring, which was one of the most intense detoxes of my life (that's saying a lot).' Cheers: Smoothies made with green vegetables like kale are recommended . For those who can't get to L.A., they can follow Gwyneth's Goop plan. The website states that it is a 'simple but tough' detox. Basically, you have avoid all your favourite foods and drinks. It explains: 'Just say no to: alcohol, caffeine, added sugar, gluten, dairy, soy, corn, and nightshades (white, blue, red, and yellow potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant).' Easy! Other tips for an effective detox include drinking plenty of water ('hot water in the morning is key') and 'getting to the spa for a handful of treatments: Anything that gets the lymphatic system moving is clutch, and IR saunas are particularly great (and effective) as sweat is one of our body's most effective means for flushing toxins.' It adds: 'Think about kicking the week off with a colonic - they definitely get things going.' Been there, done that: Gwyneth passes on her tips after trying a number of detoxes in L.A . First Thing: Lemon Water . Breakfast: Godzilla Native Juice . Lunch: Roasted Kabocha Soup . Snack: Rice Cakes with Almond Butter . Dinner: Lemongrass Chicken Banh Mi Salad . See the full meal plan and recipes on the Goop website . The seven day meal plan provides details for three meals a day plus snacks. Each day must begin with a drink of hot lemon water. Breakfasts are mostly fruit or vegetable smoothies while 'Clean Granola' is also allowed. Lunches are mostly soups or salads while dinner options include chicken kefta wraps and seared halibut with lentils. Snacks are more smoothies or rice cakes with hummus or almond butter. Proof that Gwyneth's advice works can be found in the transformation of her hairstylist and business partner David Babaii. Life coach: Hairstylist David Babaii has revealed that Gwyneth helped him to lose weight . Then and now: David lost 135 pounds (9st 9lb) through diet and exercise with support from Gwyneth . He told E! News this week that he lost 135 pounds (9st 9lb) with the Oscar-winner's help. He said: 'If I was hungry, I would email her any time of the day and if she wasn't sleeping, she'd reply right away, she had become almost like a life coach.'","Actress reveals details of annual detox on Goop website .

"An American Airlines plane carrying about 200 people suffered four blown tyres when it landed safely at one of South America’s busiest airports this week. The Boeing 767-300 had just touched down at Rio de Janeiro/Galeao-Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport when the tyres burst. Instead of coming to a stop so it could be towed, the aircraft taxied to the terminal, leaving a trail of light smoke and surface damage as the tyres disintegrated. The Boeing 767-300 had just landed safely in Rio de Janeiro when the right landing gear tyres burst . Helicopter pilot Jose Nonato Coutinho captured video of the incident and posted it on YouTube, where the clip has had more than 30,000 hits. He said the twin-engine plane arrived at the terminal moments after he landed his helicopter on Tuesday. Flight AA251 had just completed a 10-hour journey from American Airlines’ base at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas. As it taxied to the terminal the blown tyres left a trail of smoke and surface damage as they disintegrated . All four tyres on the right main landing gear were destroyed and its rims were exposed, leaving scratch marks on the tarmac. The Aviation Herald said an onward flight to John F Kennedy International Airport was cancelled and the plane was still on the ground in Rio de Janeiro the following day. MailOnline Travel has contacted American Airlines for comment.","Despite four burst tyres the plane continued to taxi to the terminal .

"Forget the Little Black Dress this winter, for British women it's all about thick black tights. A major UK retailer has reported sales of opaque stockings and tights are 112 per cent higher than the same time last year. Experts say the Duchess of Cambridge's penchant for the thick hosiery has helped put the sock-drawer staple back on the fashion map. Retailers have seen a huge spike in the sales of black tights, some experts believe that the Duchess of Cambridge may have had influence after she was seen wearing the legwear throughout her tour of New York . A Debenhams spokesman said: 'We have seen a 112 per cent growth in sales this season so far, which is huge.' They added that they had seen the sales of the garments steadily rising since 2013. 'Even sales of black tights in spring/summer 2014 and spring/summer 2013 were up in comparison to previous seasons.' Although Britain is experiencing cooler temperatures, with the mercury set to fall even further next week, experts say that it's the catwalks, not weather, that have made 50 deniers cool again. Sophie Reynolds, a spokesperson for Debenhams, said: 'Black tights are a functional winter staple and always a catwalk favourite. 'They are a practical way to stay warm, while still looking chic.' Fashion and beauty editor Lisa Haynes agreed: 'Unlike previous autumn/winter seasons, coloured and patterned tights aren't on trend so we're all going back to black.' The Duchess of Cambridge put aside her flesh-coloured 10 deniers for black tights throughout her visit to New York in December (left) as well as at the Christmas Day service at Sandringham last week . 'Even Kate Middleton switched her trusty sheer nudes for black opaques for the royal tour of New York. 'Designers like Hedi Slimane for Saint Laurent have put the cool factor back into black tights. 'He teamed every single look on the autumn/winter 2014 catwalk with black opaques, bringing mini-length hemlines into the real world.' Lisa added that the hosiery may be the hot accessory right now but their neutral colour means they can remain apart of your wardrobe for months to come. 'Black tights are the affordable ticket to versatility,' she said. Designers have helped encourage the trend. The black tights appeared on Saint Laurent's  AW14 catwalks . For many women, black opaque tights' enduring appeal lies with their ability to make limbs look slimmer, hide a multitude of skin sins and cleverly mask unshaved legs. And unlike sheer ten denier tights which require careful handling, are easy to snag and can get laddered in the wash, they'll survive rough and ready handling . Debenhams added that the demand for the tights had become so great they had to constantly order more stock over Christmas to keep up with demand. 'They instantly open up your wardrobe to skirts, shorts and dresses in the winter months - minus the goosebumps, said Lisa. 'Wearing black tights means that you can be a bit braver with your outfit. The dark base is the perfect platform for bold colour or print.'","Debenhams has reported record  sales of practical, opaque hosiery .

"Two rescue missions carried out by US Special Forces to save hostages held by ISIS in Syria ended in failure last night, according to reports. The botched operations took place in ISIS' de facto capital city of Raqqa yesterday - with the objective being to retrieve a number of hostages being held in the jihadist stronghold in northeastern Syria. Among the captives they hoped to save was Muadh al-Kasasbeh - the Jordanian pilot who was captured by ISIS after his plane was downed over their territory. Scroll down for video . Failed operation: Two rescue missions carried out by US Special Forces to save hostages, including Jordanian pilot Lt Muadh al-Kaseasbeh, ended in failure last night . The 26-year-old is the first foreign military pilot to fall into the extremists' hands since an international coalition began its aerial campaign against ISIS in September. According to activists, the failed operation took place around 20km east of the main city centre, The International Business Times reports. Abu Ibrahim al-Raquaoui, an activist in Raqqa and administrator for the secret anti-ISIS campaign Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, confirmed that the two rescue missions were attempted last night. Five coalition aircrafts were said to have  hovered at low altitude over Raqqa, while more than a dozen raids were carried out on the outskirts of the city. A number of key ISIS buildings were destroyed, while at the other end of the city, two helicopter gunships attempted to deploy special forces on the ground to rescue the hostages. Captive: The Jordanian pilot was captured when his plane went down over ISIS territory on December 24 . A picture published in Islamic State magazine Dabiq (L) shows captive Jordanian pilot First Lieutenant Mu'ath al-Kaseasbeh, who is the subject of a question-and-answer interview in which he says he was shot down . But both gunships soon came under heavy fire and were forced to abort their attempt to land - as heavy clashes between coalition forces and militants ensued. Another attempt was made to land in the countryside of eastern Raqqa between villages in the Alekershi area - but more fighting erupted. The dozen or so airstrikes carried out while the rescue mission was underway were the heaviest on the city  since ISIS captured Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh on December 24. Activists say an ISIS military base was among the targets hit. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees activist collective also confirmed the air raids - but gave no indication on casualties. As the new year arrived, U.S.-led coalition warplanes also targeted militants in Iraq and in the Syrian-Turkish border town of Kobane. In Iraq targets were hit around the town of Mosul, which contains an important dam, Fallujah, which is located just to the east of Baghdad, and Sinjar, where thousands of Yazidis were forced to flee after ISIS fighters took the town earlier this year. Stronghold: The failed rescue missions took place in Raqqa, a city in northeastern Syria that has become ISIS' de facto capital city . Last July, US Special Forces attempted to rescue several American and British hostages who were being held captive by ISIS in the al-Ekershi area in the eastern Raqqa countryside. The operation ended in failure after militants moved the hostages to another location, just hours before the attempted rescue operation. In August, the Pentagon confirmed it had attempted to rescue a number of captives held in Syria, including James Foley, the journalist killed in ISIS' first beheading video. Jordanian army troops were reportedly involved in the previous rescue attempt, with some eyewitnesses claiming they saw soldiers wearing Jordanian army fatigues. Two American soldiers were said to be injured in the mission, which took place near the Osama bin Laden training camp. US-led coalition warplanes hit 29 targets in Iraq and Syria on Wednesday, destroying buildings, vehicles and units, including in the town of Kobane (pictured) where ISIS are still fighting Kurdish forces .","Failed mission took place in ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, northeastern Syria .

"When the Eswein-Phillips family of social media moguls sit down to dinner, or go for a walk together, they don't just have each other to please. The so-called 'First Family' of the Instagram photo-sharing network have around a million and a half eager audience members to keep happy with their familial comings and goings. Their band of followers religiously shows their appreciation for the mixture of picture-perfect meals, idyllic cityscapes and luxury living served up on a daily basis by Sarah Phillips and her children Liz and Tom. The first family of Instagram pose in the living room of their Upper East Side, New York apartment with dogs Coco and Duke. From left to right Tom Eswein, Sarah Phillips, Reed Phillips and Liz Eswein. The family document their day to day lives on social media and have gained around 1.6million followers. Power family: Sarah Phillips, left, runs popular Instagram accounts alongside her children Liz, center, and Tom, right. Even the family pets, one of whom sits on Sarah's lap, have a social media presence . Eating it up: Sarah Phillips runs the @food account, which garners thousands of 'likes' and comments by posting idyllic snaps of meals, such as the above . Piece of cake: The @baking handle shows off Sarah Phillips's mango mousse case, above . Classic: Daughter Liz Eswein runs the @newyorkcity account, which features high life experiences such as breakfast at Tiffany's, above, and NYC motifs like yellow cabs . Seasonal: This post from autumn showed off a squash salad just as the vegetable was coming into season . #Chlieanfood: Even a family vacation to Santiago provides inspiration for the Instagram feed . Seasonal: This yuletide image from the @newyorkcity feed captures ice skating in Bryant Park . Raw: As well as meals, the @food feed features artfully-arranged uncooked food, such as these peppers . Each member of the family - with one notable exception - has staked out territory on Instagram, which recently overtook Twitter to be the most active social network. Sarah Phillips, 61, the matriarch of the family, and has claimed the enviable account handles @food and @baking, with followings of 330,000 and 27,500 respectively. Liz, 25, took on @newyorkcity, which has attracted a 1.1million-strong audience with its stream of idyllic-looking skyscrapers, coffee shops and tourist spots, edited to perfection. Meanwhile Tom Eswein, 29, who used to help out with @food, has turned his experience as a construction project manager to bear on his online life. He runs the @realestate tagline, which has a nascent following of 4,000. Team work: In the above post of the Rockefeller Plaza at Christmas, Liz plugs her brothers @realestate account, netting him hundreds of new followers . All-American: This apple pie was 'liked' by 520 of the accounts 27,500 followers . #foodporn: The luxuriant images have attracted an enormous following - this picture of smoked salmon was 'liked' more than 6,000 times .

Selfie: The @newyorkcity feed gets a personal touch, with pictures featuring Liz Eswein in person . Exotic: As well as classics like apple pie, the @baking handle dabbles in experiments like this lemon and potato pizza . In an interview with the New York Times, the family revealed that they have an in-house rule of waiting for the night's food to be photographed before they sit down for dinner. And once the eating begins, the generations trade social media strategy between courses. Sarah said that she imposes a strict two-per-day limit on posts from her food accounts, and often sits down with her daughter to help choose which photographs will do best online. The children have also shown a business aptitude for the social network - Tom arranged marketing deals to go with his mom's food posts, while Liz now works as a social media agent, representing other prominent posters. Her own New York-centric account also features a number of brands prominently, including NYC-based jewelers Tiffany and the Pantene beauty brand. Ingenious: Creations like these apple-shaped fruit pies have earned the matriarch a hefty following . Melting: This manchego, tomato, olive, garlic and ham tapas selection was liked 7,700 times . Cheers: Liz's posts show off an idealized version of New York City, featuring landmarks like the Empire State Building, and turning brand associations (such as the one above with Tiffany jewelers) to good use . House rules: Culinary creations such as the above must be mined for social media success before the family sits down to eat . A less enthusiastic participant in the Eswein-Phillips social media ascendancy is Reed Phillips, the Eswein children's stepfather and an investment banker. Though he has an Instagram account, he rarely posts and referred to the network as 'their thing'. But for the rest, their family connection helps them push their message even further. Liz, who has Tom as one of her Instagram clients, recently ran a  Christmas-themed post from the @newyorkcity account, directing followers to @realestate, resulting in a hefty boost for her brother's audience. Even the family dogs, Duke and Coco, have their own account, and get the occasional mention in posts, bringing the ring of real life to the heavily-edited online world.","Eswein-Phillips family run series of influential accounts on photo app .

"How's your day: typical, particularly good or particularly bad? Researchers at the Pew Research Center have posed this question to some 48,542 people in 44 countries. The results show Americans are significantly more positive about how their days are going — standing out in stark contrast to most other rich nations. Scroll down for video . The research shows just how much of an outlier the U.S. is, standing out in stark contrast with other rich nations where people are much less likely to feel upbeat about their days . Some 41 percent of Americans said they were having good days, while 49 percent said they were having a typical day. About 8 percent said they were having a bad day. Researchers show most cheerful people tend to be in Africa and Latin America . But, he added, 'The U.S. is a major outlier on this measure. 'It has the highest GDP per capita among the countries surveyed and Americans were more likely to rate a day as particularly good than people in other rich nations.' Overall, about a quarter of people surveyed said their day was going 'particularly well' and fewer than 10 percent said their day was going poorly. People in Africa and Latin America were more likely to be cheerful about how their days were going. More than half the people surveyed in Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, Nigeria and Colombia said they were having a particularly good day.

"Jourdan Dunn has been revealed as the first solo black model to grace the cover of British Vogue for more than 12 years. The 24-year-old Londoner shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on Instagram to her 954,000 followers after speculation on Twitter today. She wrote: 'I'm so Happy to finally say I'M ON THE COVER OF BRITISH VOGUE!!!' Scroll down for video... Jourdan Dunn posted her first Vogue cover to her Instagram account . Jourdan recently starred at the Victoria's Secret show in London . She added: 'Thank you Patrick Demarchelier and Kate Phelan for making this happen and also thank you all for the Love and Support it means everything to me #2015YearOfTheDunn.' The model used a string of kissing face emojis to highlight her joy. Patrick Demarchelier is a famed fashion photographer whilst Kate Phelan is an esteemed stylist. The cover, which is for the February 2015 issue, shows a simple shot of Jourdan looking stunning sitting in the sunshine in a short summer dress. Jourdan poses alongside her gorgeous Victoria's Secret model pals in matching leather jackets . Jourdan previously graced the front cover of Vogue in November 2008 alongside Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Eden Clark . Although this is her first solo Vogue cover, Jourdan did previously front the magazine in 2008 along with Rosie Huntington-Whitely and Eden Clark. This also marks a change for the fashion bible as it is the first time they have featured a solo black model on the cover since Naomi Campbell appeared in 2002. One hundred and forty six covers have been and gone since her natural, jeans and a white vest shoot. And the disparity hasn't gone unnoticed, with Naomi Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison writing an open letter to the publication in September 2013, urging them to acknowledge in the time lapsed since the last solo cover for a black Brit. They wrote: 'No matter the intention, the result is racism. Not accepting another based on the colour of their skin is clearly beyond aesthetic.' Jourdan has previously revealed her struggles in the industry having been turned away from shows who told her they didn't want, 'any more black girls.' She said in an interview last year: 'I want to talk about what goes on. A lot of people are scared to speak up. It has been twelve years since the last solo black model, a fresh faced Naomi Campbell, was featured on the cover of the magazine . Jourdan has enjoyed a highly successful career so far and has been the face of Burberry beauty along with Cara Delevingne and Edie Campbell . 'The people who control the industry … say if you have a black face on a magazine cover it won't sell, but there's no real evidence for that. It's lazy.' Now the star is following in her idol's footsteps by putting an end to the 12-year void for models of colour to appear on the cover. Beyonce and Rihanna are among the 58 celebrities to feature on the covers of British Vogue in that time, while Jourdan finally succeeds Naomi among the 95 covers that showed models. This is the latest in a string of good news for the model. At the beginning of last month she took a highly successful turn on the Victoria's Secret runway as the show hit London for the first time. Then in mid December it was revealed that Jourdan and Naomi Campbell were the faces of Burberry's Spring / Summer 2015 campaign. She said of the shoot: 'This campaign is even more special for me because I was shot with Naomi Campbell for the first time - someone who I admire and respect within the fashion industry.' Jourdan posed in September 2013 with some of her model pals including Suki Waterhouse, Cara Delevingne, Georgia May Jagger and Clara Paget . Jourdan began her career at an early age after being spotted in a Hammersmith Primark in 2006 - she was signed to Storm Model Management not long after. Mother to a five-year-old son named Riley, Jourdan has previously worked for designers such as Calvin Klein, Balmain and Topshop. She is also a firm favourite on the fashion party circuit counting Cara Delevigne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger amongst her close friends. Last year, Forbes announced that she was the 10th highest paid model, making an estimated $4m last year and beating world-renowned beauty Cara, who earned $3.5m. Rihanna has previously fronted the magazine in 2011, however, she was the only black cover star for the whole year .","Is the first solo black model to grace the magazine since 2002 .

"A teenager woke up while undergoing brain surgery in Poland and began speaking to doctors about cats and how the surgery was going. Iga Jasica, 19, was undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous growth from inside her head at the Central Clinical Hospital in the city of Katowice in southwest Poland when the incident happened. Neurosurgeons had removed the top part of her skull and were in the process of taking out parts of the growth when suddenly she woke up. Iga Jasica, 19, was undergoing brain surgery in a hospital in Katowice, southwest Poland, when she suddenly came round and began speaking . But instead of panicking or crying out in pain, Miss Jasica began calmly talking to doctors and asked how her operation was going. Medics say she was unable to see or feel anything that was happening to her, but for some reason had regained consciousness and the ability to speak. Doctors say it is possible that the brain surgery caused neurons to trigger which could have woken Miss Jesica up, but investigators are probing whether the anesthetic was administered incorrectly. Despite having part of her skull removed and her brain exposed, Miss Jasica began talking to doctors about how her operation was going, and cats - her favourite animal . Medics added that it was extremely unusual for a patient to come round during surgery, especially while their brain was exposed. After the operation Miss Jasica said: 'I can’t remember much but the doctor said he talked to me about cats, which I love. 'I missed Christmas because of this operation but it is the best present I could have had as I am now feeling great.'","Iga Jasica, 19, was midway through surgery to remove cancer from brain .

"A 22-year-old waitress whose legs were severed by a train as she walked home after work was conscious during the ordeal and had to wait three hours in the freezing cold before she was taken to hospital. Sarah Stott  was walking across a set of tracks as she made her way home in Verdun near Montreal when the train struck her in December. She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and she also risks losing her fingertips after suffering hypothermia as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures. Severe: Sarah Stott, 22, was making her way across a set of tracks on her way to her home in Verdun near Montreal when a train struck her in December . Debiltating: She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and she also risks losing her fingertips after suffering hypothermia as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures . Despite the double amputation, her friends and family say she is in good spirits and a crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $30,000 towards her medical bills. Miss Stott had planned to visit a friend following her shift at the Irish Embassy Pub and Grill in downtown Montreal on Monday December 8. She got a taxi to her house but when she realized no one was at home, she left on foot and headed home. As a short cut, she made her way over the CN Rail Tracks near Victoria Bridge, an area which has become popular with people crossing despite being unauthorized. Miss Stott noticed there was a stopped train on one side of the tracks, however she did not spot the second coming the other way. It's not known how fast the train was travelling at the time. Her mother told CBC that Miss Stott could see her severed legs beside her on the tracks, so tried to crawl towards them. She then lay on the ground in the cold for three hours before she saw another train approaching, waved it down and got them to help. Miss Stott was then admitted to Montreal hospital trauma unit and has undergone 15 surgeries since her arrival. Her mother Shelley said: 'It’s a miracle that she’s alive. Every day with her is an absolute blessing. She has an extremely strong spirit and will to live. She was left there for three, four hours with her legs severed, in the cold. She was still conscious. She was hypothermic.' Her mother said Miss Stott saw her severed legs laying on the tracks next to her so she tried to crawl towards them. She lay in the freezing cold for three hours before she was taken to hospital . Positive: Despite the double amputation, her friends and family however say she is in good spirits and a crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $30,000 towards her medical bills . Despite the severity of her injuries her mother added that she still had a sense of humor. Mrs Stott added: 'I walked into the room one day and she was awake, and she lifted her leg and said, ""Look Mom, I have no legs!"" And I said, ""Yes sweetheart, you’re going to get a brand new one.'"" 'She said, 'Yes I am! It’ll be firm forever — and I want it tanned,'"" Her mother now plans to take her back to the family home in Ottawa so she can care for her. With a long road ahead of her, a GoFundMe page has been set up and has already attracted hundreds of anonymous bids. 'It’s very overwhelming,' Mrs Stott added. 'I always believed people have a good heart, but for the amount that was raised in such little time. 'I’m speechless. I’m overwhelmed. I’m full of gratitude.' Spirit: Her family say she has maintained her sense of humor while laying in her hospital bed.

"Robin Doan awakened to her mother's screams and gunshots as she lay in bed inside her family's Texas Panhandle farmhouse. A few moments later she saw a bright flash. A man had fired an AK-47 at her bed, but somehow the bullet missed her. 'I pretended I was dead the whole time,' she told a dispatcher during a frantic 911 call September 30, 2005. 'I'm 10 years old, and I don't know what to do. I'm scared.' Nearly ten years on from that night when she played dead for two hours to survive, Robin, 19, is still haunted by what murderer Levi King did to her family as he methodically walked around her home, killing simply for fun. Scroll Down for Video . Robin Doan: The sole survivor of the 2005 massacre of a Pampa farming family is haunted by the memory of her mother's screams and will tell her story on a CBS special to air on January 3 . 'Robin lives every day with thoughts of her mother's screams in her head,' said her aunt, Christy Powell in 2009 interview with the Associated Press. This Saturday, CBS will air a special, Sole Survivor, which recounts the horrific events of that evening as King broke in and shot dead Robin's mother, 35-year-old Michell Conrad, who was six months pregnant, her father, 31-year-old Brian Conrad and her 14-year-old brother, Zach. Viewers will see Robin describe how she was awakened by her mother's screams, then crouched by her bedroom door and heard gunshots, then heavy steps down the hallway. She said she climbed back into bed and hid under the covers as she felt something whiz by her body. She then heard the person walk down the hall to her brother Zach's bedroom, followed by gunshots and a groan. Robin said she heard the intruder go to the kitchen, where she heard him rattling around. She said she remained still and silent for a long time after the noise stopped and she thought it safe to emerge. Without checking the bedrooms, she took a cordless phone, went outside and called 911. In cold blood: Levi King murdered 35-year-old Michell Conrad, who was six months pregnant; 31-year-old Brian Conrad and 14-year-old Zach Doan . Harrowing: Robin Doan recounts to a police investigator how she played dead for two hours to escape Levi King . 'I so hope my mom is not dead,' Robin told the dispatcher between sobs. 'I want my mommy. I want my mom.' When she believed the intruder had left a few hours later, Robin grabbed the family's cordless phone and ran outside to her stepfather's pickup. It was a cold, fall morning and Robin feared the worst. 'I think I'm the only one alive,' she told the dispatcher. The harrowing 911 tapes are testament to the terror felt by Robin when King broke into her Pampa home on a two-day killing spree in September 2005 that took him from Missouri to Texas. Sentenced in 2009 to life imprisonment for the killing of Robin's family, King also pleaded guilty to the shooting deaths of Orlie McCool, 70, and his daughter-in-law Dawn McCool, 47, in rural Pineville, Missouri. King drove Orlie McCool's pickup from Missouri to the Conrads' home in Texas. King was caught the same night trying to re-enter the United States at the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas. Killer Levi King, (right), is escorted from the Gray County Courthouse following his pre-trial hearing,  in June 2009 in Pampa, Texas . He claimed that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrenia; he also has been told he was psychotic. During his trial, prosecutor, Lynn Switzer told jurors that Robin and her family had 'no idea what was fixing to happen to them.' She described how King, dressed in black and toting the AK-47, broke into the back door and immediately went to the master bedroom. He shot Brian Conrad three times and killed Molly, the family's dog, before turning to Michell Conrad, who began screaming, Switzer said. 'Her screams were cut short because the defendant put five rounds into her body,' Switzer said. 'Can you imagine what it would be like to be awakened like that?' King then went to Robin's room and fired before walking to Zach's room and shooting three times. Johnny Doan, Robin and Zach's father, testified that his daughter called him and said, 'Daddy, Daddy, they're all in the house and they've all been shot.' Chilling: King tried to tell the jury that he was mentally unstable, but they did not believe this and he is currently serving five life sentences for his two-day killing spree . Still to this day, Robin says birthdays are particularly hard. 'Even my birthday is hard because I don't like celebrating it without them,' Robin said to CBS. 'I just have those days where I want my mommy, or I want my stepdad, or I want my brother, and want things to go back to being normal, and you just can't help but burst out into tears.' Under the agreement with Missouri prosecutors, King pleaded guilty to killing Orlie McCool, 70, and his 47-year-old daughter-in-law, Dawn McCool, in exchange for two consecutive life sentences with parole. Their bodies were found by a relative in a rural Pineville, Mo., home on Sept. 30, 2005 - the same day authorities in Texas discovered the bodies in the Conrads' home. Missouri authorities said King left the state in Orlie McCool's pickup, driving south and then west before coming upon the Conrads' home.","Robin Doan - then 10 - woke in September, 2005, to the petrified screams of her mom .

"A former international rugby star and his wife have had their first child on New Year's Day - after a 'year of hell' where she threw him out and sold his prized possessions on eBay. Wales and British Lions player Andy Powell, 33, was  taken back by his wife Natasha, 26, because he promised to change his ways after she accused him of cheating, gambling and lying. Last year Ms Gascoine left him and then tweeted  all of Powell's sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes. But the couple have managed to make a fresh start and yesterday she gave birth to their son Henry at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales. Scroll down for video . Fresh start: Welsh rugby star Andy Powell has had his first son with his wife Natasha, less than a year after they broke up and she sold his belongings because she believed he cheated on her . Mr Powell, who was dubbed a 'scrumbag' during their public split, today tweeted today that it was the best day of his life. A friend said: 'It has been a hell of a year for Andy and Natasha. But now they have a little one to think about - it is all new for them.' The happy news signifies an incredible turnaround for the couple who looked to be heading for divorce. Natasha Powell had sold her husband's belongings on eBay following suspicions that he had been cheating on her. She also claimed he paid for the wedding with gambling gains and got drunk before their big day and was nearly arrested. She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him. New life: The couple reunited when Natasha fell pregnant after a public falling out where she posted explicit pictures he sent to her and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes . Row: His wife  even sold the suit her husband wore on their wedding day during their initial break-up . Star: Mr Powell has played rugby at the highest level and fans had been able to buy his boots for less than £20 . At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. 'Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.' But the pair then reunited in May when Natasha discovered she was pregnant and friends have said they are happy. Office worker Natasha, who had previously suffered two miscarriages, decided to give Andy one last chance for them to be a family. She said: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time. 'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track. 'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.' Reflection: A friend said the husband and wife are back on track after 'a hell of a year' and we delighted at the birth of their son . The 6ft 4ins forward was capped 23 times for Wales and toured with the British Lions before turning to rugby league with Wigan. He then moved back to Wales to play for the Newport Gwent Dragons. After the birth of their first child at around 9am on New Year's Day Powell had to rush off to take his place alongside the Newport Gwent Dragons as they lost to Cardiff Blues. New mum Natasha was said to be 'recovering well'.","Andy Powell, 33, and wife Natasha, 26, had son Henry on New Year's Day .

"If global temperatures continue to rise, the taste of your favourite wine could either drastically change, or the drink could be off the menu completely. A wine expert has warned that fine wines in particular, such as Pinot Noir, are having their flavour significantly altered due to climate change. And, as a result, vineyard owners are ditching these grape varieties in favour of those that are better equipped to handle the increases in global temperature. Scroll down for video . A wine consultant from Lund University in Sweden said climate change is ruining the flavour of certain wines (shown). Drinks such as Pinot Noir are unable to cope with rising temperatures. This is because their grapes ripen faster, and vineyard owners have a more difficult task to work out when they are at optimum flavour . The effects are said to be most prominent in France, Italy and Spain - although parts of America, including California, would also be affected. The primary reason is that the grapes are growing faster than before due to increased temperatures - an effect more prominent for wines such as Pinot Noir. According to a study by Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania, climate change causes sugar levels to mature too quickly, while flavours ‘lag behind’. Waiting to harvest grapes until the flavour is fully developed results in less acidity. This creates a ‘flabby’ wine with a high alcohol content, as the ratio of sugar to acidity is too high. As the atmosphere warms, the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season. The optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar-to-acid ratio and the ideal flavour. Experts also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster. This is making it hard for vineyard owners to know when to pick the grapes at the right time to maintain a wine’s particular taste. In her study, wine industry consultant Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at Lund University in Sweden, wrote: ‘Climate change is beginning to affect the singular flavours that people expect from different wines - the experience you come to know and trust from your favourite reds and whites.’ She continued: ‘As the atmosphere warms, the desired ratio of acid to sugar occurs earlier in the season.’ ‘The optimal flavour moment may occur earlier too - but not as much - leaving a gap between the ideal sugar-to-acid ratio and the ideal flavour.’ She also said that grapes lack colour when they ripen faster. According to the Telegraph, the wine industry has already begun adapting to the problem, with vineyards dropping Pinot Noir in favour of grapes that can tolerate higher temperatures. Now some vineyards are switching to more temperature-resistant grapes as others like those that make Pinot Noir (shown) struggle. This could see such become less widespread, or removed from menus completely . Earlier this year, researchers also warned that climate change could increase the chances of wine becoming corked. The bark of the trees might be being chemically changed by increased exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of climate change. The genetic study was led by Dr Rita Teixeira of the University of Lisbon and shows how the £1.2 billion ($2 billion) cork industry is at risk. While cork struggles to maintain its consistency, plastic and metal wine stoppers are on the rise. To produce a good product, cork producers need bark at least one inch (25 millimetres) thick. If the cork is too thin, it will let air into the bottle and ruin the wine. But the trees, called Quercus suber trees, have undergone a drastic decrease in quality to the point where there bark is now as little as 0.1 inches (three millimetres) thick - just 10 per cent the optimum level. The reason for this dramatic drop in just two decades was unknown but now Dr Teixeira and colleagues think the blame can be pointed at climate change - although she said there could be other culprits.","Swedish expert claims climate change is ruining flavour of certain wines .

"Threatened with arrest: Amal Clooney was warned by Egyptian officials that she risked arrest for exposes flaws in the country's judicial system . Amal Clooney was warned by Egyptian officials that she risked being arrested for presenting a report which exposes flaws in the country's judicial system. The human rights lawyer, who recently married Hollywood star George Clooney, was issued with the threat after identifying the same cracks in the system that led to the conviction of three Al Jazeera journalists. Written before Mrs Clooney became involved in the Al-Jazeera case, officials considered the report highly controversial for its criticisms of Egypt's courts. Speaking to The Guardian's Patrick Kingsley after the journalists' appeal hearing this week, she said: 'When I went to launch the report, first of all they stopped us from doing it in Cairo. 'They said ""does the report criticise the army, the judiciary, or the government?"" We said ""well, yes"". They said ""well then, you're risking arrest"".' The report, compiled on behalf of the International Bar Association, suggested Egypt's judicial system was insufficiently independent. It highlighted the fact that officials in the ministry of justice have too much power over judges and the government too much control over public prosecutors. Mrs Clooney and her team recommended the practice that allows Egyptian officials to handpick judges for particular cases must stop. She added: 'That recommendation wasn't followed, and we've seen the results of that in this particular case where you had a handpicked panel led by a judge who is known for dispensing brutal verdicts.' The three Al Jazeera journalists represented by Mrs Clooney are Peter Greste, Baher Mohamed, and Mohamed Fahmy. The group was initially sentenced to between seven and ten years in prison last June by the controversial Egyptian judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata. Scroll down for video . Stuck in jail: The three Al Jazeera journalists represented by Mrs Clooney (L-R) Baher Mohamed,  Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste . Mr Shehata earned global notoriety during the journalists' trial after mocking Mr Fahmy's fiancee and rarely removing his sunglasses during proceedings. A few months later he gained further infamy after sentencing 188 people to death in one mass trial. The three journalists launched a new appeal yesterday - but Mrs Clooney suggested she fears the flaws highlighted in her report will prevent the group from receiving a fair trial. The men have been held since December 2013 - with their arrests coming after the overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood member. 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial . One of the defendants, Baher Mohamed, hold an Egyptian passport - and must pin his hopes on his sentence being overturned by the Egyptian courts. But Clooney's other clients, Mr Fahmy, a Canadian citizen, and his Australian colleague Mr Greste, are still hoping for deportation to their home countries. Both have applied to Egypt's chief prosecutor to demand they be sent to Canada and Australia  under the terms of a new presidential decree that gives foreign prisoners such an option. Inside Egypt, Mr Fahmy's appeals team was led by an Egyptian lawyer with contributions from Clooney that related to international law - but outside the country she is the one leading the efforts to win deportation.

"Kendall Jenner has been accused of Photoshopping a recent Instagram post, which featured her posing in a bikini while on holiday in Dubai. The selfie, which was posted on New Year's Day, shows the 19-year-old standing in front of a mirror in her hotel room, presumably as she was getting ready to head out to the pool or beach. But while many of Kendall's 17 million followers rushed to praise her trim and toned physique, others pointed out some suspicious-looking wavy lines in the bottom left corner of the picture, suggesting that they are signs the image has been edited. 'What are those weird wavy bits in the corner?' one commented, while another said: 'This has definitely been edited! Scroll down for video . Warped? Instagram users have pointed out some suspicious-looking wavy lines in the bottom left corner of Kendall Jenner's recent selfie . 'Why alter a flawless bod?' Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton questioned why the 19-year-old would feel the need to edit her images . 'Look at the weird distortion at the bottom. And her waist looks weird too.' Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton was also quick to point out the seemingly edited aspects of the picture, commenting: 'Maybe it's just the angle, but if you look along the very bottom of the picture, you'll see what looks like warping. 'Even the frame of the window seems to be bent inward a little — and WHAT is going on with Kendall's wrist? 'If it is Photoshop, all we can ask is: why alter a perfectly flawless bod?' One reader added: 'Don't know much about Photoshop but think the picture is doctored, because her arm is so skinny she looks like she has rickets or something.' But Daily Mail Online's picture director was slightly more skeptical about the Photoshop claims, saying: 'If she were to have Photoshopped anything it would not be that section of the frame that would be warped. 'I see that slight warping referred to on the window sill, but wouldn't she alter an area that was either on the other side or higher up and not near her wrist for a better effect? I think it is just the angle of the photo myself and that she looks amazing.' Trim and toned: Kendall frequently flaunts her enviable figure in a series of crop tops, be it on the catwalk (L) or at home (R) Kendall, who celebrated the start of the New Year with a luxury getaway in Dubai alongside close friends Selena Gomez, Gigi Hadid and Cody Simpson, is certainly not shy about showing off her impressive figure. The Estee Lauder model frequently flaunts her toned tummy and enviable waistline on social media and is frequently seen out and about in a number of midriff-baring ensembles. But this is the first time that the rising fashion star has been accused of altering an image in order to make herself appear skinnier, and many fans are bemused as to why she thinks any editing would ever be necessary. 'Kendall you are so beautiful never change anything about yourself,' one fan commented on the Instagram snap. 'This photo is everything, Kendall you are perfect,' another added. It is not the first time that a celebrity has been accused of altering their social media images; in April last year, singer Beyonce came under fire from fans after posting a picture of herself playing golf, which they suggested had been edited in order to emphasize her 'thigh gap'. Controversy: Kendall's close friend Selena Gomez has also faced heavy criticism from fans after she posted this picture of herself flashing her ankles in a mosque. The image has since been removed from Instagram . Wanderlust: Kendall has been enjoying a luxury New Year's getaway in Dubai alongside close friend and fellow model Gigi Hadid . At the time, one fan wrote on Twitter: 'really @Beyonce? we all love your thick thighs. NO reason to photoshop a thigh gap in there..' And Kendall is not the only one of her friends to have posted a controversial snap during their Dubai holiday. Yesterday, singer Selena Gomez removed a picture of herself flashing her ankles at Abu Dhabi's Grand Mosque from her Instagram account after fans accused her of being 'insensitive' and 'disrespectful' of the country's strict dress code. Commenting on the picture, Instagram user Alaa Almitwally said: 'Disrecpectful! It's a religion place not a place to have fun in, so disappointed.'

"The grandson of Oscar Wilde believes he has solved the mystery of how his grandmother met her end aged just 40 over a century ago. Speculation over the sudden death of Constance Wilde had ranged from spinal damage after falling down some stairs or syphilis picked up from her husband. It was a tragic end to a tragic life. Now, 116 years later, evidence suggests that she fell victim to eccentric medical practices and a botched operation after doctors misdiagnosed multiple sclerosis, although the condition was known by then. The death of Constance Wilde - the wife of author Oscar (right) - has been a mystery for more than a century but the author's grandson now claims she had undiagnosed multiple sclerosis . Merlin Holland, whose grandfather wrote masterpieces including The Importance of Being Earnest and The Ballad of Reading Gaol, discovered medical evidence among family letters that his mother had not wanted to make public while she was alive. He says: 'It's always been a question really. What did Constance really die of?' Those letters bear crucial passages from which a doctor, Ashley H Robins, has been able to diagnose symptoms nowadays associated with multiple sclerosis. Unable to walk, she suffered debilitating pain across her body, extreme headaches and fatigue, but the seriousness of her condition went unnoticed by her two doctors. One of them was an unnamed German 'nerve doctor', who believed in treating patients with baths and electricity, and the other was an Italian, Luigi Maria Bossi, who somehow thought that neurological and mental illness could be cured with gynaecological operations. Although Bossi had already conducted one operation which failed to improve her condition, Constance returned to him for a gynaecological procedure. Days later, she became unconscious and died. Two decades later, he faced unrelated accusations of unethical behaviour and professional misconduct and – in a final irony in this tragic saga – he was shot dead in his consulting room in Milan by the jealous husband of a patient, who then fired at his wife before turning the gun on himself. Constance's brother, Otho, was left devastated, but realised that any legal action was pointless because she had been convinced by Bossi that surgery would relieve her disabilities and enable her to lead a normal life. Merlin Holland made the discovery after finding a set of medical notes of the writer's long-suffering wife . Her grandson said: 'Constance's London and Heidelberg doctors had warned her not to be coaxed into surgery, but she ignored their advice, confident that Bossi's treatment would rehabilitate her; instead it cost her her life. 'Ultimately, both Bossi and the hapless Constance met their ends tragically - he by the bullet of an assassin and she by the knife of an irresponsible surgeon.' The Lancet, the leading medical journal, has taken the evidence seriously to publish a paper jointly written by Holland and Robins, a specialist at the University of Cape Town Medical School in South Africa. Holland hopes that this will now dispel the 'Constance death speculations' and bring 'closure' for Constance, who died less than a year after her husband's release from prison. She suffered enough. Having been virtually abandoned by her mother, following the death of her father - she and her brother were brought up by their grandfather – she married Wilde in 1884 and, after his imprisonment for homosexual acts in 1895, had to flee to Europe with their two boys. She changed their surname to 'Holland', an ancestral family name, and eventually settled near Genoa. The evidence emerged from around 130 letters written between Constance and her brother, between 1878 and her death. Constance, who was played by Jennifer Ehle in the 1996 film Wilde, married the author (right) in 1884 . In 1894, she wrote: 'I am alright when I don't walk.' A year later, her walking had deteriorated, but she had put her faith in Bossi who 'undertakes to make me quite well in six weeks and I shall be glad to be able to walk again'. But by 1896, her condition had deteriorated further: 'I am lamer than ever and have almost given up hope of ever getting well again.' Holland recalls that his mother 'didn't particularly want anyone to have access' to them, 'frightened of what, in an age of sensationalising everything, someone might do with them'. The first generation out from the literary personality is often rather 'overprotective', he observes. He notes that although biographers had mentioned a gynaecological operation, there were few details: 'People somehow never put two and two together and thought 'why is a gynaecologist operating on her spine?' The letters reveal that Bossi removed fibroids, benign tumours, having 'totally wrongly diagnosed what was the matter with her', Holland said. 'In those days… it was an extremely dangerous operation.' In closing this chapter of his grandmother's life, Holland said: 'I rather feel it will put Constance to rest, poor thing.' He visited her grave this summer: 'We cannot go past Genoa without going and paying our respects to her. We went and put some flowers on her grave. Every time I go there, I feel she's rather alone in exile in Genoa.' Today, by chance, would have been his grandmother's birthday.","Author's wife's death has been a mystery for more than a century .

"It's hard to imagine Hillary Rodham Clinton not running for president again – and easy to imagine the result of such a decision: political chaos. 'It would be shocking,' says Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who is advising Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Democrat who is considering a presidential campaign himself. Early polling shows Clinton in a dominant position but at least ten other Democrats stand ready if she declines to accept her brass ring-in-waiting. Outside groups have been promoting her candidacy for more than a year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . WILL SHE? Hillary Clinton is still the odds-on favorite to coast to a Democratic presidential nomination, but the rest of the potential field is still waiting to see what she'll do . OBAMA FATIGUE? As the current White House occupant's numbers slide, Clinton's work as his secretary of state looks more like a liability . The fundraising juggernaut EMILY's List is well into a foundation for the campaign to elect the nation's first female president. All that has left the potential field frozen in place and locked down financial donors, endorsements and connections around the country. But what if Clinton decided against another campaign? Those considered long-shots would become instant contenders and others planning to skip the race would give it a new look. Some whose political fortunes and plans for 2016 could change if Clinton decides to pass on the race: . JOE BIDEN . In any other year, the sitting vice president would have an inside track to the nomination. But Clinton's dominant standing within the party has marginalized Biden in early 2016 discussion. In a Clinton-free campaign, the veteran of runs for president in 1988 and 2008 would be an early front-runner . ELIZABETH WARREN . The Massachusetts senator is a favorite of liberal activists, some of whom are trying to 'draft' her into running for president – even though she has repeatedly said she is not. Warren's populist economic approach and calls to rein in Wall Street resonate with many Democrats disappointed by the midterm elections and the gap between the wealthy and the poor. If Clinton decides not to run, Warren is sure to face pressure to fill the void. MARTIN O'MALLEY . The outgoing Maryland governor has been a workhorse surrogate for fellow Democrats, trying to build a network of financial donors – only to be effectively frozen by Clinton. Even without Clinton in the field, the Republicans' defeat of his hand-picked successor in Maryland – and sagging poll ratings at the end of his term – would complicate his campaign. JIM WEBB . The former Virginia senator would bring a bipartisan record to the campaign: He served as President Ronald Reagan's Navy secretary. He is an accomplished author and decorated veteran, still carrying shrapnel from his service in the Vietnam War. He is independent and at times unpredictable, and his foreign policy outlook and outsider status could shake up the primary with or without Clinton. FIRST TEAM: Liberals' liberal Elizabeth Warren (left) would take Hillary's default slot as the leading female candidate if she doesn't run, and Joe Biden (right) would gain momentum as an incumbent vice president . THE GOVERNORS: Maryland's former Gov. Martin O'Malley (left), New York's current Gov. Andrew Cuomo (center) and Virginia's former Gov. Tim Kaine could provide executive experience in a crowded field . BERNIE SANDERS . Few Democrats expect the independent senator from Vermont to make much of an impact if he runs against Clinton, but that has not stopped Sanders from courting college students and liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire. He has maintained a large email distribution list, giving him a way of reaching activists, but is still more likely to shape the debate than compete for delegates no matter what Clinton does. ANDREW CUOMO . When New York Gov. Mario Cuomo declined to seek the White House in 1991 after a lengthy deliberation, the vacuum helped a relatively unknown Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton. If Hillary Rodham Clinton decides not to run, it could give his son, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, an opening to jump into a race he does not plan to contest. The second-term governor has built a record of accomplishments on marriage equality, gun control and, last month, banned hydraulic fracturing in New York — a move cheered by environmentalists. TIM KAINE . The Virginia senator has big-time credentials: He's a Spanish-speaking former Catholic missionary, Harvard Law graduate, former mayor of Richmond, Virginia, and the ex-governor of the state. Kaine quickly embraced candidate Barack Obama and found himself on the short-list for vice president. Instead, Obama put him in charge of the Democratic National Committee and Kaine later succeeded Webb in the Senate. He has backed the pro-Clinton Ready for Hillary super PAC, and would get a serious look if Clinton took a pass. YEAR OF THE WOMAN? New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (left) or Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar (right) could swoop in to claim that mantle from Hillary if she sits out or falters early . FAR OUTSIDE: Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (left) and former Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean (right) form the left vanguard while former Sen. Jim Webb (center) is a low-charisma outsider with military cred . KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND . The energetic New Yorker holds Clinton's old Senate seat and has been talked up as a potential heir apparent. A relative newcomer to the national stage, Gillibrand has displayed a strong acumen as a legislator, fundraising moxie, and a down-to-earth sensibility as the constantly juggling mother of two boys. She has championed legislation to remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command and promoted paid family leave for women. AMY KLOBUCHAR . The first woman elected to the Senate from Minnesota, Klobuchar has made political trips to neighboring Iowa to help Democratic candidates and the party, moves that always start talk about the White House. A former prosecutor, Klobuchar has built a reputation in the Senate for working across the aisle. On the dinner circuit, she displays a folksy sense of humor that helps her connect with Democratic audiences. HOWARD DEAN . The former Vermont governor and contender for the party's 2004 presidential nomination has backed Clinton, giving the former secretary of state an advocate among the party's liberal wing. As DNC chairman, Dean helped modernize the party's technological capabilities, laying the ground work for Obama's successful grassroots campaign in 2008. He's unlikely to leave the private sector, but may be swayed if Clinton decided to take a pass on another campaign.","Elizabeth Warren would emerge as the new standard-bearer for activists trying to elect the first female US president .

"The Ku Klux Klan is trying to attract listeners to their racist radio station by using messages of love and pictures of puppies. A billboard erected in Harrison, north Arkansas carries the innocent-sounding  'It is not racist to love your people', but the true sentiment of the message becomes clear by website it advertises. Underneath the picture of a young girl holding a puppy, is the address of web-based Ku Klux Klan radio station White Pride. Not so cute after all: The billboard showing an innocent-looking girls and cute puppy carrying a message of love is in fact advertising Ku Klux Klan station White Pride Radio . The website advertised on the billboard automatically redirects  to  KKKRadio, whose program listing includes 'This is The Klan,' ''The White Side,' and 'White Women's Perspective.' The billboard has been rented by the Knights Party of Zinc, formerly the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, and comes just a year after another billboard carrying a racist message was taken down. 'Yes, that's us,' Thom Robb, national director of the Knights Party admitted to the Harrison Daily Times, adding that he has paid for the billboard to be up for one year. Robb was national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which The Southern Poverty Law Center said he has renamed the Knights Party. Robb said that he has been working on the web-based radio station for more than a year and wanted to advertise it. The billboard in Harrison, Arkansas has been rented by the Knights Party of Zinc, formerly the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, whose 'national director' Thom Robb lives outside the town (file photo) Race riots a century ago chased all but one black person from Harrison, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, and in the 1980s the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan moved its headquarters there. Another billboard in Harrison that read 'Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White' was taken down in 2013 after being in place for just more than a year. A second billboard beneath it read: 'Welcome to Harrison. Beautiful town. Beautiful people. No wrong exits. No bad neighborhoods,' also was taken down. The person or groups who leased those spaces were not identified. Mayor Jeff Crockett and Chamber of Commerce President Patty Methvin, who expressed dismay at the billboards in 2013, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

"Thursday night: Kaleigh Lambert (right) with boyfriend Colton Mullholland (center) and a friend at the Sugar Bowl last night in New Orleans . It was the six second clip that sent the Internet into a frenzy of speculation - what caused one Ohio State fan to suddenly stop stroking the hair of one blond man and then turn ashen faced as she realized she was on camera during the Sugar Bowl? Had she been caught with another man? Had she been busted at the big game after calling in sick? And who was the stony faced blond man who appeared unmoved by her affections? The answer is far less scandalous than some online rumors suggested and far more innocent than others would want. The somewhat sheepish looking fan is Kaleigh Lambert, 23, an Ohio substitute teacher who was simply consoling her long term boyfriend, Colton Mullholland, after a decisive play did not go their way. Unfortunately for the gossip mongers online, she had not been caught with her hand in the metaphorical cookie jar. Indeed, another video recorded just seconds before the viral clip of Kaleigh, shows the truth and reveals how out of context the mysterious footage is. In it, Kaleigh holds her head in her hands and then turns her attention to Colton, who begins to shake his head with disappointment after a Buckeyes failure. Her hand rubs the top of his head and then makes its way down to the back of his neck, which is the point where the much discussed six second Vine video begins. When viewed together, the full story of what really happened becomes clearer. It becomes obvious that Kaleigh was not caught red-handed by the cameras up to no good, despite what people may want. She simply did not know what to do with her hand and just left her boyfriend to his own devices after trying to make him feel better. When the Daily Mail spoke to Kaleigh's mother Suzanne, she said that her daughter had been seeing Colton, 'for quite some time' and said that the Lamberts and the Mullhollands were family friends. Scroll Down for Video . Friends: Kaleigh and Colton (right and second right) with friends back home in Ohio have been revealed as the couple at the center of a viral video sensation . Innocent: Kaleigh Lambert graduated from the University of Miami and works as a substitute teacher . National attention: Kaleigh is no doubt aware that she has become a viral sensation overnight and the video clip that she features in has been viewed more than 13 million times . Having posted the video - which has been viewed more than 13 million times - onto her own Facebook page, Suzanne laughed at the attention her daughter had received. 'She wasn't guilty of anything,' said Suzanne, amused at how out of context the clip had been taken. It all began last night when DJ Sourmilk posted the clip online and titled it, 'When you're at the game with your side dude and realize you're on TV'. Others joined in the speculation. Act natural: Kaleigh Lambert appeared to be stroking the back of the blond man's head - but when she realized the camera's were on her she suddenly flinched and pulled back her hand . One imaginative viewer posited that Kaleigh and Colton had taken mind altering drugs and the sudden attention of the camea sent her into a deep and sudden crisis. Apaprently this theory was supported by the guy behind them, presumably their friend, shouting a comforting 'We're OKAY!'. Other commentators even suggested that Kaleigh had too much to drink and her real boyfriend was the guy on the other side of her, to her left. Others even questioned whether Kaleigh's boyfriend had made a bad smell and some just thought she had the look of a woman who left the gas on. Horrified, but why? Kaleigh looks positively mortified to have been caught on camera and appears to try and style it out . What have I done? The Kaleigh suddenly seems extremely preoccupied, unlike the man behind her who is loving being on television .","Ohio State fan, Kaleigh Lambert, caught acting very suspiciously during Sugar Bowl .

"Too much alcohol depletes your body’s store of vitamins, piles on empty calories and ages your skin. But as countless people embark on a dry January, renouncing all booze, Daryle Knight, 31, from London set out to see if a month of teetotal living  undo the damage? His aim? To lose weight and look younger by turning his back on his old friend, the pint. After the inevitable indulgence over the festive period, he set out to discover if a month's abstinence can really reverse the negative effects of alcohol on the body. Scroll down for video . Daryle Knight, 31, took on the challenge to ditch booze for one month to see what the effects of a dry January would be. He lost almost a stone and an inch from his waist . Renouncing all alcohol at New Year is as unoriginal a resolution as it is typically unsuccessful. So, to see if it really works, I pledged to live a month free from booze, abstaining to see what the true affects would be. At first glance, my body appears untouched by my love of indulging in a drink. But the cracks are starting to show. In fact, they're beginning to hurt. I start by looking at my vital statistics. At 5ft 11, my 13-stone weight edges me into the 'overweight' category, according to the NHS weight calculator. My cheeks are flushed and I have dark circles under my eyes. And despite my three-day-a-week gym habit, I still have love handles. I’m spending £50 a month to maintain my 33-inch waist, while making zero progress. Finally (albeit somewhat reluctantly) I face reality and record my drinking habits. I realise I’m out between three and five times a week, and drinking up to a bottle of wine per night - that's 37 units a week. And that's motivation enough. Day one . And afterwards . Daryle before . According to the NHS, cutting your weekly alcohol units can improve skin tone, prevent weight gain and increase energy levels. During his month of abstinence, Daryle's waist slimmed from 33 to 32 inches. And his weight dropped from 13st to 12st. I set myself rules - no drinking for the next 28 days. And I pledge to replace alcoholic drinks with  juice or water, to keep my body hydrated and replenish the stores depleted by nights out. Four days in . The first four days of the challenge are pretty easy; I develop a coping strategy - I say no to social invites. It’s easier to stay in and drink water, than face temptation in the pub. But, my first hurdle appears in the shape of a colleague’s birthday. The phrase ""go on just have one, don’t be a bore"" is repeated through the night and at about midnight I think about caving, but instead I just leave early. On the upside my body is beginning to show signs of transformation. I spend more time in the gym - and I note it is the only location where people are drinking water out of choice. And I notice my strength is improving, as I increase my weights. Before I could shoulder press 45kg soon I can lift 60kg. A clearer head has me more focused on maximum results. I increase my arm curls. New definition is definitely emerging. I also have extra energy, which nutritionist Dr Sue Langham-New explains is due to a better diet and sleeping like a baby. It turns out the reason my hangovers felt like jetlag because alcohol affects normal sleep patterns. With the extra get-up-and-go, my three to four gym sessions a week extend to five to six times a week. And I'm even finding the time to cook at home; grilled chicken and vegetables have replaced my post pint steak baguette. Burning off the average Vodka Red Bull will involve 12 minutes on the rowing machine, while a glass of champagne will require eight minutes on the badminton court . A smoothie made of pineapple juice, banana, yoghurt and wheat germ can help counteract the effects of alcohol by replenishing potassium and vitamin B in the body . The full article is available in the January/February edition of Men's Health on sale now . The end is in sight . By day 26, the end is in sight. On the final day, I look in the mirror again, my stomach is definitely more defined. I get the tape measure out and my waist is a whole size smaller. The NHS calculator has me firmly back in a  weight for my height. My sleep, diet and physical activity have all improved. The results are impressive but what have I learnt? Mainly, I’m in no hurry to stay on this challenge. The whole month felt too strict and beyond the 28 days you’d need serious willpower to keep going, which is why the pubs are full come February 1. Instead moderation is the method for me. I definitely want to maintain the benefits, so I’ll be opting for a two weeks on, two weeks off, plus planning more events without alcohol involved. I want to give my body a break without the contractual abstinence. It's the rebound binge that will sink you. Read the full report in the January/February 2015 issue of Men’s Health, on sale now.

"Katie Hopkins  dislikes plus-size models and wants overweight people to pay the NHS to treat any health problems resulting from their size . Katie Hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the UK - she recently came second in a poll of the world's most hated people. But her latest battle - to shame people into losing weight - has virtually made her a social pariah. The television star's new documentary, which sees her gain and lose three stone in six months, has made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her. The mother-of-three told FEMAIL: 'Fat people can be quite afraid of me, there is this sort of Hopkins fear. 'A lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street. 'Others will present me with their excuses before I have even opened my mouth, which is weird because it's not like I go around judging me all of the time. Fat mums completely avoid me, but that’s fine.' Katie has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years. Last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she wouldn't hire a fat person because they are 'lazy'. So in the last six months, the 39-year-old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly, to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds. The star has very little time for larger people, admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat, but she has even less for their excuses. Instead of laying the blame for Britain's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies, Katie says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do. The documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story follows Katie Hopkins as she gains 3st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then loses the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise . Katie said: 'At my heaviest during this television experiment, I weighed 12 stone. 'Nowadays, I hear a lot of women say 12st isn’t that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14. 'But it's strange idea that we think 12st isn’t that big, I actually find it very alarming. Katie wants her TLC documentary to start a debate about the nation's obesity crisis . 'We keep pushing up the boundaries, first of all 10st wasn't that big, then 11st and now 12st. 'I really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation. 'By putting size 16 models in Debenhams shop windows and embracing bigger seats, bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal.' But while Katie thinks the plus-size models in Debenhams shop windows are unacceptable, the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in Topshop are acceptable in her eyes. She said: 'I don’t mind skinny mannequins. 'I didn’t think that they were particularly skinny, I thought that they pretty alright. 'There are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny. I was a pretty skinny kid. 'In terms of sizing, Mango starts their plus-size collection at a size 12 and I’ve always said that size 12 is a size called fat. 'Because for me, it’s not necessarily that a size 12 is fat, it’s so that people can have a sense of what is normal. 'I believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger, we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal.' Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot. Asked about a fat tax as a potential solution, making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce, Katie scoffs and suggests a far more radical option. The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st  'killed her' and left her in constant floods . In part two of Katie's documentary, airing Saturday, she debates diet bloggers and plus-size campaigners . She says: 'I’m not averse to the idea of a fat tax, but I would go much more brutal than that. 'I think the fact that we don’t own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have. 'For instance, our NHS in this country is free at point of use, but most people perceive that as completely free. 'Therefore, any problem that they create with their body is also free, with someone else footing the bill.' Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot . She continued: 'Obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like £17.4 billion last year. 'We need to make these people own the problem. So, we should have a social security insurance scheme, whereby people are charged if they don’t make a genuine effort to look after their own health. 'If you don’t look after your own health, guess what? You’re going to pay more. So if you smoke, guess what? You’re going to pay more. You drink too much, guess what? You’re going to pay more. 'And if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese, then you’re going to pay for your hip operation as well. 'That would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax. 'Because this tea and sympathy lark just isn't working.' The first episode of Katie's new two-part documentary Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story airs tonight on TLC, with the second programme coming out tomorrow evening. In half a year, Katie went from 8st 12lb to 11st 13lb and then lost the weight again to prove how easy it is to get fit. The journey was all captured on camera. Katie Hopkins: My Fat Story, airs Friday and Saturday, 2 and 3 January at 9pm on TLC.","Katie Hopkins is so vocal on obesity that people now avoid her in street .

A sheriff's deputy has been arrested for allegedly taking nude photographs of a woman from outside her home in New York State and posting them online. The victim, from Germantown, Columbia County says she was told by an acquaintance that naked photos of her could be found on the internet. Deputy sheriff Thomas Bagnall, 27, of Hudson, has been charged with second-degree unlawful surveillance and is currently in custody. The unnamed woman told police she had been alerted to the existence of the photographs in August this year and reported them.

"American Vogue used more black coverstars in 2014 than it ever has before in a single year. Four stars - Rihanna, Lupita Nyong'o, Joan Smalls and Kanye West - appeared on American Vogue covers last year out of a total of 15 overall, the rest of whom were white. However, only Rihanna and Lupita were given solo covers; Kanye was joined by his wife Kim Kardashian and Joan Smalls appeared with fellow supermodels Cara Delevingne and Karlie Kloss. Record: American Vogue chose more black celebrities to grace its covers in 2014 than it ever had before in one year, including two solo stars, Lupita Nyong'o  in July (left) and Rihanna in March (right) Four in total: Joan Smalls appeared on the cover of Vogue's esteemed September issue, along with Cara Delevingne and Karlie Kloss (left), while Kanye West graced the cover with Kim Kardashian in April (right) For American Vogue, it certainly signals a move, albeit a slow one, towards the embrace of more ethnic diversity. In 2013, Michelle Obama and Beyonce were the only women of color to appear on the publication's cover. In 2012, Serena Williams took the sole spot and in 2011, it was Rihanna. When Halle Berry covered Vogue's most important volume of the year - the September issue - in 2010, she became the first woman of color to do so since Naomi Campbell in 1989. Slow progress: When Halle Berry covered American Vogue's September issue in 2010 (left), she became the first woman of color to do so since Naomi Campbell in 1989 (right) Plain to see: According to The Fashion Spot, white models have been chosen as cover stars nearly five times as often as non-white women have made the cut (pictured) Last year's performance, however, puts American Vogue head-and-shoulders above other high-fashion publications in terms of diversity on its covers. Last month, The Fashion Spot assessed 44 major print publications across the globe to determine which magazines did and did not feature models from a minority background on their cover at some point in 2014. White models were found to appear 567 times out of 611 total covers, while people of color made the cut just 119 times, nearly five times less overall. Status quo: Vogue UK has not featured a solo model of color on its cover in a whopping 12 years. Pictured, Cara Delevingne fronts last year's September issue . Lack of representation: Neither LOVE (left, Fall/winter 2014 issue) nor Harper's Bazaar UK (right, September 2014 issue) chose a single cover model of color last year . Harper’s Bazaar U.S. and UK, Vogue UK, Vogue Netherlands, Vogue Paris, Vogue Ukraine, Vogue Russia, Teen Vogue, Numéro, LOVE and Porter all failed to use a woman of minority on their covers at all in 2014. Keep in mind that The Fashion Spot's survey only took models into account and not celebrities. Beyonce made Vogue UK's cover in 2013, for example, and Rihanna did so in 2011. Vogue UK has not featured a solo model of color on its cover in a whopping 12 years, the last instance being Naomi Campbell's appearance in 2002. But British black supermodel Jourdan Dunn announced today that she would be breaking that spell, having made Vogue UK's February 2015 cover. The 24-year-old Londoner shared the cover image of the fashion magazine on Instagram to her 954,000 followers, writing: 'I'm so Happy to finally say I'M ON THE COVER OF BRITISH VOGUE!!!' Only time will tell whether Vogue continues to lead the way in including a wider range of ethnicities on its covers in 2015, and whether the rest of the fashion world will follow.","Rihanna, Lupita Nyong'o, Joan Smalls and Kanye West made American Vogue's cover last year .

"A house described as 'one of the worst cases of hoarding ever seen', has been cleared after officials discovered five refrigerators filled with food so rancid it had liquefied and five dead cats among the squalor. Armed with a court-signed abatement warrant, Las Vegas officials began hauling away items from Kenneth Epstein's home on Friday after they found materials stacked from floor to ceiling inside and declared it uninhabitable. 'It's a very tragic situation, but it's also tragic for the neighbors,' Councilman Stavros Anthony said.

This photo provided by the City of Las Vegas via the Las Vegas Review-Journal shows a cat on a pile of rubbish inside hoarder Kenneth Epstein's home during a cleanup attempt . City spokesman David Riggleman said . Epstein, 55, had created a space for himself to crawl on top of the . materials, but wouldn't have been able to walk upright in the house at . the Sun City Summerlin retirement community. Last . week, building code officials went to the home but couldn't enter . because there was so much stuff blocking the door. They had to take the . door off the hinges to enter. Riggleman . said ten truckloads of stuff were removed by Saturday afternoon and the . cleanup continued Sunday. In all, a private removal company was working . with officials to remove about 15 truckloads of materials. Nine cats have been captured by animal . control officers as authorities called it the worst case of hoarding . they have ever seen.

'You can write whatever you like about me,' he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He has been cooperative except when . he locked himself in the house on Friday when workers tried to enter to . remove stuff authorized under the warrant. Items . that Epstein wants to keep will be put in two storage bins and . fumigated. If he doesn't pay for the cleanup, the city will file a lien . against his house, making him unable to sell until the debt is settled. Squalor: A satellite view of Kenneth Epstein's home in the Sun City Summerlin retirement community, Las Vegas where the back yard is piled high with garbage . Obsession: Inside the property was so blocked with possessions that authorities had to take the door off to enter at the weekend . Epstein has received eight citations from the city about the hoarding since 2007. According to neighbors, the problem became more severe the last two years as materials also piled up in his front courtyard and back patio. Epstein became the owner in 2010 after his mother died. People often become hoarders because of trauma in their life, according to experts. 'This probably won't be the last episode. We understand we may have to return,' Riggleman said.","Homeowner Kenneth Epstein, 55, had created crawl spaces through stacks .

"President Barack Obama used an executive order today to impose new sanctions on North Korea today over its 'destructive, coercive cyber-related actions,' including a hack on computers Sony last month. The sanctions affect three state-controlled North Korean companies and 10 of its government officials, the Associated Press reports. Obama, still on vacation in Hawaii, notified Congress of his actions in a letter this afternoon. Scroll down for video . At a press conference the day he departed for his annual holiday in the Hawaiian islands, President Barack Obama promised a 'proportional and appropriate' response to North Korea's hack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. Today he levied sanctions on the foreign government and 10 of its officials . Obama promised at a press conference last month before departing for his annual holiday in the Hawaiian islands that he would take 'proportional and appropriate' actions to punish North Korea for its attack on Sony's computers. Obama would not say whether sanctions were under consideration at that time or detail other possible retaliatory measures the U.S. might take against North Korea such as a cyber hack of its own, just that he was considering 'a range of options.' 'They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond,' he said. 'We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose. 'It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference,' he added. Days later North Korea began experiencing massive, repeated internet outages. The State Department did not take credit for internet disruptions, which are believed to be the result of a hack, but it left the possibility open that the U.S. could be involved. A spokesman for the National Defense Commission, North Korea's military arm, later insisted that the U.S. was behind the country's internet failures and slurred Obama. 'Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest,' an unnamed official told the country's state-run Korean Central News Agency. Today's sanctions are the first government acknowledged actions against North Korea for hack on Sony's computers and related threats of violence against movie theaters that showed a James Franco Seth Rogan comedy film depicting the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 'As the President has said, our response to North Korea's attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment will be proportional, and will take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing,' the White House said in a statement. 'Today's actions are the first aspect of our response.' Obama told Members of Congress in a letter, 'I have now determined that that the provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during November and December 2014...and commission of serious human rights abuses, constitute a continuing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.' He noted that his executive order 'is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the Government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others.' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un delivers a New Year's address in this January 1, 2015 in this photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency. An unnamed official in Kim's government called Obama a 'monkey' last week and accused the U.S. of hacking the country's internet as revenge for Sony . The new sanctions build off of previous penalties levied on the foreign government by Obama in 2008, 2010 and 2011. Per AP, sanctions were directed at Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's primary intelligence organization, Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation (KOMID), the state's arms dealer and Korea Tangun Trading Corporation, defense research organization. North Korean officials named include KOMID representatives to Russia, Iran and Syria and the business' external affair officers, as well as a Korea Tangun Trading Corporation representative who operates out of Shenyang, China. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the sanctions were 'driven by our commitment to hold North Korea accountable for its destructive and destabilizing conduct. 'Even as the FBI continues its investigation into the cyber-attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, these steps underscore that we will employ a broad set of tools to defend U.S. businesses and citizens, and to respond to attempts to undermine our values or threaten the national security of the United States,' he said today. Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Obama administration's decision 'sends a message to North Korea and others that the United States will not tolerate illicit activities, including cyber attacks.' 'It’s time to acknowledge that our current North Korea policy is not working, and that we must develop a more proactive strategy across the board to respond to growing threats from North Korea, including its cyber activities as well as its weapons of mass destruction programs,' the Tennessee lawmaker said. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce also said he did not think the penalties on North Korea were stiff enough. 'It’s good to see the Administration challenging North Korea’s latest aggression - cyberattacks that can do grave damage. But many of the North Koreans blacklisted today have already been targeted by U.S. sanctions,' the California Republican said. 'We need to go further to sanction those financial institutions in Asia and beyond that are supporting the brutal and dangerous North Korean regime, as was done in 2005. 'My comprehensive legislation that the House passed last year would give the Administration the tools to do just that,' he said. The White House has said several times since the Sony hack that it would like to see Congress pass new cyber security legislation and it would support those efforts.","The sanctions affect three state-controlled North Korean companies and 10 of its government officials .

"Hall hath no fury like a woman scorned, as Katie Price and former  Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace recently proved. Over the past few days Katie and Aisleyne have unleashed a torrent of anger on social media towards the other women involved in their relationship woes. Katie's husband Kieran Hayler cheated on the mother-of-five with two friends last year and Aisleyne's romance with David McIntosh ended in tears when he reconciled with his ex Kelly Brook. Scroll down for video . Both Katie Price, left, with husband Kieran Hayler, and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace, right, with David McIntosh, have used their social media accounts to take aim at the other women involved in their relationship woes . Kati Price took to Twitter on New Year's Eve to wish her former friends Chrissy Thomas and Jane Pountney 's**t lives' and label them 'w****s' after they slept with Kieran but she ended  'Pricey is back' Katie let fly yesterday with a series of messages on Twitter in which she expressed her wish that her former friends would have a 'sh*t life forever'. Meanwhile, Aisleyne posted a picture on her Instagram account captioned, 'I don't take back, unlike ""some"" women', which is thought to be a thinly-veiled dig at model Kelly. But it seems Katie and Aisleyne are not alone in turning their anger on the other women, rather than directing their anger at the men who caused them so much pain. When David McIntosh's ex-girlfriend Sarah Harper gave an interview in which she said she and David had 'hooked up' while he was engaged to Kelly, Sarah alleged that Kelly sent her a series of unpleasant texts. Similarly when former TOWIE hunk Mark Wright cheated on Lauren Goodger with Sam Faiers during the first season of the Essex-based reality show in 2010, both women flung abuse at each other on camera. Meanwhile in the US, The Real Housewives of Beverley Hills star Brandi Glanville’s former husband Eddie Cibrian left her for  LeAnn Rimes. Brandi could not contain her vitriol for the country singer even admitting that at one point she thought she was going to ‘kill’ LeAnn for stealing the father of her two children. Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace posted this image to her Twitter account with the caption: 'Like SERIOUSLY??? Don't waste ur time darling... I don't take back, unlike ""some"" women' thought to be aimed at Kelly Brook . Aisleyne has been showing off her figure in a series of pictures on Twitter since her split from David McIntosh . So why is it that when a partner cheats or ditches us for someone else so many females blame the ‘other woman'? Relationship expert Laura Yates says that it is a relatively common way of coping with a partner's betrayal. She said: ‘Sometimes, when women desperately want to make things work with their partner and take them back after an episode of cheating, the way of coping and dealing with it can be to blame the other woman or women involved. 'My baaaay baaaay!' LeAnn Rimes recently posted this happy snap alongside her husband Eddie Cibrian, left . ‘In their minds it helps them to try and justify the cheating when in reality, both people involved in the cheating are equally at fault - and particularly the one already in a committed relationship. ‘You can't forgive and take someone back yet still blame the other women. This isn't congruent with moving forwards. ‘I think when it comes to moving on from cheating, if you do take the person back, you have to fully commit to moving forwards and that means not bringing up the cheating every time an argument arises. ‘That can be tough and so you really need to take a period of time to consider whether you can take them back and genuinely learn to forget the cheating and trust them or if it's more out of desperation not to lose them. ‘The latter means you will likely live the relationship in constant anxiety, which isn't healthy.’ Brandi Granville has  expressed her anger at LeAnn Rimes for ending her marriage to Eddie Cibrian . Psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy explained that often women feel, or want to feel, that their man has been manipulated by another other woman. ‘When the man cheats it is interpreted as being inspired, encouraged and manipulated by the other woman.' He said the wronged partner can see the 'the other woman' as a 'threat to their self-worth, self-esteem and to their personal identity. ‘But they still want to blame them as it becomes part of a coping strategy. They can attribute their pain and low self-esteem to something that is outside of the relationship they're trying to fix.' Laura Yates said  ending a relationship can sometimes be the only way to recover from a partner's betrayal. ‘The anger and bitterness you experience when you have being wronged by someone you love is natural and feeling that is all part of the healing process. ‘But use that anger to fuel you in a positive way as opposed to dwelling on it and allowing it to completely consume you. ‘You will soon realise that your life is far better without someone who cheats on you and that you are worth more. ‘The anger will start to fade. Be kind and good to yourself and take things slowly. Don't let the cheating experience define you.'","Both Katie Price and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace slammed other women in their partners' lives .

"The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has married the son of one of the country's most powerful officials, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said today. Kim Yo Jong, who is 27 or 28, was said by state media late last year to have assumed a senior position in the ruling Workers' Party.

A Chinese source said: 'As far as I know, Kim Yo Jong, deputy director of the Workers' Party, got married to a son of the party secretary Choe Ryong Hae.' According to the source, the lucky man is Choe Song, second son of Choe senior. The elder Choe is a high-ranking member of the Workers' Party and widely seen as a close confidant of supreme ruler Kim. Kim Yo Jong was seen wearing what appears to be a wedding ring in a photo released by the reclusive North's official KCNA news agency today. Kim Yo Jong was spotted wearing a wedding ring when she was photographed visiting an orphanage on New Year's Day with her despot brother Kim. She is the only member of his family to have a significant role in his regime, where he has been installed as deputy director of the Workers' Party. Sources claim that Kim's sister and Choe Song got married some time in December. Earlier last year it was believed that his father Choe Ryong Hae, may have fallen out of favour when he had not been seen in public for some time.","South Korean media claims that Kim Jong-un's sister has got married .

"A revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year. Laboratory tests suggest that the drug is likely to be effective in melanoma patients who no longer respond to existing treatments. Known as a panRAF inhibitor, the drug may also help people with a strain of cancer that cannot be treated with standard drugs. Melanoma, or malignant skin cancer, affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the UK each year. Scroll down for video . A revolutionary new pill for advanced skin cancer is to be trialled next year. Scientists say it is likely to be effective in patients no longer responding to existing treatments . In the U.S., the American Cancer Society estimated that it killed 9,710 people in 2014. The cancer is triggered by short, sharp bursts of sunlight and those who have been burnt at least five times are at double the risk of the disease. Surgery is always the first treatment option. But in more advanced cases patients are given drugs that suppress faulty versions of a protein called BRAF, which fuels the growth of about half of all melanomas. While BRAF inhibitors are initially very effective, the cancers generally become resistant to them within a year. The new drugs, which target a wider range of biological pathways in order to kill cancer cells,  have been shown to halt the growth of resistant tumours. They also appear to work against the 20 per cent to 25 per cent of melanomas driven by a different defective protein, RAS. Professor Caroline Springer, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, who co-led a study, said: 'Melanomas often respond initially to the current generation of treatments, but they inevitably acquire resistance to them, and there is a desperate need for more effective options. 'Our new inhibitors are the first in a new family of drugs that attack cancers without allowing them the get-out clause of drug resistance, by blocking multiple cancer proteins at once. 'We are very hopeful that clinical trials from this series of new inhibitors will begin very soon - and that they will ultimately become new first or second-line options for patients who, at the moment, exhaust all the available treatments and end up with fatal disease.' Melanoma, or malignant skin cancer, affects around 13,000 people and causes more than 2,000 deaths in the UK each year. In the U.S., it killed approximately 9,710 people in 2014 . Her colleague, Professor Richard Marais, director of the Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, based at the University of Manchester, added: 'Our laboratory study showed that these new drugs deliver multiple blows to cancer by hitting several cell survival routes at once. 'It's a step on from the drugs that are currently available which can't multitask in this way. 'The next step is testing this family of drugs in clinical trials to establish that they are both safe and effective in cancer patients, potentially providing urgently-needed new treatments for patients who have run out of options.' The trial is likely to involve a small number of patients and focus mainly on safety and dosage, although it might also produce some data about the drug's effectiveness. If you are unhappy with your looks, there is a greater risk of skin cancer, scientists have warned. A study found that people who believe they are unattractive are more likely to ‘gamble with their skin’s health’ by basking in the sun. They are also less likely to use sunscreen. The UK and US researchers say that those with low body confidence may crave a tan in the belief that the golden glow makes them look better. Alternatively, they may simply care less about their health. The finding could be used to improve advertising campaigns about the danger posed by skin cancer. Assuming the results are positive, further larger trials will look more closely at how well the drug performs. Few details of the trial are available at this stage and the number of patients due to take part is yet to be determined. But Professor Springer said funding had been agreed and an application made for ethical approval. She added: 'We're all very excited and very hopeful, because it's very important to have different therapies to offer patients who have become resistant to existing treatments.' Patients will be given one specific drug which was chosen from hundreds of candidates after rigorous testing. In the laboratory study, two drugs code-named CCT 196969 and CCT 241161 were tested. Both suppressed drug-resistant tumours from patients grown in mice without significant side-effects. Dr Richard Seabrook, of Wellcome Trust, which co-funded the research together with Cancer Research UK, said: 'Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK, with more than 13,000 people diagnosed in 2011. 'Doctors already have frontline drugs to treat melanoma, but many patients gradually develop resistance to them and are left with few other treatment options. 'This research, which discovered how two newly developed compounds could treat drug-resistant skin cancer, may give hope to the thousands who find themselves in this situation.' The study was published in the journal Cancer Cell.","Drug called a panRAF inhibitor could help advanced skin cancer patients .

"Madonna has been branded 'disrespectful' after apparently comparing herself to Martin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mandela and Bob Marley in a bid to promote her new album. In a series of Twitter and Instagram posts, the 56-year-old singer compared her '#rebelheart' to those of the civil rights activist, South African anti-apartheid revolutionary and reggae musician. The Queen of Pop did so by transposing her new album's artwork - which features her face covered in black rope - onto iconic images of the trio, before posting the Photoshopped pictures online.

"As people across the United States struggle to stick to their New Year's Resolutions, an 11-year-old Montana boy is offering lessons in self-discipline and delayed gratification after winning a $500 prize from his parents for skipping sugary drinks for a year. A year ago at Christmas time, Jon Sarisky's parents offered him and his older brother Andrew a choice - a guaranteed $100 then or $500 in a year if they avoid pop, milkshakes, hot chocolate and sugary beverages. Patience brings rewards: Jon Sarisky, 11, poses alongside his jumbo check for $500 - the prize from not touching a soda for 12 months . Andrew took the $100. Jon took the challenge. He tells the Livingston Enterprise that it wasn't that difficult, with the exception of remembering not to accept a pop at a friend's house. He says he stuck to the challenge by thinking about ways he could spend the money. Jon's parents drafted a contract, which resembled a legal document, to enforce his behavior over the year to come. The contract - signed by all parties on January 4, 2014 - is a promise to drink only water, though it allows plain milk as an exception. Notwithstanding a medical disaster, Jon signed away his right to enjoy any other liquid sustenancne, with sofa, coffee, fruit juice and Gatorade all specifically banned. To be extra sure, the contract included definitions of both 'drinking' and 'water', pointing out that soup was OK because it is considered 'eating'. When asked by a local news reporter what he would do with the cash, Jon joked: 'I could buy 500 pops'. Contract: The agreement, drafted with legal precision, allowed Jon to drink only water and plain milk for an entire year .","Jon Sarisky, from Livingston, Montana, abstained for 'Christmas Challenge'

"Organizing for Action wants its supporters to know its around for the long haul and will continue on past the next set of election, even though its founder, Barack Obama, will be leaving the presidency. 'OFA is not a political campaign,' OFA executive and former Obama adviser Jim Messina said in an email to supporters, according to the Washington Examiner. 'We're a built-to-last movement that's not going anywhere. When the polls close and elections end, we're the ones still here, fighting for the principles we believe in.' President Barack Obama delivers remarks on Obamacare at an Organizing for Action grassroots supporter event in Washington, D.C. in November 2013. OFA's website continues to reside at barackobama.com, and it manages the president's twitter account, despite describing itself as 'bigger than just one person or one cause. Likewise, the president often sends out messages on its behalf . OFA is offspring of Obama's presidential campaign apparatus, reconfigured in January of 2013 as he began his second and final term in the Oval Office. Previously it went by the nation Organizing for America and its sole goal was to get Obama elected to higher office. After Obama's time as a candidate came to an end it took on the unofficial role as the grassroots arm of his administration. It now has more than 250 chapters around the country. Billed as a non-partisan organization that doesn't directly support any candidates or political party, it's allegiance to the Democratic Party is evident and it openly advocates for the 'advancement of goals for progressive change at the federal, state, and local level.' Comprehensive immigration reform, equal pay for equal work, climate change prevention, state and federal minimum wage increases, healthcare reform,  gun violence prevention and paid family leave are mainstay issues for the grassroots organizing group just as they are for the Obama-led White House. Its website continues to reside at barackobama.com, and it manages the president's twitter account, despite describing itself as 'bigger than just one person or one cause. Likewise, the president often sends out messages on its behalf. In the last six days Obama sent out at least four emails to the group's listserv asking supporters to recommit their fidelity to both him and the group and the principles they espouse. 'It's because of folks like you that I'm able to give this everything I've got in the next two years,' Obama said in an email with the subject line 'I need to know you'll be there, too.' 'The work you do with groups like OFA is how we win real progress. There's a lot left to do, and it's no secret that we'll have our work cut out for us in Congress,' he told them. Organizing for Action head Jim Messina, pictured with the president here at a March 2013 OFA event, told supporters in an email recently that 'OFA is not a political campaign' and it will continue to live on past the next election . In an even less subtle reference to Republicans gaining the gavel in both chambers of Congress, Obama made not of the soon-to-begin session of Congress in a message on Monday and said, 'I'm committed to working with anyone from either party to put the American people first. Still, I know there will be plenty of obstacles in our way. 'We've never let it stop us before -- on so many of the big issues we've taken on, from health care to immigration to climate change, we've made real, undeniable progress,' he said. 'And we're not done, as long as we keep fighting together.' In a separate email Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager told the group, 'We are — and will continue to be — the sum of millions of grassroots voices calling for change.' They staying power of OFA is unusual as no other president has maintained a campaign or grassroots operation during his time in office or afterward that is separate from the national party. Progressive non-profit Center for American Progress, founded by former Bill Clinton Chief of Staff John Podesta, did not launch until 2003 - a full two years after the Clintons moved out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And while supportive of the advocacy group's work, the former president and his wife are not directly affiliated with CAP.","'We're a built-to-last movement that's not going anywhere,' OFA executive and former Obama adviser Jim Messina said in an email to supporters .

"Overshare: Matt and Shannon Moskal were the public faces of an Allstate campaign to make people aware that tweeting can attract burglars . This is the real-life couple whose oversharing social media habits made them the stars of a commercial where their home appeared to be robbed and all their possession sold off. Matt and Shannon Moskal, both 25, were seized upon by Allstate insurers, who noticed their tendency to post so much sensitive information online they were prime candidates for burglary. And, using national television and the big screens of the College Bowl as their platform, the company staged an elaborate fake robbery of their home in Illinois to teach them - and others - a lesson. At the start of the game, Allstate's robber mascot Mayhem, played by Dean Winters, appeared on the big screens to 'thank' the Moskals for revealing they were at the game in New Orleans - and therefore not home to guard their things. He told viewers: 'I'm kind of a social media nerd - I'm also kind of a burglar. So when the people who live here posted live from tonight's game I did what any self-respecting nerd-burglary would do. 'I let myself in and started selling their stuff live on the internet...' Allstate then directed viewers to an online marketplace containing an exact inventory of all their possessions, sold at ludicrously low prices, culminating in their car, which went for $200. Going... gone: The couple revealed that their possessions were painstakingly recreated, then sold for real via a promotional website while the ad campaign was running . In an interview with ABC News, the real-life couple revealed that they were tracked down by market researchers months in advance, who then recreated their home for the commercial. Part of what sealed the deal was a series of posts from the couple's Puerto Rico honeymoon, which went up in real-time and was proof of a substantial voyage. For the stunt, Allstate made real-life replicas of 300 of the couple's possessions, which were genuinely sold and shipped to the first bidder, . Shannon said: 'It was disconcerting to know our car could be sold for $200 or that this could really happen as a result of oversharing on social media.' They said they have reviewed their privacy settings - which were previously stuck on 'public' - as a result of the campaign - but admitted it's unlikely they will stop sharing as much, or as often.","Matt and Shannon Moskal, 25, were 'burgled' for College Bowl commercial .

"When it comes to working as a team, the staff at Kamakura Japanese Restaurant have it down pat. Lead by their knife-weilding sushi chef, the group of employees managed to take down a man with a gun who tried to rob the eatery in Champaign, Illinois, on Tuesday night. Tetsuji Miwa, 39, said he didn't think twice before springing to action as the 23-year-old assailant threatened the hostess with what appeared to be a revolver. 'I instantly grabbed my sushi knife, walked up to him, wrapped my arm around his shoulder and asked him what he wanted,' Miwa told The News-Gazette. 'He saw the blade, got scared and started running.' Team work: Tetsuji Miwa, 39 (right) sprang into action when an armed robber came into  Kamakura Japanese Restaurant.

Scene of the crime: Kamakura Japanese restaurant Sushi and Steakhouse in Champaign, Illinois . But it wasn't over. Waitress Aichan Mitsuhashi-Acs saw what was happened and alerted other employees. General manager Yuji Niizuma and assistant manager Joe Pendzialek came running from the kitchen while Mitsuhashi-Acs called 911. 'Tet was halfway out the door. We could see him with the knife,' Niizuma told the newspaper. 'We didn't have a choice because he was engaged in the fight.' The three tackled the man in the car park. Pendzialek had grabbed a bar stool on his way out 'and cracked him over the head with it'. While the bandit fought back, the trio were able to restrain him until police arrived. Afterwards, Miwa said he was worried about his special knife. He told the newspaper: 'It's pretty expensive so I didn't want to damage it or use it. I was telling him, 'Don't make me use this. 'As soon as the other two managers came out, I set it down to the ground very carefully because I didn't want to damage my blade.'

"It's that time of year when everyone vows to get fit and fight the flab to become fitter and healthier. But after the initial early January enthusiasm, many people will struggle to keep up with their proposed fitness regime. Some will complain that they just don't have time to fit the exercise in, while others will do too much too soon and get injured or give up because it's too tough. Scroll down for video . Push up: A great move to tone up the stomach and legs, beginners should start on the knees as demonstrated by fitness trainer Julia Buckley . Steam engines: This exercise will raise the heart rate, raise the knee to touch the alternative elbow . So what's the solution? Personal trainer Julia Buckley says short, intense workouts are key if you want to tone up and slim down. And she has an all body workout, which you can view and follow in the video below, which will tone you up and burn fat with the added bonus that it can be completed in less than 15 minutes. She told MailOnline: 'At this time of year a lot of people are looking to shed fat and sculpt, strong lean bodies - for those aims, a healthy diet is key, of course, but on the exercise side, high intensity workouts are the ticket. Jumping jacks: Another move for raising the heart rate and burning calories . Burpees: Push the feet out behind you, left, and then jump up into the air, right . 'Shorter, more intense workouts challenge our body by making it do things it isn't used to. You're not simply doing more of the same activity just for a bit longer, you're really pushing your body to places it hasn't been before.' The workout in the video, taken from Julia's book The Fat Burn Revolution, contains just six moves that are all you need to shape up. Julia demonstrates three ways in which you can do the moves depending on your current fitness - so if it doesn't hurt, you need to move on to the next level. One circuit of the exercises, as described below, should be done with 30 seconds of doing the move repeatedly followed by a 30 second rest. Then repeat the circuit again (or do the more advanced version if you found the beginners' moves too easy). Way to a flat stomach: Hold the plank position for 30 seconds . The six exercises are as follows: . PUSH UPS . 30 seconds push ups . 30 seconds steam engines . 30 seconds jumping jacks . 30 seconds plank . 30 seconds burpees . 30 seconds step ups . Do all the moves continuously with 30 seconds recovery in between then repeat the circuit . Beginners, start on knees, advanced with feet propped up on a bench or chair . Julia explains: 'Press ups are an awesome all-body move, again you're bracing the core and engaging the abdominal muscles to maintain a straight position, which is great for shredding the belly and at the same time you're sculpting the chest and arms.' To do it, start lying flat face down, position your palms face down under your shoulders and then push up so your body is balanced on your hands and toes and your back is straight. Slowly lower and repeat. STEAM ENGINES . Start in a standing position then raise one knee to opposite elbow and repeat on the other side. Move with more speed if you are fitter. This move will raise your heart rate while toning the stomach, bottom and legs. THE PLANK . This move engages your core muscles leading to a tighter, flatter stomach. Julia explains: 'The plank is one of the best exercises for tightening the tummy because it works the whole midsection of your body, including the deep abdominal muscles. It is also great for improving posture and balance and will build core strength to help you perform better many other exercises.' Begin by lying flat face down. Position your arms under your shoulders and then rise up onto your hands or your body is balanced on your hands and toes and your back is straight. JUMPING JACKS . From standing, do a star jump splitting your legs apart and then jumping back to bring them together. At the same time, raise your arms up and apart. Beginners can do the move more slowly. This exercise again raises the heart rate burning calories. BURPEES . Burpees are renowned as one of the toughest exercises around - which means they must do you good. From standing, lower yourself onto your hands and then push your feet out and back in, then leap up into the air. Beginners should do the move more slowly or could put one foot back instead of both. The moves works up a sweat as well as toning the stomach, arms and legs so is one of the best all body exercises you can do. STEP UPS . If you don't have an exercise step, use a stair or just mimic the action by raising your knees up and down. As the name suggests, the move involves stepping up and down leading with each leg alternatively. Step up: Use a stair if you don't have the equipment . Julia said if people follow this workout, which takes less than 15 minutes, twice a week, 'you'd get fitter and possibly notice some subtle changes in your body shape after just a few weeks.' She added: 'Obviously, if you did a workout every day, those results would be more dramatic. But over time, those results would almost certainly plateau and you'd need to up the ante by doing longer and/or more intense sessions. 'One thing is for sure, doing 15 minute workouts is a million times better than not exercising at all.' To stay motivated, Julia recommends setting yourself a goal and then sharing it with other people so you become accountable to follow it through. She also recommends seeking support from like-minded people online. While Julia's workout can be done at home, there are also short exercises you can do while getting some fresh air that will also take little time but will improve your fitness. Iain Reitze, 49, head trainer at Prestige Boot Camp, said it's easy to get fit in just 15 minutes if you are using the time to working the muscles and raise the heart rate. Time to get fit: A running session known fartlek (aka speed play) can take just 15 minutes . He said: 'If you combine these things with good nutrition it will lead to a fitter, healthier, happier life.' Iain recommends the short sessions below to tone up and burn calories. He explains: All of these sessions can be done by any level or standard. It is about individual work rate during each session. Just do what you can and do it as best as you can. 'They can be adapted to any level, made longer or shorter and you can change the exercises to train different parts of the body. 'Depending on your individual work rate you could burn 20-30 calories every minute, so the harder you work, the more you burn.' SESSION ONE: Fartlek Session – 15 mins . This session can be done anywhere and for as long as you wish. First, warm up with a steady jog for three minutes. Then alternate 30 seconds at a fast jog, followed by 30 seconds sprinting then 30 seconds walking. Do this six times. To warm down either steady jog or walk for three minutes. SESSION TWO: Cardio - 15 minutes . This is a HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) with five exercises that will condition the whole body. Start on the minute and complete every exercise as quickly as you can. Warm up for three minutes with a gentle jog and warm down by stretching for two minutes at the end of this session. The time you have left remaining before the next minute starts again is your rest time. If you feel you are not getting enough rest then just cut back on the reps until you feel your fitness improving.

"A mother has described her trauma at discovering her 15-year-old son had been sexually abused by a female security chief twice his age in a juvenile correctional center. The woman, a nurse, said the night her child was admitted to Idaho's state correctional center in Nampa in 2012, she was upset but relieved. '[The] night he went in, I felt bad, but I could sleep because he was safe,' she told the Wall Street Journal. Horror: A mother has told how her 15-year-old son had sex three times with the head of security at Nampa . But just months later it emerged Julie McCormick, the 29-year-old head of security, had groomed the teenager into a relationship. McCormick told a court in 2013 that she had sex with the minor three times, adding that she was 'in love with him'. She was jailed for up to 20 years in 2014. 'You hear about the Boy Scouts, you hear about the Catholic Church - those kids can walk away from it,' said the boy's mother, who has remained anonymous to protect his anonymity. 'My son couldn't.' In a victim impact statement at the time, she raged at McCormick: 'I thought I was making the right decision to help my son, but I was wrong. Jailed: Julie McCormick, 29, told a court she loved the teenager, before she was jailed for five to 20 years . 'You brainwashed my son into thinking he would have a life with you. 'You gave us trust, and then you demoralized him.' Since the conviction, eight other teenage boys and girls have filed allegations of sexual victimization. The mother's words come as a survey reveals 10 per cent of juveniles in US correctional facilities claimed they were abused in 2013, Press TV reported. More than 80 per cent of incidents involved members of staff, the nationa survey of juvenile inmates states. And around 90 per cent of the respondents were males alleging abuse by female staff.","Teenager was admitted in 2012, had sex with security chief 3 times .

"The woman critically injured by her police chief 'husband' in a pre-dawn New Year's Day shooting divorced him 15 years ago, DailyMail.com has learned. And Chief William McCollom went on to marry a rabbi in 2002 he met when she was his police department's chaplain in Delray Beach, Florida. But that marriage too ended last March when he engaged in an extra-marital relationship, she claimed in court papers.  McCollom reunited with his first wife Maggie— who is now recovering in the hospital from the bullet fired from his gun in the couple's own bedroom. These revelations come as it is leaned that McCollom told a 911 dispatcher that he accidentally shot his wife while moving a handgun that was in their bed - at 4:17 am on New Year's day. Scroll down for video . What happened? On Thursday, Peachtree City, Georgia authorities confirmed that local police chief William McCollom shot his wife in the bedroom of their home early New Year's Day. Margaret was last listed in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center . Wife No.2: Suzanne Carter is a rabbi who was the police department chaplain in Delray Beach, Florida when McCollon was chief. They married in 2002 and divorced in 2014 after she claims he cheated on her . Scene: McCollom  called 911 shortly after 4am on January 1 to report that he accidentally shot his wife . The police chief calmly told the dispatcher that he needed medical assistance for an accidental gunshot would at his suburban Atlanta home. The dispatcher asked, 'Who shot her.' McCollom answered, 'Me. The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to the side an' it went off.' McCollom and Maggie lived together for two years before McCollom's divorce from Suzanne came through last year. In court papers, obtained by MailOnline, Suzanne claimed he had 'engaged in an extra-marital relationship.' The tangled marriage-go-round that led up to Thursday's 4 a.m. shooting adds new intrigue to the incident that has shocked the leafy Atlanta suburb of Peachtree City. McCollom, 57, called 911 to say he had accidentally shot his wife, a former emergency-room nurse, twice with his police-issued Glock 9 mm. handgun. But it was later determined that she had only been hit once. Investigators have not revealed whether alcohol or drugs were involved in the shooting. McCollom has now been placed on paid administrative leave by authorities in the city of 34,000, 30 miles south of Atlanta, as investigations into the shooting get underway. No charges have yet been filed. The city's police have handed the case to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) due to McCollom's rank. The police chief is said to be cooperating fully. After being interviewed on Thursday, McCollom went to the hospital to be with his wife. It is understood the couple's daughter, has also flown to Atlanta to be by her mother's side. McCollom had only been Peachtree City's chief of police since October, earning $115,000 a year. He joined the force as assistant chief two years ago and was made interim chief in July after the previous chief Skip Clark stepped down suddenly. Fayette County District Attorney Scott Ballard told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that charges are possible. 'We’ll keep an open mind about this, and certainly the GBI has taken an open mind. The police department has been incredibly cooperative with them as they gave the facts they need. When we have those facts, we’ll see if it’s appropriate to bring charges.' Veteran cop: McCollom has been the police chief of Peachtree City since October, but on Thursday it was announced that he would be placed on leave pending an internal review . Happy couple? One of the McCollom's neighbors described them as 'loving' and that he has 'never seen any problems over there'. William (left) and Margaret McCollom (right) pictured above in a picture posted to Margaret's Facebook. It's unclear what relation the young man in the middle has to the couple . McCollom beat out 53 other applicants for the $91,000-a-year job. His appointment was heavily criticized locally at the time with accusations of cronyism as then chief Clark had come to Peachtree City from Juno Beach, Florida, less than 15 miles from Tequesta . William and Maggie McCollom were married in the late 1980s and divorced in 1999, documents show. For 22 years he worked for the Delray Beach police department in Florida, rising to the rank of assistant chief. While there, he met Suzanne Carter, a rabbi, who was the department's chaplain. But he suddenly quit the Delray force in 2006 to become chief of police in the much smaller Florida beach town of Tequesta — taking a $20,000-a-year pay cut. He left that job in 2010 so he could look after his ailing sister in Wyoming. While in Wyoming — his home state — McCollom worked as a general contractor, and only returned to law enforcement when he moved to Georgia in 2012 to a newly created position of assistant police chief in Peachtree City. He beat out 53 other applicants for the $91,000-a-year job. His appointment was heavily criticized locally at the time with accusations of cronyism as then chief Clark had come to Peachtree City from Juno Beach, Florida, less than 15 miles from Tequesta. After the McColloms' marriage broke down, William McCollom wed Rabbi Carter. But that marriage also failed. McCollom and Carter were only divorced last year, two years after he and Maggie had moved into the three-bedroom home where Thursday's shooting took place. McCollom called 911 at 4.17 am on New Year's Day to say he had accidentally shot his wife twice. She was airlifted to Atlanta Medical Center in critical condition. In the call he said his wife was having difficulty breathing and appeared to be suffering from both internal and external bleeding. She can be heard crying in the background. 'Oh my God,"" the police chief said. 'How the hell did this happen?' Lt. Mark Brown, of Peachtree City Police Department told reporters at a New Year's Day press conference that McCollom is 'very well-liked' by those who work under him. 'The department is hurting,' said Brown. 'We're very concerned for his wife and the chief. We're just trying to make sure everything is done correctly as far as the investigation goes.' According to Mrs McCollom's Facebook, she is licensed practical nurse who used to work in an emergency room. A neighbor who lives across the street from the McColloms described them as a 'loving couple' who 'do a lot of things together' and that he says he has 'never seen any problems over there', according to Fox.","'Oh my God.

"US scientists encouraged 20 obese people to eat extra fast food for several months, and found that about a quarter stayed in good health despite the additional pounds they gained. The study in the January 2 edition of the Journal of Clinical Investigation was led by a team of scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. Subjects were encouraged to eat 1,000 extra calories per day, mainly by frequenting fast food restaurants with the goal of adding six percent of their body weight. Scroll down for video . The results mirror what scientists have seen in the general population, which is that about a quarter of obese people do not appear to suffer from metabolic complications that can lead to heart attack, diabetes and stroke. The study involved 20 obese participants who were asked to gain about 15 pounds over several months to determine how the extra pounds affected their metabolic functions. Research participants were asked to consume 1,000 extra calories every day until each gained 6 percent of his or her body weight . 'This was not easy to do,' said chief author Elisa Fabbrini, assistant professor of medicine. It is just as difficult to get people to gain weight as it is to get them to lose weight,' Those not suffering from ailments typically associated with obesity at the outset of the study - such as insulin resistance, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and excess liver fat - did not have these problems even after adding about 15 pounds (seven kilograms) to their already overweight frames, said the findings. The results mirror what scientists have seen in the general population, which is that about a quarter of obese people do not appear to suffer from metabolic complications that can lead to heart attack, diabetes and stroke. But those whose did suffer from metabolic problems before the study grew even worse when they put on extra weight. All the research subjects were helped by dieticians to lose the weight they gained for the study, which was featured on HBO's documentary 'Weight of the Nation' while the research was under way. Study authors said they now understand better how to distinguish obese people who will be more prone to ill health from those who may be more protected. For instance, those with abnormal metabolisms accumulated fat in their livers, while the healthier people did not, even when they gained more weight. 'Another difference involved gene function in fat tissue,' the university said in a statement. The study found that overweight people with normal metabolisms had more fat-regulating genes. 'The activity of those genes increased even more when the metabolically normal people gained weight. That wasn't true for people with abnormal metabolism,' the study found. The results mirror what scientists have seen in the general population, which is that about a quarter of obese people do not appear to suffer from metabolic complications that can lead to heart attack, diabetes and stroke. Since obesity is known to contribute to dozens of health problems, more research is needed to figure out why some are particularly prone to problems from obesity. 'Could it be genetics, specific dietary intake, physical lifestyle, emotional health or even the microbes that live in the gut?' asked senior investigator Samuel Klein, director of Washington University's Center for Human Nutrition. 'We need more studies to try to understand why obesity causes specific diseases in some people but not in others,' Klein said. 'This research demonstrates that some obese people are protected from the adverse metabolic effects of moderate weight gain, whereas others are predisposed to develop these problems. 'This observation is important clinically because about 25 percent of obese people do not have metabolic complications,' he added. 'Our data shows that these people remain metabolically normal even after they gain additional weight.' As part of the study, the researchers then helped the subjects lose the weight they had gained. 'It's important to point out that once the study was completed, we enrolled all subjects in our weight-loss program to make sure they lost all of the weight they had gained, or more,' he said.","US scientists encouraged 20 obese people to eat extra fast food .

"Ghislaine Maxwell stands accused of procuring young girls for the sexual gratification of Jeffrey Epstein and his ‘friends’. Court documents say that she ‘facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madam for Epstein’. She was described in the court papers as a ‘primary co-conspirator in Epstein’s sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme’. Scroll down for video . Ghislaine Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein (left) at Sandringham in 2000 and at an event in New York in 2010 . The documents said: ‘Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 to come to Epstein’s mansion. Epstein then became enamoured with Jane Doe #3 and with the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a sex slave.’ Miss Maxwell, the cherished daughter of crooked tycoon Robert Maxwell, is no stranger to scandal. Her world came crashing down in 1991 when her father plunged to his death from the deck of his £15million yacht, named Lady Ghislaine in her honour. Shortly afterwards it was revealed that the notorious newspaper tycoon had stolen £440million from the Mirror Group’s pension fund. Miss Maxwell and her family were disgraced, and she fled to New York to escape the furore in Britain. It was in America that she met Epstein, becoming his girlfriend for a time and attending celebrity events with him. He provided her with a champagne lifestyle of luxurious holidays and palatial apartments that she could never have afforded on the £80,000-a-year her father left her. In return, she used her contacts to introduce Epstein to leading lights of the world of showbusiness, politics and royalty, including Prince Andrew. But in recent years she has also faced accusations that she procured girls for Epstein – claims she has always denied. Ghislaine Maxwell, left, with her parents, Robert and Elizabeth, in 1987 - four years before Robert's death . Miss Maxwell, now 53, was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University. In 2000 she and Epstein were seen on holiday with Prince Andrew at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. That same year, she took the prince to a ‘hookers and pimps’ themed party in New York, which was hosted by the former lingerie model Heidi Klum. There were once rumours that Miss Maxwell would marry Epstein, but their relationship reportedly ended because he wanted to see other women. However, it is alleged that the services provided by Miss Maxwell to the wealthy financier extended to finding attractive girls for him and his friends. One of the girls, Virginia Roberts, has claimed she was 15 when she met Miss Maxwell at a Florida spa in 1998. Miss Maxwell allegedly invited her to Epstein’s mansion to be a masseuse. Miss Roberts claims she was made to perform sex acts on Epstein.

"Earl Spencer has said he wishes he had gone to a state school because of the cruel treatment meted out to boys at his prep school. Princess Diana’s younger brother said pupils judged to be stupid or lazy were ‘really unpleasantly’ beaten with a cane on their bare buttocks every week. The aristocrat claimed that he had six months of sleepless nights before being sent away aged eight to board at Maidwell Hall preparatory school in Northampton in the early 1970s. Reflecting on his past: Earl Spencer, pictured with his third wife, Karen Gordon, has revealed he was unhappy during his time at Maidwell Hall boarding school in Northampton . Happy days: The Earl, pictured with Diana in 1968, four years before he started his dreaded boarding school . ‘I said I wanted to go to a state school because it must be preferable to 13-week blocks away in a rather cold and unpleasant place,’ he told TES magazine. Earl Spencer, 50, described Maidwell Hall’s regime as ‘quite tough’, with a ‘slightly terrifying’ headmaster and military-style drill for the boys in the mornings. He did not say whether he himself suffered the weekly cane beatings at the 104-year-old school. But he claimed that some members of staff expected little of him because of his privileged upbringing. ‘To be totally candid, I think, coming from my background, teachers had absolutely no expectations of me,’ he said. It now costs £7,980 a term for a pupil to board at the school disliked by the Earl, pictured as a boy with Diana at Park House, Sandringham, in the summer of 1967 . ‘They just thought I’d be fine in life anyway. I was lucky enough to drift through.’ Earl Spencer, now a thrice-married father of seven, claimed that he got through his time at prep school by succeeding in his exams and some sports. The earl once fondly recounted how he was able to correct a history master at the prep school on the topic of the Blenheim estate. He said: ‘It was a triumph over a very nasty man and I owe Blenheim a debt to this day. He was a socialist who resented that everyone in the class was called Guinness, Whitbread or Spencer.’ Former pupils of the preparatory school also include former Conservative MP Sir Adam Butler and John Ailwyn Fellowes, 4th Baron de Ramsey, a landowner who became the first chairman of the Environment Agency. He described his former private preparatory school - Maidwell Hall in Northampton (pictured) - as 'cold and unpleasant' Well-educated: After attending Maidwell Hall, the Earl went on to study at Eton then Oxford . Earl Spencer went on to study at Eton College alongside London Mayor Boris Johnson and former Thai prime minister Mark Vejjajiva. He later read modern history at Magdalen College, Oxford. Born in 1964, Charles Spencer lived with Diana and his two other sisters Sarah and Jane at Park House in Sandringham until the death of their grandfather, the 7th Earl Spencer. He was aged five when his parents divorced and Diana once said: ‘It was a very unhappy childhood. Always seeing my mother crying and Daddy never spoke to us about it.’ The family moved to its ancestral seat at Althorp House, a Northamptonshire stately home dating back to 1508, in 1975. But Charles hated life at Althorp, and once said: ‘It was like an old man’s club with lots of clocks ticking away. For an impressionable child, it was a nightmarish place.’ Maidwell Hall, where fees for borders are now £23,940 a year and girls have been accepted since 2010, could not be reached for comment yesterday. But the school’s former headmaster John Paul has previously suggested that Earl Spencer may have exaggerated how bad his time there was. ‘He’s been in constant touch with the school ever since, so I don’t think he could have been that unhappy,’ Mr Paul said in 1992.

"Texas police are on high alert after a patrol car's anti-lock braking system was  sabotaged and two officers were apparently shot at in separate incidents in Houston. A sergeant of  Harris County Precinct 7 was reportedly driving his 'take home' marked car this week when he noticed a warning light flashing, a force spokesman said. After taking the unit for repair, a county technician discovered someone had intentionally cut its anti-lock braking system - an act of vandalism that could have proved fatal in an emergency. Also this week, two officers in the area have reported being fired at by members of the public in two separate incidents. Both were  in possession of marked vehicles at the time. Scroll down for video . Alert: Texas police are on high alert after a Harris County Precinct 7 patrol car's (file picture) anti-lock braking system was sabotaged and two officers were apparently shot at in separate incidents in Houston this week . Now, Houston-based police patrolling in marked cars have been warned of the possibility of rogue attacks, according to ABC 13. They have also been advised to travel in pairs. In the vehicle sabotage, the technician discovered two different ABS lines had been intentionally cut, leaving the car's basic braking system operational, but its anti-lock brake system useless. 'The maintenance technician, once he examined the wheel well, he realized that there was a cut in the line,' Pamela Greenwood, the Precinct 7 Constable's spokesman, told KPRC-TV. Ms Greenwood added that the loss of the anti-lock brake system could have put an officer’s life at risk during a high-speed chase or pursuit. 'All of our officers have been told to be on alert for attacks like this,' she told The Blaze. 'We got the word out to our deputies to be vigilant to make sure to check their equipment and vehicles before they get in and drive off. And we want to make other law enforcement agencies are aware.' Vandalism: A sergeant was reportedly driving his 'take home' marked car when he noticed a warning light flashing. A technician discovered someone had intentionally cut two ABS lines (pictured: a similar system) Warning: Now, Houston-based police patrolling in marked cars - including officers at Harris County Constable Precinct 7, pictured -  have been warned of the possibility of rogue attacks, and advised to travel in pairs . Meanwhile, in one of the shootings, a Harris County Sheriff's Office sergeant believes he was shot at while working his second job at Cypress Fairbanks Medical Center. He said heard a gunshot in the parking lot outside the emergency room and went to check it out, at which point a man allegedly fired two more shots out of an SUV toward his marked car. The sergeant subsequently climbed into his patrol unit and gave chase, but was unable to catch the alleged shooter. However, he managed to get a vehicle description and the man was later arrested. The apparent shooting was the second report of shots fired at a Harris County deputy his week. Details of the second alleged attack are currently unknown. Spokesman: Pamela Greenwood (pictured) said the loss of the anti-lock brake system could have put an officer’s life at risk during a high-speed chase or pursuit. She added all officers have been told to be on alert . 'Some people were saying the one incident had to be isolated because they didn't have any other incidents,' Houston Police Officers Union President, Ray Hunt, said. 'Then when we found out about the second incident that had happened prior to ours, it's very, very alarming to us that in 48 hours we had two people, deputies, shot at in Harris County.' It comes just two weeks after two police officers were fatally shot at point-blank range while sitting in their patrol cars in Brooklyn, New York, before the gunman committed suicide at a tube station. The shooter had made statements on social media suggesting that he planned to kill police following two grand juries' decisions not to indict officers in the Eric Garner and Michael Brown cases. Victims: It comes just two weeks after officers Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramo (right)were fatally shot at point-blank range while sitting in their patrol cars in Brooklyn, before the gunman committed suicide . He then crept up on officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos as they sat in the car near Myrtle and Tompkins Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant, before waking up to the passenger window and firing. The double killing came in the midst of nationwide protests over alleged police brutality. Police are investigating both of the alleged Houston shootings, as well as the vehicle sabotage.","Harris County Precinct 7 sergeant noticed warning light was flashing .

"A woman died in Cleveland police custody nearly two months ago because she was physically restrained in a prone position, and her heart condition and bipolar disorder were also factors, a coroner said on Friday. The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office ruled that Tanisha Anderson's death was a homicide. Anderson died on November 12 at hospital after being handcuffed, taken into police custody and then losing consciousness while having a mental-health episode. Death ruled a homicide: The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office ruled that Tanisha Anderson's death was a homicide after being taken into police custody for a mental health episode . Sparking change: Tanisha Anderson died while police took her into custody for a mental health breakdown and her family demand that law enforcement re-evaluate the treatment of the mentally ill . Relatives said the 37-year-old was schizophrenic, and they claimed an officer used excessive force. In a statement, Cleveland police said its own use of force investigation team is looking into the death. The two officers involved are on restricted duty, the department said. Anderson's cause of death was ruled 'sudden death associated with physical restraint in a prone position,' the medical examiner's office said, while also citing coronary artery disease and her bipolar disorder. Her family said at a news conference nearly two weeks ago that they wanted more answers about what happened and that Cleveland officers need better training on dealing with mentally ill people. In December, the police force was heavily criticized in a U.S. Justice Department report that found excessive use of force and civil rights violations. Federal investigators spent 18 months looking into use of force policies in Cleveland after a series of well-publicized incidents, including the killing of two unarmed civilians in a hail of police gunfire after a high-speed chase. Not a criminal: 'What we don't understand is, why she was treated like a criminal?' Mike Anderson, Tanisha's uncle, said following her death . Mourning her loss: Anderson's family is seeking justice fore the police responsible for her death . The Justice Department's finding will force the city to devise a plan to reform the police department. That plan must be approved by a federal judge and will be overseen by an independent monitor. Lawyer Michael Nelson, Co-Chair of the NAACP''s Criminal Justice Committee told WKYC, ' It was a crime. The person was killed by the officer..The person's head was slammed on the ground. They were choked to death...We believe an indictment should result.' New Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Union President Steve Loomis said, 'Our hearts go out to her family...The officers responded exactly as they were trained to do....We're not surprised by the findings..She had previous medical conditions.' Anderson's family expressed their sadness following her untimely death and place some of their blame on the police who handled her mental health episode. In a statement, Tanisha's family said,' The family demands justice for Tanisha, a thorough criminal investigation and an independent prosecutor that results in accountability by police officers and the Cleveland Police Department.' 'What we don't understand is, why she was treated like a criminal?' Mike Anderson, Tanisha's uncle, said following her death.","The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office ruled that Tanisha Anderson's, 37, death was a homicide .

Dispute: United Airlines told New Mexico monk Brother Noah he couldn't buy a new return flight for his colleague because they suspected the ticket was bought fraudulently. It sparked a terse row . It started, according to the New York Times, in late November. John Baptist had bought a $2,489 return flight to his native Malawi to visit his sick mother. As time went on it became clear he would have to stay longer, so he contacted the Benedictine monastery. Brother Noah said he would take care of it. Little did he know what imbroglio lay ahead. 'He was told that the company never received payment for the ticket,' the Times reported. Baffled, the monk explained his colleague had already used the first leg of the ticket. United accepted that but said they suspected it was fraudulently purchased so he was not allowed to use John Baptist's credit to purchase a new flight. The United representative concluded the conversation by saying Abbott Philip, the monastery leader, should drive three hours to Albuquerque airport to discuss the discrepancy. 'It was my tone of voice': Noah said he instantly regretted his outburst but the situation was later resolved . That's when Brother Noah lost it. 'My monastic life is about staying peaceful in all circumstances. I failed during this call,' he told the Times. 'It was my tone of voice. I knew that it manifested anger.' Thankfully for Noah, it was not in vain. United eventually conceded after the monastery posted an open letter on their website and made a few more phone calls expressing their discontent. John Baptist was finally given his rescheduled ticket, $350 credit, and an apology.","Brother Noah of a New Mexico monastery called airline to rearrange a flight .

"A Massachusetts woman who slashed her two children's throats before dousing them with lighter fluid and setting fire to their apartment was sentenced Friday to 20 to 25 years in prison. Tanicia Goodwin, 27, of Salem, pleaded guilty to armed assault with intent to murder, arson and other charges during a hearing in Salem Superior Court. The mother of two was ordered to not have contact with any children, including her own, 8-year-old Jamaal and 3-year-old Erica. Justice: Tanicia Goodwin, 27, pleaded guilty Friday at Salem Superior Court to armed assault with intent to murder, arson and other charges in connection to a March 2012 attack on her children . Authorities said firefighters responding to the blaze in March 2012 discovered that vents and sprinklers in the apartment had been covered and the front doorknob had been removed. Goodwin then went to the police station and told authorities, 'I'm sorry, babies. I did what I had to do to protect my children,' prosecutors said. Both children survived and are now living with relatives. They did not attend the sentencing. Prosecutors said Jamaal and Erica still suffer emotionally from the aftereffects of the attack. When given the chance to speak, Ms Goodwin told Judge James Lang that she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is now on medication that makes her thoughts 'more clear.' Her lawyer, Denise Regan, said Goodwin grew up in abusive and neglectful conditions and was only 8 or 9 years old when she began receiving treatment for mental illness. Lang said Goodwin's actions were shocking. 'I'm frankly at a loss for words, really, to articulate the heinous nature of what occurred here,' Lang said. Heinous crime: Goodwin has admitted to slashing the throats of her 8-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter, dousing the wounded children with lighter fluid and then setting their apartment on fire . Assistant District Attorney Melissa Woodward said Goodwin attacked 8-year-old Jamaal as he was watching a movie on television and eating a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch for dinner, telling him that he had lived too long and cutting his throat so deep his trachea was exposed. Goodwin then told Jamaal to give a goodbye hug to his little sister, who was lying in a pool of blood after having her neck slashed, Woodward said. The mother then doused both children with lighter fluid, set a fire and at some point had cut her own neck. 'This was by all accounts a double murder with a pitiful feigned suicide attempt by the defendant,' Woodward said. On March 18, 2012, a responding firefighter found Goodwin naked and wet outside her smoking apartment, according to police reports. Jamaal was sitting inside against a wall, covered in lighter fluid and struggling to breathe through the hole in his throat. Erica was bleeding and abandoned on a neighbor's couch. Heartbreaking: After the attack on her children, Goodwin went to the police station and told authorities, 'I'm sorry, babies. I did what I had to do to protect my children' Goodwin, meanwhile, walked barefoot to the Salem police station and allegedly told officers she'd hurt her children to protect them. In her cell that night, she continuously repeated, 'I'm sorry, my babies,' according to a police report. Goodwin's cousin Wayne Cox is currently raising Jamaal in Atlanta, while Erica is being raised by her biological father. Cox told prosecutions for an impact statement presented in court Friday that Jamaal does not let anyone touch his throat, will not zip coats past his collar and is afraid to play outside alone, reported the Boston Herald. Although the boy is an honor student, he is very anxious. And every time he sees a listing on TV for 'Men from Mars' he says, 'This is the movie that was on when mom cut me.'","Tanicia Goodwin, 27, sentenced to 20-25 years in prison after pleading guilty to armed assault with intent to murder and arson .

"More than three-quarters of the police officers due to work on New Year's Eve in Rome called in sick as half a million people descended on the city to celebrate the start of 2015. The mass desertion of 83 per cent of the 1,000 officers who were supposed to be patrolling the streets has been branded 'unacceptable' because of the potential danger to the public. As well as claiming they were too ill to work, some officers insisted they were giving blood or cited unspecified physical 'disabilities'. Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has rebuked the force and called for a shake-up of public sector employment in 2015. Scroll down for video . More than three-quarters of the police officers due to work on New Year's Eve in Rome called in sick . 'I read that 83 per cent of police did not work 'because of illness' on December 31. This is why we will change the rules of public sector employment in 2015,' he wrote in a tweet. Italian authorities are threatening disciplinary action against those officers who failed to show up to help deal with thousands of revellers who surged through Rome's historic piazzas and let off powerful illegal fireworks, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ignazio Marino, the mayor of Rome, wrote on Facebook: 'They didn't manage to ruin the party, but those responsible will have to be held to account.' His deputy, Luigi Nieri, said an investigation is on the way and they would use the results to decide whether there is a legal case to answer. He said the rate of absenteeism was 'unacceptable' and could have endangered the public's safety on what is  one of the busiest nights of the year. Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has rebuked the force and called for a shake-up of public sector employment in 2015 . The latest move by the officers, follows a police rift with the government where for months both were unable to work out changes to their salaries and working conditions. Rome's police commander Raffaele Clemente desribed the absences as 'absolutely unjustified'. 'I can only condemn the attitude of those who have tried to sabotage the New Year festivities,' he said, adding that the action had 'put at risk people's safety but also the good name of the entire local police force and the city of Rome.' The municipal police, known in Italian as 'vigili', denied that they were being lazy, saying their absence was part of a broader dispute over pay, conditions and not enough personnel. There are 5,900 of us and there should be 9,400. With these numbers we can no longer provide a 24-hour service, seven days a week,' said Stefano Giannini, the head of the police union. Marianna Madia, the public service minister, warned that the skiving officers could face disciplinary action.","More than three-quarters of the police officers due to work called in sick .

"The New Jersey strip club that was the real-life stand-in for the infamous Bada Bing on HBO's 'Sopranos' has been hit  - again - by criminals. Satin Dolls in Lodi was robbed by two armed men a few days before Christmas. Now, police say someone broke into the club early Friday morning. Police tell The Record that the break-in occurred between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Friday. Robbed: Satin Dolls in New Jersey was targeted in an attempted burglary early today, nearly two weeks after another burglary at the club, also known as Bada Bing from HBO's The Sopranos, authorities said . Classic: On The Sopranos, which ran from 1999 to 2007, Satin Dolls was used as the site of the show's strip club Bada Bing, a perrenial hangout for Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini (pictured) The would-be thieves smashed through the club's glass front door and pried open the office door to get to a safe, but did not take anything. The earlier robbery - just a few days earlier on December 21 - cost the club about $30,000. Detective Capt. Donald Scorzetti said the two crimes were not related. The Bada Bing was seen frequently on the show, which ran on HBO from 1999 to 2007. It was a hangout and hotspot for the often-dirty dealings of Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini. Flashback: Characters from The Sopranos play cards in Bada Bing from an episode in the show's fifth season . Smash and grab: Satin Dolls, the New Jersey strip club that was the real-life stand-in for the Bada Bing on the hit HBO series The Sopranos has been hit by criminals for the second time in two weeks . All interior and exterior shots of the Bada Bing were filmed at Satin Dolls, which is on Route 17. The expansive bar was loosely based on Wiggles, a strip club owned by notorious New Jersey mobster Vincent Palermo, whose life and times inspired the series. 'Bada Bing' was a catchphrase in Sopranos that meant 'it's done'. On its website, Satin Dolls says its ladies 'will have you so excited you'll be singing soprano.'","New Jersey bar Satin Dolls robbed early Friday morning .

"A 26-year-old hairdresser is celebrating after what she thought was a $1,000 winning lottery ticket turned out to be worth a staggering $1.3million. Ligia Dennis was waiting for her clothes to finish washing at a Laundromat in Los Angeles, California, when she decided to buy a coffee from a donut shop across the street. While there, she also purchased three $6 California Lucky Life Scratchers tickets on the spur of the moment, two of which she later gave away to her mother and brother. 'I can't believe it': Ligia Dennis (pictured holding a giant check alongside her fiance, Tim Ballany) is celebrating after what she thought was a $1,000 winning lottery ticket turned out to be worth a staggering $1.3million . After a homeless man asked her for change, she nearly handed over her final ticket to him, but decided against it at the last second, her fiance, Tim Ballany, told CBS Los Angeles. When Miss Dennis discovered she was in possession of a winning ticket, she was ecstatic. 'When I saw LIFE, the winning symbol, I went crazy for a minute, she said. 'It didn’t really process.' However, she initially did not realize the extent of her win - thinking she had scooped $1,000. It was only when she traveled to the California Lottery Van Nuys District Office on December 26 that she found out she had actually won $1,000 per week for 25 years - a total of $1.3million. Winner: Miss Dennis purchased three $6 California Lucky Life Scratchers tickets from Big Jim's Donuts in East Hollywood, Los Angeles. Above, her winning lottery ticket, which she nearly gave to a homeless man . '[The lottery employee] looked at the ticket and was like, ""How much do you think you won again? It's a little more than a thousand dollars,""' Miss Dennis told NBC. She added: 'I’m shocked. I can't believe it.' The hairdresser, who also attends Santa Monica College for business management, said she plans to pay off her student loans and outstanding bills with her winnings. She also said she hopes to open her own hairdressing salon. 'It’s always been my passion,' she said. 'I’ve been a hairdresser for about six years. It’s always been my dream to own my own salon.' Cashing in: And the 26-year-old hairdresser is not the only winner - the donut shop (pictured), situated in the 700 block of North Vermont Avenue, has also scooped a bonus of $6,500 for selling her the winning ticket . Miss Dennis has reportedly arranged to meet a financial adviser to discuss whether to take out the $1.3million in installments over 25 years, or a lump, pre-tax sum of around $750,000. And she is not the only winner - Big Jim's Donuts in the 700 block of North Vermont Avenue in East Hollywood has also scooped a bonus of $6,500 for selling her the winning ticket.

"Android apps are spying on users far more than expected, a new study has found. The research by Vocativ shows the apps that can access user's microphones, call logs and contacts. It found one of the worst offenders was a game aimed at children. Scroll down for video . One of the worst offenders was a game called Happy Fish. Developer HappyElements, programmed the game so that it can collect a precise location, has access to your photos and can read your text messages. Called Happy Fish, developer HappyElements, programmed the game so that it can collect a precise location, has access to your photos and can read your text messages. It can even tell which Wi-Fi network you're using. Android users have taken to messageboards to complain about the problems. The hugely popular game Fruit Ninja asks users for permissions described as 'crazy' by users. One reviewer wrote 'I will never install this until it is clear as to why the developer needs access to all your private content.' The chart ranks the apps (top to bottom) that ask for the most permissions. AntiVirus Security, Viber and Facebook top the charts. However, more than half of the 25 apps have access to contacts, and about a third tap into text messages, call log and microphone. The key to the permissions, experts say, is ads. The research by Vocativ shows the apps that can access user's microphones, call logs and contacts. AntiVirus Security, Viber and Facebook top the charts. 'These advertisers are trying to get more targeted information about you, so they can get more targeted ads,' PrivacyGrade.org founder and Carnegie Mellon professor of computer science Jason Hong said. 'These apps access information about a user that can be highly sensitive, such as location, contact lists and call logs, yet it often is difficult for the average user to understand how that information is being used or who it might be shared with,' 'Most developers aren't evil, but they often don't know what to do with respect to privacy and security,' Hong added, explaining that some developers may simply collect data with their apps because they can, and nobody stops them. The site assigns letter grades to more than one million free Android apps, ranging from an A+ for the puzzle game Lazors to a D for the Despicable Me: Minion Rush game. PrivacyGrade.org keeps track of hundreds of apps, and publishes its ratings for them. It says that for Android smartphones, you only have a few options. If you're feeling particularly sensitive about privacy, you can delete the app. PrivacyGrade also names and shames Fruit Ninja, Despicable Me & Talking Tom as popular apps with poor privacy . Alternatively, you can try to find a replacement app that has similar functionality (e.g. there are many flashlight apps that don't need an Internet connection or location data). If you're worried about location data, you can turn off location services. Also, generally speaking, for-pay apps are better about privacy than free apps. The grades are assigned automatically using a privacy model that the researchers developed based on the preference ratings of 725 users. The final grade is based in part on an automated analysis of how an app uses sensitive data — whether it is essential for the app operation or whether it is shared with advertisers and marketers. Part of the grade is based on survey information about how comfortable users are with information being used in those ways. 'Our privacy model measures the gap between people's expectations of an app's behavior and the app's actual behavior,' said Hong. 'Most people expect apps such as Google Maps to be able to access their location, but most are surprised and troubled to learn that a game accesses their location.' The second part of Vocatic's research, revealing apps such as Twitter,and Chrome. PrivacyGrade.org keeps track of hundreds of apps. 'Today's smartphones have an incredible array of capabilities,' it says. 'Smartphones have access to our communications (email, contacts list, and social networks), activities (location, call logs, photos, accelerometers), and more. 'However, some apps access this sensitive data in ways that people do not expect. 'These are not just hypothetical risks either: several app developers have already been fined by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive uses of people's data.' Last year the Federal Trade Commission offered guidelines to developers, but they are often ignored. In 2013, Path, the social networking site, was fined $800,000 for deceiving users by collecting phone numbers from its address book. In September 2014 , review site Yelp forked over $450,000 for collecting location data about its underage users. The FTC says: 'The complexity of the ecosystem raises 21st century concerns: When people use their mobile devices, they are sharing information about their daily lives with a multitude of players. 'How many companies are privy to this information? How often do they access such content and how do they use it or share it?

"An 81-year-old horror film director has been arrested for 'violently groping' a woman in his luxurious New York City building on New Year's Eve, police said. Joel Reed, who created Blood Sucking Freaks (1976) and G.I. Executioner (1975), is accused of placing his hand on the woman's groin then twisted her hand, pushing her to the ground. The alleged victim was left with a swollen finger, shoulder and hip, as well as 'substantial pain', according to a police report. A 46-year-old woman named Nava Shapiro was also arrested and charged with assault in the incident.

"A woman has been ordered by a Western Australian court to pay $12,500 worth in damages to her estranged husband after it was found she had defamed him on Facebook. In December 2012, a post appeared on Robyn Greeuw's social media page saying she had 'separated from Miro Dabrowski after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse. Now fighting the system to keep my children safe'. But Western Australian District Court Judge Michael Bowden ruled Ms Greeuw was unable to prove she had been subjected to this behaviour, despite finding holes in Mr Dabrowski's case. Robyn Greeuw posted on her social media page that she had 'separated from Miro Dabrowski after 18 years of suffering domestic violence and abuse' 'Even applying the extended definition of the words ""domestic violence and abuse"", as urged by Ms Greeuw, she has failed to prove any essential or substantial truth to the stings of the defamation imputations,' he said. The post on the Bunbury mother-of-two's page was seen by Mr Dabrowski's brother as well as a woman he started dating in 2012. It was not removed until February 2013. During the trial, Ms Greeuw maintained she was did not know how to use Facebook and had only started using it just months before the December 2012 post went up. She said the post was 'a complete fabrication and part of a malicious and vindictive campaign' against her carried out by Mr Dabrowski and other people. The only reference Ms Greeuw was able to produce as evidence of the violence and abuse she claims to have suffered was a 2010 incident. Mr Dabrowski later penned a letter to apologise to his wife for his 'freak out' and 'spoiling the holiday'. The letter was presented as evidence during the trial and read: 'I don't deal with my panic attacks well … the panic and freak out period I had re holidays just showed that'. But Mr Dabrowski told the court this referred to 'his internal state of mind' but Judge Bowden said this defence 'lacked credibility'. WA District Court Judge Michael Bowden said he had 'no doubt' Ms Greeuw's post had caused Mr Dabrowski 'personal distress, humiliation and hurt and harm to his reputation' However, the judge said this did not mean he accepted Ms Greeuw's version of events. He believed she had a 'propensity to say whatever advances her cause' and was 'not a credible witness'. Judge Bowden said he had 'no doubt' Ms Greeuw's post had caused Mr Dabrowski  'personal distress, humiliation and hurt and harm to his reputation'. 'It did cause people to ""look at him twice"" and be more reserved about their contact with him,' the judge said. During the civil trial, a number of witnesses said the post had altered their perception of the school teacher to the point where they questioned their association with him and his behaviour. As he was handing down his ruling, Judge Bowden said content on social media had a way of spreading quickly and damages would be awarded to Mr Dabrowski 'as reparation for the harm done to his personal and business reputation and for vindication to his reputation'. 'Defamatory publications on social media spread easily by the simple manipulation of computers,' he said. 'A public Facebook page is able to be viewed worldwide by whoever clicks on that page.'","Robyn Greeuw posted the defamatory remark on her Facebook in 2012 .

"The mother of an off-duty police officer who was killed by a wrong-way illegal immigrant driver has written a furious letter to President Obama demanding to know why the man was not deported after being convicted of a crime. Mary Ann Mendoza, who lost her son Sgt. Brandon Mendoza in the horror crash in Mesa, Arizona in May, expressed her anger that the driver, Raul Silva-Corona, was not sent back to Mexico two decades ago after he carried out crimes in Colorado. 'The prosecutors were ""lenient"" on him and several charges were dismissed,' she wrote in the letter. 'When . he was convicted of these crimes (in) 1994 and the government knew he . was in the country illegally, why wasn't he deported? Why are any of . these illegal criminals in this country?

Corona was a native of Chihuahua, Mexico, who had entered the United States without permission. Court records show that he pleaded guilty to a criminal-conspiracy charge in Adams County in 1994 and prosecutors dismissed charges of burglary, assault and leaving an accident scene. Speaking to The Arizona Republic, Mrs Mendoza said that she was not planning to stop at the letter. With the help of a lawyer, she is calling for laws that would . prohibit undocumented immigrants from purchasing and registering . vehicles without a driver's license and further legislation that would remove . undocumented immigrants who are convicted of a crime. Killed: Brandon Mendoza, left, was killed when Raul Silva-Corona, right, drove the wrong way for 35 miles along freeways before smashing into his car. Corona also died in the crash . 'I have to do something in my son's memory to stop this kind of thing from happening,' she said. She added that she does not have any problems with law-abiding undocumented immigrants in the country. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Mendoza, 32, had been driving home from work on May 12 when Silva-Corona smashed into him after driving the wrong way along freeways for 35 miles. Police received 33 911 calls as he sped along the Loop 101 Freeway, down State Route 51 and eventually to the I-10/US 60 interchange before hitting Mendoza on a freeway ramp. Mendoza, a beloved 13-year veteran of the force, was taken to an area hospital in critical condition and later died. Loss: Mendoza had worked for the police for 13 years and was driving home from work when he was hit . Fatal: Footage shows the massive fire that followed the head-on collision between the two cars on May 12 . Scene: Corona died at the scene while Mendoza passed away shortly afterwards in hospital . Officer Carrick Cook, a state Department . of Public Safety spokesman, said Mendoza likely only had seconds of . warning before the crash. Silva-Corona died at the scene and his body was so badly burned that authorities could not immediately identify him. After he was identified, police said he had a blood-alcohol content of 0.24 per cent. In Arizona, a driver is presumed to be intoxicated at 0.08 per cent. Police had . frantically tried to stop him during a 30-minute chase. One officer had . smash into the vehicle to stop it, but the driver drove around him and . continued. 'We were scrambling,' Cook said. 'Nobody was really pursuing. We were just trying to intercept.' KPHO reported that Mendoza was a bachelor who had family in the area as well as a brother deployed to South Korea. President Obama, . I am writing this letter to you regarding illegal immigrants. As a tax paying, law abiding citizen of the United States, I WANT my voice heard on this issue. My son, Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, an officer who was with the City of Mesa, Arizona police department, was killed in a tragic head on collision on May 12, 2014 by a wrong way driver on our freeways. This man happened to be an illegal immigrant, was in this country illegally, convicted of previous crimes, no Social Security number, no valid driver's license BUT he had purchased a vehicle and registered it to drive in Maricopa County Arizona. The Federal Government knew he, Raul Silva Corona , was an illegal immigrant when he was convicted on crimes in 1994 in Colorado. The prosecutors were 'lenient' on him and several charges were dismissed... Why wasn't he deported? I am furious that the Federal Government allowed this criminal to stay in this country and KILL my son! [My son] was an Icon with the City of Mesa Police Department. He was instrumental in making life better for people of all walks of life in the park project he took on. He was humble, selfless, worked many hours off the clock helping disadvantaged children. I want laws to change that would not allow illegal immigrants to purchase vehicles in our country and register them to drive them in our states WITHOUT having driver's licenses to drive them legally. I want answers that make sense. I want answers from you personally as to why this criminal was allowed to stay in our country until he took my son's life. Sincerely, . Mary Ann Mendoza .

The main thing is we want to get him home and look after him,' his friend Travis Lynch told NT News. 'He's the life and soul of our group. We need him.' The group will continue their second search across the Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria, as well as trekking through off-roads in between Darwin and Melbourne. In an attempt to locate Kowalski, his friends have set up an official website, social media campaigns with hashtag #finddane, printed Kowalski t-shirts and stickers, and various fundraising events. There has been no trace of the 27-year-old since that day: His phone and bank accounts remaining untouched . One of Kowalski's best friends, who have been mates since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered $25,000 in reward money from his own pocket for any information. Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry. 'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then [December 12]; his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.' The enormous search effort for Mr Kowalski has involved police, psychics, missing posters, a social media campaign, a website and various fundraisers. His friends and family have considered hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search. 'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said. Desperate: Mr Kowalski's friends and family have launched a widespread search in which they have retraced his footsteps from Victoria to Darwin and handed out hundreds of missing posters . 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,' Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said . One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Mr Kowalski's family that the young man may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken. It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records, but to no avail. Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him. 'Even if people just put one flyer up on the back of their car windscreen – that's incredible and everything is appreciated,' Ms Taylor said. 'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's ok. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home.

"It's been a boom time for sellers in Australia's real estate market in the past year, which saw prices soar by eight per cent across capital cities in 2014, but that big balloon is expected to deflate somewhat in the next 12 months. Sydney and Melbourne led the way, with the harbour city market soaring 12.4 per cent year-on-year and the Victorian capital up 7.6 per cent. The CoreLogic RP Data Hedonic Home Value Index showed an overall increase in capital cities of almost 0.8 per cent for 2014. But with a renovated garage going for $1.4 million and a squatters shack uninhabited for 25 years bringing in the same cash, did buyers get any bang for their big bucks? The front of the luxurious six bedroom abode in Toorak that sold for a whopping $19.2 million . Despite boasting countless spectacular features, the property was on the market for over a year. The home in Melbourne's ritzy Toorak fetched $19.2 million . This run down property in Sydney's Balmain East sold for $2.68million, $83,000 above the reserve price, in September. The high price may have had something to do with the property being on the waterfront . Part of the boom is a waterside property in the suburb of Putney, which just been sold. Set on the exclusive Putney Point, the home cascades to the waterfront of Morrison Bay, boats a private beach and is set on 1,131sqm with a salt pool. It also has a games room and the wet bat spills out onto the entertaining area. It went under the hammer for $4.25 million. Each of the four bedrooms has a balcony with water views. Despite only being on the market for eight days, the property received an 'unprecedented' amount of attention including 54 inspection groups and 4,000 email inquiries and went more than $200,000 over the expected price . This luxury property at Point Piper was one of the star turns of 2014 and offered a ballroom, sandstone walls and a sprawling garden with century-old trees and was touted as a $100 million buy - the stamp duty alone would have been $7 million . This garage-turned two-bedroom home in Sydney's eastern suburbs sold for a staggering $1,415,000 in October . House prices in Sydney soared more than 13 per cent and Melbourne came in at 8.4 per cent. The cost for a unit jumped in the New South Wales capital too, more than 8 per cent. The only city to go backwards in price was Canberra, dropping marginally, about half a per cent. Home prices across Australia's capital cities have increased about 8 per cent over 2014 but did buyers get value for money? This Putney property fetched more than $4 million, complete with a pool, water views for all bedrooms and its own beachfront . The bedrooms all have water views at this inner western Sydney property. It also has a games room and the wet bat spills out onto the entertaining area. It went under the hammer for $4.25 million. Water everywhere. Salt water pool plus water views for all bedrooms at the Putney property .

Hobart, in fact, had the biggest increase in the last month of the year, registering a jump of 2.7 per cent across all housing types but the median price there is still the lowest for the capital cities, at $341,000.. And while market analysts agree that home price rises are going to slow, if you're looking for a place in Sydney it's still going to cost you a median price of up to three-quarters of a million dollars. While Sydney is the most expensive, Melbourne's average comes in at just under $600,000. In the Victorian suburb of Templestowe, a five bedder, plus a study to boot, has just sold for more than $2.2 million. In all its glory. This home in the Victorian suburb of Templestowe, a five bedder, plus a study to boot, has just sold for more than $2.2 million. A flowing floor plan, gym, billiards room and four bedrooms at Templestowe sets you back $2.2 million . For that you get a perfectly level established acre block, a flowing floor-plan, formal lounge and dining plus billiards room and wet-bar plus your very own gym, with a pool setting outside, not to mention four bathrooms from which to choose. For a little less, $1.8 million you could have bought 1,560 sqm on one of Brisbane's 'best streets' with the potential to do more with that land. This Indooroopilly home, also a five-bedder, was just offered recently for the first time in 39 years. Big yard, loads of potential at a cost of $1.8 million at 20 Gilgandra Street, Indooroopilly in Queensland - one of the biggest sellers in the past few months in the country's north . This Indooroopilly home, also a five-bedder, was just offered recently for the first time in 39 years. It went for $1.8 million . Overall, capital city home values were up again in December by 0.9 per cent, and were up 7.9 per cent  for the year 2014, according to the CoreLogic RP Data home value index. RP Data senior research analyst Cameron Kusher told AAP that despite the strong result the pace of home price growth continues to slow. Brisbane remains one of the more affordable major cities, with the median price for a home still well below half a million dollars. Sydney is by far the most expensive at almost $750,000 . It may look rundown to you but this two-bedroom house in Durham St, Stanmore sold for $923,000 in early June despite the fact that it was uninhabitable . The house in Stanmore in Sydney's inner west  was littered with garbage, despite the fact that realtors had already removed nine truckloads of rubbish from the property - it still went for a touch under $1 million . Overall, capital city home values were up again in December by 0.9 per cent, and were up 7.9 per cent for the year 2014, according to the CoreLogic RP Data home value index . 'The slowing annual growth rate is further evidence that the housing market is losing some steam with combined capital city home values increasing by 9.8 per cent over the 2013 calendar year compared to a more moderate 7.9 per cent increase in 2014,' he said. 'Auction clearance rates reduced noticeably across the two largest auction markets, Sydney and Melbourne, over the final two months of the year.' Unit prices in the harbour city have also jumped significantly in the past year, up more than 8 per cent . CommSec chief economist Craig James believes the housing market is cooling because there are more homes being built. Mr Kusher added that as home values have been rising, rental growth is sitting at its lowest annual rate in more than a decade, with capital city rents up by 1.8 per cent over the past 12 months. Perth is one of four Australian capital cities with an average home price of more than $500,000 in 2014 . He expects it to stay sluggish in 2015. 'Affordability hurdles in Sydney, and to a lesser extent in Melbourne, are making it increasingly difficult for some buyers to enter the market,' he said. 'Additionally, low rental yields and the likelihood of tougher lending criteria to investment buyers will likely dampen the very active investor segment of the market which may in turn reduce housing demand in 2015.'","Australia's real estate market increased 8 per cent in 2014 .

"This haunting image of an empty road leading to an erupting volcano  was captured by a photographer who appears to be on the highway to hell. The stunning snap was taken on Chain of Craters Road, near Pahoa, a small village under threat from volcanic lava flows on Hawaii's main island. The road had only just been cleared after being covered by previous flows but the cause of that lava - the Pu'u O'o crater - can still be seen ominously spewing fire in the background. Highway: This haunting image of an empty road leads to an erupting volcano in the distance  on Creator's Road, near Pahoa, Hawaii . Night sky: A red truck comes to a standstill on the highway which had been cleared after being covered by previous lava flows from the Pu'u O'o crater . DIY store worker and part-time photographer Ed Coykendall took a series of amazing pictures which show the strikingly bright orange of the volcanic explosion glowing against the pitch black night sky. Despite working full-time, Coykendall and some of his friends often spend nights out in the Hawaiian bush photographing this amazing crater. In some images the whole night sky above the local town is illuminated by the lava and in others the light produced by the volcano makes it look like an image from another world. Hawaiian Coykendall has been fascinated by the Pu'u O'o crater - pronounced 'poo-oo oh-oh' - which is is a spatter cone in the eastern rift zone of the Kilauea volcano of the Hawaiian Islands. It has been erupting continuously since January 3, 1983, making it the longest-lived rift-zone eruption of the last two centuries. Dad-of-two Coykendall, 30, has lived in Hawaii for the last 20 years and works full-time as a supervisor at DIY store Home Depot. He said: 'With my spare time I am also a photographer. I enjoy capturing moments in time to share to the world. 'With the highway to hell image it started off as any other night looking to view the eruption of the volcano.

'I meet up with two other photographer in the area Ken Boyer and David Smith. As we headed to the volcano the weather conditions were unfavourable so instead we decided to take pictures of the ocean. 'We got to the ocean and the weather was still pouring down rain. After waiting an hour for the rain to stop we gave up and started heading home. On the way back on a rarely travelled road called chain of craters the clouds opened up enough to see the glow of the lava in a distance. 'We never expected for this to happen and didnt even know that it could be seen so clearly at this location. 'We pulled over stood in amazement for about 15 minutes. We finally grabbed our camera gear out of the truck to capture what we had seen. 'This was a incredible experience for all of us seeing how the road just heads up to the lava going up the slopes of Kilauea.'

"While pandas are often the main attraction at zoos, the adorable animals do not usually attempt to entertain visitors by playing a musical instrument. But as this comical picture shows, this bear appeared to be doing just that as she held a bamboo stick up to her face as if she was playing the flute. Crowds gathered around the panda enclosure at Taihu Lake National Wetland Park in Suzhou, in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, as one of the female bears put on the adorable show. Scroll down for video . Eats flutes and leaves: A giant panda at a zoo in China looked like it was playing the musical instrument as it held a bamboo branch up to its face . Holding the bamboo in her paws in the same fashion a musician would do with a flute, she paused to lick the branch, apparently unaware of visitors to the zoo crowding around her pen. The black and white giant panda then started gnawing on the bamboo branch - a staple in the bears' diet. Giant pandas, which are native to central China but are often kept in captivity to encourage the endangered species to breed, eat between one and five stone of bamboo branches, stems and shoots every day. Female giant pandas can reach up to 19 stone, but those in the wild often weigh  less as deforestation has led to bamboo being harder to find. There are thought to be slightly less than 2,000 pandas left in the wild, a number which has gradually increased since the 1960s after international efforts to save the species were increased. As well as this, there are about 240 giant pandas in captivity in China, while 49 live in zoos around the world, including two at Edinburgh Zoo.

"Two police officers have gone on the run in India after allegedly abducting a 14-year-old girl and gang raping her at their  police station on New Year's eve. Constables Veer Pal Singh Yadav and Avnish Yadav were suspended before absconding from the police station in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh. Authorities have launched a massive manhunt for the two constables and are calling for serious disciplinary action to be taken against them. Victim: A 14-year-old girl was allegedly abducted by two Indian police constables who took her back to their police station and gang raped her . The girl's mother reported the incident claiming the two officers had abducted her daughter when she left the house to use the toilet  and bundled her into a car at around 4.30pm. She said in a statement: 'On the night of December 31, my daughter went out of the house to address nature's call, while she was returning from the field the two police constables Veer Pal and Avanish pushed her in a car and sped to the police station. 'They locked my daughter in a room located in the police station. Later, they raped her and when her condition deteriorated they dumped her on the outskirts of the village at midnight.' On New Year's day, the girl and her mother went to Musajhag police station to report the incident and lodge a complaint against the constables but claim no one would listen to them. Badaun, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly region, gained notoriety last year after two girls were found hanging from a tree in a village amid reports they had been gang-raped and murdered . It was only after them meeting the city's superintendent of police and the incident receiving some media attention, that the complaint was taken seriously and a search for the officers was launched. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has demanded  all efforts now be made to arrest the officers and that serious disciplinary action be taken against them when caught. Badaun, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly region, gained notoriety last year after two girls were found hanging from a tree in a village amid reports they had been gang-raped and murdered. In November investigators concluded that the girls had committed suicide, however many have disputed this explanation. India brought in tougher rape laws last year for crimes against women after the fatal gang-rape of a physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012. India brought in tougher rape laws last year for crimes against women after the fatal gang-rape of a physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012 . Last year a woman was raped by up to 13 men in West Bengal as punishment for a relationship with a local man that was not sanctioned by village elders. In October last year, another teenager in West Bengal was attacked twice, including one assault on her way back from a police station, and eventually murdered. The number of rapes reported in New Delhi increased by nearly a third in the last year, police said Friday, highlighting the alarming levels of sexual violence against women in the Indian capital. At an annual briefing with reporters, Delhi Police Commissioner Bhim Sain Bassi said that a total of 2,069 rape cases were reported in New Delhi in the 12 months leading up to December 15, against 1,571 reported the previous year, an increase of 31.6 per cent.","Officers accused of bundling girl inside their car on New Year's Eve .

"A father called the local Sheriff’s deputy to his home to witness him spanking his daughter with a paddle to make sure he wasn’t committing a crime. The unnamed dad called the Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office in Florida, to come and watch him paddle his 12-year-old daughter, and they dutifully arrived. He wanted to discipline his child after she got into a heated argument with her sister on Monday, according to a deputy's report obtained by WLWT 5. Paddle: The unnamed dad called the Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office in Florida, to come and watch him paddle his 12 year old daughter . Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office said it is not the first time that they have been asked to supervise a beating . Undersheriff Noel Stephen, seen here, said he had personally supervised approximately 12 spankings . Noel Sheriff, the underSheriff for Okeechobee county said: 'There is a big difference between beating your child and disciplining your child. 'Parents are seeking guidance on how to deal with their child. You are entitled to paddle your child, whether you use your hand, you use your belt or a paddle within reason as long as your paddling the buttocks.' In this case, the 'whooping' was not considered to be a crime, so the deputy wrote up his police report and left the house. An unnamed local resident told the channel: 'People don't want to hit their kids because of consequences from the authorities.' However, it's not the first time that a parent has called Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office to supervise a beating. The sheriff's office said it had received several similar requests in the past and Undersheriff Noel Stephen said he had personally supervised 12 spankings. But the sheriff's office stated that while it is not 'advertising this type of service' they will  come to your house if they're not busy on other calls. Stephen added: 'It's definitely not something we advertise to do, and even though law enforcement has been willing to help out in this situation, watching a parent discipline their child is something that's done only when a deputy has no other calls to handle.' The sheriff's office said it is not 'advertising this type of service' but if it has nothing else to do they will come to your house and supervise . The father's actions have received plenty of support from local residents. 'Good for him!' one said. 'Look at these kids nowadays, most of them are in prison. 'A bit of a whooping never hurt nobody. It didn't hurt me when I was growing up, didn't hurt my mother, or father we're all still alive.'","The unnamed dad called the Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office in Florida .

"Dozens of homes are likely to have been destroyed and eight firefighters have been injured by a raging bushfire that continues to sweep through the northeastern Adelaide Hills as South Australia's worst bushfire since the 1983 Ash Wednesday blaze continues to threaten lives overnight. There are several firefronts each one spanning kilometres in Adelaide Hills. At one stage on Saturday evening the smoke was so dense visibility was virtually nil. The out-of-control fire  is threatening the communities of Kersbrook, Gumeracha, Cudlee Creek, Inglewood, Houghton, Lobethal, Mount Torrens, Charleston, and Mt Pleasant after burning freely in all directions for most of Saturday. In Victoria, storms brought a brief respite to firefighters battling blazes across the state, but not before a blaze at Moyston, in the state’s west, ­destroyed three homes, killed thousands of animals and burnt 4700ha of land.

Fire ripped through the Tea Tree Gully Boarding Kennels and Cattery on Saturday morning, burning down the cattery and a large section of the kennels. All of the cats and about a third of the dogs at the kennels were killed. Owner Paul Hicks says he and his wife were unable to take any of the animals with them when the fire forced them to evacuate. The devastated couple's home was also destroyed in the blaze. 'It's really, really sad at the moment,' Mr Hicks told ABC radio.

""If the house goes, it's all just possessions,"" she said on Saturday while sitting outside the bushfire relief centre in Ararat. The dogs - Frank and Ken - sat nearby, with a bucket of water, in Ararat's quiet main street. About 20 people and their pets had arrived at the relief centre by Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile South Australian premier Jay Weatherill has told residents in the Adelaide Hills to put their emergency evacuation plans in place and leave immediately. 'Your lives are at risk and we are asking you to implement your bushfire survival plans,' Mr Weatherill said. 'If you decide to leave you should leave immediately. 'If you have decided to stay the fire could become incredibly scary and it could make you change your mind and leave. 'It could be a catastrophic decision to leave late.' More than 10,000 hectares has been already been burnt and at least seven volunteer fire fighters have been treated for smoke inhalation. Around 500 firefighters supported by 100 appliances and 14 aircraft are currently battling the blaze, with more personnel and trucks to arrive from New South Wales.

A band of lightning crossing Victoria on Saturday evening is also sparking more fires. Residents near Ararat in Victoria's west have been urged to leave their homes amid fears a wind change could send the fire towards them. An emergency warning also remains in place for Sampson Flat. The fire is expected to burn well into next week. The major concern is to get the fire under control before the hot and windy conditions which are forecast for Wednesday. Lightning strikes are also causing further problems for fire fighters, starting several spot fires in the area. 'There should be no sense of relief because of a temperature drop or spots of rain.

"A plumber has died and a family taken to hospital from a block of flats which was evacuated because of chemical fumes. The man was believed to have suffered an electric shock and was pronounced dead at the scene. He is understood to have been unblocking a sink using a drain cleaning fluid when the tragedy happened on the fourth floor of the flat on New Year's Day. Residents said a small 'explosion' took place when the plumber - who has not been named - poured the fluid down a drain. A plumber died on the fourth floor of this block of flats at Boulter House in New Cross, south east London . London Fire Brigade said around 100 people were evacuated from Boulter House in New Cross, south east London, by the emergency services as a precaution because of the smell of chemicals. People in the flat spent several hours sitting on a night bus which had been pulled over by police to give residents shelter. The plumber is not believed to be a resident, but a Nigerian couple and their three children who live in the flat were all taken to hospital. An LFB spokesman said: 'A woman and three children from the flat involved were taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service suffering from the effects of the fumes. 'Two men who were in the flat at the time are also believed to have suffered a possible electric shock. One of them, also affected by fumes, was taken to hospital, but sadly the other man was pronounced dead at the scene.' Yohannes Berhe, 33, a cleaner, who lives next door to the flat, said the son of the couple had been knocking on his door for help. Mr Berhe said: 'I came home around 9:30pm and the eldest boy, he's 14, was really distressed and he said ""my dad and my mum and the engineer - they've had an accident and they're all lying on the floor"". 'He was holding his mobile phone and so I rang the ambulance for him. They told us to stay outside so I took the children and looked after them until the ambulance came. 'The plumber had poured some acid or solution down the drain because the sink was blocked. I think that must have caused an explosion somehow. The kitchen light exploded. 'From what I can make out, the plumber was shocked and the man who lives there touched him to see if he was OK and was shocked himself. Then the same thing happened to the lady too, I think.' He said he could see the emergency services rushing to the aid of the Nigerian man, adding: 'It looked like they were pumping his chest in the back of the ambulance. 'The mother was vomiting a lot in the back of the ambulance. The children were also taken to hospital.' Yohannes Berhe (pictured), 33, a cleaner, who lives next door to the flat, said there was an 'explosion'  - because he was outside with the couple's children when the building was evacuated but had left his light on, the fire brigade smashed his front window (pictured) to check no body was in . Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'We were on the bus until around 2am, but the police made sure we stayed calm. 'After a while, when they had taken everybody's name and address on the bus, they told us there could be a problem with gas and we wouldn't be allowed back until they knew it was safe.' Residents were eventually allowed to return to their flats at around 4.30am. Boulter House resident, Raynold Dove, 47, said: 'It was like a disaster movie, there were fire engines, ambulances, and police all around the flats. I counted six fire engines and five ambulances. I thought the end of the world was coming, or something. It was crazy, absolutely crazy. 'We weren't aware at all what was happening. We just got put on a night bus and didn't really know why we were being evacuated.' London Ambulance Service (LAS) said paramedics were called at 9:49pm. An LAS spokesman said: ' 'We sent a number of resources to the scene including an advanced paramedic, the hazardous area response team and a tactical advisor. 'A man reported to be in his fifties, a woman reported to be in her forties and three children were all taken to Kings College Hospital as a priority. 'Sadly, despite extensive efforts to resuscitate the patient, a man was dead at the scene.' A Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said officers were called to the flat shortly after 10pm and that the incident was not believed to be suspicious. She added that the Health and Safety Executive had been informed. The building is managed by Lewisham Homes. However, the flat the Nigerian family live in is a leasehold property. The social housing provider described the incident as 'terrible' and said it was providing support to police to help their investigations. A Lewisham Homes spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the families involved in the terrible incident at a leasehold property in New Cross on Thursday night. 'We are providing support to the police to ensure the property is safe to enter while investigations are carried out.'","Man thought to have suffered electric shock and pronounced dead at scene .

"Inspiring cynicism: Nick Clegg (pictured) pledged to vote against a rise in tuition fees - a promise he later broke, infuriating many youngsters . Young people are less supportive of the welfare state than their parents, more likely to believe that people should look after themselves, and less trusting of their neighbours, a Government report has found. In what is described as ‘a clear generational shift’, those who grew up under Margaret Thatcher and John Major are more ‘individualist’ and appear to be more cynical and more suspicious that the benefits system is being abused. The Cabinet Office findings indicate that individualism is the most pronounced among Generation Y, those born after 1980 into the early 2000s. The report stresses that this trait does not mean those in their 20s and early 30s are more selfish than older generations because they are just as likely to value the welfare of others. While the shift in attitudes could be good news for the Conservative Party, which hopes to combat the benefits culture, and bad news for Labour, which promotes the welfare state, Generation Y are less likely to vote, according to the findings. The wide-ranging report also found: . - Children are set to live with their parents for longer; . - Political engagement among the young is set to decline further, with even fewer voting in elections; . - There will be a slow decline of religious identification, pushing us further towards a secular society; . - Grandparents could increasingly be called on to look after young children – as they are expected to stay in the workplace for longer; . - There could be a future of less-secure jobs for the young – but there are signs that many have reacted to the economic crash by becoming more entrepreneurial than their forebears; . - For some, the effect of the internet and the prevalence of technology could have a ‘negative impact’. The study concluded that while there was much to be positive about, ‘there are also potential concerns, for instance around declining mainstream political engagement, low levels of social trust and the potential negative impacts of digital technologies’. The Cabinet Office report was compiled by the Government’s ‘horizon scanning programme’, which looks at policies that may be needed in the coming decade to react to changes in society. It was based on numerous sources, including focus groups and an Ipsos MORI survey published in 2013. That study found only 23 per cent of those in Generation Y said they agreed that ‘the government should spend more money on welfare benefits for the poor, even if it leads to higher taxes’, compared to 37 per cent of those who were born before the war. The welfare state is most identified with the Labour government of 1945 to 1951, which set up the National Health Service and replaced the Victorian poor law with social security. Those who grew up under Margaret Thatcher (centre) and John Major (behind her to the left) are more ‘individualist’ and appear to be more cynical and more suspicious that the benefits system is being abused . However, much of it was questioned during the 1980s and 1990s during the Tory premierships of Mrs Thatcher and Sir John. Now major elements are being cut back in the wake of the economic crisis. For example, a cap has been imposed on the amount a family can claim in handouts. The report, which was published late last month, says that the generational shift away from support for the welfare state appears to have occurred ‘partly [because of] a view that the system is abused by many people and partly due to an emphasis on personal autonomy’. It continues: ‘Generation Y is more likely than other cohorts to believe the role of the state should be more focused on providing opportunities and less on managing the risks individuals face. This suggests that Generation Y is a more “individualist” generation than the others, more concerned with personal independence and opportunity than compulsory systems of risk-pooling and redistribution.’ ‘However, younger people are no less likely to think that specific groups, such as the elderly, the disabled and low-income working families need to be supported.’ It added: ‘Young people attach as much value to the welfare of others as older generations.’ The report said that, in general, the future looks bright for young adults. But there is much uncertainty around the ‘changing nature of the youth labour market’. ‘Some commentators argue that we are seeing a change in the nature of the youth job market towards fewer, less secure jobs,’ it said. However, one positive note is that the economic downturn may have made young people more entrepreneurial. ‘There is some evidence of an increase in the numbers of young people that aim to start or are in the process of starting a business,’ it said. The report also warns of the potential dangers of technology. ‘There is clear evidence that moderate use of technology is likely to have significant positive impacts on wellbeing, but that for the small minority of young people who use technology heavily, there could be a range of negative impacts, related to, for instance, “sexualisation”, the influence of violent video games and cyber-bullying,’ it said. Economy left them reliant on bank of Mum and Dad . Children are likely to live with their parents for longer and rely increasingly on the ‘bank of mum and dad’, the report predicts. The rising costs of housing and the trend towards studying for longer means that today’s children face an ‘extended path to full adulthood’. This will lead to a new life stage of ‘emerging adulthood’, the report predicts, as young people take longer to achieve full independence from their parents. More and more youngsters are relying on their parents for finance, with up to two thirds asking them to help fund a deposit for a first house. Children are likely to live with their parents for longer and rely increasingly on the ‘bank of mum and dad’, the report predicts (file pictures) All this could have a ‘detrimental impact’ on social mobility in the future – because while the middle classes will support their children, poorer parents will be unable to do so. The report said: ‘As young people struggle to become financially independent, they are taking longer to move out of their family home, have children, get married and buy their own home. ‘For more advantaged young people who can depend on parental support, this time is often spent in full-time education can be characterised as a time of opportunities and experimentation. For young people who cannot depend on this support, it is likely to be a more precarious and less positive experience.’ The report also said that ‘multi-generational households’ may become more common in the future, and relationships could be ‘reshaped’ by increasing mutual dependence, particularly as older people will increasingly be expected to provide childcare for their offspring. But, far from being a return to tight-knit families, the report warned that the demands of work will mean parents and children live further apart in the future, limiting the ‘contact and support available’.","Today's youth feel people should stand on their own two feet, report finds .
They are less likely to vote or say they are religious, according to Cabinet Office findings .
But the report finds 'Generation Y' are more likely to start up a business .

"Britain is feeding the world, challenging national stereotypes to sell tea to China, beer to Belgium and cheese to France. The powers of persuasion of the UK's food and drink producers have not quite managed to sell snow to the Eskimos, but they have got a deal to export ice cubes to Sweden. A record 150 countries worldwide now import British produce to supermarkets, bars and restaurants, taking total sales last year to almost £19billion. Britain has shaken off its reputation for bad food to now take on countries at their own game, exporting wine to Italy, chocolate to Belgium, cheese to France and even tea to China . Ministers boast they have helped a record 2,500 food and drink firms to sell their produce abroad in the last year. It seems Britain has finally shaken off its reputation for grim grub to now take on homegrown industries 'at their own game'. Most notably, sales of cheese to France – which prides itself on its fromage – have soared by more than a quarter in four years to top £70million in 2013. There are now more varieties of cheese produced in the UK than the whole of France, with British firms exporting to 86 different countries last year. The Ice Co. exports ice cubes made in Britain to unlikely countries including Sweden, Denmark, France and Hong Kong. Tea might be the quintessentially British drink, but we have been importing tea leaves from China since the 17th century. Now, the tables have turned, with £330,000 worth of tea exported to China between January and September this year, up 30 per cent in a year. Number of firms UK exporting food and drink . Value of food and drink exports in 2013 . Tonnes of cheese sold to France . Increase in tea sales to China 2013-14 . Sales of biscuits to Nigeria . Value of beers sales to the USA in 2013 . Beer is also finding fans in unlikely places, like the USA, Australia and Belgium, all home to world famous brands like Budweiser, Fosters and Stella Artois. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss told MailOnline: 'The world over, we're beating people at their own game when it comes to exporting our first rate food and drink – our chillies are shipped to Pakistan, our ice is flown to Sweden, the Belgians can't get enough of our beer and the Chinese are sipping Yorkshire tea. 'We've had huge success in this area which is why the UK's entire food chain has now smashed the £100 billion mark generating more money than ever for our growing economy. 'We have opened, on average, almost three new international markets every week since 2010. This has helped a record number of British food and drinks companies sell their delicious produce abroad, building a stronger economy for the UK.' But sales of British beer overseas have trebled in recent years, and are now worth £93million to Belgium alone, up from just £3million in 2010. Sales to Australia have more than doubled to £11million while to the USA they have risen by more than a third to £147million. For the first time the UK is even exporting chillies to Pakistan, a market now worth £40,000 but with the potential for huge growth. Environment Secretary Liz Truss said Britain is 'beating people at their own game' when by exporting food and drink around the world . Latest figures show that 1.6 per cent of all chilli exports so far in 2014 have been to Pakistan, a country with a strong traditional chilli culture of its own. The UK market in chillies to the Netherlands and France alone is worth almost £900million. Switzerland and Belgium might have a global reputation for their own fine chocolate, but both are now importing British versions too. Chocolate sales to Switzerland are up 160 per cent since 2010 to reach almost £10million. Sales to Belgium last year were worth £17million and to Germany £35million. Cider might have its roots in Somerset scrumpy, but thanks to a modern revival it is enjoying growing popularity around the world. Drinks in Singapore, Thailand, Bulgaria and the USA have got a taste for it, with sales to these four countries worth £7.5million alone, including £435million to Singapore. For a long time English wine may have been seen as a joke, but is now a major player in the global market. While the French pride themselves on their Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, last year they imported more than £48million worth of UK wine, up 11 per cent in a year. Sales to Australia hit £3million, Italy £2million and South Africa £1.3million. The biscuit business is booming too, exporting 7.5million biscuits to 143 countries last year, generating a record £1.1billion for the UK economy. The USA is the biggest market, worth almost £21million, up more than a quarter since 2010. The Germans bought £15million in British biscuits in 2013, while almost £10million went to both the UAE and Nigeria.","Sales of cheese to France have soared by more than a quarter in four years .

"A mental health worker who inspired Pulp's Disco 2000 has died after losing a battle to cancer. Deborah Bone, who was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer in January 2013, passed away on December 30, shortly after she learned she had been honoured with an MBE. The New Year's Honours list was announced just a few hours after her death. Born in Sheffield, she was a close childhood friend of Pulp lead singer Jarvis Cocker, pictured together, who sang the 90s hit, which repeatedly mentions her name . Born in Sheffield, she was a close childhood friend of Pulp lead singer Jarvis Cocker, who sang the 90s hit, which repeatedly mentions her name. The song, which reached number seven in 1995, features the lyrics: 'Well we were born within one hour of each other. 'Our mothers said we could be sister and brother. Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya.' Cocker reportedly sang Disco 2000 at her 50th birthday party. The 51-year-old, who set up the Step2 health service for the Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust in Stevenage, had been battling multiple myeloma. Mrs Bone, from Letchworth, Hertfordshire, used a blog to document her battle with cancer. In one of her last posts, in November last year, she wrote: 'Your strength is my strength. I have been wrapped in a blanket of love and appreciate all your comments even if I don’t always respond. 'It all makes such a difference to my mental well being. 'I'm looking forward to Christmas and the birth of my second grandchild in February.' Deborah Bone passed away on December 30, shortly after she learned she had been honoured with an MBE . She developed the Brainbox, a visual resource to help young people cope with high stress and anxiety, and was also the co-creator of the award-winning Bright Stars programme which is used in primary schools across Hertfordshire. Her MBE was awarded for services to children and young people in recognition of such feats. She is survived by husband Colin, daughters Jemima and Pollyanna, grandson Elliot and a soon to be born granddaughter Lucy. Mrs Bone's family paid tribute to her on her blog, describing her as an 'inspirational woman'. They said: 'Thank you for taking the time to share in this journey with Deborah and our family. 'We are sorry to let you know that after a brave fight, Deborah passed away on December 30th, peacefully at home. She loved life and fought to the end. 'Deborah was a truly inspirational woman, always putting other people before herself. 'She worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those around her and it is with great pride we can tell you that in the New Years honours list 2015 she received an MBE for her services to children's mental health. 'She leaves behind a loving family – her two beautiful daughters, grandson and husband who all miss her greatly and will continue to follow in her footsteps. 'As a family, we would like to thank you all for the support and kind wishes. 'We will be creating a book of our Mummy's life and memories. Please could you share any photographs, notes or thoughts with us so together we can forever honour her memory.' Pulp's Disco 2000 repeats the name Deborah frequently and features the lyrics: 'Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya' Her husband Colin told the Stevenage Comet: 'Learning Deborah had been awarded an MBE was a very emotional experience. 'Her first thoughts characteristically were for the other people who helped to make her achievements possible. 'I shall be so proud to attend the MBE award ceremony on her behalf accompanied by her daughter Pollyanna who is following in her mother’s footsteps working for the NHS and already achieving national recognition.' Mrs Bone's funeral will be held on January 16 in St Nicholas's Church Hinxworth, Hertfordshire. The family have asked for donations to be made to Young Minds 'to enable Deborah continue her passion to improve children's mental health.' Pulp's hit Disco 2000 reached number seven in 1995.

A still from Pulp's Disco 2000, sung by Jarvis Cocker, about a girl named Deborah . Well we were born within one hour of each other . Our mothers said we could be sister and brother . Your name is Deborah. Deborah. It never suited ya . Oh they thought that when we grew up we'd get married, never split up . We never did it although often I thought of it . Oh Deborah do you recall . Your house was very small with wood chip on the wall . When I came around to call you didn't notice me at all . I said let's all meet up in the year 2000 . Won't it be strange when we're all fully grown . Be there at 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road . I never knew that you'd get married . I would be living down here on my own on that damp and lonely Thursday years ago . Source: AtoZlyrics .","Deborah Bone passed away at home on December 30 at the age 51 .

"The NHS is paying stand-in A&E doctors £2,000 a day because staff are refusing to work permanently in hospitals they have likened to ‘war zones’. Hospitals are being forced to spend tens of millions of pounds on commission to agencies to arrange cover for shifts at understaffed departments, The Times reported last night. Desperate trusts are hiring temporary doctors to fill gaps during busy times, with a fifth of the £855million NHS locum bill being spent in Accident and Emergency units. Scroll down for video . Hospitals are being forced to pay locum doctors up to £2k a day to work in 'war zone' casualty departments . One locum GP said he covers four shifts a month in an un-named unit (not pictured) to top up his wages . According to a detailed analysis of NHS spending on locums, even the most junior doctors are earning up to £1,000 a day. Hospitals have spent a record amount of almost £1billion on agency doctors and nurses in six months. Doctors said working conditions in some A&E units were so bad that staff did not want to sign up full-time – leading to acute shortages. Others say there is little incentive for doctors to take a permanent job when temporary work can pay so well. Patients’ leaders attacked the payments as a waste of money and urged the NHS to focus on training, hiring and retaining skilled doctors. Consultants in general medicine have been paid up to £175 an hour, while A&E consultants receive an average rate of £90 per hour, which can rise to £142. Stand-in dentists receive an average rate of £111 an hour and commission fees paid to agencies can add up to £25 an hour in some fields. Even doctors only two years out of medical school have been paid £100 an hour to work on maternity units. The average NHS consultant receives basic pay of £89,000 and total earnings with bonuses and other payments of £111,000. The figures are contained in an analysis of 39 hospitals by Liaison – a financial services company employed by hospitals to help manage their spending on agency staff. Andrew Armitage, the company’s managing director, said many hospitals did not know whether they were paying too much for staff. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, labelled the figures ‘truly shocking’. She added: ‘The NHS should start focusing more resources on hiring and retaining skilled doctors and stop the wastage spent on temporary staff.’ A locum GP, who asked not to be named, compared A&E to a war zone. The 35-year-old does three or four shifts a month in hospitals, for £800 a time, to top up his salary, but says some colleagues are able to work full-time as locums. He said: ‘There’s camaraderie and a real sense of purpose – but you wouldn’t want to work there every day. The pay is good but it’s stressful work, and draining.’","One fifth of the NHS locum budget of £855 million is spent on A&E units .

"Britons who are planning a post-Christmas holiday in Gambia are being told to steer clear of public gatherings after a flash of violent unrest in the capital. Gun battles erupted near the presidential palace in Banjul on Tuesday while the West African nation’s president, Yahya Jammeh, was out of the country. In a televised address the longtime leader, who seized power 20 years ago, denied that it was a coup and claimed the capital was attacked by ‘terrorist groups’ backed by dissidents in the UK, US and Germany. Gambian President Yahya Jammeh blamed 'terrorist groups' for a flash of violence in the capital . Following Tuesday's violence the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) has not warned against travelling to Gambia but said it is keeping its travel advice ‘under constant review’ as it encourages holidaymakers to take precautions. The FCO said: ‘There were reports of gunfire in the early hours of 30 December in the capital, Banjul. The situation is now calm. ‘If you’re in Banjul, avoid public gatherings and monitor local media for developments.’ It said access to Banjul, the international airport and routes to tourist zones are no longer being restricted. The FCO said: ‘Access to Banjul has been reopened, as the blockade at Denton Bridge has now been lifted and returned to a checkpoint. While in power President Jammeh has targeted political opponents, journalists and gays and lesbians . ‘There are other checkpoints currently operating in Banjul. You should expect your vehicle to be searched if stopped by security forces. ‘Roads on the mainland between the airport and other areas, including the main holiday resort areas, are open as usual. Banjul airport is unaffected and operating as normal.’ Gambia is a popular winter sun destination for Europeans who flock to its nature reserves and beaches on its short stretch of Atlantic Ocean coastline. A handful of UK tour operators offer package holidays to destinations such as Banjul Beach and Kololi Beach, and the country is visited by an estimated 60,000 Britons per year. A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said: ‘Abta always works closely with the Foreign Office in any situation which might affect the safety of passengers, which we have done in relation to the Gambia. ‘Luckily the situation did not worsen and the resorts have remained unaffected.’ Britain's Foreign Office has not warned against travelling to Gambia but it keeping its advice under review . The Foreign Office said ‘attacks on tourists are increasing’ in the Gambia and corruption in the country is ""endemic at all levels."" During Tuesday’s unrest forces loyal to Jammeh’s regime gained the upper hand and reportedly killed five insurgents. It is not known how many casualties were suffered by the national military. Soldiers went house-to-house in search of opponents, arresting dozens of military personnel and civilians. Jammeh, who has since returned to Gambia following the attack, became the country’s leader in a coup in 1994. An estimated 60,000 British tourists flock to Gambia every year for its nature reserves and beaches . During his time in power he has targeted political opponents, journalists and gays and lesbians. He has become one of Africa’s most vocal anti-gay leaders and previously threatened to behead sexual minorities. It said there has been ‘a period of anti-UK rhetoric by the Gambian president’ following the country’s withdrawal from the Commonwealth in October 2013. It warned visitors: ‘Although this rhetoric has since subsided and anti-UK sentiment among the wider population appears limited, you should avoid discussing politically sensitive topics.’ There has also been an increase in political tension and public demonstrations after disagreements between Gambia and the EU over the deterioration of human rights in the country.","Gambian president denied talk of a coup and blamed 'terrorists' for unrest .

"A couple paid £38,000-a-year in benefits because they have 11 children have posted a baby scan picture on Facebook - suggesting they may be expecting again. Cheryl Prudham, 32, had twins last autumn but she may have become pregnant just a month-or-so after giving birth. This week she posted a picture of a 12-week baby scan for her friends and family to see with the caption: 'Prudham baby #12' - whose birth could earn them an extra £700-a-year in benefits. Expecting again? Cheryl Prudham, 32, a mother of 11 posted a picture of a scan with the caption 'Prudham baby #12' on Facebook . Controversial: The Prudhams, from north Kent, take home around £38,000-a-year in benefits, pictured together before the birth of their twins in October . Support: A friend of Cheryl Prudham's appeared to congratulate her in October on her latest pregnancy . The couple get £12,000 more than the £26,000-a-year cap on benefits by working 20 hours  a week each as carers for the elderly, which allows them to top up their income with tax credits. The mother-of-11 first attracted criticism after demanding her local council provide her with a bigger council house to give her growing family more space. And as their family grew Mrs Prudham said publicly their benefits allowed to them to set aside thousands for foreign holidays and presents for their children. A friend of the Prudhams, who live in Gravesend, Kent told The Sun: 'There could only have been about a month after she had the twins before she was pregnant again. 'I don't know if they'll ever stop. They just keep on having more and more'. A spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'It's not for the state to say how many children anyone should have, but there is a limit to the number of children taxpayers can support. 'Couples up and down the country face tough decisions all the time when they decide if they can afford another child, and those on benefits should be no different.' Goring family: Mrs Prudham and her husband Rob had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose late last year . Time away: Mrs Prudham has previously attracted controversy for insisting it was right that taxpayers paid for their two-week holiday in Menorca, which she insisted they 'deserved' Home: The family live live in this five-bedroom council house in Gravesend, which they have recently redecorated . Mrs Prudham has since removed the scan after claiming it was a joke, and refused to comment on the story today when she answered the door at her semi-detached 1930s house in Gravesend, Kent. But neighbours were shocked she may be pregnant again. One said: 'It is disgusting. What sort of an example is she setting for her other kids? She is taking the mick and telling them it is okay to live off the government and not work hard for your money. 'Her money should be stopped, but if it is then it is the kids that will suffer. I feel sorry for them the most, because of their parents, they could lose out on things. Another resident added: 'They're a joke, the whole family.But surely the government is to blame too? The woman is only in her 30's, who knows how many more kids she could have.' One neighbour said: 'I feel embarrassed that I live on the same street as them.' Earlier this year the family boasted about having £4,000 to splash on Christmas presents and have insisted she's happy to claim state handouts and blaming the welfare system for her large family. Extraordinary life: Mrs Prudham has said publicly their benefits allowed to them to set aside thousands for foreign holidays and presents for their children . Mrs Prudham also revealed that her benefits help her fund a £30-a-week smoking habit and have paid for the family to redecorate their five-bedroom council house. The family were then photographed enjoying a two-week holiday in Menorca, which she insisted they 'deserved'. Mrs Prudham had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight. She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four. In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year. She then had twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose this autumn.","Cheryl Prudham posted scan picture with message: 'Prudham baby #12'

"Lord Tebbit said the Prime Minister will pay a heavy price for breaking a promise to tackle immigration . David Cameron can only hope to win the election if Ukip 'implodes', Tory grandee Lord Tebbit warned today. As the Conservatives launched their first election poster of the campaign, the former party chairman said the Prime Minister will pay a heavy price for breaking a promise to tackle immigration. He said that only a collapse in support for Ukip - which has made big gains in the past year - would allow the Tories to form an overall majority after May 7. Before the last election Mr Cameron pledge 'no ifs, no buts' to reduce net migration to the 'tens off thousands'. But latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in the last year, including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the European Union. Lord Tebbit told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: 'Mr Cameron swore that he would get immigration, net, down to tens of thousands, so that's a real problem,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. 'It makes it difficult for him to persuade people that he can control it without a radical change in our relationship with Europe, which Ukip would then point out would almost certainly mean leaving the European Union.' 'I think it is going to be very difficult to win an overall majority unless, for some reason or another, Ukip should implode.' The Prime Minister kicked off what expected to be four months of frenzied campaigning by the parties with an appeal to voters to 'stay on the road' to economic recovery. Addressing supporters in Halifax, West Yorkshire, he said the election would be 'the most important in a generation' and that any result other than a Conservative victory would be 'disastrous' for the country. David Cameron today launched the new Tory party campaign poster in Halifax, with the slogan 'Let's stay on the road to a stronger economy' Polling by YouGov shows how Ukip built its support during the last 12 months, including taking two seats in the Commons, winning the European elections and building a base on local councils . Speaking at the launch of the Conservatives first campaign poster of the year - with the slogan Let's Stay on the Road to a Stronger Economy - Mr Cameron said it was 'absolutely crucial' that the party triumphed in May. 'It is an absolutely vital election for our country and I think the most important election in a generation,' he said. 'I say we need to stay on the road to a stronger economy not just because the alternatives are so disastrous and, frankly, they are disastrous. 'I say that we should stay on this road because I'm absolutely clear about what the destination should be, about what more we can do for our country over the coming five years.' For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls MP said the Conservatives' economic plan had failed and the country needed a change of course. 'David Cameron and George Osborne are taking Britain in the wrong direction. It's a road lurching to the right - their plan is not working yet they're saying let's carry on with our failed plan,' he said. 'In the last few years we've seen living standards squeezed, a crisis in our NHS and tax cuts just for the richest in society while everyone else has to pay more.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: 'The Conservative economic plan for the future looks more like the highway to hell for the majority of British voters, as the Tories want to roll back the state to the 1930s.'","Former Tory party chairman warns Cameron will pay a high price for error .

"Fad diets are so last year as more and more Brits turn their backs on quick-fix solutions. The Atkins, the Paleo and the Cabbage Soup diets look set to be kicked to the curb in 2015. But while 91 per cent of Britons vow to eat healthier this year, half will quit in just three months, a YouGov survey revealed. Healthy eating plans: 91% of Britons vow to eat healthier this year but half will give up in just three months . While we all want to maintain our figures and lead a healthy lifestyle, boredom and not being able to eat favourite meals are reasons why we give up on diets . Paleolithic diets mimic the types and quantities of foods our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate. Pastured and wild meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, eggs, plenty of fresh vegetables and small seasonal amounts of fruit feature heavily. The basic premise of the Paleo diet is that this way of eating suits our genetics, which have hardly changed in the last 10,000 years. It is said to be much better than the grains, dairy, and processed foods that have arisen since the agricultural revolution. The main reason for giving up on the diets is boredom and not being able to go without their favourite meals, 71 per cent of survey respondents said. Despite 50 per cent of the population quitting their New Year diets after just 90 days, 91 per cent said they will try their hardest to make healthier food choices part of a routine which can be maintained for more than just the month of January. Although eating less is no longer the trend, one place consumers are cutting back is on their meat intake. More than one third of the consumers who took part in the poll have deliberately cut the amount of meat they eat and 48 per cent of these cite improving their health as the main reason. Dietician Alison Clarke said: 'Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the health benefits of eating a diet rich in protein and low in saturated fat, which meat alternatives can provide. More than one third of the consumers who took part in the poll deliberately cut the amount of meat they eat . 'People are wise to alternative protein sources and the long term benefits that these offer when it comes to overall health and weight control as part of a balanced diet.' Women do not seem as bothered about their meat intake as just 27 per cent have said they will cut down, although 60 per cent of men are trying to eat less. Eating meat alternatives is seen as a healthier option, with 50 per cent of consumers questioned focused on reducing either their calorie intake or saturated fat from their diet to become healthier this year. The poll was commissioned by meat-alternative brand, Quorn. Fad diets like Paleo (left) and the cabbage soup will soon be a thing of the past, the survey indicated . Ms Clarke added: 'It's clear that fad diets just aren't sustainable and people who attempt them may see short term benefits, but suffer long term disappointment at the results as well as potential health issues. 'A sustainable diet should allow you to eat your favourite meals, but in as healthy a way as possible. That way you're less likely to fail at the first hurdle. 'Eating healthily in 2015 should not be difficult or boring.'","Atkins, Paleo and Cabbage Soup diet no longer in fashion with Brits .
Boredom and not eating what we want are reasons why we we quit .

"The driver who killed a young couple in Boston in June will spend six months behind bars after he pleaded guilty to two counts of motor vehicle homicide in court on Friday. Mohamed Alfageeh, 30, was sentenced to two years in total behind bars for the deaths of Jessica Campbell, 27, and John Lanzillotti Jr., 28, after he caused a car accident which claimed their lives. Before Suffolk Superior Court Judge Carol Ball sentenced Alfageeh, his attorney, John Seed, said that his client accepted resposibility for the crash on Beacon Street in Boston on June 21, the longest day of the year. Tragedy: Jessica Campbell, 27, and John Lanzillotti Jr., 28, lost their lives in a car crash in Boston on June 21 . Judge Ball spoke to the mothers of the couple and took into consideration their feelings before passing down the sentence. According to the Boston Globe, Campbell's mother reminded Ball that she had spent 10 years trying to conceive Jessica and her loss is unfathomable. 'I don’t have the words to tell you how shattered we are,’ she said to Ball. 'My children are everything to me … She was a happy kid, a good student, and she grew up to be a beautiful young woman.’ Surprisingly, Campbell's mother, Ronnie, has declared herself free of anger towards Alfageeh. 'My sense of grief and loss supersedes any sense of anger,’ she said according to the Boston Globe.

"Two new houses, which are just four metres deep, are being built on a cramped derelict plot - and could be sold for up to £500,000 each. The development, on a patch of land 29 metres long, is in upmarket Clifton, in Bristol, where space for new property is in short supply. The houses - the length of a VW Polo - will have two storeys of living space and two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen area and a bathroom plus storage space. This tiny plot of land in upmarket  Clifton, Bristol, will have two houses built, each just four metres deep . The houses, which are as deep as the length of a VW Polo, will feature two storeys of living space each . They will also have flat roofs with solar panels - but no rear windows because of the tall retaining wall behind them. The total depth of the plot is 4m - compared to the 3.97m of a Polo - but inside the houses will be even smaller because of the thickness of the outside walls. Local estate agents say when finished they each could fetch up to £425,000. Bristol City Council turned down a previous scheme three years ago because it proposed three houses on the site. But planners have now agreed there are no good reasons for turning down the revised plan for two houses side by side. The depth of the plots are four metres, but once built, they will be even narrower because of thick outer walls . The site once formed part of a large quarry and there is a steep drop from the back of the existing houses to this plot. Planning agent Colin Pemble said despite the narrow width of the site, the homes would provide a similar amount of space to a home with a more conventional design. He said: 'If you think of a modern executive house, the depth of the rooms is unlikely to be more than about four metres. 'Instead of having rooms back-to-back in the traditional way, in this case, we have got them side by side.' He added that the design meant there was enough space to meet the council's planning regulations. It has not yet been made clear when the homes will be built or when they will become available on the market.

"In the words of one punter, 'Australia needs to get a better national dish'. Organisers of the 2015 Asian Cup put together a collage of each competitor's national meal of choice as part of its promotional efforts this month. Many of them were exotic dishes, such as Oman's Shuwa, Korean Naengmyeon and Saudi Kabsa - but Australia's was a meat pie with a squeeze of tomato sauce, bemusing many punters. 'What an embarrassment next to all these dishes,' punter Ben Jones wrote. 'Least pick an actual dish, not something you heat out the freezer'. Powered by meat pies? Asian Cup organisers described the meat pie as Australia's national dish . Asian Cup organisers put together this chart of each participating country's national dish . 'Should have been medium rare chicken parma!' said another fan, Vince Pham, referring to a chicken parmagiana - a dish which features cheese and tomato cooked onto a chicken schnitzel. 'All of these delicious looking meals and then Australia gets a meat pie?' questioned Kahlee Anderson. Others embraced the decision as a celebration of Australiana. 'We like football, meat pies, kangaroos and Holden cars,' said Mike Curran. AFC cup organisers even felt it needed to describe the composition of a meat pie, writing that it is a 'pie with a filling of meat and/or other savoury ingredients'. Japan: Star player Keisuke Honda's national dish was sushi . Saudi Arabia: Nasser Al-Shamrani's national dish was kabsa, a type of spiced chicken . Oman: Ali Al-Habsi's national dish was suwah, a lamb-based dish . Statistics, however, show the AFC may have done its research. Each Australian eats an average of 12 meat pies a year, according to Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) . That means the nation consumes some 270 million pies each year. Just last week, the Cup was criticised for leaving the entire continent of Australia off its map of Asia (although, the map has not been changed since Australia joined the competition in 2001.

"This is the shocking moment a reckless road rage driver slammed the car's brakes just inches in front of a lorry on the motorway. Dash-cam footage captured the motorist almost causing a mass pile-up after pulling off the dangerous manoeuvre on the busy M5 motorway. The driver of the blue Citroen C3 had been jostling for position with the large truck near Frankley Services, in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in August last year. The clip begins as the driver starts overtaking the lorry which then immediately pulls into the middle lane behind the car . He can be seen overtaking the lorry which then immediately pulls into the middle lane behind the car between junctions 3 and 4 of the motorway. Incredibly, the driver then slams on his brakes in front of the 7.5 tonne HGV which only manages to avoid a serious collision by a matter of inches. The man behind the wheel of the Citroen was tracked down by officers from the Central Motorway Policing Group (CMPG) after the incident. He admitted one count of dangerous driving and was handed a 12-month driving ban by magistrates as well as a £145 bill for court costs.

"Taxpayers forked out a quarter of a million pounds to send Shrien Dewani to South Africa for a murder trial which collapsed before his defence even began. The care home tycoon from Bristol was sent to face a South African court after the murder of his new wife Anni in 2010, after allegations he had arranged for her to be killed. The 35-year-old was sensationally cleared in early December when the judge threw out the case and panned the evidence of the  main prosecution witness as 'riddled with contradictions'. Cleared: Shrien Dewani is pictured left at Western Cape High Court for the start of his trial in Cape Town, South Africa, on charges of arranging his wife Anni's murder. Right, the happy couple on their wedding day . A report in the Daily Mirror says the Crown Prosecution Service spent £87,908 on QCs and £48,612 on junior counsel for the hearings leading up to Mr Dewani's extradition. The paper said a Freedom of Information request showed a further £23,464 was spent on psychiatric reports after Mr Dewani was diagnosed with stress-related mental health problems. It reported that the CPS revealed its solicitors had spent 496 hours on the case. Estimating the briefs were paid about £69 per hour, reporters Jeremy Armstrong and Jonathan Corke calculated that their fees added £34,000 to the cost. 'Police, transport, medical and other costs are likely to push the total bill to a quarter of a million pounds,' they wrote, adding that the Home Office and Scotland Yard also paid out during the extradition process but those figures were not included. Mr Dewani walked free after being cleared of any part in the killing despite Judge Jeanette Traverso saying that many 'unanswered questions' still surrounding the case. The decision to acquit Mr Dewani provoked a furious reaction from Anni's family who said they had been 'failed' by the justice system and would 'suffer sleepless nights for the rest of our lives'. They were outraged that Mr Dewani did not give evidence, choosing instead to have a statement read out by his lawyer at the start of the trial in which he admitted that he is bisexual in an apparent attempt to dismiss speculation over a possible motive for the murder. Furious: Ami Denborg, Anni's sister, weeps as she makes a statement expressing her shock at the South African justice system as she stands with Anni's brother Anish Hindocha, and her father Vinod Hindocha . Ashok Hindocha, Anni's uncle, said at the time: 'I was furious at the judge from day one - she just wanted to wrap up the case as quickly as possible. She appeared to be determined to have no time at all for the prosecution case. 'The way she spoke to Adrian Mopp, the prosecutor, was truly shocking. You can't speak to a prosecutor like he's an idiot - it was embarrassing to listen to. 'I felt sorry for him - she just never gave him a chance from the first day.' Mr Hindocha also vowed to meet Mr Dewani in court again after renewing the family's pledge to sue Mr Dewani for hiding his gay trysts. They believe they have grounds for legal action against Mr Dewani for leading Anni into marriage without revealing his sexuality and for compensation for the money the Hindocha family spent on the £200,000 wedding. Return: Mr Dewani in the back of a car being driven home from Gatwick after flying back from South Africa . Wealthy: An Avon and Somerset Police officer speaks into the intercom at the entrance of Mr Dewani's home in Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol after paint was thrown onto the driveway of the house after he returned . Twenty-four hours after he was cleared of involvement in the murder of Anni during their honeymoon Dewani left South Africa at the first opportunity on a £3,000 first class flight. The millionaire businessman then travelled in his own private pod on an Emirates Airlines flight from Dubai that touched down at 6.16am at Gatwick on December 10. The Home Office told the Daily Mirror that none of the money the UK taxpayer spent on the case is recoverable from South African authorities.","CPS spent nearly £137,000 just on barristers for extradition hearings .

"An Ohio woman who died in a car crash overnight Thursday is the girlfriend of the man killed by police while holding a BB gun in a Walmart. Tasha Thomas, 26 — who is seen on tape weeping as police threaten her during an interview — had been traveling in Dayton with Frederick Bailey, 30, when their car struck a pole and rolled about 3 pm. Thomas and Bailey were thrown nearly 100 from their vehicle, which landed on its top on a front yard near North Broadway Street at Edgewood Avenue. 'Witnesses on scene gave us accounts that the vehicle was traveling approximately 90 to 100 mph, lost control, hit an RTA pole and then flipped several times,' Sgt. Creigee Coleman, of the Dayton PD, told WHIO. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Police say Tasha Thomas, 26, and Frederick Bailey, 30, were speeding in this car before they struck a pole and rolled over . Police say the two victims were thrown nearly 100 feet as the car rolled over, leaving pieces like this door all over the place . The car landed on its top on this front yard near North Broadway Street at Edgewood Avenue . Just weeks ago, footage emerged of police in Ohio aggressively questioning Thomas. An officer from the Beavercreek department repeatedly demands to know where the slain John Crawford III, 22, got his 'gun' from in an interview with his weeping girlfriend, Tasha Thomas. Thomas, who is not told until the end of the interview that her loved one has died, is clearly distressed by the line of question from the disbelieving officer, Rodney Curd, who repeatedly suggests she is lying. Curd, who warns Thomas she could be jailed for what she says in the interview, also suggests that she looks 'messed up' and could be drunk or high on drugs in footage obtained by the Guardian. Thomas breaks down in tears several times in the interview following the August 5 incident, which focuses on the moments before Crawford was shot dead after picking up a BB gun in the Beavercreek Walmart outlet. Questioning: Beavercreek police officer Rodney Curd, right, is seen in the footage harshly questioning Tasha Thomas, the girlfriend of John Crawford III, who was shot dead by police in August . Repeated: Curd asks Thomas again and again whether she knew Crawford had a gun before going into the Walmart where he was shot. In fact he didn't have a gun, and picked up a replica from a shelf . A 911 caller had told police the replica gun was actually a real assault rifle, which led officer Sean Williams to gun him down. A grand jury later decided not to indict him for the killing. Tasha Thomas swore repeatedly on her own life, and the graves of her dead relatives, that she was being honest, despite Curd telling her she was phrasing her answers like 'someone not telling the truth', and saying he expected her testimony to change later. Shot dead: Crawford, pictured right with his mother, Tressa Sherrod, was killed after a 911 caller said he had a gun in the store . Moments before: Crawford can be seen above moments before he is killed by officer Sean Williams . Officer Curd: 'You and John went into Walmart, at some point as I understand it, John produced a gun. You were with him just moments before that, weren't you?' Tasha Thomas: Yes, sir . Curd: OK, Tell me where he got the gun from. Thomas: Sir I don't know - I honestly don't know. Curd: And the truth is you knew at some point he did carry a gun, isn't it? Thomas: No sir, I didn't know. I swear I didn't know. Curd: You see, I'm having trouble with this. Thomas: [Through tears] Please, give me a lie detector test! Footage from 94-minute interview, released to the news site by the Ohio attorney general, shows Curd grilling Thomas at length on her version of events, at times banging his hand on the table for emphasis. He also pursues a theory that Crawford had taken his own, real, gun into the store in order to shoot his ex-girlfriend, LeeCee Johnson. At one point he asks her: 'Did he ever mention ""I'm gonna shoot that bitch"", or something like that?' Thomas replied that he didn't, and that as far as she was aware she was in Cincinnati and not in the store. Although the grand jury concluded that the shooting was justified, federal officials are looking into the case. Earlier this month it was reported that Officer Williams, who also killed a man in 2010, will remain on leave until after that investigation. MailOnline has contacted the police department for comment.","Tasha Thomas, 26, was traveling in Dayton with 30-year-old Frederick Bailey when their car struck a pole and rolled .

"A Chinese student on board Asiana Flight 214 survived the crash-landing only to be killed accidentally on the runway by a fire truck racing to the wrecked, smoking plane, authorities revealed Friday. Ye Meng Yuan, 16, died of blunt force trauma as a result of being hit by a vehicle, according to the San Mateo County Coroner's Office. She was sitting in the back of the plane and it is believed she may have been ejected from her seat onto the tarmac when it crashed upon landing at San Francisco International airport. Her body was found near the left wing. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Ye Mengyuan, left, and Wang Linjia, right, are two of the three Chinese students killed the crash landing . Charred: Asiana Flight 214 burst into flames after crash landing July 6 at San Francisco International Airport . Ye Meng Yuan and her middle school . classmate, 16-year-old Wang Linjia, died in the July 6 crash. The other victim killed, 15-year-old Liu Yipeng, died at a hospital July 12. Dozens of others were injured. Tragic: Liu Yipeng, 15, died in the hospital days after the crash that killed two of her Chinese classmates . Police . and fire officials confirmed last week that Ye Meng Yuan was hit by a . fire truck racing to extinguish the blazing Boeing 777. 'The . fire truck did go over the victim at least one time. Now the other . question is, ""What was the cause of death?""' San Francisco police . spokesman Albie Esparza said. All three girls killed were from China. Ye . Meng Yuan's close friend Wang Linjia was among a group of injured . passengers who did not get immediate medical help after the crash. Rescuers did not spot . her until 14 minutes after the crash. Wang Linjia's body was found . along with three flight attendants who were flung onto the tarmac. Moments after the crash, while rescuers tried to help passengers near the burning fuselage, Wang Linjia and some flight attendants lay in the rubble almost 2,000 feet away. A group of survivors called 911 and tried to help them. Survivors said that after escaping the plane, they sat with at least four victims who appeared to be seriously hurt. They believe one of them was one of the girls who died. Cindy Stone, who was in that group, . was recorded by California Highway Patrol dispatchers calling in for . help: 'There are no ambulances here. We've been on the ground 20 . minutes. There are people lying on the tarmac with critical injuries, . head injuries. We're almost losing a woman here. We're trying to keep . her alive.' San . Francisco fire spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said Friday that when airport . personnel reached the group near the seawall, Linjia was dead. She did . not know when the girl had died. Several flight attendants remain hospitalized. Beyond recognition: The charred remains of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 after crash landing in San Francisco . Miracle: Despite the cabin bursting into flames, only three people have so far been identified as dead . Talmadge also confirmed that an Associated Press photograph of a body under a yellow tarp near the burned-out jet was Ye Meng Yuan. The photo, taken from above, shows firefighters looking down at the tarp, and there are truck track marks leading up to it. Police said the teenager was covered in foam that rescuers had sprayed on the burning wreckage. When the truck moved while battling the flames, rescuers discovered her body, Esparza said. 'The driver may not have seen the young lady in the blanket of foam,' said Ken Willette of the National Firefighter Protection Agency, which sets national standards for training airfield firefighters. 'These could be factors contributing to this tragic event.' Panic: As fire trucks rushed to the scene, one may have hit and killed Liu Yipeng, 15, in the chaotic aftermath . He said fire trucks that responded to the Asiana crash would have started shooting foam while approaching the fuselage from 80 or 100 feet away. The foam was sprayed from a cannon on the top of the truck across the ground to clear a safe path for evacuees. That was supposed to create a layer of foam on the ground that is several inches high before the truck gets to the plane. The victims were close friends and top students, looking forward to spending a few weeks at a Christian summer camp in California, where they planned to practice English and boosting their chances of attending a U.S. college. Their parents were flown to San Francisco after their deaths where the Chinese consulate was caring for them. Remarkable: The tail of the Boeing 777 came completely off when the back section of the plane hit the runway's sea wall . The crash-landing occurred after the airliner collided with a rocky seawall just short the runway. Dozens of passengers were hurt. There were 182 survivors taken to hospitals, though most suffered only minor injuries. So far, an investigation indicates the pilots, a trainee and his instructor, failed to realize until too late that the aircraft was dangerously low and flying too slow. Nothing disclosed so far by the National Transportation Safety Board investigators indicates any problems with the Boeing 777's engines, computers or automated systems. Also, San Francisco airport officials said that the runway where the jet crashed was reopened Friday evening, and all airlines would resume normal schedules immediately.","Ye Meng Yuan, 16, was killed by blunt force trauma as a result of a firetruck running over her at the scene of the crash, according to the results of an investigation .

"In the hunt for life elsewhere in the universe, one of the key questions has been how and when other planets formed; and was Earth an early or a late bloomer by comparison? Now astronomers may have an answer, as they have discovered a planet in our own Milky Way that is a staggering 11.2 billion years old - more than twice the age of our solar system. More importantly, the planet is an Earth-sized world, suggesting planets like our own have been forming long into the history of the universe. A team from the University of Birmingham has found an ancient planetary system containing five planets (shown at the bottom of the illustration, compared to other planets at the top). The planets are the size of our own, suggesting Earth-sized planets - and maybe life - have formed throughout the history of the universe . The discovery of the extrasolar system - 117 light-years away in the Lyra constellation - was made by Dr Tiago Campante, an astronomer from the University of Birmingham. With his team, he studied the star called KOI-3158 (KOI stands for 'Kepler Object of Interest'), which had been found by the Kepler Space Telescope. Around the star were five planets, all smaller than Earth. And they were able to estimate that the system is 11.2 billion years old, give or take 900 million years. By comparison, our sun is only 4.56 billion years old. The astronomers estimated the age of the planets from that of the star. By working out the age of the cluster in which a star resides, its age can be estimated. The Fermi Paradox questions why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve. Physicist Enrico Fermi devised it in 1950. He believed it was too extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected. He claimed there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced, space-colonising civilisations. This barrier is sometimes referred to as a 'Great Filter'. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. And, as most planets are thought to form early in the life of the planetary system, it has been reasonably assumed they formed at the same time - but there is a sizeable margin of error owing to this method used. 'That implies that Earth-size planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's history when metals were more scarce,' Dr Campante said in a talk earlier this year. 'KOI-3158, a system of terrestrial-sized planets, formed when the universe was less than 20 percent of its current age, so that suggests that Earth-sized planets may have formed throughout most of the Universe's history, leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy.' The system's innermost planet is the size of Mercury, the middle three are the size of Mars, and the outermost is slightly smaller than Venus. However, it is unlikely any of these planets host life - all of them orbit very close to their host star, closer than Mercury orbits our own star. Despite KOI-3158 being 25 per cent smaller and 700 degrees cooler than the sun, this distance is thought to be too small, and the temperatures too hot, for life to survive. But, it is the age and size of the planets that it is of most interest, however - and it is not unfeasible to think Earth-sized planets in more habitable orbits may have formed elsewhere in the universe. The discovery of the extrasolar system - 117 light-years away in the Lyra constellation - was made by Dr Tiago Campante, an astronomer from the University of Birmingham in the UK. With his team, he studied the star called KOI-3158, which had been found by the Kepler Space Telescope (illustration shown) It is unlikely any of these planets host life - all of them orbit very close to their host star, closer than Mercury orbits our own star (shown in diagram). But it is the age and size of the planets that it is of most interest, and it is not unfeasible to think Earth-sized planets in more habitable orbits  formed elsewhere . Life on Earth is thought to have taken billions of years to reach the state it is in today, leading some to believe we might be one of the first planets in our galaxy to have formed complex life. But, if other planets have been around more than twice as long as Earth, it's likely life could have started elsewhere. Others have suggested a lack of life discovered elsewhere might be due to complex life being extremely rare. In December, however, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr Jeremy England argued that life was actually common. In a series of talks given to several universities, he said the origin of life 'should be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill.' He added: 'You start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant.' Other Earth-sized worlds like Kepler-186f (illustration shown) have been found before. However, its age was not too dissimilar to Earth. The discovery that some Earth-sized worlds are much older than our own planet is hugely important, and could have big implications in the search for life . The reason for this, and the underlying aspect of his theory, is that while all matter - from rocks to plants - absorbs and dissipates energy, life is much better at redistributing it. This means atoms will eventually reorganise themselves into life because it is better at dissipating the energy in the water. If true, the implications of Dr England's theories are vast. Perhaps most importantly, it may suggest life elsewhere in the universe is not as rare as once thought, but rather is as common as planets and stars themselves. And together with this latest discovery of ancient planets, it brings us one step closer to finding out if we are alone in the universe or not.","University of Birmingham team has found an ancient planetary system .

"After years of dominating the burger industry, McDonald’s is now facing tough competition from upmarket rivals. Young foodies are increasingly seeking out boutique burger bars with top quality ingredients and table service. The explosion of trendy burger joints, including Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Byron Burger and Honest Burger, has put McDonald’s under pressure. After years of dominating the burger industry, McDonald’s is now facing tough competition from upmarket rivals (file picture) Now, the US giant has launched a gourmet cafe in Australia to see if it can upgrade its image. Known as The Corner, its new Sydney cafes have ditched the counter service and plastic feel for table service, metal baskets and wooden trays. It has also launched a separate phone app in America which allows customers to pick which bread, cheese, toppings and sauce they want before the burger is made to order. But critics suggest McDonald’s could struggle to fend off the rise of posh burger restaurants, which are rapidly expanding worldwide. In London, customers queue down the street to eat at fashionable eateries such as Dirty Burger, Meatliquor and Patty & Bun, where the meals are served in paper. Far from serving processed meat and cheese, they all emphasise the high-end cooking and staunchly target Britain’s middle-classes. The explosion of trendy burger joints, including Gourmet Burger Kitchen (pictured), Byron Burger and Honest Burger, has put McDonald’s under pressure . Byron Burger says it makes ‘proper hamburgers’ with ‘good Scottish beef, ground fresh, cooked medium and served in a squishy bun with fries and a craft beer’. In the US, a rival brand called Shake Shack describes itself as ‘fine casual’ and says it makes ‘premium burgers’. McDonald’s, in contrast, was said to be regarded as ‘unhealthy, outdated, downmarket and not a nice place to be’ by Britain’s young food-lovers. The Financial Times said: ‘McDonald’s has a grip on the mass market but is losing the top.’ McDonald’s is trying to adapt. It recently opened a McCafe known as The Corner, in Sydney’s suburbs, although it is not believed to sell burgers. The experimental café serves chipotle pulled pork, chorizo and egg rolls, museli pots, Moroccan chicken salad and tofu. Byron Burger says it makes ‘proper hamburgers’ with ‘good Scottish beef, ground fresh, cooked medium and served in a squishy bun with fries and a craft beer’ They will also sell ‘barista-made quality coffee, according to Business Insider, in a bid to satisfy Australia’s high standards for coffee and its café culture. The only giveaway that it is owned by McDonald’s are small logos on staff name badges and packaging. McDonald’s said it would use the trial café as a test for a healthier menu before possible rolling it out nationwide. Kyle Jarvis, manager of The Corner, said: ‘If they’re looking for a Quarter Pounder they’ll probably be sorely disappointed. ‘It’s a new concept for us, it’s a learning lab where we test the things that Maccas has never done before and push the boundaries of what we can do in a cafe environment.’ McDonald’s also revealed this week that it would cut several items from its massive menu next month in the US in a bid to speed up service. McDonald’s US President Mike Andres said: ‘We don’t need to have a big menu board to offer variety.’","Fast food giants McDonald's facing tough competition from upmarket rivals .

"Having a pet-loving president is a bonus for dog owners in Argentina whose state-run airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, is to  allow small pets on flights starting in mid-January. President Cristina Fernandez announced the policy change in a strange New Year social media address starring her beloved pooch Lolita, who regularly appears on her Facebook page. 'Careful! I said only small pets,' the post says. 'Don't try to board with a 50 kilo mastiff. Lolita only weighs two kilos.' Argentine president Cristina Fernandez announced small pets will be allowed on Aerolineas Argentinas . Fernandez announced the state-run airline's policy change in a New Year's address on Facebook . Lapdogs are a popular accessory and status symbol in Argentina, especially in the capital Buenos Aires, and famously pampered. One photograph of Fernandez with Lolita on the presidential plane Tango 01 posted on New Year's Eve has attracted more than 42,000 likes and almost 5,000 comments. Hand-held pooches ranging from shih tzu's to pugs are commonly seen at outdoor cafes and on the wide avenues of Buenos Aires, which is known as the Paris of South America for its European layout and architecture. As an aside, Fernandez addressed her country's worrying double-digit inflation, contracting gross domestic product and repeated sovereign debt defaults. She said central bank cash reserves rose 2.7 per cent in 2014, which could keep her from being forced into an unpalatable deal with hedge funds suing over defaulted bonds. 'Oh yes, I almost forgot, we've come to $31.4 billion in central bank reserves,' the post says. Zoe Herman (pictured) is going up against some of America's biggest airlines with a petition to allow her companion hedgehog Heloise to travel in the cabin of an aircraft, just like small cats and dogs. Heloise the hedgehog, from Portland, is not allowed to travel inside airplane cabins with her owner . The next president will be elected in October, so Lolita better make the most of the time she has left to enjoy the spacious Tango 01. Fernandez can't seek a third term as president. Pet travel policies vary from airline to airline but most able to arrange for a pet to travel in the hold, which is usually air-conditioned in the same manner as the cabin. In the past week US woman Zoe Herman launched a campaign to make it possible for her to travel with her pet hedgehog Heloise in the cabin rather than the hold. Some dog and cat breeds are deemed unfit for travel. Virgin refuses to fly snub or pug-nosed breeds including all pugs, Boston terrier, English Toy Spaniel, British, American and French bulldogs, along with Himalayan and Persian cats, due to their respiratory problems. British Airways allows cats or dogs in a carrier in the cabin if they weigh less than 6kg (13.2lb) - any larger they have to go in the cargo hold.","President Cristina Fernandez has a pet toy poodle call Lolita .

David and Rosemary King (pictured), who live in Surrey Road near the junction with Worcester Road, said they had heard little from Royal Mail by way of explanation . A number of residents in the area - including some that do not even live on the same road as Ms Sandiford - now say they face a four-and-a-half mile round trip to collect their post. Royal Mail, which has apologised for the inconvenience to its customers, said the suspension would continue indefinitely after another attempted attack on a postman a fortnight ago. Residents, among them pensioners and a pregnant woman, have hit out at the decision with some saying important medical letters have gone missing. They have to drive to and from the Blackburn Delivery Office in Canterbury Street, as do residents in neighbouring Worcester Road, if they want to collect their mail. A councillor for the area said the situation had now been going on for too long and called for a swift resolution. Ms Sandiford, of Worcester Road, was given a six-month community order at Blackburn Magistrates' Court in October after she pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control. The court also ordered that her American bulldog must be accompanied, muzzled, and kept on two leads when in public, while her garden must be securely fenced and adequately locked to prevent the animal from escaping . Trevor Smith, who lives in Surrey Road, said his wife Joan, 67, had missed a hospital appointment as a result of post not being delivered and now arranged visits over the phone. The 'temporary suspension' started in February 2014 for some homes on Surrey Road (pictured), Blackburn, Lancashire . Mr Smith, also 67, said: 'I believe the dog has been examined and there is nothing wrong with it. My wife has missed appointments through letters going missing and I know she's not the only one on this street. 'There are a lot of elderly people here and a pregnant woman across the road who have all had letters go missing. 'It also starts to add up when you have to drive or get a taxi to Canterbury Street once or twice a week. It's just wrong.' Louise Johnston, 85, who is recovering from an operation, said her son had to travel from Bury to pick up letters on her behalf. She said: 'One letter was posted to me on the 27th and arrived on the 4th. My hospital appointment was on the 3rd. It's not good enough.' Neighbour Mark Crear, 41, said: 'Me and my partner both work night shifts so it's hard enough to get to the delivery office. I feel like we're being unfairly punished. The dog doesn't even live on this street. 'I don't understand why they can't put the post in the Accrington Road post office and that would save the whole community going to Canterbury Street all the time.' A court ordered that Hayley Sandiford's American bulldog (pictured) must be accompanied, muzzled, and kept on two leads when in public . Val Regan, 75, whose husband Phillip died last year, said she found it difficult frequently getting taxis to and from the mail depot. She said: 'The cost of going to the sorting office is something I could do without. There have been Christmas cards missing too. 'I have a lot of hospital appointments and sometimes I won't know when they are until the last minute.' David and Rosemary King, who live in Surrey Road near the junction with Worcester Road, said they had heard little from Royal Mail by way of explanation. Mr King said: 'Luckily we can do our appointments by email, but not everyone can do that. My wife is disabled and it's not right that our street is still being excluded.' Councillor Tony Humphrys, who represents Shadsworth with Whitebirk, said he felt sorry for all parties involved. He said: 'I sympathise with both sides, with Royal Mail and with the residents because it is now so long since they have had mail delivered. 'I also have sympathies with Twin Valley Homes as they have tried their best to resolve it. 'It has gone on for too long now and there has to be a resolution.' The Royal Mail has said it had decided on areas where deliveries would not take place based on reported sightings of the animal. Spokesperson Val Bodden said: 'Royal Mail can confirm that we are continuing with the temporary suspension of deliveries to a number of addresses in the Worcester Road area of Blackburn, while concern for our postmen's safety continues, with the dog which attacked two of our postmen earlier this year still being allowed to roam freely on occasion while our postmen are out on delivery. 'In a recent incident on December 18, following restoration of deliveries to several addresses in September, our postman had to seek shelter when the dog, unattended and without a muzzle, tried to attack the postman. 'Suspending deliveries is always a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously and we have reported this latest incident to the police and local dog warden. 'We apologise to all affected customers and we want to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.'","Suspension started last February for some in Surrey Road, Blackburn .

"The United States imposed fresh sanctions on North Korea on Friday in its first public act of retribution for a crippling cyberattack against Sony. The stepped-up sanctions, authorized by executive order from President Barack Obama, will affect three North Korean entities, including a government intelligence agency and a North Korean arms dealer. The U.S. is also sanctioning 10 individuals who work for those entities or the North Korean government, the Treasury Department said. Scroll down for video . Sanctions: President Obama, left, authorized a new wave of sanctions against the oppressive regime, led by Kim Jong Un, pictured right giving a New Year's address . 'The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is aimed at the government of North Korea and its activities that threaten the United States and others,' Obama wrote to a letter to House and Senate leaders. Although the U.S. already has tough sanctions in place against North Korea over its nuclear program, these are the first sanctions punishing Pyongyang for alleged cyberattacks. The White House said this is just the first part of the U.S. response to the Sony incident. The FBI has blamed North Korea for the crippling cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. North Korea has denied involvement, but has expressed fury over a comedy film by Sony that mocked North Korea's leader. The Interview, directed by Seth Rogen and starring himself and James Flacco, depicted the Kim Jon Un as a manic, embarrassing psychopath who cries over Katy Perry songs and soils himself on live television. Outrage: The hacking attack was caused by outrage over Sony film The Interview, which depicted the violent death of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, above . Sony Pictures initially called off release of the film, citing threats of terror attacks against U.S. movie theaters. Obama criticized Sony's decision, and the movie opened last month. A nearly 10-hour shutdown of North Korean websites last week prompted widespread speculation that the U.S. had launched a counterattack in retribution, but the White House did not comment on whether the U.S. was responsible. The U.S. has vowed a proportional response to the Sony incident but has warned its response would 'take place at a time and in a manner of our choosing.'

"Heard the one about the golf course which banned golf buggies? Or the chip shop which stopped customers using salt and vinegar? They might sound like bad jokes - but they are actually just some of the bizarre excuses which have been trotted out in the name of health and safety. In the most recent example, a customer in Northumberland was told he could not put his own salt and vinegar on his take-away fish and chips. Scroll down for video . Barmy: A customer was stopped from putting his own salt and vinegar on his takeaway fish and chips for 'health and safety' reasons . It later emerged that the shop had stopped customers using the shakers because they were not sure where customers' hands had been. The bizarre incident was  referred to the Health and Safety Executive's 'myth busting' panel, which works to ensure rules are not used irrationally. Since it was set up in April 2012, the panel has dealt with nearly 350 cases of gone-wrong health and safety rules, once described by David Cameron as the 'national neurosis'. Another example from last month's panel included a primary school banning parents from bringing young babies to sit on their laps during the nativity play. But the panel concluded that the school had probably just made the ruling to prevent the children disturbing the performance - and that it had nothing to do with health and safety. This year, Brighton and Hove City Council also decided to close the beach on Christmas Day over 'safety fears' after a swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago. The so-called 'myth busters' at the HSE are now calling on businesses to stop blaming health and safety for poor or over-the-top decisions. It comes as researchers at the University of Exeter found that half of all cases came related to shops, cafes and leisure centres - which the HSE said is usually a cover-up for poor business practice. Judith Hackitt, Chair of HSE and the Myth Busters Challenge Panel, said: 'HSE wants to encourage everyone, especially those working in leisure and retail, to make a resolution to stop using the health and safety catch-all excuse. 'Give the real reason for the decision you take. We want people to be honest - giving health and safety the blame is lazy and unhelpful. Brighton and Hove City Council banned a Christmas day swim after two previous incidents due to health and safety. Pictured: The Christmas Day swim in 2011 . One customer was not allowed to return headphones because the packet was open (left) while another customer was confused when a trolley assistant on his train insisted they physically put his coffee onto his table for 'health and safety reasons' (right) 'Customers are at the heart any business. Getting rid of over-the-top decisions blamed on health and safety will improve the service customers receive and enable the business to prosper.' In another bizarre incident this year, a DIY store refused to cut a door to size, claiming that cutting the wood would compromise the strength of the door, thereby contravening health and safety legislation. A customer was also left baffled when a trolley assistant on his train journey insisted she had to put the coffee cup on the table rather than handing it to him, again for 'health and safety'. Earlier this year, a local furniture store told a customer's wife that she could not collect her foot stool from the store due to health and safety - even though the item would have fitted perfectly in her car. The business stated that the item had to be delivered, which cost around £30. The panel concluded this was a 'poor excuse'. In another incident, a high street clothing store would not open their fitting rooms on the first day of a sale, apparently due to health and safety. Mark Harper said over-the-top interpretations of health and safety rules 'get in the way of what the law is for' And a customer who bought some headphones from a high street store was told that if the packaging was opened the headphones could not be returned, even though they had not been used. Researchers found that 60 per cent of cases were due to a generic 'better safe than sorry' risk averse mind-set, which was especially strong in instances of poor customer service. In 32 per cent of cases, there was an assumption that there is a rule in place when there is not. And the study also found that 20 per cent of the health and safety myths affect children, meaning they were 'frequently prevented from engaging in activities in educational and leisure settings on the grounds of health and safety that are found to be baseless'. Dr Claire Dunlop said: 'Identifying these trends will enable the HSE to develop more focussed communications strategies that tailor advice and raise awareness in specific sectors and about particular populations. 'It will also enable them to support organisations to address the weaknesses in capacity that make health and safety myths more likely.' In previous cases, a local council was refusing to allow hanging baskets for a Village in Bloom competition until engineers had assessed the lampposts to show they were capable of holding the bracket and basket. The panel ruled this was a 'classic case' of rules being applied in an 'overly-cautious and inappropriate way'. Earlier this year, a six-year-old from Hampshire was also told that she could not take a baby chick into school for a presentation amid fears that children could contract bird flu. The little girl's father, Mike Montgomery, described the rule as 'ridiculous' and said he had even offered to bring in gel for the children to clean their hands with. In another case, a local council in Scotland banned a dog training club over allergy fears. The club, which had been running in a community hall for 60 years, was banned because the council claimed that those using the hall next door might be allergic to dogs or catch a disease from the pets. One council refused to put up hanging baskets for a Village in Bloom competition until lampposts had been checked . The myth buster panel said: 'This is a clear example of health and safety being misused. Any concerns about allergies and cleanliness can be easily managed.' In June last year, a mother in Gloucester was told by the headteacher that her seven-year-old daughter was no longer allowed to wear her homemade frilly socks because they could become a tripping hazard. But the Health and Safety panel again dismissed the rule. A spokesman said: 'There is nothing in health and safety law which stipulates how long or short frills on school girls' socks should be. 'These socks are unlikely to be a serious hazard unless they are torn and trailing on the floor. If you tried to ban everything children could trip over, they wouldn't be able to do anything. 'Schools are free to set their own uniform policies but these decisions shouldn't hide behind spurious references to health and safety law.' In the golf example, buggies were prohibited because they were not 'health and safety authorised'. Other examples include a council which stopped a nursery teacher taking children to an allotment, and a manager who banned a woman from wearing flip flops in the office because they did not have enclosed toes and a supported back. Department for Work and Pensions Minister Mark Harper said: 'The Health and Safety Executive has done fantastic work over the past 40 years to keep working people safe. 'Elf n safety' myths get in the way of what the law is for – saving lives, not stopping people living them. 'No employer or worker should hide behind the health and safety excuses, if they act in a sensible way. If you hear of a bogus health and safety myth, report it to our panel.' Set up in April 2012, the myth-busting panel invites those who believe they are victims of a ludicrous health and safety ruling to email in and get a professional view. The panel may then contest decisions made by insurance companies, local authorities and employers. There have been nearly 350 cases. In Northumberland, a customer was told they were not allowed to put their own salt and vinegar on their take-away fish and chips. This Christmas, a primary school stated that parents could not bring young babies to sit on their laps at the nativity play for 'health and safety' reasons. Earlier this year, a local furniture store told a customer's wife that she could not collect her foot stool from the store due to health and safety - even though the item will fit perfectly well in her car, . The business stated that it had to be delivered costing around £30, which the panel said was a 'poor excuse'. In Derbyshire, small wooden canes protecting daffodil canes were pulled out of the ground in case someone tripped over them and fell into a flowerbed. A primary school in Cumbria told pupils that they needed to wear goggles - if they wanted to play with conkers at school. The rule came after the local council attempted to ban children from playing conkers in the playground. Previously, a local council was refusing to allow hanging baskets to be placed on lamppost for a Village in Bloom competition until engineers had assessed the lampposts. In 2012, a Santa was not allowed to ride his float in Sutton - despite the tradition being around for decades. The ban was imposed after health and safety assessments found the sleigh too dangerous, instead Father Christmas had to walk alongside his sleigh . In 2008, children were banned from taking part in a sack race in Durham because teachers feared they would hurt themselves. Instead pupils was asked to run or skip. A town council near Manchester created a policy preventing loose flowers and pots being placed on graves.","Man told he could not salt his own chips due to alleged health and safety .

"It has become common practice for manufacturers around the world to sell phones and tablets with less storage space than is advertised on the box. And while many users are happy to put up with this discrepancy, two iPhone owners have decided to take Apple to task about it. In a suit filed in Miami, the pair accuses the tech giant of 'concealing, omitting and failing to disclose' that on 16GB versions of iPhones, more than 20 per cent of the advertised space isn't available. Scroll down for video . The lawsuit was filed by Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara from Miami.  They accuse the tech giant of 'concealing, omitting and failing to disclose' that, on 16GB versions of iPhone 6 Plus models that have iOS 8 pre-installed, in excess 20 per cent of the advertised storage space is not available (illustrated in this graph) The lawsuit has been filed by Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara from Miami. They are suing Apple both individually, 'and on behalf of all others similarly situated.' 'Apple’s misrepresentations and omissions are deceptive and misleading because they omit material facts that an average consumer would consider in deciding whether to purchase its products,' explained the suit, first spotted by Silicon Beat. 'Namely, that when using iOS 8, as much as 3.7GB of the represented storage capacity on a device represented to have 16GB of storage capacity is, in fact, not available to the purchaser for storage.' And a chart contained within the files shows that this discrepancy doesn't just apply to the latest models of the device. Older models that update to iOS 8 similarly suffer. For example, storage space on the iPhone 5S drops by 18.8 per cent, the iPad Air drops by 21.3 per cent, and the iPod by as much as 23.1 per cent, in comparison to advertised space. The files continued: 'Apple fails to disclose that upgrading from iOS 7 to iOS 8 will cost a device user between 600 MB and 1.3 GB of storage space - a result that no consumer could reasonably anticipate. In January, Which? tested eight 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google (pictured). Samsung's Galaxy S4 was worst performing handset, with only 54 per cent (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was best, with 79 per cent (12.6GB) California-based analyst Neil Cybart recently studied Apple’s iPhone storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry-level phones, customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger, more expensive, device the following year. This ultimately makes the firm an extra $3billion (£1.9 billion) each year . 'To put this in context, each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high resolution photographs.' 'The matter in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 exclusive of interests and costs,' added the files, and the pair is demanding a jury trial. Apple doesn't comment on ongoing court cases. In January, Which? tested eight 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google. It found that Samsung's Galaxy S4 was worst performing handset, with only 54 per cent (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was best, with 79 per cent (12.6GB). The iPhone 6 16GB has a similar amount of storage as the iPhone 5S, at 12.2GB, which has been dubbed 'inadequate' by users. Apple offers the iPhone 6 Plus (left) and iPhone 6 (right) in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models . By limiting the amount of storage on entry-level phones, in the ‘lower tier’, customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device, in the middle tier, the following year. These customers are more likely to then stay in the middle tier, or in some cases move to the upper tier, but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage. This trend is even more common if Apple keeps the entry-level the same, but boosts the storage by three times or more in the following year. However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but stay in the lower tier. All of these figures are taken from Neil Cybart's Above Avalon site. In year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version. The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. The current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are available in these sizes, for example. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two. This 64GB costs more than the 32GB version did the previous year. By the third year, Apple can offer 32GB as an entry-level model, but the customer won’t downgrade storage and stays with the 64GB as a minimum. In year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version.The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two. This 64GB costs more than the 32GB version did the previous year . Example 2 . Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model. And so on into year three, if Apple offers 64GB as a minimum. This means they spend less money each year, and Apple can't move customers from the lower to the middle or higher tiers. Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model . California-based analyst Neil Cybart recently studied Apple’s iPhone storage strategy and believes that by limiting storage on entry-level phones, customers are more likely to upgrade to a larger, more expensive, device the following year. He claims Apple makes an extra $3 billion (£1.9 billion) each year by not doubling the amount of minimum storage every time a new model is released. ‘Apple's decision to keep the entry-level storage tier at 16GB for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, despite doubling the other capacities to 64GB and 128GB, continues to raise eyebrows,’ explained analyst Neil Cybart on his Above Avalon site. ‘Apple's near-term motive behind keeping the 16GB capacity option is pretty clear: get people to buy the 64GB option.’ But, as Mr Cybart explained, Apple’s strategy is more complex, and forward-thinking than that. He believes that by limiting the amount of storage on entry-level phones, in what he calls the ‘lower tier’, customers will eventually upgrade to a larger device, in the middle tier, the following year. However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but stay in the lower tier. According to Mr Cybart's calculations, Apple's middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion) These customers are then more likely to then stay in the middle tier, or in some cases move to the upper tier, but are unlikely to downgrade to less storage. This trend is even more common if Apple keeps the entry-level the same, but boosts the storage by three times or more in the middle tier, the following year. However, if Apple doubles the amount of storage on the entry-level model each year, people upgrade but will always stay in the lower tier. According to Mr Cybart's calculations, the middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion). This is a difference of $3 billion (£1.9 billion). Mr Cybart claims that this difference is based on Apple charging an average $20 (£13) more for the handsets year-on-year. If Apple charged more, the difference would be greater. For example, in year one, Apple offers a 16GB, 32GB and 64GB model and the customer buys the 16GB version. The following year, Apple offers 16GB, 64GB and 128GB models. This prompts the user to either stay the same, or upgrade to 64GB in year two at a higher premium than the 32GB cost the previous year. By the third year, Apple can offer 32GB as an entry-level model, but the customer won’t downgrade storage and stays with the 64GB as a minimum. Alternatively, if Apple offers an entry-level 16GB one year, but then increases this lower tier storage the year after to 32GB, the customer may upgrade to a phone with larger storage, but they’re still technically buying the entry-level model. And so on into year three, if Apple offers 64GB as a minimum. Mr Cybart also worked out how much revenue Apple makes by keeping the 16GB model as a minimum, and using the middle tier strategy. According to his calculations, the middle tier strategy makes Apple $47 billion (£30 billion) a year. But the lower tier strategy makes $44 billion (£28 billion) - a difference of $3 billion (£1.9 billion), simply by charging an average $20 (£13) for the handsets. ‘By doubling the middle tier storage capacity to 64GB, while maintaining the price, and keeping the 16GB storage capacity at the bottom tier, I estimate that approximately 30 per cent of previous 16GB iPhone owners will upgrade to 64GB to take advantage of the better deal,’ continued Mr Cybart. ‘While some may say this discussion profitability is anti-consumer, observers need to look at this process as a bit more than just greed. ‘A case can be made that Apple is looking to get users dependent on higher storage, by carefully guiding customers into a particular iPhone model each year.’","The lawsuit was filed by Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara from Miami .

"Paula Thorne, pictured with Satchmo, was left distraught after a courier ran over and killer her dog while delivering Christmas presents to their home . A Family was left distraught after a courier ran over and killed their dog while delivering Christmas presents to their home. The delivery man struck the cocker spaniel as he came down the drive, sending the beloved pet ‘flying’ and breaking his pelvis in six places. The injuries meant Satchmo – who had been in the family for nearly 13 years – had to be put down. But when owner Paula Thorne contacted the Hermes courier service, they simply apologised ‘for the inconvenience’ and closed the complaint. And to make matters worse, Mrs Thorne now believes she has been ‘blacklisted’ by the company after a second package she ordered was sent back to the seller. ‘My husband was in the yard when he heard a car coming down the drive,’ she said. ‘Thinking it was me, he came out but realised that the car was going much faster than I ever would.’ Satchmo then ran out to meet the vehicle – however the driver apparently did not see the dog, who had a black coat, as he approached in the dark. ‘My husband saw the car swerve round the corner and then straight into Satchmo. ‘The car sent Satchmo flying. The courier, who is a regular, got out and said sorry, but my husband said to him: “Do you realise you’ve killed my dog?” The courier apologised but my husband said: “What do you expect when you drive like that?”’ She added that there is a sign warning people to drive slowly on the approach to their family farm in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Her husband Ian, 70, ran to get a blanket for the injured animal, who whimpered as he lay on the ground. The vet later confirmed that his pelvis was broken in five or six places, and he had to be put down to end his suffering. Mrs Thorne, who has three grown-up children and works in NHS mental health services, said the family was in shock and that the tragic incident on December 15 had ruined Christmas. ‘I was away in London at the time visiting my daughter and my husband phoned to say he had sad news and told us what had happened,’ she said. ‘We were in a daze. We collected his body and buried him in the woods. We were in shock but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that someone would have to take responsibility.’ She called the company with whom she had made the initial order – a pair of slippers from Samuel Windsor. But the firm said that she would have to get in touch with Hermes. A sign warning people to drive slowly on the approach to their family farm in Newark, Nottinghamshire . The grandmother-of-six then wrote to the courier service describing how her family had been left ‘grief-stricken’ by Satchmo’s death. ‘Understandably we are in the deep throes of bereavement – our Christmas has been destroyed – the pain is beyond measure,’ she said. ‘And my husband is suffering the acute loss of his shadow Satchmo. We hold Hermes responsible for the horrific death of our beloved dog of 13 years.’ She also complained to Hermes about the fact that a second delivery had been sent back to Next, the company she had ordered it from. The package included Christmas presents for the family of her son, the former Olympic sprinter Du’aine Ladejo, 43, who now lives in Australia. But they failed to arrive in time after the delivery was cancelled. A spokesman for Hermes said the company was in contact with the Thornes and had apologised. ‘We would like to send our sincere condolences to this family for their terrible loss,’ he said. He added that the firm had investigated the incident which led to Satchmo’s death, concluding that it was a ‘very sad accident’. ‘The courier contacted us immediately after he had explained to the customer what had happened. He was extremely upset, particularly as he too is a dog owner,’ he said. ‘He explained that he was driving slowly, around 20mph, but the lane was dark and he didn’t see the dog.’ The firm has also offered to help with any vet bills.","Cocker spaniel Satchmo was ran over and killed by a Hermes delivery man .

"A drama teacher has been banned from teaching for life after putting an explicit short story which described a man having sex with underage girls into a 12-year-old's textbook. John Salway, 67, intentionally put the self-written fantasy story into the pupil's textbook at Mount St Mary's College in Spinkhill, Derbyshire, so she would find it, a professional conduct panel heard. The short story - which the panel heard demonstrated a 'deep-seated and harmful attitude to children' - detailed a man having sex with two 15-year-old girls. It also referred to the man having sexual activity with a 12-year-old girl. John Salway, 67, a drama teacher at Mount St Mary's College in Spinkhill, Derbyshire (pictured), wrote a graphic short story and slipped it into a 12-year-old girl's textbook . Mr Salway said he wrote the story 'as a sexual fantasy for my own private gratification' but could not explain how it ended up in the girl's book. After reading it, the Year Seven pupil became worried, distressed and uncomfortable and she showed the story to her mother and father, the panel was told. Her distraught parents complained to the school's headmaster and the teacher's career was brought to an end. Mr Salway, who taught drama between 2011 and 2014, admitted at the hearing last month that he had demonstrated unacceptable professional conduct that could bring the profession into disrepute. In a statement, he told the panel he had written the story 'as a sexual fantasy for my own private gratification' but did not explain how the story ended up in the book. Dr Robert Cawley, who chaired the panel run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said the allegations 'demonstrate a deep-seated attitude to children which could lead to harmful behaviour'. He added that it lead to a pupil being exposed to the behaviour in a harmful way. Mr Salway, who has now been banned from the classroom for life, said he wrote the story for his own gratification but could not say how the words ended up in the book . He said: 'The panel has determined that Mr Salway's actions were deliberate and there was no indication that he was acting under duress.' Dr Cawley said the teacher - who was not present at the hearing - had a previously good history and had shown remorse early on. But he said the case involved serious sexual misconduct and warranted an indefinite prohibition order. Alan Meyrick, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, said Mr Salway would be banned from the profession for life. He said: 'This case is a serious one which involves behaviours that fall considerably short of those expected by the public of a teacher. 'Mr Salway wrote a story which itself evidenced a deep-seated and harmful attitude to children. 'Furthermore, the panel found that he deliberately caused a young pupil to read this story, causing distress to her and to her parents.' Mr Salway, who was not present, was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court. Mount St Mary's College is a Roman Catholic independent boarding school which was founded in 1842.

"Privacy issues: Google's Eric Schmidt has splashed out $15m on a Manhattan penthouse that he has had soundproofed and which won't have a doorman . Billionaire Google boss Eric Schmidt is fiercely protective over his colorful and complex private life which includes a string of affairs. In the past few years and despite his . marriage to wife Wendy, Schmidt has had relationships with a series of younger . women, including a vivacious television host who dubbed him ‘Dr . Strangelove,' a leggy blonde public relations executive and a sexy . Vietnamese concert pianist. Now details have emerged that 58-year-old Schmidt has splashed out $15 million on a sprawling Manhattan penthouse in the trendy Flatiron District to be close to at least two of his female friends. Schmidt has been seeing at least two New York-based women in Lisa Shields, an executive on the Council on . Foreign Relations, and Vietnamese pianist Chau-Giang Thi Nguyen. The glamorous love-nest was featured in Oliver Stone’s ‘Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps’ movie as the crash pad for Shia LaBeouf’s character. So fiercely protective is Schmidt of his own - and his guests privacy - that he has insisted he doesn't want a doorman. ‘While . everyone in New York wants a doorman, Eric specifically said he didn’t . want one. He doesn’t want anyone to see him and his guests coming in and . out. He insisted on his own elevator,’ a source familiar with the . purchase told the New York Post. Schmidt has been seeing at least two New York-based women in Lisa Shields, left, and Vietnamese pianist Chau-Giang Thi Nguyen, right . The glamorous love-nest was featured in Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' movie as the crash pad for Shia LaBeouf's character. With money no object to the . billionaire, he has also invested in getting the 6,250-square-foot . duplex - which has four bedrooms and a large entertainment area with a . wet bar opening onto a 3,300-square-foot terrace - soundproofed to ensure complete . privacy. Meanwhile his wife Wendy, 57, remains at one of the couple’s many homes, a $23million waterfront mansion on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, where she focuses on her philanthropic work amid reports that she has accepted their ‘open marriage’. Schmidt, worth an estimated $8.2billion, is believed to have had at least one mistress sign a confidentiality agreement not to divulge any details of their relationship. Stunning TV personality Kate Bohner, aged 46, had a three-year affair with the married mogul from 2007 to 2010. ‘As far as Kate was concerned it was true love,’ her close friend Jason Parsley, a journalist, told the MailOnline. ‘She adored Eric. This wasn’t some short-term fling. This was a serious love affair that went on for three years. His wife Wendy Schmidt stays at home and concentrates on her philanthropy work. She is said to have accepted the unusual martial situation . 'The reason I am speaking out now is . that it is ironic that someone like him can be so free and easy . discussing other people’s privacy issues online while using his vast . wealth to protect his own image.’ Bohner . moved to Los Angeles to be near Schmidt, whose property empire includes . a home near Google’s Silicon Valley HQ, and a $38 million estate in . Montecito, California. Bohner . laid bare her feelings for Schmidt, whom she jokingly called ‘Dr . Strangelove,’ in an online blog: Recoverygirl007. She revealed he had . given her a prototype iPhone (late Apple boss Steve Jobs was a friend of . Schmidt’s), whisked her away for romantic getaways and lavished her . with expensive jewelery. She wrote of her pain at their breakup, saying: ‘I’ve been sleeping with my Blackberry just in case Dr Strangelove might send an email.’ At the time of the affair, Schmidt was at the height of his power. He was brought in as Google’s CEO in 2001 by creators Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who relied on his expertise to turn their modest internet search engine into a global media powerhouse. But Google has been criticized for not doing more to protect users, particularly children, against the  proliferation of porn on the web. Schmidt's glamorous new pad: Michael Douglas starred in 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' which was partly filmed in the Google CEO's new penthouse . Google, which says it has a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy on child sexual abuse content, has argued policing the billions of images, stories and data generated daily on the internet would be a Herculean task and any controls could inadvertently restrict legitimate online searches. It says parents can use Google ‘filters’ like SafeSearch to prevent children accessing pornography. ‘What I worry about is that such laws are often slippery slopes,’ Eric Schmidt told a conference in May 2012. ‘In many other countries, adult pornography legislation is an attempt to legislate something else.’ But a source who knows Schmidt well . defended him, saying: ‘Eric is integral to the success of Google and in . enabling it to become a hugely successful company that employs 35,000 . people around the world and is a service that is much-loved by its . users. He was a great CEO and very well regarded as someone with . extraordinary technical knowledge and great business acumen.’ Bohner . did not return calls or emails this week, possibly bound by her . believed confidentiality agreement, but her close friend Parsley . insisted: ‘It was a serious romance, at least as far as she was . concerned. ‘To my . knowledge he would pay for her to travel to see him. He was always . promising her he would get divorced. She cried on my shoulder countless . times. She believed wholeheartedly he was going to leave his wife for . her.’ Google CEO Eric Schmidt with his then mistress Kate Bohner at Burning Man in the Nevada Desert in 2007. She is one of a string of extra-marital affairs . Schmidt and . Bohner were photographed together at the Burning Man festival in 2007, a . gathering in the Nevada desert which showcases art and encourages . creative thinking. The . couple wore goggles and bandanas to protect themselves from sandstorms. Schmidt posed with his arm around his mistress, although he refused to . join the masses camping in the desert, preferring a five-hour round trip . to the nearest hotel. Parsley . continued: ‘They communicated a lot by phone and email when they were . not together. But it devastated Kate that he would chose to spend . holidays with his family. It was always the same, Thanksgiving, . Christmas, all the big ones. ‘I am speaking out because Kate has . been the victim of unfair comments online. In any affair, the woman . always gets the blame – “Oh, she knew he was married.” ‘Well, . in this case it’s not so cut and dried. Yes, Eric was and is married. But he needs to look at himself long and hard and start living a . truthful life. Eric wants to have his cake and eat it too. He has had . numerous affairs and everybody knows it.’ Like Bohner, Schmidt’s other reported girlfriends have been glamorous, successful women of a certain age. There . was Marcy Simon, a leggy blonde PR executive in her mid-40s who was . spotted with him on holiday on the French Riviera in 2006 and, according . to reports, remains close to him still. He gave her a large, . canary-yellow diamond ring. With money no object, Billionaire Schmidt has invested in getting the 6,250-square-foot duplex soundproofed to ensure complete privacy . TV presenter Kate Bohner, left, and PR woman Marcy Simon, right, were both lovers of Eric Schmidt . Website Gawker.com reported on their split in December 2007, and also alleged that the couple rekindled their relationship in 2009,  when they were reportedly spotted together at the Aspen Ideas Conference in Colorado and in California. Schmidt was also linked to Lisa Shields a 47-year-old divorced single mother who worked as a producer for America’s top-rated breakfast show Good Morning America. According to the New York Post, in 2011 Schmidt took her on holidays aboard his $72.3million superyacht Oasis to the Caribbean and the South of France. They were spotted dining out in the millionaire’s playground of Southampton in upstate New York, and according to the New York Post were ‘also spending time at a summer rental in the Hamptons’. A source told the Post at the time: ‘She has been telling friends they are dating and they have been going out openly in New York and the Hamptons as a couple.’ Shields now works as a publicist for the Council On Foreign Relations in New York, and speaking from her weekend home in the Hamptons did not deny her reported relationship with Eric Schmidt, but added: ‘I never comment on my personal life.’ Eric Schmidt has been criticised because of his 'free and easy' approach to others' privacy while using his vast wealth to protect his own . Schmidt’s most recent affair, according to the New York Post (which has taken particular delight in his extramarital interests) was with sultry Vietnamese concert pianist Chau-Giang Nguyen, with whom he has been spotted dining at upscale New York restaurants. A source said: ‘He has been very supportive of her music career. Eric is getting increasingly interested in the arts.’ Nguyen, who declined to comment on their relationship, was previously engaged to Hollywood producer Brian Grazer. Wendy Schmidt failed to respond to requests from the MailOnline for comment about her marriage. She met her husband at Berkeley University in the late 1970s and they married in 1980. They have two grown-up daughters, Sophie and Alison, who remain close to their father. In her only comments on the  subject, Wendy told the New York Times: ‘Some couples are very much in each others’ space. In our case, we are both busy. I think it’s nonsense and, between us, if we know what is going on in our lives and we are happy, that kind of stuff is part of his being in the public eye.’ She added she would tire of ‘following’ her husband around the globe: ‘I would feel like a piece of luggage, and he wouldn’t want me  to feel that way.’ When asked about his open marriage Mr Schmidt told The New York Times : ‘I don’t think that is an appropriate question. We don’t comment on that, rumors.’ Schmidt hit back at critics of Google who argue the company should be more concerned about protecting people’s privacy, saying: ‘If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.’ It is, perhaps, advice he would be wise to heed himself.","The billionaire Google boss has spent millions on a sprawling New York penthouse to be close to several of his female friends .

"An Indonesian housemaid who murdered a four-month-old baby by bashing its head on a wooden table has had her death penalty upheld and her final appeal rejected. The defendant, named only as S.T., was accused of killing the child, Malak, out of jealousy of her Filipino nanny last year. Home security cameras captured the chilling moment the maid took the child out of its crib before returning its battered body four minutes later. An Indonesian housemaid who murdered a four-month-old baby by bashing its head on a wooden table has had her death penalty reinstated by a court in Abu Dhabi . It is believed that the baby's head was bashed against a table at the family home in Abu Dhabi, reports Gulf News. It was said she carried out the extraordinary attack on Malak - whose name means 'angel' - to get at her colleague, according to The National. The child's nanny, a Filipino woman, was in the shower at the time and came back to the sight of the injured baby struggling to breathe. She was rushed to the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital in the city, where doctors diagnosed her with a fractured skull and severe brain damage. She died on April 28 2013 - two weeks after the attack. In an attempt to frame her, the maid initially blamed Malak's nanny for the death - but admitted her guilt when she was presented with video footage of her actions. Prosecutors said that she resented her colleague because it was her job to care for Malak and her brother, while the convicted woman had to care for a sick grandmother. The defendant had already been sentenced to death after being found guilty at the Criminal Court of First Instance. The defendant, named only as S.T., was accused of killing the child, Malak, out of jealousy for her Filipina nanny last year . But The Appeals Court then announced that it was cancelling the Criminal Court's verdict of the death sentence because it was invalid as S.T.'s defence was not serious enough. Defendants facing life in jail or the death penalty are entitled to a lawyer appointed by the court. The court is then responsible for monitoring the appointed lawyer's performance to see if they attend hearings, follow the case and present a 'serious defence'. The Appeals Court said that the defence attorney representing S.T. in the Criminal Court of first instance was not serious in presenting the defence and therefore the verdict that sentenced her to death was invalid. However, that verdict was upheld by the first Appeals Court to look at S.T.'s case, before being cessated, bounced back to the Appeals Court, and upheld for a second time. Since the baby's family has insisted on the death penalty, the court sentenced her to death again. The verdict is to be carried out in the presence of the child's family and in a method chosen by the President of the UAE. All death sentences in the UAE are subject to two rounds of appeals, and if these both  fail the common method of execution is firing squad.","Defendant, named only as S.T., has now lost two appeals against sentence .

"A family of five squatters and their pet dog moved into a luxury $1million home and even organised a party for their neighbors before they were removed, court documents have revealed. Convicted con artist James Crombie, 47, his wife and their three young children allegedly moved all of their belongings into the four-bedroom house in Bethesda, Maryland, and stayed there for three days. It was not until the home's real owners showed and called the police that members of the community realized something was wrong. Squatters: A family of five moved into this vacant $1million property in Bethesda, Maryland, for three days, authorities have said . Luxurioys: The property has been on the market for over a year and includes four bedrooms . James Crombie, 47, a convicted con artist is believed to have moved into the home with his wife, their three young children and a dog. He now faces a long list of criminal charges and up to 30 years in prison . Officers then arrived and told the family that they had one day to move out after Crombie failed to provide proof he had legitimately purchased the property. The vacant home had been on the market for a year and has two full marble bathrooms and nanny quarters on the main level. The listing posted by an estate agent says it is fitted with a gourmet kitchen and has a garden patio 'perfect for entertaining'. Court documents said that the family badly damaged some of the rooms during their stay. Stains on the carpets, broken locks and soiled furniture has resulted in a repair bill of $1,000. The family are also believed to have moved some of the home's items into a wooden shed in the garden. Neighbor Patricia Medeiros told WJLA: 'It was shocking. I can't imagine how you would think you could get away with something like that. Not to mention the ethical issues involved with moving into someone else's home. Charles Hill added that the lock on the house had been drilled and the family had gone around houses in the neighborhood introducing themselves. They even set up 'entertainment' for the community.

"A banner demanding that New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio apologise to police in the city flew over the city on New Year's Eve. The banner read 'De Blasio, apologize to the NYPD!!' and was flown up and down the Hudson river on Wednesday afternoon. The message for the mayor was ordered by the son of a NYPD police officer, who said he wanted to embarrass de Blasio. Message: A banner from the son of a reading 'de Blasio, apologize to the NYPD' was flown over Hudson River on New Years Eve . Bad run: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has been heavily criticised by the NYPD over his comments following the death of Eric Garner . Michael Sheehan, 49, a retired Westchester County correction officer whose father was a Bronx NYPD detective told the New York Daily News he paid $1,000 for the 90-minute flight. The banner comes just days after another reading 'De Blasio, our backs have turned to you' was flown over New York City. It is not yet known who ordered the first banner as the advertising agency who organised it said the buyer wanted to remain anonymous. Many NYPD cops are furious with the mayor for his sympathy toward protesters who rallied against alleged police brutality when a grand jury failed to indict an officer for the chokehold death of Eric Garner. De Blasio's remarks, including a statement that he had talked to his biracial son about the possibility he could be stopped by the NYPD, seemed to confirm long-held NYPD suspicions that he held anti-cop views. Michael Sheehan, 49, a retired Westchester County correction officer whose father was a Bronx NYPD detective paid $1,000 for the 90-minute flight . Dozens of cops - from the NYPD and around the country, turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for slain Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend . Harsh words: This banner was seen flying across New York City last Friday . During a speech where he called for peaceful protests following the death of Eric Garner, de Blasio said: . 'Chirlane and I have had to talk to Dante for years about the dangers that he may face – good young man, law abiding young man, never would think to do anything wrong, and yet because of the history that still hangs over us, the dangers he may face. 'We’ve had to literally train him, as families have all over this city for decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him.' When two officers were gunned down on December 20 by a fanatic who claimed he was retaliating for Garner's death, the head of the largest NYPD union, Patrick Lynch, declared that de Blasio has 'blood on his hands.' NYPD cops turned their backs on the mayor when he visited the slain cops' families at the hospital. Then, at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos last weekend, dozens of officers were pictured refusing to face de Blasio when he took the podium. Then, at NYPD academy graduation on Monday, the mayor was met by scattered boos and was heckled while he spoke. Yesterday, it was revealed that de Blasio's lobbyists called top political allies and asked them to publicly slam the NYPD unions and cops for turning their backs on the New York mayor at a funeral for a slain officer, it has been revealed. City Hall tensions with the NYPD took a dramatic turn for the worse after the murders of NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos . DNA Info quoted two lawmakers who received calls from the de Blasio's aides asking them to speak out against the NYPD for its protest. 'City Hall wanted me to blast the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association for turning their backs on him,' one politician told the news site. 'They called up Monday, said they were calling all of us, and that it was our obligation to stand up defending the mayor.' The angry lawmaker said the request, made to both state legislators from New York City and city council members, was 'not really appropriate.' Another politician confirmed he got a call, as well, according to DNA Info. A City Hall spokesman tried to cast the calls to legislators in a different light - saying the mayor's aide were simply asking for 'statements of support' for the families of two slain NYPD officers.","Banner demanding Bill de Blasio apologise to the NYPD flown over NY .

"They were born within moments of one another and they died only two hours apart. Twin sisters Mary Dickson and Martha Dixon from Granite City, Illinois, passed away last week on Christmas day at the age of 90, having lived in the same home together for the duration of their lives. Both sisters were said to 'depend on one another' and were married, incidentally, to men who were brothers - both of whom had died before them, reports Fox's KTVI. Together until the end: Twin sisters  Martha Dixon (left) and Mary Dickson (right) from Granite City, Illinois, passed away last week on Christmas day at the age of 90 . Mary and Martha's cause of death has not been disclosed. One of the twins' granddaughters Amy Deconci said: 'It’s like one had to take the steps to pass and help the other get through that. 'Having them [pass away] together was peaceful but we were broken-hearted at the same time.'

Martha was described as a 'homemaker', while Mary worked at the credit department of a clothing store for 18 years before she retired. They married brothers Thomas E.

"If you've ever woken up full of regret about the messages you sent the night before, or you've sent a text to the wrong person, a new app could solve your woes. Called Strings, the free app lets you remotely remove all traces of your drunken ramblings or inappropriate comments before the recipient ever gets the chance to see them. The string of messages is 'immediately and permanently' deleted from everybody's phone, and it is impossible to download or save messages from the app. Strings is a new mobile messaging app that lets users share what they want  - and take it back. It lets users remotely remove all trace of their messages, and texts are 'immediately and permanently' deleted from everybody's phone. It is also impossible to download or save messages from the app . The only drawback is that the app requires everyone who is texting to have it installed. Unlike other similar apps, such as Cluster, it doesn't allow anyone to download the messages to a private folder once they've been sent. Strings claims that all content is deleted from every users' phone and from Strings servers. Users can also see when a message has, or has not, been read. The process has been dubbed 'untexting.' 'We think the time for Strings is now,' said Seattle-based Edward Balassanian, founder of Be Labs which created the app. Strings claims content is deleted from every users' phone and from its own servers. The free app is currently available from the iOS App Store. The only drawback is that it requires everyone involved to have it installed . 'With the privacy issues plaguing existing messaging apps, email, and texting, it's time we had a messaging app that gives us complete control of our conversations.' The app starts with letting users select who to start conversations with. Users can add or remove people, allowing them to change who sees their content. Each 'string' is a unique conversation, making it possible to have multiple conversations with the same people about different topics. Users always maintain the ability to delete a string of conversation at any time. Once deleted, the string and all its associated content is removed from every users' phone. The app (left) starts with letting users select who to start conversations with. Users can then add or remove people allowing them to change who sees their content. Strings can be deleted at the press of a button (right) Users always maintain the ability to delete a string of conversation at any time, explained the developers. Once deleted, the string and all its associated content is removed from every users' phone . Strings is currently available for free from the iOS App Store. An updated version is due to be released in mid-January. There is no word on when an Android version will be released. It follows the launch of a similar app, dubbed Ansa, which also allows people to delete messages sent to a person's device remotely. 'With Ansa you can go 'off the record', and have full conversations that automatically disappear; send self-destructing photos and videos that only last for seconds; and take back the messages you already shared using synced deletion,' explained the developers. Videos and photos only appear when a user clicks 'Tap to view', and once viewed are only be visible for 60 seconds before being deleted from both users' phones. In February last year, Facebook bought messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat. At the start of April, Vine revealed its 'Vine Messages' service that enabled users to send messages to each other. This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo's attempts to get back into the game with Blab. Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client. Facebook announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself. It then announced Snapchat rival Slingshot in June. Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a direct messaging service last December, and later announced Bolt - designed to be another rival to Snapchat - in July. In May, Snapchat released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger.

"A woman left almost bald by an impulsive disorder compelling her to tear her hair out, has finally got a full head of locks after undergoing cosmetic treatment. Cheryl Mitchell has suffered with trichotillomania (TTM) since she was five-years-old, but has faced a 13 year battle with doctors to receive a diagnosis and then get treatment. The 33-year-old from Rhyl, North Wales, finally recognised her own symptoms after reading a magazine article about the rare condition when she was 20 years old. The mother-of-five is now celebrating after receiving her first full head of hair in almost 30 years after undergoing therapy that involved stitching extensions into a mesh barrier that is fixed to her scalp. Transformation: Cheryl Mitchell was left almost bald, pictured right, by an impulsive disorder that compelled her to tear her hair out. The 33-year-old has finally got a full head of locks, pictured left, after undergoing cosmetic treatment. She said: 'It feels really strange having long hair because for so many years I only had patches of hair or nothing at all. Mrs Mitchell had to pay the £800 for the treatment herself because it is deemed a 'cosmetic procedure.' 'It was really strange because I'd wake up with bald patches on my head - I didn't have a clue what had happened,' she said. 'I visited doctors on a regular basis and I started seeing psychiatrists when I was around 11-years-old but they didn't seem to know what the problem was. 'I found myself wanting to pull my hair out and I couldn't stop myself - it gradually got worse and worse as I got older. 'It seems really strange but it's not much different from people biting their nails or anything like that. 'It was really difficult for me because people would stare and make jokes about me having no hair - it was very upsetting. Before: Mrs Mitchell said she could not stop herself pulling her hair out and it got worse the older she got . 'I suffered a lot of abuse as well which was so hard to take - people said I would pull my hair out just to get attention which was really cruel. 'I also lost my father when I was 14-years-old so I had a pretty traumatic childhood which didn't help. 'To be given a full head of hair for the first time after almost 30 years of having the condition is a huge relief. 'Even though I'm still getting used to it, I feel much more confident since I had the therapy.' It is not known what causes TTM but it usually starts in teenagers, more often girls, at the age of 11 to 13. Mrs Mitchell first noticed the problem when she was five-years-old but over time she found the urge to tear out her hair grew. Mrs Mitchell, pictured with her husband Graham, underwent treatment at The Hair Confidante in London on December 3 . She was often left in agony and was tormented throughout her time at school due to the affects of the condition. But the former care home nurse received the treatment at The Hair Confidante in London on December 3. She is now adjusting to life with her new hair and admits her husband, Graham, 45, and children, Alex, 11, Adam, 12, Sam, nine, Claire, eight and Holly, seven have been thrilled to see their mum's new locks. She said: 'It feels really strange having long hair because for so many years I only had patches of hair or nothing at all. 'It's grown around an inch-and-a-half since I had the procedure last month so I have to get it adjusted every three or four weeks. 'I've set up a Facebook group to help people with the condition. 'Hopefully it will help to raise awareness and make people feel more comfortable with talking about it.' Trichtillomania is a condition where sufferers are compelled to tear their hair out. It is common in teenagers and young adults, affects up to four in every 100 people. They can pull hair from their head, as well as other places including their eyebrowns and eyelashes. Trichtillomania is an impulse-control disorder - a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action. Sufferers experience an intense urge to pull their hair out, and growing tension until they do. Once they've pulled their hair out, they are overcome by a sense of relief. The condition, which leaves sufferers with bald patches, can invoke negative feelings, including guilt. People feel embarrassed and ashamed, and may try to deny it and cover it up. Experts do not know what causes the compulsion, but some believe it is a form of addiction. Others think it is a reflection of a mental health problem, with psychological and behaviourial theories suggesting it is a means of relieving stress and anxiety. In some cases experts believe the condition amounts to self-harm, deliberate injury to achieve temporary relief from emotional distress. Recognised treatments for the condition include psychotherapy, allowing patients to talk about the emotional problems underlying their compulsion. Cognitive behaviourial therapy may be recommended, helping a person manage their problems by changing how they think and act.

"A Thomson flight hit by a 22-hour delay from Cancun, Mexico, to Gatwick, saw passengers celebrating the New Year on the beach instead of in the air. The flight was due to depart from Cancun at 4.10pm local time on New Year's Eve and fly overnight to arrive in London at 7.05 am on New Year's Day. But instead, passengers spent New Year's Eve in a hotel on Mexico's Caribbean coast, after problems with the scheduling of cabin staff for the plane, apparently being delayed in Sweden, meant the aircraft was left sitting on the runway. Scroll down for video . The Maloney family were able to see in the New Year on the beach in Cancun rather than in mid-air after a flight delay saw them spend an extra day in Mexico . The Maloneys were handed a special bonus with a New Year's Eve night at the Riu Caribe resort . The Maloney family, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, was among the passengers who were shuttled to the plush Riu Caribe beach resort, rated as 4T+ by the holiday company. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, father Chris Maloney, who had spent two weeks in the the five-star star all-inclusive Grand Bahía Príncipe Akumal, said: 'When we came down for breakfast on the day of departure, our tour guide came over and told us that the flight had been delayed. 'When she said by 22 hours I thought she was joking at first; but in the end it meant we got an extra day of holiday. The family were treated to live dolphin shows at their hotel, and were able to sneak in an extra performance . With an extra day of holiday handed to them, the Maloneys begin to set up their beach spot . 'I'm not totally sure what the problem was; we were told the staff had been held up in Sweden, but it was crazy as the plane was just sitting there with nowhere to go. 'We were taken off to another hotel in Cancun, and the extra day we spent by the swimming pool, exploring Cancun, and getting some last-minute sun - the temperature was around 30 degrees.' Incredibly, last year on their trip to annual Christmas trip to Mexico, the Maloneys, father Chris, mother Jo and sons Chris and Tom, were delayed 24 hours at Gatwick due to flood problems. Their desperation to make it to the airport had seen the family of four take a taxi all the way from their home in Hatfield to Gatwick - a 70-mile journey and a £150 fare to boot. Chris added: 'Last year was the full 24-hour, full-day delay, so I suppose this time we're two hours better off! It wasn't a bad way to spend New Year's Eve as the Maloneys got the chance to sun themselves on the beach . It's not a bad thing when a flight delay means an extra day's stay in Cancun, Mexico . 'It's some contrast though; from travelling in a taxi to the airport to be told the flight is delayed last year and put up in an airport hotel, to getting an extra day in the Mexican sun this year. 'We really love this part of Mexico, I would highly recommend a family holiday here, so getting an extra day, despite the flight delay, isn't all bad. The family's flight out of Cancun was yesterday (Thursday) at 4.10pm local time, landing back in the UK at 7.27am this morning. MailOnline Travel have contacted Thomson for comment regarding the delayed flight, and are awaiting a response. A spokesperson for Thomson told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson Airways would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers travelling on flight TOM049 from Cancun, Mexico to London Gatwick Airport. 'The aircraft operating this flight was delayed on another route and as a result the flight had to be delayed further, due to mandatory crew rest restrictions. 'Thomson provided customers with overnight accommodation and meals in a hotel in Cancun. All customers are now back in the UK after the aircraft landed at London Gatwick airport at 07.27 today (Friday). 'We would like to reassure customers that delays of this length are extremely rare.'","The Maloneys, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, delayed due to staffing issues .

"A Miami mother is accused of beating her 8-year-old son with a rope and killing the family’s English bulldog puppy by repeatedly slamming him on the floor in front of her children. Charlotte Wonjah, 26, remained in jail Friday after a New Year's Day court appearance on child abuse and cruelty to animals charges. Police say she admitted to ‘anger issues’ and said she ‘did not want to clean after the dog’ after the puppy went to the bathroom on the floor. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Charlotte Wonjah, 26, pictured left in her booking photo and right with her infant daughter, has been charged with child abuse and cruelty to animal . Confession: Wonjah, a Miami performer, admitted to ‘anger issues’ and said she killed the family dog in front of her children because she did not want to clean up after him . Domestic call: Police responded to the family's home in Miami after getting a call from Wonjah's boyfriend of seven years about a domestic altercation . Vicious attack: Wonjah reportedly became upset that the family's 1-month-old pet English bulldog went to the bathroom in the corner and slammed him to the floor . The mother, a club performer from Miami, is accused of beating her 8-year-old son, whose body had bruises and welts in different stages of healing. Wonjah was booked into jail Tuesday after police say she attacked her boyfriend of seven years, Juan Suarez, when he returned home with gifts for their children from his mother. She faces two counts of misdemeanor battery for that episode. Speaking to CBS Miami, Juan Suarez said that he called police Tuesday when his girlfriend attacked his 14-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. Suarez said Wonjah 'went ballistic' and started hitting, punching and biting him for no apparent reason. When his daughter tried to intervene, Wonjah allegedly turned on the teen, hitting her in the face and throwing her against a wall. When officers responded to the family's home at 360 Northwest 58th Avenue, they discovered that Wonjah and Suarez's 8-year-old son had been physically abused as well. Violent: Wonjah was booked into jail Tuesday after police say she attacked her boyfriend . Mother-to-be: The 26-year-old is four months pregnant with her third child, a boy . Jailbird: Wonjah has a criminal record that includes two arrests on battery charges in 2013 . The woman's boyfriend said the boy told him that Wonjah repeatedly struck him with a hangar and a rope in the bathroom. Officers investigating the domestic incident also learned that Wonjah had killed the family's 1-month-old English bulldog puppy by repeatedly slamming the helpless animal against the ground. Suarez said when the puppy got up and tried to walk, the enraged woman slammed his head against the floor until he stopped moving. ‘She has some serious issues to get rid of,’ said Suarez. ‘She needs some help and some counseling and to stay away from kids until she get better or she is going to hurt them.’ Suarez revealed that the 26-year-old is four months pregnant with their second child together, a son. Wonjah, a native of Liberia, had two prior arrests for battery charges dating from April 2013 and August 2013. On his way out: Wonjah's boyfriend made it clear that he plans to leave the woman and raise the children on his own . Juan Suarez said Wonjah attacked him in August 2013 and has just completed probation this past summer. Wonjah is a Miami musician and certified nursing assistant. Her Facebook page is filled with racy photos from her past performances in clubs and professional modeling shots depicting the 26-year-old posing provocatively in skimpy outfits. The boyfriend said he had stayed with Wonjah all these years for the sake of their children, but now he wants to raise them on his own.

"From public urination to streaking and night-time fistfights, Paul Ghysels has seen it all while living in a house sandwiched between two UC Berkeley fraternities. Ghysels, 61, a Vietnam War veteran and retired Chicago firefighter, purchased more than $60,000 worth of surveillance equipment in hopes of warding off his neighbors’ bad behavior, but to no avail. ‘I have video of them throwing 1.75-liter glass bottles of vodka off their tower, at the front door of our house,’ he said. Scroll down for video . Neighbors from hell: Paul Ghysels, 61, a retired firefighter and Vietnam vet, has been locked in a battle with several fraternities in Berkeley, which he says had turned his life into  his life a living nightmare . Too close for comfort: Ghysels' home on Durant Avenue (left) is located next door to the Chi Phi fraternity . For years, Mr Ghysels has been fighting a war of attrition against inconsiderate college students living on the edge of Berkeley's infamous Frat Row. Ghysels moved from Chicago to Berkeley in 1988 and settled in his wife's old family home on Durant Avenue that once belonged to her grandmother. At first, the couple and their young neighbors got along fine. 'We were invited to the fraternities for their Monday night lobster and steak dinners, and I did many things for the fraternities,' the retired firefighter told ABC's 20/20 in an episode that airs tonight at 10pm. But with the advent of cell phones and social media, things quickly spiraled out of control in the neighborhood jam-packed with fraternities and sororities, which were now drawing hundreds of people to their parties every weekend. Anyone familiar with the plot of the 2014 comedy Neighbors starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron can guess what happened when, much like Rogen's character in the movie, Mr Ghysels started complaining about the loud noise and inappropriate conduct of rowdy college kids. In the flesh: Surveillance cameras installed by Ghysels on his property captured two young men running naked down the street from one of the frat houses nearby . Bottoms up: Another recording shows a young woman coming out of a frat house without underwear. The image on the right shows her bending down to pick up her keys . Fisticuffs: Besides their naked antics, frat boys sometimes come to blows outside Ghysels' home . Caught with his pants down: The homeowner has complained about his neighbors' lewd behavior, but to no avail . Alcohol-fueled antics: This video shows what appears to be a vodka bottle flying through the air before landing on Ghysels' property . In a case of life imitating art, the fraternities declared war of Ghysels and his family. According to the 61-year-old homeowner, students would break into his house, throw up and defecate on the edge of his property and even leave death threats on his voicemail. Even local police could do nothing to stop the fraternities from throwing wild parties lasting into the wee hours of the morning. 'We’re under siege and we’re not getting really any help from the university or the authorities,’ Ghysels said. Ghysels has been documenting his neighbors' antics with surveillance cameras installed all over his property. His extensive collection includes videos of young men and women running naked down the street and relieving themselves in public, groups of drunken college kids brawling outside his house and liquor bottles flying over the fence. Life imitating art: Paul Ghysels' tale reads like the screenplay of the 2014 comedy Neighbors starring Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron (pictured) At war: Like in the movie, things took a bad turn for Ghysels after he started complaining about the frat boys' behavior . In an interview with Inside Edition last year, Ghysels said the makers of Neighbors went on a site called ucberkeleyfrats.com, where he has been posting his surveillance videos, to get ideas for some of the debauchery scenes in the raunchy flick. Ghysels’ attorney Yolanda Huang told ABC that the Berkeley Police Department receives on average 400 calls a year about frat houses, but no one is ever arrested. The law enforcement agency released a statement to the news station saying that it takes 'all crimes seriously' and 'tries to address community concerns regarding noise complaints, loud parties and alcohol issues.' Officials with UC Berkeley said they work with Greek organizations affiliated with the university on 'safety, wellness and risk management.' If a fraternity is found to be in violation of university policies, it can be stripped of its affiliation to UC Berkeley. Ghysels, however, insists that police and UC Berkeley are not doing enough to address the problem, which is why in 2010 he filed a lawsuit naming dozens of defendants, among them 34 fraternities. The retiree's original suit was dismisses in 2014 but he appealed the decision and refiled the suit. Ghysels and his wife, Kate, moved out of the house on Frat Row in 2010, but the former firefighter who is currently battling cancer hopes that one day his spouse will be able to return to her family home in the 2700 block of Durant Avenue. ‘I’m strong enough to continue this, and to keep it going until we have a resolution,’ he said. ‘My friends say that it’s probably because of this that I’m still alive.’","Paul Ghysels, 61, a retired firefighter  from Chicago, filed a lawsuit naming 34 Berkeley fraternities .

"Outrage has been sparked in India after men playing the roles of terrorists in security drills were dressed as Muslims and shouted pro-Islamic slogans. A video of a drill, which was broadcast on Indian media websites, shows five policemen capturing and then pinning down three men in white knitted skullcaps before bundling them into jeeps in the Surat district of Gujarat. The drills are being carried out across Gujarat following intelligence reports that two high-profile events - Pravasi Bharatiya Divas and the Vibrant Gujarat Investors Summit - could be a the target of terror attacks. Stereotype: Policemen posing as terrorists were told to wear skullcaps during an anti-terror drill in Surat . Speakers at the summit this month will include U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as well as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 'Mock drills were carried out in 10 to 15 locations,' Deputy Superintendent of Police, Pradeep Sejul told television network NDTV. 'This should not have happened; it was an avoidable mistake. 'We assure you that if someone deliberately made the mistake, we will take action against them.' Kamal Faruqui of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board called the mock drill 'atrocious and highly condemnable'. 'It is profiling the Muslim community which is very bad. They should apologise, otherwise they should be taken to the court,' Faruqui told NDTV. Preparations: The exercise was ahead of a summit due to be attended by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (pictured) Police initially tried to brush off the criticism, saying the skullcaps were used 'to give them a different look', but later apologised. Videos of two more exercises show mock terrorists shouting pro-Islamic slogans, according to NDTV. In one filmed in the Narmada district, terrorists shout: 'Kill us if you want. Islam Zindabad (long live Islam).' Modi, who is leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, was chief minister of Gujarat during an outbreak of communal violence in 2002 which killed more than 1,000 people. Most of the victims were Muslims. Concerns about religious intolerance in secular India have grown since Modi came to power in May, fuelled by reports of Muslims and Christians being forced or induced to become Hindus in mass conversions.","Drills have been described as 'atrocious and highly condemnable'

"A mother has claimed that staff at a Logan's Roadhouse kicked her out of a wedding reception meal for breastfeeding her baby daughter. Patricia Varner was at a party in the McDonough, Georgia, outlet of the eatery when she stopped to feed her nine-week-old child - and was allegedly hounded out of the restaurant. According to Varner, first a waitress then a manager started haranguing her to stop after she sat down in a secluded booth and fed the baby girl underneath a blanket. Complaint: Patricia Varner says she was thrown out of the Logan's Roadhouse in McDonough, Georgia . Baby: Her daughter, whose name Varner did not give, was allegedly being fed discreetly when management intervened . She told local news station KCTV that staff told her she had to go because other customers were complaining. The mother told her she was rushed out the door into the rain before she could get her husband the baby's car seat or even a coach to her, and was followed around the restaurant by a manager when she refused. She said: 'I had no car seat, no coat for her or anything, and he insisted that I leave his restaurant. And I said, I refuse. He just continued to go on until I went to go find my husband.' Family: Varner said they were kicked out of the restaurant before her husband Devon, left, could reach them . According to a scathing review of the restaurant Varner posted on Facebook, there were plenty of free places for other customers when she was asked to leave, and felt 'disrespected' as a result of her treatment. Varner wrote: 'There were 8 other empty booths and 3 empty tables that my husband counted. However, I was asked to stop nursing and get up from the booth. '...We were there with a large party after a wedding and it ruined the whole occasion! I have never in my life been so disrespected while nursing my children. 'We will never eat at any Logan's Roadhouse again and I will tell our story every chance we get.' However, a spokesman for Logan's Roadhouse said that Varner's story is untrue and that the restaurant did its best to make her comfortable. Location: A spokesman for the restaurant disputed Varner's version of events, but would not expand on what did happen. Pictured above is the branch in question, in McDonough, Georgia . A statement said: 'When we learned about Ms. Varner’s complaint, we immediately looked into it, and interviewed team members in the restaurant. 'We have not found any evidence that she was treated unfairly. In fact, we believe that efforts were made to accommodate her.' The statement continues to explain that the restaurant complies with all state laws on breastfeeding. This includes a section of the Georgia code which calls breastfeeding 'an important and basic act of nurture'. The legislation adds that a woman is allowed to breastfeed a child anywhere she is ordinarily allowed to be. Logan's Roadhouse has yet to respond to specific questions from DailyMail.com about the incident.","Patricia Varner says she was thrown out of eatery in McDonough, Georgia .

"It is not the most conventional way of breaking up protests, but Sam the skateboarding dog certainly seems to be effective. Ukrainian police have found a secret weapon to battle demonstrations in the city of Odessa, in the form of a skateboarding British Bulldog. The performing pup has already managed to work his magic on one group, when demonstrators descended on City Hall in Duma Square, in the south-western Ukrainian city. Sam the skateboarding dog caused a stir when he ploughed into crowds in Duma Square, Odessa . The British Bulldog proved a hit with the crowds as he performed tricks no his board . The angry mob had gathered to protest against corruption in particular with relation to building permits being handed out allegedly for bribes with the angry mob waving placards and chanting. With only three officers on security outside, it looks as if things were about to get out of hand when the mob started gathering at the door to the building and looked as if they wanted to get inside. But the anger turned to amusement and laughter and the mob faded away when skateboarder Sam swept into the square, and started nipping through the masses on his skateboard. The dog even managed to break up the protest as demonstrators started to laugh at his pranks . Ukrainian police could certainly use the dog as an unusual method of crowd control during protests . Instantly the crowd focused attention on the dog who performed some impressive steering manoeuvres and was even able to turn the skateboard back onto its wheels every time it turned over when hitting someone. Eyewitness Anatoly Hlushko, 25, said: 'He was hilarious and impossible to ignore, he seemed very excited about the action and was smashing the skateboard left and right and running into everyone. 'It was also panting like a steam engine and suddenly people who seemed to focus on the building were grabbing their mobile phones to film the hilarious dog.' One person is heard on one of the videos asking if the animal was a police dog, with another woman confirming: 'He must be. Look at the way he is rounding everybody up.' Sam is apparently a well-known sight in the city and favourite for his clever tricks . Eventually though Sam, who is well known at least in Odessa for his skateboarding stunts at a local skate park, had enough and skateboarded off into the distance without stopping. His owner was not in sight and it's suspected that the dog had run off from the local park with his skateboard after being attracted by the noise and excitement at the nearby Square. Afterwards, he apparently decided to return back to his owner.","Sam the British Bulldog was a hit when he turned up to a demonstration .

"Mahmoud Hussein has been left fighting for his life in hospital after a vicious thug attack near his home . A Palestinian refugee who fled the violence of the West Bank for a new life in Britain has been left fighting for his life after a vicious brick attack near his home. Mahmoud Hussein, 46, had left his flat in Stechford, Birmingham, to make a trip to a nearby chemists to pick up a prescription when he was brutally assaulted outside shops. The father-of-five, who got a job at Land Rover after moving to the UK eight years ago, suffered a head injury, fractured jaw, a fracture above his right eye and a serious injury to his knee. He had to undergo brain surgery and has been in a coma since the attack two weeks ago while his distraught wife, Eman Tahaineh, 38, keeps a bedside vigil at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. She said: 'It's very difficult, I'm counting the hours and minutes until he wakes up.' The couple, who have been married for 15 years, have four children - the oldest is their 14-year-old son Anas, followed by their only daughter Roua, 11, then Malik, seven and Muhammed, four, and the couple's youngest child is baby Ibrahim, who is just nine-months-old. Police are yet to make any arrests over the attack on the maths graduate, who had previously reported concerns over anti-social behaviour, including drug taking, near his home. Mr Hussein's brother-in-law, Nadel Arif, 48, said he had no enemies and was a hard-working father. 'He spent most of his time teaching his children, teaching them mathematics, he's got hundreds of notebooks,' he said. 'He told me his children are the most valuable thing he had and he was every day concerned about them. The children ask every day about him and we have said ""he's just a little bit sick"". 'His 14-year-old is still unaware about what could happen. He tells his mother, ""I don't like you to see me crying"".' Mr Arif said his sister  is afraid for the future and suspects a group of men seen taking drugs at the block where the family lives were behind the attack on December 20. He told how Mr Hussein had reported problems to the police numerous times over the past last three years, but he said there were never any arrests. Mr Hussein, pictured before the attack, has previously reported anti-social behaviour relating to drug taking at the block of flats he shares with his wife and five children in Birmingham . The junction between Church Lane and Stud Lane in Birmingham where Mr Hussein was attacked with a brick . 'I know my brother-in-law, he is a peaceful man. From his house to his work he has no enemies at all,' he said. 'I've reported to the police there are no enemies, only one enemy.' Officers have said it could be one person behind the attack and  are keen to speak to a man, white and aged in his 20s, who was wearing a blue coat. Mr Hussein has been married for 15 years and has four young sons and a daughter . Detective Inspector Nick Dale, based in Chelmsley Wood, said: 'The level of violence shocked not only the family but officers dealing with it. 'We suspect that members of the community will know who committed this offence. 'If that's the case then it's likely people are keeping that information and keeping the individual away from police attention. 'This is an appeal that anybody with any information about who has done this and where they are, comes forward and speaks to police about it. 'We don't know what the motivation for it is, it seems to be an assault that came out of the blue.' DI Dale added: 'We are aware of concerns raised by residents of anti-social behaviour with youths gathering at the block of flats, causing a nuisance and taking drugs. 'These concerns were being looked at by the local neighbourhood team which is working with residents to resolve the issue. 'Our records show there have been eight calls made to us by Mr Hussein since 2012 relating to concerns of drug taking at the flats. 'The serious assault on Mr Hussein was not near his home address but some distance away whilst he was on a shopping trip; there is nothing to suggest the anti-social behaviour is linked to the assault though clearly it does form part of our enquiries.' Mr Hussein remains in a critical care unit, where his condition is stable and police are keen to speak to anyone with information - call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Mahmoud Hussein was walking to chemists near his home in Birmingham .

"The Health Service cannot be treated like an open all hours Tesco store, doctors warned yesterday. They claimed plans for seven-day services were wasteful and could even threaten patient safety. Outpatient clinics and routine operations on Saturdays and Sundays would lead to similar services being cancelled in the week, according to the British Medical Association. It says the strategy is wholly unrealistic because it will intensify demand without providing any extra cash to meet it. GPs fear that opening surgeries on Saturday and Sunday without extra resources will not work, file photo . Dr Mark Porter of the BMA said this move would require services scaled back at other times . Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA’s council, said: ‘The BMA has been clear in its support for better seven-day services, but the Government needs to be clear about what an expansion of services will look like and, crucially, how it can be safely staffed and resourced, without existing services being scaled back. Doctors already work around the clock, 24/7, so the existing [salary] contract is not a roadblock to seven-day services.’ The BMA makes its opposition clear in evidence given to a review of doctors’ pay in the event of a seven-day NHS. ‘There have been suggestions likening providing NHS services over seven days to Tesco supermarkets opening seven days a week; these take no account of the challenges faced by the NHS in implementing seven-day services,’ it says. ‘Indeed even supermarkets do not operate at full capacity or offer a full suite of service throughout the day, seven days a week.’ Offering a full range of NHS services at weekends is ‘neither desirable nor feasible’ and the costs of implementation would outweigh the benefits. The BMA says it is important to tackle the ‘weekend effect’ whereby death rates go up in hospital on Saturdays and Sundays. But it says this should not mean having to fund extra services just because it is more convenient to patients. Sir Bruce Keogh, pictured, NHS England's medical director is committed to a seven-day GP service . Making a consultant work weekends would entail finding a replacement during the week to avoid putting patients at risk, the GMC says. ‘We believe that pursuing an ill-informed seven-day service model would be at best wasteful for the NHS and at worst threaten patient safety,’ adds the BMA submission published yesterday. NHS England has pledged to start offering a wide range of services on all seven days of the week to improve the care patients receive at weekends, and also to better fit in with patients’ working lives. When he made the commitment in 2013, Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England’s medical director, said the dramatic expansion would cover much more than simply emergency care, which is already close to a 24/7 service in many places. ‘It is also about access to doctors, diagnostics and elective operations so people do not have to miss work to get healthcare,’ said Sir Bruce. ‘If someone needs a day-case operation, why can’t they have that on Saturday, recover on Sunday and be back to work on Monday?’ The professor wants hospitals to have access to X-rays, ultrasound scans and emergency general surgeries at weekends and believes mental health and community care services also need to be available 24/7 if the expanded role is to work. NHS England said 2015 would see ‘significant progress’ toward the goal of a seven-day service. The Department of Health said: ‘Patients expect to receive the same standard of care regardless of the day of the week. A seven-day NHS service will speed up diagnosis and discharge times as well as reducing the amount of time patients need to spend in hospitals at weekends.’","The British Medical Association is opposed to a seven-day GP service .

A 7-year-old girl walked away from the crash with only minor injuries . Today a rescuer revealed how the bloody and barefoot girl seven-year-old knocked on his door to beg for help after crawling free from a Kentucky plane crash. Larry Wilkins, 71, told NBC News in a phone interview late Friday night that the 'brave' 7-year-old came knocking on his door after emerging from the plane wreckage at 6:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET).

A spokesman for the family, Kent Plotner, issued a statement Saturday afternoon that read: 'The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sienna Wilder. 'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.' Sgt. Dean Patterson of the Kentucky State Police says the FAA received a distress call at 5.55pm from a private plane in the area around the time the girl reported the crash to a resident .

"They are billed as the country’s most popular tunes but it seems that even the best offerings from today’s pop stars can’t compete with the hits of yesteryear. It has been revealed that Radio 1’s chart show, which counts down the 40 top selling tracks in the UK, attracts 700,000 fewer listeners a week than Radio 2’ s Pick of the Pops. The Official Top 40 show records 1.3million listeners every Sunday. Its presenter Jameela Jamil has just stepped down after two years fronting the programme to be replaced by 1Xtra host Clara Amfo. Scroll down for video . Radio 1's official chart presented by Jameela Jamil, pictured right, attracts 700,000 few viewers than Radio 2's Pick of the Pops hosted by Tony Blackburn, pictured left . In comparison, Pick of the Pops, presented by Tony Blackburn on Thursdays and Saturdays, attracts an average audience of 2.1million for each episode. Blackburn, who turns 72 this month, was famously the first presenter on-air on Radio 1 when the station launched in 1967. He took over the show from Dale Winton in 2010, it has also previously been presented by Alan Freeman. It sees Blackburn revisit charts from previous years, counting down the most popular song from each vintage. For example, Thursday’s episode looked at 1965, 1976, and 1987 and included hits from The Hollies, Abba and the Pet Shop Boys. And, in this afternoon’s edition, Blackburn will turn his attention to 1956 and 1980, which songs from Pat Boone, Elvis Presley, Frankie Laine, The Jam, Blondie and Sheena Easton all set to appear. The programme first appeared in 1955 and has been on and off the airwaves at various times since, moving between Radio 1 and Capital before landing on Radio 2, where it has been since 1997. Pick of the Pops used to play contemporary music, playing everything in the top 20 and new entries out of the tracks ranked 21 to 30. It was not until the 1980s that vintage music began to be included. For many years, the Radio 1 chart was the only way to hear the big sellers of the week, prompting many people to tape the entire run-down. Tony Blackburn pictured in the BBC studios in 1981 when he was a presenter on Radio 1 . However, although modern audiences can now find the tracks on YouTube or streaming services such as Spotify whenever they want. These new audience figures, which come from radio data compiled by audience research body Rajar, show younger listeners have not entirely lost their appetite for chart hits. The Vodafone Big Top 40, which is broadcast on the Capital network at the same time the BBC broadcasts the Official Singles Chart each Sunday, has a weekly audience of 2.6 million. This chart is based on official iTunes download figures. As of July 2014, the official chart on Radio1 included streaming in the calculation of where different tracks placed, to better reflect how people are consuming music.","Radio 1's chart show with Jameela Jamil attracts 1.3 million listeners .

"As any expectant mother will tell you, when you've got to go, you've got to go. Fortunately for six months pregnant Karen Gunner, when nature called she was in a fast food restaurant. So while her partner and their friends queued to order and pay for their food, she nipped to the loo. But that was when disaster struck. For Miss Gunner found herself barred from the Burger King toilets – because she didn't have a receipt for a meal. Karen Gunner, who is six months pregnant, with partner Dan Weston, was barred from a Burger King toilet . She tried pleading with staff, explaining that she was heavily pregnant, but they remained unmoved. Eventually, with the situation becoming pressing, she had to leave the restaurant and head somewhere else. Last night Miss Gunner said she had found the whole situation embarrassing and accused Burger King of 'disgraceful behaviour'. The company has now apologised. The incident took place at the same Burger King branch in North Road, Brighton, where in March last year another pregnant woman left in tears after being told she would have to pay £1 to use the toilets. In Miss Gunner's case, her partner Dan Weston and their friends were queuing to order while she rushed to the washrooms. But a member of staff said she would not be allowed in until she could show a proof of payment from the tills. Miss Gunner was refused entry to the Burger King toilet in North Street, Brighton (pictured) The 31-year-old said the decision to prevent her using the toilet was 'absolutely disgraceful behaviour' Miss Gunner said: 'I was furious. I pointed out that my friends were in the queue and that I was clearly heavily pregnant, asking for a little leniency, but again I was refused. 'It's quite obvious I'm pregnant and I specifically pointed it out to them. But she just said, 'Sorry, that's our policy'. As I was unable to use the toilet we had to leave before my partner ordered our lunch. 'I was left feeling extremely embarrassed at being turned away from using the toilet. I found this to be absolutely disgraceful behaviour. 'I tried to speak to the member of staff serving my friend and they still said there was nothing they could do. The whole thing just felt so silly. They could see we were waiting. While I understand people do come in to use facilities only, my partner could clearly be seen ordering.' A Burger King spokesman said: 'I would like to assure you that all pregnant women, whether they are customers or not, are allowed to use our washrooms at all times. 'It appears that one of the temporary Christmas staff was not informed about the policy. I have phoned the restaurant manager and discussed this unacceptable situation with him. He has assured me he will speak to all his staff to reiterate the company policy on this matter.' She said: 'It's quite obvious I'm pregnant' but was denied entry to the toilet because it was company policy .","Karen Gunner, 31, was told she could not use the toilets in Burger King .

"Barack Obama shows absolutely no mercy to his enemies when it comes to war - as long as they are flies. This photograph shows the President using a magazine to swat a pesky fly in the Oval Office as his aides laugh around him. The photo of Obama as Lord of the Flies was released as part of an inside look at a year in the life of the President of the United States. Wham, bam, thank you maam: Aides laugh as the President swats a fly that was invading his space in the Oval Office at the White House . However, this is not the first time the President has been caught on camera battling pesky airborne pests. In January 2013 President Obama was visibly bothered when a fly landed between his eyes during a speech in the State Dining Room of the White House. Four years earlier, in 2009, the President famously killed a fly during an interview with CNBC at the White House. 'Get out of here,' Obama said as the fly buzzed him during his interview. The pest persisted, and when it landed on his left forearm, Obama smacked it. 'Now, where were we?' the president said without missing a beat. The photograph of Obama's battle with the fly in 2014 is part of the White House's annual picture roundup.

One snap depicts the cheerful hug between Obama and Dallas nurse Nina Pham after she was declared Ebola-free. Another shows the President holding a basketball while talking to a group of mentees who had participated in a session in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. As the meeting was coming to a close one of the participants challenged the President to a game of HORSE on the basketball court on the South Lawn. In addition to the shooting competition, the President also used the opportunity to further talk to the young men about life lessons, not basketball.

"New Year axe murder victim Tanis Bhandari was killed after a trivial argument over a cigarette, it was claimed yesterday. The 27-year-old plasterer was described as a ‘peaceful’ former member of the Royal Navy who doted on his younger siblings. More than 100 of his friends and family gathered yesterday outside the village pub where he died in a horrific axe attack an hour into the new year. Scroll down for video . Tanis Bhandari, 27, was killed in an axe and knife attack outside a quiet village pub on New Year's Eve . A spokesman for the pub said it was saddened by the unprovoked attack on a group of 'lovely' people. Above, mourners gather outside the Kings Arms . Dozens of bunches of flowers were left on the tiny green by the Kings Arms in sleepy Tamerton Foliot on the edge of Plymouth, Devon. Many mourners – including a woman believed to be the victim’s mother, Andrea Sharpe – wore shirts bearing the logo of his favourite football club, Liverpool. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of murder, though neither has been charged. It was today claimed the attack came about when one of the suspects asked a female friend of Mr Bhandari's for a cigarette. When she said no, Mr Bhandari, a builder, stood in front of her to protect her from harm, a source told MailOnline. It was then he was attacked with a knife and axe-like weapon, the source added. Devon and Cornwall Police would not confirm the altercation had begun over a cigarette, but said Mr Bhandari was the victim of an unprovoked attack. 'The evidence gathered so far points to this being an indiscriminate attack on a group of innocent young men, resulting in a tragic outcome,' Detective Superintendent Jim Colwell, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said today. 'I understand and appreciate how this attack has come as a shock to many, especially the residents of Tamerton Foliot. 'I would like to reassure you that we are doing everything we can and want to highlight that we currently have two suspects in custody. 'Interviews with them are continuing and at this stage, it is my belief that no other suspects remain at large.'

More than 100 people gathered at around 10.30am yesterday to lay flowers outside the pub in the historic village, which is popular with walkers. Liverpool football tops and scarves were tied to trees nearby. Friends and colleagues paid tribute to Mr Bhandari on Twitter and Facebook. Andy Nicholls wrote: ‘Gutted to hear that the victim of the unprovoked NYE attack in Plymouth was a former Navy shipmate. RIP Tanis “Bandi” Bhandari. Sleep well.’ Bouncer Andy Dymond-Park said he was working in the pub and saw the attack happen. He wrote on Facebook: ‘Horrendous events to witness last night and absolutely terrifying. My heart goes out to the victims and their friends and family at this sad start to the new year after what was such a good night. Bit shaken up by it all but I’m fine, feel terrible for everyone involved. It has just hit hard. Could have been anyone involved.’ A spokesman for the Kings Arms, where the 27-year-old had been celebrating with friends on New Year's Eve before his death, said the men were 'lovely' people. 'On New Year’s Eve a terrible attack was made on a lovely group of people on the way home from a great night in our pub. 'It was an unprovoked violent attack with a tragic consequences. That I feel devastated is an absolute understatement. 'I wish all the families of those involved my deepest deepest sympathy, not that this will help them in any way now but, I wish I could turn back the clock so that these events would not occur.' Mourners today paid tribute to the man described as 'kind' and 'peaceful'. One friend, who declined to be named, said: 'He was very peaceful and a very relaxed guy. 'I would say hello to him every morning when I saw him. He would often care for his younger twin siblings.' Others shared their grief on Facebook. 'Can’t believe it, I grew up in the same village as Tanis, he’s always been a kind lad, you will truly be missed bud, my thoughts are with his family and may whoever done this get what he deserves,' said Lee Ryder while Colleen Finn added: 'We've lost our jester, I feel ripped to pieces.'

"A humanitarian worker on holiday in New York was charged $165 (£106.60) by a pedicab driver for a journey of just 0.8 miles in Midtown on New Year's Eve. Haiti-based Red Cross employee Ken Smith, 41, was in New York with his wife Peothong and daughter Samantha, who both took the pricey ride with him from Herald Square to the Rockefeller Center. The Wisconsin native, who has travelled throughout Asia and Africa, said the driver charged per passenger, which is illegal, and covered a sign with prices printed on it with his foot. Haiti-based humanitarian worker Ken Smith was charged $165 (£106.60) for a journey of 0.8 miles in New York . The visitor told the New York Post that he could have taken a helicopter ride for the price charged by the driver of the bicycle-powered vehicle. He said: 'I felt like I was robbed. 'We saw and know most of the scams all over the planet, and, sadly, we're victims to one in our own country.' One of more than 800 rickshaw-like pedicabs in New York City negotiates traffic on a busy street . Mr Smith reported the incident to the non-emergency 311 line. While this ripoff was significant, Mr Smith and his family are not the first to be scammed by a New York pedicab rider. In June 2013 a Japanese couple was reportedly charged $720 for ride from Midtown to Greenwich Village which took 20 minutes. The rider used the Square mobile card-reading app to take the fare. With tourist scams becoming a major issue in New York a new law was passed in 2013 in an attempt to regulate fares. Pedicabs must display their per-minute rate on their vehicle after laws were changed in 2013 . The new rules state pedicabs can only charge a per-minute rate rather than a fee based on distance or the number of passengers. The driver can charge whatever they like as long as it is posted on their vehicle in 28-point font. There are more than 800 pedicabs operating in New York, concentrated mostly around major tourist attractions such as Central Park and Times Square.","Ken Smith, 41, was charged $165 (£106.60) for a journey of 0.8 miles .

"A 33-year-old man has spent five years and $100,000 in an effort to look like his hero - teenaged pop idol Justin Bieber, whose attraction hasn't waned for him since the star's recent arrest. Toby Sheldon is a songwriter from Los Angeles who has used Bieber's youthful features as the inspiration for numerous surgeries, including face fillers, a chin reduction and eyelid surgery.

Sheldon had already spent $8,000 on hair transplants to supplement his thinning blond locks, but he wasn't happy with the results. He took a picture of Bieber to his plastic surgeon to demonstrate exactly how he wanted his hair to look. 'It took three transplants and a total of $21,000 to accurately lower my hair line, close off my temples and grow back my bangs,' he says. Once he had perfected his Bieber-style hair, Sheldon, who admits to a phobia of aging, decided he wasn't finished. Grown man: Despite the 14-year age difference, Sheldon wants to look like Justin Bieber . Teen idol: 33-year-old Toby Sheldon wants his face to resemble Justin Bieber's . 'By using Justin’s charming baby face as my . inspiration, I’ve been able to restructure my entire look to maintain a . much more youthful appearance through plastic surgery.' Sheldon says he admires Bieber for his youthful good looks, if not his musical output. 'I . didn’t necessarily listen to his music or fawn over him as a celebrity, . but his face was just so flawless every change I made was modeled after . him.' In this quest, Sheldon has remodeled his features so that he bears little resemblance to the fair-haired, pleasant-featured man he was before his surgeries. After his successful hair refurbishment, Sheldon had his face and lips plumped up with filler to look more youthful. Five years: Before his surgical procedures began five years ago (left) and now more recently (right) Next, he had Botox and Aquamid injections in his forehead and temples. In 2012, he spent $4,850 on eye surgery to lift his upper eyelids. 'But . it took going to eight different surgeons before anyone would agree to . operate on me as everyone thought I was crazy to be obsessing over such a . tiny detail,' he says. His most recent procedure, a three-part . smile surgery, has literally turned his frown upside down in an effort . to emulate his 19-year-old idol’s boyish smile. Popular in South Korea, smile surgery has doubled in the U.S. in the past year. 'When I first sought out to look like Justin I only paid attention to . specific aspects of his boyish look like his hair and the structure of . his face,' says Sheldon. Original look: Sheldon's attempts to thicken his hair led to a full-blown surgery addiction . Resemblance? Toby Sheldon acknowledges that he needs a few more procedures before he'll be considered Bieber's 'doppelganger' 'But the more I started studying Justin . and young people in general it’s really their smile that gives them . their youthful glow. If you look closely, you’ll notice that . when younger people just barely have their mouths open they naturally . show their top teeth, giving them a sort of natural and effortless . smile.' For $30,000 Sheldon's Beverly Hills plastic surgeon . lifted his upper lip, turned out his bottom lip and turned up the . corners of his mouth to give him a 'perma-smile.' He also had . liposuction on his chin to smooth out his smile and had the fat from his . chin transferred to his hands, lips and under his eyes. Even after a total of $100,000 worth of plastic surgery to look like his baby-faced idol, Toby says he still hasn’t achieved his dream look. 'I know there is more work to be done in order to make a full transformation into Justin Bieber’s doppelganger like a nose job and jaw reduction, which my surgeon has suggested.' Sheldon proudly relates a story about being turned away from a liquor store recently because the staff didn't believe he is 33. Although Sheldon's similarity to his teen idol isn't immediately obvious even after spending $100,000 worth of surgical procedures, he says he does get mistaken for Bieber. ''I can definitely look back and say all those surgeries were really successful,' he says. ''Between our similar hairstyles, baby faced smile and overall youthful appearance I finally look like Justin Bieber and I couldn’t be happier about it,' he says.","LA man Toby Sheldon says Justin Bieber is his inspiration .

"Security experts recently revealed a massive security flaw that could let hackers listen in on private calls and read text messages on mobile networks. One way in which such hackers - as well as some intelligence agencies - get access to such information is by using International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, or 'stingrays'. These controversial tracking devices trick mobiles into connecting with them, and now developers have created an app that claims to detect such gadgets, and warn users if their data is at risk. An app called SnoopSnitch (homescreen pictured left) claims to detect IMSI catchers (right) - eavesdropping devices used for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking the movement of smartphone users - and warn smartphone users if their devices are giving up their personal information and connecting to them . Called SnoopSnitch, the app scans for signals that indicate a switch from a legitimate tower to a 'stingray', where information may be being collected. IMSI catchers - eavesdropping devices used for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking the movement of smartphone users - are controversial because they act like ‘fake’ mobile towers. IMSI catchers are known as 'stingrays' and are eavesdropping devices for intercepting mobile phone traffic and tracking the movement of mobile phone users. A 'fake' mobile tower acts between the target smartphone and service provider's real towers. In this way, it is considered a 'man-in-the-middle attack' and can be detected by the app. Catchers work by exploiting a security hole. The GSM specification - the default global standard for mobile communications - requires a smartphone to authenticate to the network, but doesn't require the network to make itself known to the handset. The IMSI catcher masquerades as a base station and logs IMSI numbers of all the mobile stations in the area, as they attempt to attach to the IMSI-catcher. It forces mobile phones connecting to it to use no call encryption, or to use breakable encryption, making call data easy to intercept and convert to audio. They sit between a real phone and telecom tower to launch a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept data. Once a phone has connected to a stingray, it makes it easy for a hacker to intercept and convert data to audio, enabling experts to listen to people's phonecalls. While experts may be using the techonology to target specific handsets of suspected criminals, it is almost impossible to avoid capturing data from other 'innocent' smartphones in the process, too. As a result, the use of stingrays has been banned in certain countries and US states such as Florida, for example. Reacting to public privacy concerns, security  researchers Alex Senier, Karsten Nohl, and Tobias Engel from SRLabs in Berlin created the SnoopSnitch Android app. They presented the findings at the Chaos Computer Congress’ annual meeting in Hamburg. The free Android app’s Google Play listing reads: ‘SnoopSnitch collects and analyses mobile radio data to make you aware of your mobile network security and to warn you about threats like fake base stations (IMSI catchers), user tracking, and SS7 attacks.’ Mr Nohl told Motherboard that the app gathers information from the stingray, which is used to analyse if one is in close proximity. It is rumoured that some law enforcement agencies across the globe and using the technology to collect information. This map produced using SnoopSnitch data so far, shows  network security in Europe. There is not enough US data collected to make a map yet . A massive security flaw that could let hackers listen in on private calls and read text messages was revealed last month. The flaw, is in a global telecom network called Signal System 7 (SS7). SS7 helps phone carriers across the world, including AT&T and Verizon, route calls and texts. Although the extent of the flaws was not revealed, it is believed hackers can locate callers anywhere in the world, listen to calls as they happen or record hundreds of encrypted calls and texts at a time for later decryption. ‘The phone receives information that's useful for the attacker, but it's also useful for the defender,’ he said. ‘There's no one set of information, taken by itself, that allows you to detect an IMSI catcher, but we do stream analysis of everything that happens on your phone, and can come out with a warning if it crosses a certain threshold.’ Crucially, the app can’t prevent a smartphone from connecting to stingrays, but lets a user known there is surveillance in a certain area. The app currently only works with rooted Android handsets that have Qualcomm chips inside, such as Sony and Samsung Galaxy models. Rooted smartphones are ones where the owner can access system files and change features that they can usually only read. But the app creators are working out how to extract information needed by the app to detect stingrays, in other ways.","SnoopSnitch app claims to detect so-called IMSI catchers or 'stingrays'

"Leslie Cropper, 37, fled after crashing his car and was discovered by police hiding in the loft where he kept his £120,000 stash of heroin and crack . A drunk drug dealer who fled after crashing his car was discovered by police hiding in the loft where he kept his £120,000 stash of heroin and crack. Leslie Cropper, 37, has been jailed for five years and four months after admitting possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply and driving over the limit. He smashed his car down an embankment in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, after a drunken argument with his partner, Leeds Crown Court heard. Cropper swiftly returned to his nearby home where he was found among £6,000 worth of crack cocaine and heroin weighing 2.389kgs with a potential street value of £112,000. A breathalyser test revealed he had 53 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, over the  limit of 35. He told police: 'I just had a barney with my missus and drove straight off there.' Neighbours had heard screaming and shouting and then saw him walk away before returning at speed in a Ford Focus from his nearby home in November this year . Prosecutor Dave Mackay said Cropper continued the row through the window of the car before he drove off - only to return once more at speed. But the drink-driver failed to negotiate a junction and crashed down an embankment. He got out of the car and went home where he was found hiding in the loft by police. Mr Mackay said officers found heroin and crack cocaine with him in the loft and more heroin in a bag in the bedroom. Around £600 in cannabis was also found which Cropper said was for his own use. He was discovered in the attic of his home in Walker Street, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, by police along with £6,000 worth of crack cocaine and heroin weighing 2.389kgs with a potential street value of £112,000 . Initially Cropper claimed to have found the drugs but he later admitted he had been approached a few months earlier by a taxi driver who offered him some work. He was paid £1,200 each time for bagging up the Class A drugs and said he did it because it was 'easy money.' Kathryn Stuckey representing Cropper said he worked as a window cleaner but was only earning around £150 a week and found it difficult to make ends meet. Judge Sally Cahill QC told him: 'It seems to me to have this amount of heroin in your possession it must have been completely clear to you the scale of the operation you had become involved in. 'This was a very large amount indeed. 'You had it to cut up and deliver it back to those who gave it to you and you were paid £1200 each time so you did it for financial gain.' He was also banned from driving for 12 months after pleading guilty to driving over the prescribed limit. He was jailed for five years and four months and banned from driving for 12 months after admitting possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply and driving over the limit at Leeds Crown Court (pictured)","Dealer Leslie Cropper, 37, has been jailed for five years and four months .

"Hackers targeting Sony computers may still have access to the company's servers. The company suffered a series of embarrassing leaks after a group of hackers calling themselves Guardians of Peace infiltrated its systems and stole huge amounts of data. But investigators still can't confirm to Sony bosses whether the hackers have been shut out of the company's systems, the Wall Street Journal reported. Scroll down for video . Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton has been trying to fix the mess over the controversial movie 'The Interview,' which has amassed $18 million since its Dec. 25 release . 'It took me 24 or 36 hours to fully understand this was not something we were going to be able to recover from in the next week or two,' CEO Michael Lynton told the newspaper. If the computer network does remain secure, with no further leaks, it is expected to be fully operational again within two months, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, the hackers have so far only released a fraction of the 100 terabytes they claim to have originally stolen. Leaks have included email exchanges between Sony executive Amy Pascal and film producer Scott Rudin in which racist jokes were made about President Barack Obama and Angelina Jolie was branded a 'minimally talented spoiled brat.' Faced with cyber attacks, Sony executives at first said they wouldn't release 'The Interview' but then decided they'd distribute it online . So far, the movie has grossed some $18 million, despite not being shown in many American cinemas . The attack, suspected to be the work of North Korea, aimed to cancel the release of comedy film 'The Interview,' which parodied the country's dictator Kim Jong-Un. The film was pulled prior to its release but this decision was reversed after the backlash. So far, 'The Interview' has grossed $18million (£11.6million), despite not being shown in many American cinemas following the threat of terrorist attacks by Guardians of Peace. With $15million (£9.7million) of its $18million earnings coming from online sales, it is Sony Pictures' highest grossing online release, helping offset its $44million (£28.6million) budget. Lynton told the Wall Street Journal that the company had to improvise majorly to get work done in the aftermath of the attacks. Executives established a phone tree to pass information from person to person. The payroll department found an old machine to cut paychecks manually. Cell phones and notepads became the norm. Meanwhile, Lynton has been seeking wider distribution for 'The Interview' in theaters and online. 'I have tried to make sure all the decision-making related to this incident comes back to me so that, as much as possible, the operating groups are not distracted from the normal business they have to do,' he told the Wall Street Journal. About $15 million of the movie's earnings come from online sales, making it Sony Pictures' highest grossing online release .","Security analysts trying to restore Sony computers say they're just not sure the hackers are completely out now .

"Inspector Ian Hanson claims police resources were so stretched that officers were not making arrests 'out of necessity' Police are choosing not to arrest drunks on Friday and Saturday nights because there are as few as four officers on duty in some city centres. A senior officer in Manchester has claimed that resources are so stretched that officers are not arresting those drunk and disorderly ‘out of necessity’, for fear that there will be no one left to police the streets if they take offenders into custody. Inspector Ian Hanson, chairman of the Greater Manchester branch of the Police Federation, said as few as four officers were on duty at some times of the night in the city centre and taking a bobby off the beat to process a drunken yob at a police station would ‘reduce the beleaguered thin blue line yet further’. His comments have been echoed by Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, who said officers across the country faced a dilemma about whether to arrest binge-drinking thugs or risk letting them loose to create further disorder because there simply ‘aren’t enough officers to go around’. The row comes after Dr Cliff Mann, the leader of Britain’s A&E doctors, said police should adopt a zero-tolerance approach to binge drinking by arresting drunks who ended up in accident and emergency. However yesterday Inspector Hanson said the plan by the president of the College of Emergency Medicine was ‘poorly thought out and not based in the reality of where our police service now finds itself’. A senior officer has claimed that police in Manchester are unable to arrest drunks on Friday and Saturday nights because there are just four officer patrolling the city centre. Pictured, New Year's Eve in the city . He added: ‘Every weekend in Greater Manchester Police we battle to keep a presence on the streets. ‘The reality behind the fact that arrests for drink-related offences have reduced is that police officers out of necessity are not making arrests. Quite where these additional detainees will be kept is quite another challenge.’ Yesterday local police and crime commissioner Tony Lloyd said: ‘It’s unrealistic to expect the police, with all the other demands it faces, to police drunkenness in any of our towns and cities.’ Recently Lincolnshire police and crime commissioner Alan Hardwick revealed that there are only 18 constables available to deploy in Lincoln on an average Saturday night. And Mr White said officers up and down the country were having to come up with ‘imaginative alternatives’ to arrest when faced with drunken behaviour at weekends while forces were at their busiest. He said: ‘I have no doubt this is something that is not particular to city centres such as Manchester, Bristol, the West Midlands or London, it’s happening across the UK.’ Dr Cliff Mann said the threat of arrest would deter people from drinking too much and reduce the pressure on medics.Police arrest a reveller on New Year's Eve in Manchester city centre . He said there were not enough officers to cope with the impact of 24-hour drinking laws introduced by Labour in the wake of police funding cuts, adding: ‘On Friday and Saturday nights you get to a crescendo of activity, typically between 1am and 2am where all resources are out. ‘You may be dealing with a complete idiot, who in the normal course of events would be arrested for public disorder. But where you are the only one left and other calls are coming in, you can’t do that.’ Northamptonshire Chief Constable Adrian Lee said: ‘When an arrest is made it can take an officer off the street for the rest of their shift. ‘The use of other powers, such as making people leave town centres who are too heavily intoxicated, ensures that we keep officers where they are most needed. ‘Arresting and prosecuting all of those who are too drunk to take care of themselves would place a huge demand on police and the criminal justice system. We respond proportionately, using the powers we have available to us.’ A woman attempts to ride a bicycle that is padlocked to a lamppost on a night out in Manchester city centre .","Inspector Ian Hanson claims police resources were so stretched that officers were not making arrests 'out of necessity'

"Forget hair of the dog and fancy hangover cures – bleary-eyed Britons turned to the simple formula of chips and Coca-Cola to help them recover from New Year Eve’s festivities. Figures show they were the most commonly ordered items from online takeaway menus on January 1. Just Eat, which represents more than 22,000 restaurants, said more than 250,000 takeaways were ordered by revellers as they sought comfort food while recuperating from the night before. Coca-Cola’s reputation as a hangover cure has seen the fizzy drink dubbed the ‘Black Doctor’ or ‘Red Ambulance’. Britons turned to the simple formula of chips and Coca-Cola to help them recover from New Year Eve's festivities . In recent months, model Kate Moss, singer Pixie Lott and actor Tom Cruise have all reportedly been seen drinking it while looking worse for wear. Fans of the drink credit its mixture of caffeine and sugar, while others claim it is the bubbles that help to settle their stomachs. Vogue magazine has described Coca-Cola as the ‘perfect sugar-to- caffeine ratio when you’re exhausted and veering dangerously towards hypoglycemia [low blood sugar levels] after a night on the fruit punch’. According to figures compiled by Just Eat for the Daily Telegraph, the most popular meal excluding Coca-Cola and chips was a margherita pizza. This was also the most commonly ordered fast food on Christmas Day. Takeaways over both days are growing in popularity with orders via the Just Eat website jumping by 50 per cent on New Year’s Day compared to the previous year. Chinese takeaways are the nation’s year-round favourite, according to figures from market research firm NPD Group. It comes as experts said champagne and sparkling wine can cause the worst hangovers. A US academic said the drink’s bubbles cause alcohol to be absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly. Boris Tabakoff, pharmacology professor at the University of Colorado, told ABC News: ‘You get a faster rate of absorption, higher blood alcohol levels – and brain levels – if you drink champagne as opposed to something non-carbonated.’","Chips and Coca-Cola were the most popular items ordered from takeaways .

"At least six ‘ghost ships’ packed with hundreds of migrants have been abandoned to their fate by traffickers in the Mediterranean during the past month, it emerged yesterday. The Italian coastguard rescued 450 migrants yesterday – many of them women and children – who were on board the Ezadeen, a 50-year-old cargo ship designed to transport cattle. It came just 48 hours after six officials were dropped on to the deck of another ship, the Blue Sky M, packed with nearly 1,000 Syrians and Kurdish migrants that had been ‘locked’ on a crash course with the Italian coast. Scroll down for video . The Italian coastguard rescued 450 migrants from the Ezadeen, pictured, which normally transports cattle . Six vessels have been abandoned by their crews over the last month leaving migrants to fend for themselves . Authorities believe the traffickers have adopted ‘a policy’ of packing old, barely seaworthy vessels with desperate migrants and leaving them to their fate by abandoning ship during the journey. The ships – with their human cargo often cramped on deck in bitter cold and with few supplies – are fixed on a ‘crash course’ with the Italian coastline, their engines locked or simply allowed to drift towards land. It is seen by the authorities in Italy as ruthlessly exploiting the cancellation of Operation Mare Nostrum, a search and rescue response to migrants, that has seen 100,000 rescued in the last year by Italian ships. Previously, smaller quicker boats that could evade patrols were used but now with the number of searches reduced, larger older ships often written off as not being seaworthy are being employed by the smugglers. The Sierra Leone-flagged, 240ft livestock carrier, Ezadeen was found drifting without power about 40 nautical miles off the southern Italian coast with 450 people on board, including several pregnant women. It had been put on a collision course for the Italian coast but ran out of fuel, officials said. ‘We know that it left from a Turkish port and was abandoned by its crew,’ coastguard spokesman Filippo Marini said. ‘When we hailed the ship to ask about its status, a migrant woman responded, saying, “We are alone and we have no one to help us”.’ For the Icelandic coastguard vessel, ICGV Tyr, which was leading the Ezadeen’s rescue, it was the fifth time it had been involved in the rescue of an abandoned vessel since it was deployed to the area at the beginning of December as part of a European replacement of Mare Nostrum. Italian coastguard officers were lifted on to the ship by helicopter and managed to pass a tow-rope to the crew of the ICGV Tyr. Engineers were also lowered by helicopter to ensure the Ezadeen was safely steered to port. When the coastguard rescued 1,000 migrants on board the Blue Sky M it was believed the crew had left the Moldovan-registered ship, but it is now thought they may have tried to slip in to Italy by pretending they were migrants. Four Syrians, aged 30-46, have been arrested after investigators intercepted Facebook and WhatsApp messages that they had allegedly used to arrange the voyage, sources told Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano. Two other alleged traffickers have also been identified but are yet to be arrested. Messages between the alleged crew dating back to December 15 show they always planned to impersonate fellow passengers before slipping away, investigators say. The migrants made the reservations on Facebook then paid the equivalent of between £3,250 and £4,500 for the trip once they had arrived in Turkey, they told authorities. The UN refugee agency says that last year 165,000 seaborne migrants had arrived in Italy by November 2014 and a further 40,000 in Greece. This compared with 60,000 for both Italy and Greece in 2013. At least 4,000 have died this year in the waters off the coast of North Africa having been placed on overcrowded boats. The war in Syria has meant the numbers fleeing for Europe have risen dramatically, overtaking the numbers of Afghans, Eritreans, Tunisians and other nationalities seeking a new start. Both boatloads abandoned to their fate this week were made up of those fleeing Syria.","Italian coastguard rescued 450 migrants on an abandoned cattle ship .

The friends - all born in 1964 and 65 - had each forked out £750 for the three-day trip. But they were left heartbroken when the travel company registered with ATOL collapsed just weeks before they were set to fly to America. Organiser Mandy Weston was left devastated when Blue Skies (UK) Ltd failed to honour their booking . Mandy, who booked the trip, had paid for flights, hotels and theatre tickets - but the company had not booked anything or paid a single penny to any firm. The group from Caerphilly, South Wales, had paid their deposit on protected Visa cards. But the majority of the holiday was paid by bank transfer after the company claimed that if they paid quickly, they would receive £70 worth of vouchers to use on the trip. It looked doomed - until a friend loaned them the cash to rebook the holiday despite it costing double the original cost. The company went under owing consumers almost £415,000 in un-booked holidays. Mandy said: 'I am seething. What breaks my heart is how they can get away with ripping off £415,000 from people. 'This was a holiday of a lifetime, but some people lost their weddings. I can't believe that suspicion wasn't raised. 'I don't think there's a hope in hell of us getting money back from the creditors. 'We had a great time in New York but it has cost a lot - in money, worry and pain.' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority - of which ATOL is a part of - said: 'We can confirm we have received a number of complaints from customers who have booked with Bright Skies Travel, which we are looking into.' A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'We are investigating a travel company based in Kent relating to a number of allegations of fraud against that company. At this stage we've made no arrests and inquiries continue.' It should be made clear that the company, though of similar name, is not connected to Blue Skies Travel in Cardiff. Although Mandy Weston's group eventually made it to New York, many other customers have been left high and dry by Blue Skies Travel (UK) Ltd . MailOnline Travel have previously tried to contact Clive Allard without success. The company's office in Kent is believed to have closed, and the website is no longer active. It's not new news concernign complaints about the company. Online review site TripAdvisor has been flooded with furious holidaymakers who have received poor treatment at the hands of Blue Skies Travel (UK) Ltd, which also shares its phone number with Bright Skies Travel and Fly Vacations. On the most recent discussion thread about the company on TripAdvisor, started on September 7 2014, there have already been 117 posts, few of them positive. Thomas D from Belfast says, ‘Do not book with this Travel Agents!!!!!! We are due to leave on Sunday 26th October and we still have no holiday booked! When querying with Clive he sent us over a confirmation of a reservation for flights. 'I spoke directly to United airlines who confirmed that infact all he did was reserve it and not paid for our flights!!! and after numerous calls and emails Clive is ignoring us and we are now getting from trading standardas [sic]' Bernadette C from Blackpool added, 'I have not received any paperwork and have left countless messages with Clive Allard and his 'team'. We have been advised by the police to take further action which is what I will be doing as Jet2.com have no record whatsoever of our flights....and I too am completing a form with the Fraud Squad immediately - Jet2.co were very interested too in wanting all his details and I will certainly not be fobbed off any further!!!!!!!' Kirb80 equally despairs, ‘Like all of the previous postings, I have tried numerous different ways to try and contact him. He is not currently answering his mobile and you cannot leave a message as it is full. Both my hotel and flight had reservation numbers but last Wednesday the flight reservation was cancelled due to Clive not paying for it.'

"A moose buried by an avalanche on an Alaska mountain had its luck changed by three men passing on snowmobiles. The three Matanuska-Susitna Borough residents were about 55 miles northeast of Anchorage when they passed a small hillside that had both ski and moose tracks. When they returned an hour later, an avalanche had covered the tracks. This moose was about to freeze to death when friends Marty Mobley, Rob Uphus and Avery Vunichich noticed its snot in the snow and dug it out . Marty Mobley says he saw something move in the debris —and was surprised when he inspected it closer alongside friends Rob Uphus and Avery Vunichich. 'It looked like a guy's arm at first because we were expecting to see a skier,' Mobley told the Alaska Dispatch News. 'But it was moaning and groaning and moving and we realized it was a moose, even though only his ears and some of its snout was sticking out of the snow. He added: 'There was just enough of its snout sticking above the snow that it could breathe.' Two of the men began digging while third stood as an avalanche lookout. 'It didn't even fight us,' Mobley told the Alaska Dispatch News. 'It was like, 'Help me. Help me.' It was totally docile and let us touch it. It just (lay) there.' Then, after 10 minutes of digging, the moose began to move. 'It stood right up and towered over us, because we were in kind of a hole from the digging,' Mobley told the Alaska Dispatch News. 'It looked like the abominable snowman because its fur was so packed with snow and it looked at us, shook the snow off it, and off it went.' The moose was at 'full steam,' he says. 'I am an animal lover, and I couldn't leave it there,' Mobley told the Alaska Dispatch News. 'Besides, we deal with a lot of avalanches and a lot of snow. That kind of karma is something we don't pass up.'","Friends out on a snowmobile ride in Alaska saw something odd in the debris after an avalanche, and were surprised to find it was a snout sticking out .

"A Christmas day flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles diverted to Albuquerque after a row escalated over a passenger singing along to Blake Shelton's hit song 'Boys 'Round Here'. A man sitting in first class on Delta flight 81 was escorted off the plane and met by police officers on landing after the pilot decided there was a security risk on board. Fellow passengers become irate when the Wichita man sang along with his headphones and complaints were passed on to the airline staff. A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger made threats . The passenger was singing along to Blake Shelton's hit song 'Boys 'Round Here' with his headphones on . After being confronted by a male passenger on board, the man, who was released without charge after the incident, told Eyewitness News: 'I asked the gentlemen, sir what am I doing wrong? Can you tell me what I'm doing to you sir? All you have to do sir is talk to me about it.' At this point, as more people began to get involved in the incident, the man became upset and started to cry before disappearing into the toilet. NBC news reported that after references to the ongoing troubles in Ferguson, Missouri, and the fact that 'the man stated he was being harassed because he was black,' the pilot took the decision to land the plane. Passenger Lauri Springer live tweeted the ordeal after the pilot said there was a 'security issue' The disruptive passenger was not charged with a crime but he was not allowed back on the plane . Passenger Lauri Springer was heading to California for a family holiday when the incident occurred . Passenger Lauri Springer tweeted the ordeal as the plane turned around and was met by police cars when it touched down in the New Mexico city last Thursday. Ms Springer said she learned there was a problem on board when the pilot informed passengers that the aircraft was turning around due to a ‘security issue’. When the plane arrived at the gate police officers boarded the aircraft and detained a disruptive passenger who was making threats, she said. The plane spent around two hours in Albuquerque before resuming its journey to Los Angeles . The University of Alabama student, who was heading to California for a  family holiday, wrote in a tweet: ‘And then everyone applauded the police officers and pilot and flight attendants for handling it so well.’ The passenger was not charged but he was not allowed back on the plane when it departed for Los Angeles around two hours later.

"Having paintballs shot at you for a living may not sound appealing. But an unusual job advert for a Human Bullet Impact Tester at UKPaintball has attracted more than 10,000 applications from around the world. The firm, which operates at 60 locations across the UK, said it had received expressions of interest for the £40,000-a-year job from as far away as India, the United States, Canada and Croatia. Right on target: The unusual job advert has attracted more than 10,000 applications from across the world . Candidates' comments included: 'I'm a rugby player... so I know physical pain. I can also break watermelon with my head. 'I always dreamed of being face-covered by paint while screaming so I think I can be the perfect tester.' Another hopeful candidate said he was fat - so easier to aim at. Justin Toohig, owner of UKPaintball.co.uk, said: 'This incredible response is the last thing we expected when we posted the advert. Vacancy: UKPaintball, which is no longer accepting applications, posted this notice on their website .

"A devoted couple who met on the day World War II broke out and vowed never to be parted, have died within days of each other. In a story worthy of a tear jerking Hollywood script Aquilla Brant, 100, passed away just 12 days after 96-year-old Catherine, his wife of 72-years. The inseparable couple, who were both suffering from pneumonia, will now be cremated together. Their daughter, Sue Brant, 68, revealed that the doting pair, who met in 1939, had a pact not to be parted. Devoted: Aquilla Brant, 100, and wife, Catherine, 96, died within 12 days of each other fulfilling their pact never to be parted . 'Dad used to say 'when mum goes I'll go a fortnight later' and he died 12 days after her,' said the mother-of-two. 'Mum died first and it was very sudden. They were both frail but were very lucid until the end. 'It's a nice end that they have gone together.' Mr Brant, whose first name is Latin for eagle, was in the St John Ambulance and was called to train others in lifesaving skills at the outbreak of World War II. Lovebirds: Aquilla Brant, pictured left in his army days in Germandy in 1946, met his wife Catherine, pictured left aged 21 years, on the day World War II broke out . Happy family: The couple went on to have three children (pictured left to right) Susan, Carl and Hazel . The retired electrician was training a group of 12 men at a fever hospital in Dalton, West Yorks., when he met his wife, who was working as a nurse. The couple fell for each other after Mr Brant was told to seek out the young nurse to help him find tea and sugar. The romantics married on April 8, 1942 at Almondbury Church before spending a few days on honeymoon in Ilkley, West Yorks. By the time of his wedding Mr Brant had been called up into the Army while his wife continued working as a nurse. When he was demobbed in 1946 he started work at a chemical plant, he later moved to work for many years at a power station, where he was a maintenance electrician. Catherine worked as a nurse until she left to bring up her family. Speaking on their 72nd wedding anniversary in April last year, Mr Brant said: 'Yes, it was love at first sight. Aquilla and Catherine Brant, pictured left, on their wedding day at Almondbury Church in April 1942. The couple, pictured right on holiday in France, celebrated their 72nd wedding anniversary last year . 'We just love each other. Of course we've had our ups and downs like everybody else and someone once asked me how we'd stayed together so long. 'I told them it was two little words. Yes, dear.' He added that they rarely had a cross word and if they did they always sorted it out. The aged couple, of Huddersfield, West Yorks., shared a double room at Pilling House residential home in Skelmanthorpe. Their daughter said: 'It was December 16 and it was Dad's 100th birthday so we were going to have a party. I got a call saying Mum was ill. 'She had pneumonia and died at 4am the next morning. It was a tremendous shock. 'Dad was admitted to Barnsley General Hospital 24 hours later and he had pneumonia but also had a heart attack.' Mr Brant stayed in the hospital over the Christmas period and died peacefully on December 29 with family at his bedside. 'Dad was devastated when Mum died and he took it really hard,' said their daughter. 'He knew he didn't want to continue without her. 'It has been quite a difficult time but we know it was what they wanted. It's is nice that they can now have their funeral together.' The couple went on to have three children Carl, Susan and Hazel, two grandchildren John and Amanda and four great-grandchildren Tom, Sam, Alexandra and William. The funeral is at St John's Church, Lepton, on January 8 at 12.15pm, followed by cremation. The family are making donations to the Forget me Not Children's Hospice.","Aquilla and Catherine Brant met in 1939 when the war broke out .

"Peter Greste's family are holding their breath for Egypt's president to deport the jailed Australian journalist after a court ordered a retrial. An Egyptian court has ordered Greste and his two colleagues, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, be retried after more than a year in jail. Greste's family is hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt. Greste's brother Andrew says the retrial presents a window of opportunity because Peter has become an accused, rather than a convicted, person. Scroll down for video. Retrial: Egyptian Baher Mohamed (left), Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy (centre) and Australian journalist Peter Greste (right) pictured at an earlier hearing . Mike (left) and Andrew (right) Greste, brothers of Australian journalist Peter Greste, speak to media during a press conference in Brisbane . 'Hope': Mohamed Fahmy (left), Peter Greste (centre) and Baher Mohamed (right) will face a retrial . ""It really opens up this option under the presidential decree,"" he said. ""Now that Peter is essentially an innocent man, he's not convicted anymore, it does allow for some room to move and for him (al-Sisi) to step in ... and deport them."" Peter Greste's lawyer has applied to the Egyptian attorney-general for deportation. The retrial effectively means the original legal proceedings now count for nothing, international law expert Don Rothwell says. ""The ordering of a fresh trial is a real vindication, I think, for Greste, his legal team and others who have been pointing out the irregularities in the case,"" he said. ""It's reflective of a decision by the Egyptian legal system that they recognise there were flaws with the first trial."" Greste's brothers Mike (left) and Andrew (right) are hopeful Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will honour a decree he issued in November which gives him the power to repatriate foreign prisoners detained in Egypt . 'Disappointed': Marwa Omara, the fianceé of Mohamed Fahmy, outside the Egyptian court (left), while Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (right) says the court's decision was some cause for optimism . Andrew Greste said it was not clear how long the process would take. ""We've got to be hopeful. It's a new decree and there's very little understood about it, there's very little regulation, there's no precedent. We are in uncharted waters,"" he said. ""I'd like to think the decree was enacted to be used. We are going to test it out."" If deportation is unsuccessful, the family will apply for bail at the retrial. Mike Greste said the past 12 months of fighting for his brother's freedom had been full of confusion and ""trying to come to terms with a system we are totally unfamiliar with and having to take one day at a time"". Their parents, Juris and Lois Greste, have been in Egypt for a month and are allowed to visit their son every 15 days but have not had a chance yet to talk to him about the latest events.

Imprisonment: Presiding Judge Mohamed Nagy Shehata handing down the sentences to the journalists last year . Lois Greste said they were initially dismayed the court did not throw out the original conviction, but ""despite some of our disappointments, I think overall it's been a good outcome today."" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop agreed the court's decision was some cause for optimism. ""He's back in the position of an accused person awaiting a trial rather than a convicted person facing seven years in jail,"" she told ABC television on Friday.

"A judge has ruled that the original owners of a three-pound chihuahua which ran away should get the dog back following a three-year legal battle with the couple who took it in. Lucy was reunited with the Blanton family after an Easley, South Carolina, magistrate court ruled that the pet was theirs under state property law. The family claimed they were on vacation in 2012 when the dog got loose and ended up at the home of Easley City Councilman Dave Watson and his wife Trisha. They took the animal in and named it Gracie. Case: A chihuahua called Lucy has been at the center of a three-year legal battle in South Carolina. Last week she was returned to her original owners . First family: The Blantons, who now have their beloved pet back following the ruling by a judge in Easley, claimed that she got loose and ran away during a vacation in 2012 . The pair said they made every effort to contact the owner but when they found no leads, they decided to keep it. Five months later, the Blantons found Lucy and then took the Watsons to court. After five hearings, a judge has decided it should return to its first home. The Watsons said they were 'shocked' by the decision and have now filed a motion to reconsider in a bid to get the dog, which they believe is theirs, back. A devastated Trisha Watson told Fox Carolina: 'When you're our age and you have a dog, for some reason, it's more than an animal ... it becomes part of your family.' The Blantons on the other hand have said they are relieved their dog is home. Speaking to the station, Kerri Blanton said: 'It's very emotional, it's been a long fight. The fight for the dog became heated at times.' Initially the Watsons decided to give the dog back, but they changed their minds after the Blantons refused to pay the veterinary bills. The judge ruled that in order for the dog to return to the Blantons, they would have to pay $496 for the costs incurred. But the Watsons insist that is a fraction of the money spent on the chihuahua in the time she was in their care and believed the figure is closer to $3,000. They have now started a GoFundMe page in a bid to raise funds to cover the costs. They also said they chose to fight for Lucy following allegations the Blanton family mistreated her. The page says: 'I (Trisha) found this shivering 3 pound little Chi, without a collar, in a chair on our front porch. I had to wrap her up - she was wet, cold, and also in HEAT! New home: The dog turned up on the porch at the home of Councilman Dave Watson (pictured) and his wife Trisha. They claim Lucy was shivering when she arrived, even though it was warm outdoors . Hunt: They took the animal to the vet and then tried to track down the owner, but they decided to keep the dog when their search did not create any promising leads . 'I called a groomer I know (at home) that Sunday and asked him what to do. I did everything he said. We put up signs including at the neighborhood store and asking people we knew in the neighborhood if they knew who she belonged to. 'Dave took her to our vet as a stray and had him check for a microchip - no chip. But when the vet did blood work on her, we found out she had liver damage. 'To date, we have spent $ 3000 getting her healthly. She has to have Hepatic food and medicine everyday. 'We have had to house train her as well as train her to walk on a lease (with a harness). She would not walk through a door when she first came in May 2012.' The Watsons have also filed a motion to reconsider with the courts, hoping they might get Lucy back in the future. Despite the allegations, the Blantons say the dog has fitted in at home again. Father Keith told the station: 'She was very excited to see all the kids. Just snuggling and sitting and sleeping, but she's doing real good.' Funds: The Watsons set up a GoFundMe page in a bid to cover Lucy's medical bills which they say were $3,000 . Allegations: On their page, they posted a text message that accused the first family of mistreating the dog .","Dog was reunited with the Blantons following South Carolina court ruling .

"A drunk driver who killed a young woman in a head-on crash while checking his mobile phone has been jailed for six years. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titley’s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitor’s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was ‘nothing she could have done to avoid the collision’, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: ‘Craig Eccleston-Todd’s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titley’s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of her Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . ‘Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. ‘She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. ‘Miss Titley’s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.’ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titley’s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabulary’s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.' ‘Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel’s family have lost her for ever. I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they’re on the road. This case highlights just how tragic the consequences of committing these offences can be.’ Eccleston-Todd, of Newport, Isle of Wight, was also disqualified from driving for eight years after which he will have to complete an extended re-test.","Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, had drunk at least three pints before driving car .

"Can I get a witness? Slobodan Milosevic during his trial at the Hague in 2004. A key witness against him wants to sue over her protection arrangements . A key witness in the trial of Slobodan Milosevic wants to sue the Metropolitan Police after its witness protection scheme left her living a miserable double life. The  former lawyer in Serbia, who now works in Marks & Spencer in a northern English town, says her entire former life was erased and she was left living in a council house on benefits. A decade after testifying against Milosevic, she she wants to sell her old flat in Belgrade and use the money to sue the Met and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. But to do that she must first re-establish her former identity as a key aide to Serbian warlord Arkan, which she abandoned after an attempt on her life in 2003 following her testimony against Milosevic. She told The Times: 'I'm not thinking about the risk because I would like to speak clear and loud; victims and witnesses should be protected. Anonymity makes me the criminal, not them.' Known as witness B129 during the trial against Milosevic for war crimes, her testimony gave evidence of the links between the him and Arkan - aka Zeljko Raznatovic - leader of the brutal militia known as Arkan's Tigers. That irregular unit cut a bloody swathe through the Balkans during the ethnic tensions of the Nineties and is said to have been deeply involved in the ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims during the violent break up of Yugoslavia. Although B129's identity was obscured at the trial, a court technician mistakenly released a recording of her real voice which led to an attempt to run her over as she walked the streets of Belgrade. After that, according to The Times, B129 and her husbnand were placed on a witness protection scheme organised by the ICTY and managed by the Metropolitan place. Their former identities were erased and they were housed on a council estate in the north of England and given £100 a week benefits to live on. All their previous qualifications went too. 'My husband had to take his driving test again, I could not practise,' B129 told The Times. 'I am still trying to finish my qualifications as a solicitor here.' The couple soon found work and have since raised a family under their new names in the UK, but even that wasn't the end of B129's involvement in attempts to bring war criminals from the former Yugoslavia to justice. She told Times reporter John Simpson that in 2010 the ICTY and the Met 'bullied' her with threats of subpoena and even possible detention to testify again, this time against two Serbian officials who were subsequently cleared. Serbian warlord Zeljko Raznatovic - aka Arkan - who the witness, known as B129 during the Milosevic trial, worked for as a key aide. She testified about the links between Milosevic and Arkan's paramilitary unit . Ethnic cleansing: Video footage submitted as evidence by prosecutors to the war crimes trial of Milosevic shows emaciated prisoners at Trnopolje camp in north west Serb-held Bosnia in the summer of 1992 . Now B129 wants recognition of the struggle she has faced in trying to help convict suspected war criminals, which has left her living on the margins of British society. She says she has been left living a double life, one in her home and a totally different one when she goes outside.  And she is disillusioned by Hollywood portrayals of U.S. programmes which give relocated witnesses a house and car. B129 was once so close to the highest echelons of Serbian society that she was a guest at Arkan's wedding to pop star and actress Svetlana Velickovic, a regional megastar. Arkan was himself indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1999 for crimes against humanity, but was assassinated before he could be brought to trial. After Yugoslavia crumbled in 1991, Arkan formed the Serb Volunteer Guard paramilitary group - also known as Arkan's Tigers. They were blamed for some of the worst atrocities of a conflict for which the term 'ethnic-cleansing' was coined. B129 refused to condemn Arkan and denied his unit had been responsible for ethnic cleansing, claiming they were a special forces unit that did not aim to attack civilians. She added: 'I'm not defending any party. War is the last and worst solution.' A team of Serbian security agents who held top positions in the regime of Slobodan Milosevic have been linked with the unsolved murder of Jill Dando. In a bizarre claim, it is said the tyrant held a grudge against the BBC presenter because she made a successful TV appeal to get help for the millions of Kosovan refugees displaced by his murderous regime. The four men accused of being involved are wanted over a string of political murders in their home country. Killed by the Serbs? BBC TV presenter Jill Dando, left, was shot dead outside her home in 1999. Barry George, right, was initially convicted of her murder but subsequently cleared on appeal . A widow of one of their alleged victims said Miss Dando's execution in April 1999 has all the hallmarks of her own husband's murder, which was two weeks earlier. Serbian historian Branka Prpa was with her husband, Slavko Curuvija when he was shot dead outside their home in Belgrade on April 11, 1999 - 15 days before Miss Dando was killed outside her home in Fulham, west London. She believes that the same people who killed her husband came to London to kill Miss Dando. Both were high-profile journalists who were returning home when they were assaulted, then shot in the head. There has been a long-running link between Serbia and Miss Dando's murder. In the immediate aftermath of the 1999 killing an anonymous caller phoned the BBC claiming he had killed the Crimewatch presenter over Nato action in the former Yugoslavia . However, senior Scotland Yard sources have said there was 'not a shred of evidence' that Miss Dando killed by Serb assassin.","Former lawyer gave evidence on links between Milosevic and Serb militias .
She was a key aide to brutal Serbian warlord Zeljko Raznatovic, aka Arkan .

"Twitter has begun rolling out a so-called ‘while you were away’ summary feature across its apps and website. The tool shows users a selection of  tweets that it considers to be important, and that the user may have missed since they last logged in. The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the site, and are similar to the 'Top stories' prioritised on Facebook. Twitter has started to roll out its ‘while you were away’ feature (example pictured), which offers some users of the social network a selection of important tweets that may have missed since they last logged in . The feature was spotted by a number of users over Christmas. It works in a similar way to Facebook’s news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order. The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the Twitter update is likely to cause similar frustrations. The site  did not reveal how it prioritises tweets, or what it considers 'important'. Twitter announced its plans to roll out features to boost engagement in November, stating at the time: ‘Every time you open the Twitter app, you’ll see something great.’ It added: ‘We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app.’ The best tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline when they open the app (pictured) or website - a new feature, which has delighted some, while annoying others who took to Twitter to complain . It works in a similar way to Facebook’s Top stories news feed feature, which ranks status updates in terms of importance, instead of in chronological order (pictured). The Facebook tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear . In November Twitter revealed its plans for the ‘while you were away’ feature. Here is what it said in a blog post: . 'Right now, what you see of the 500 million tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow, and that’s a great model for many people. 'But with that many tweets every day, there’s no way even the most avid Twitter user will find everything that’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment. 'That’s why we’re exploring ways to surface relevant tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on Twitter all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real-time nature of the platform that makes Twitter special. 'For instance, we’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to Twitter for: a snapshot of what’s happening. 'We can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. 'We’re also working on ideas such as an instant, personalised timeline for new users who don’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own.' Now, it appears that more and more users are seeing the ‘while you were away’ changes, with some noticing the new feature in early December, TechCrunch reported. It is the first major new feature rolled out by the company, based in San Francisco, California, since it launched promoted tweets and adverts, which also buck its chronological approach. Twitter declined to comment when MailOnline asked when all users will see the update, and if it will be an optional feature. The tool is designed to attract a user's attention to important tweets that can get easily lost in the rapid flow of information, especially if they follow hundreds of people, or do not check their feed very regularly. A staggering 500 million tweets are published every day. People reacted on Twitter to the change, with some pouring scorn on the new feature. One user wrote: '#Twitter new feature to tell me what happened while I was away. I was away because I didn't want to know anything', while another said: ‘Why does Twitter show me tweets from last night ""while you were away"" .. Wack.’ However, one Californian user was among many who praised the change, saying: ‘Love the 'While You Were Away' feature at Twitter. Achieves its purpose without affecting real time news feed!’ The new feature may be seen as a move by Twitter to close in on Facebook’s social media lead, which has 1.3 billion users, compared to Twitter’s 284 million. Twitter is expected to roll out another new feature called ‘instant timeline’ to reinvigorate current users and attract news ones early this year. Last year, Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app (pictured). Twitter is now releasing new features to make its offering more appealing to current and new users . In August, Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November. Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent. Snapchat's popularity is growing among 25 to 34-year-olds, and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the younger age group. The figures were taken from comScore’s  Mobile Metrix report.","The selection of missed tweets are displayed at the top of a user’s timeline .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans has been offered an unexpected route back into football by Maltese team Hibernians. The 26-year-old footballer, who had an offer to train with his former club Sheffield United retracted in November after a public outcry, has been without a club since he was jailed for rape in 2012. The Maltese Premier League club revealed last night that they had made an offer for Evans to play for the side for the next six months. Scroll down for video . Convicted rapist Ched Evans has been offered an unexpected route back into football by Maltese team Hibernians . Evans, pictured alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey, has been without a club since he was jailed for rape in 2012 . Club vice-president Stephen Vaughan said: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill. 'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close. 'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.' He added: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.' Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Mr Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.' In November, television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron of Sheffield United after Evans was invited to train with the team. Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk. The Maltese club said they had 'no problem' signing Evans and that the Wales international deserved a second chance . Scottish Championship side Hibernian moved to clarify they had not offered a deal to Evans . Sheffield United then retracted their decision, saying in a statement that the club had not anticipated the 'intensity' of the public's reaction. Tranmere Rovers, Oldham Athletic and Hartlepool United have all also rejected the opportunity to sign the Wales international. However, Malta's Hibernians, who are top of the country's domestic league and play in the town od Paola, believe there would be no such reaction in Malta. 'We have no problem with that,' Mr Farrugia said. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football. 'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.' He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.' Mr Farrugia added: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football. '(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.' Scottish Championship side Hibernian took to Twitter to ease fans' fears that they had made an offer to Evans, posting: 'Just to clarify we are #Hibs of Scotland and not #Hibernians of Malta. Should that ever change we'll let you all know. See you in the morn, HFC'. Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011.","Convicted rapist Ched Evans has been offered a contract by Maltese team .

"Nothing encourages forgiveness quite like a bouquet of flowers. And even the taxman, it seems, likes to say sorry with floral arrangements when he gets his sums mixed up. According to figures released by HM Revenues and Customs, public money was used to fund more than 100 bouquets for customers handed incorrect demands over the past five years. Scroll down for video . One recipient of a floral apology was Florence Coke (right), owner of Mama Flo's cafe (right) from Gorton, Greater Manchester, who was wrongly sent a tax bill for nearly £1billion . One recipient of a floral apology was Florence Coke, a cafe owner from Gorton, Greater Manchester, who was wrongly sent a tax bill for nearly £1billion. Officials later agreed with her that the amount was incorrect, and dispatched a revised bill of £17,000 along with a bouquet of flowers. She said: ‘I was really, really traumatised by getting that demand. It nearly killed me thinking I owed £1billion. I was new to business and naïve. It was shocking.’ Mrs Coke, 60, said it was ‘insulting’ that the taxman thought he could compensate her for the trauma of being handed such a massive demand with a cheap bunch of flowers. ‘When the flowers came they didn’t even have a note saying who they were from,’ she said. ‘I only realised they were from the taxman when a letter came afterwards apologising and saying they had sent some flowers. ‘They can’t have cost them much more than £10. It’s insulting for them to use taxpayer’s money to say sorry for their own mistakes.’ Officials later agreed with her that the bill of nearly £1billion (left) was incorrect, and dispatched a revised bill (right) of £17,000 along with a bouquet of flowers . Mrs Coke, from Gorton, Greater Manchester, works six days a week to keep her café, Mama Flo’s, in Stockport, afloat. She said she is still trying to pay off the revised £17,000 tax bill in small instalments nearly two years later. She received a VAT bill for £979,092,858 in March 2013. The letter, signed by an HMRC debt collector, said: ‘If you do not pay or contact us, we can visit your premises in order to arrange for your assets to be sold by public auction.’ HMRC said it could not provide the cost of the 106 bouquets sent to customers between January 1, 2009 and July 1, 2014, but said it stuck to strict guidelines on spending public money. A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘When we let a customer down, we always apologise and put matters right. And occasionally, having considered the specific details of a customer’s complaint, we do send flowers, but only where we consider this is the most appropriate way of saying “sorry”.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, said the idea that flowers could compensate for the stress and worry caused by HMRC errors was ‘ludicrous.’ He added: ‘Rather than receiving crushed carnations in the post, taxpayers would prefer the taxman to simply get their maths right in the first place.’","HM Revenue and Customs sent 100 bouquets to say 'sorry' to customers .

"The Quadrantids meteor shower is set to mark the start of New Year in style this weekend when it makes an appearance in the north to north-eastern skies. Astronomers predict the meteor shower will peak on 3 January at 9pm EST - or 4 January at 2am GMT - and will be visible in northern regions, near the Big Dipper constellation. The Quadrantid shower is one of the year's most spectacular events, but also the shower that most astronomers miss because it's very brief and intense. The Quadrantids meteor shower is set to mark the start of New Year in style this weekend when it makes an appearance in the north to north-eastern skies. Pictured is a meteor streaking past stars during the annual Quadrantid meteor shower in Qingdao, Shandong province, January 4, 2014 . It could provide people in the northern latitudes with the opportunity to see 'Earth-grazers' - stunning meteors that come in close to the horizon to the east and west. But, this year, a bright moon could spoil the views for some star gazers, and astronomers are advising people to stand in a position where the moon is blocked by a building or a tree. Astronomers predict the meteor shower will peak on 3 January at 9pm EST (4 January at 2am GMT). To view the meteor shower, people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards 'kite formation' in the constellation Boötes before the shower's peak. Those in the eastern part of Asia are expected to get the best views with the shower peaking there before dawn on January 4th. The Quadrantid shower will be at an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and Arcturus. 'In fact, the Quadrantids might be the strongest and most famous major meteor shower that you've never seen,' EarthSky said in a separate report. To view the meteor shower, people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards 'kite formation' in the constellation Boötes before the shower's peak. 'Look towards the North and the seven famous stars known as The Plough (or 'Big Dipper') which collectively resemble a saucepan,' Colin Stuart, astronomer and author of 'The Big Questions in Science' told MailOnline. 'Cast your eyes wide around the pan's handle and you should spot fleeting shards of bright light streaking by. 'These meteors are caused when our planet ploughs through a trail of cosmic rubbish strewn across the solar system by passing comets. When this dust impacts our atmosphere it incinerates, resulting in flashes of light.' Those in the eastern part of Asia are expected to get the best views with the shower peaking there before dawn on 4 January. The Quadrantid shower will be at an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and Arcturus. The Quadrantids derive their name from the constellation of Quadrans Muralis - mural quadrant - which was created by the French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795. Quadrans was an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot stars. Even though the constellation is no longer recognised by astronomers, it was around long enough to give the meteor shower - first seen in 1825 - its name. The Quadrantid shower is one of the year's most spectacular events, but also the shower that most astronomers miss because it's very brief and intense . This year, a bright moon could also spoil the views for some star gazers, and astronomers are advising people to stand in a position where the moon is blocked by a building or a tree . Like the Geminids, the Quadrantids originate from an asteroid, called 2003 EH1. Studies suggest that this body could very well be a piece of a comet which broke apart several centuries ago, and that the meteors you will see before dawn are the debris from this fragmentation. After hundreds of years orbiting the sun, they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph (144,800 km/h), burning up 50 miles (80km) above Earth's surface. 'The Quadrantids can be spectacular because the number of possible meteors is comparable to two of the best meteor showers of the year - The Perseids and The Geminids,' Mr Stuart said. 'However, its peak doesn't last as long - hours not days - so you'll need a healthy dose of luck and good timing to catch this year's Quadrantids.' The Lyrid shower is the next major meteor shower after the Quadrantids, and is expected between April 16 to 25. To view the meteor shower, people living in the northern latitudes will need to look towards 'kite formation' in the constellation Boötes before the shower's peak. The Quadrantid shower will be at an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and Arcturus . The Quadrantids derive their name from the constellation of Quadrans Muralis - mural quadrant - which was created by the French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795. Pictured is a meteor from the shower in 2009 .","Shower will peak on 3 January at 9pm EST (4 January at 2am GMT)
It can be seen in the northern latitudes by looking towards Big Dipper .
Astronomers predict it could produce as many as 100 meteors per hour .
The Quadrantid event is one of the year's most spectacular showers, but also the one that most astronomers miss because it's brief and intense .
This year, a bright moon could also hamper attempts to see the meteors ."
"Ryanair has been on the charm offensive in recent months, eager to prove it does value its customers, despite previous claims to the contrary. Which is probably why it was so quick to jump on a claim on Twitter that a woman was being charged extra for her 'emotional baggage'. Comedian Ryan Hand managed to confuse the airline with a tongue-in-cheek tweet stating: 'What a disgrace, there's a woman crying at the @Ryanair check in desk who's been made to pay more for emotional baggage.' Scroll down for video . Ryan Hand could not believe it when Ryanair thought his tweet was genuine . Within two minutes of sending the tweet, Ryanair responded with the question: 'Hi Ryan, which airport is this happening at? IK' Mr Hand was so amused by the Ryanair response that he posted a second message, telling all his followers to retweet the conversation. The presenter and comedian wrote: 'I can't believe Ryanair have just fallen for this joke LOL retweet!!!' The tweet was immediately picked up by his followers and has been retweeted 1,100 times and 'favourited' 689 times. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is normally known for having a sense of humour . But it seems Ryanair's sense of humour returned quickly enough. When asked for comment about the incident, a spokesperson said: 'As the fastest responding airline on Twitter in Europe, we pride ourselves on the speed of our customer service. Comedian Ryan Hand posted the joke on Twitter . 'We apologise for temporary technical difficulties with our sarcasm detector today.' Airline CEO Michael O'Leary is famed for his sense of humour, often joking about at press conferences. However, his outspoken manner, threatening all sorts of additional airline charges from a so-called fat tax to a fee for using the toilet, has seen the airline become increasingly unpopular with passengers. The joke Twitter conversation came as an 85-year-old grandmother really was left in tears at Stansted Airport after being refused travel for trying to travel to Edinburgh using a bus pass as identification. Helen Trotter, from Hawick, Roxburghshire, had used the permit to prove who she was on the outbound flight, however Swissport staff at Stansted - acting as third party agents for Ryanair - advised her that this form of ID was not acceptable for the return journey. A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'Customers flying domestically within the UK should travel with a passport or driving licence. In rare cases, where customers have no other form of ID, travel may be permitted with a bus pass. The airline launched a charm offensive last year in a bid to win over customers . 'We have asked our third party handling agent at Stansted (Swissport) to explain why this issue was not escalated and ensure it does not recur. 'We sincerely apologise to Mrs Trotter and transferred her free of charge onto the next available flight that day, however she chose not to travel. 'As a gesture of goodwill, we are offering Mrs Trotter a free return flight from Edinburgh to Stansted and hope she will fly with us once more.'","Comedian and presenter Ryan Hand tweeted the joke to Ryanair .
The airline responded asking where he had seen the woman crying .

"The White House's most-watched YouTube video of 2014 wasn't the State of the Union address, Barack Obama's angry denunciation of the ISIS terror army or his ground-shattering declaration of new rights for illegal immigrants. Those moments pulled in about one-tenth as many viewers as a 3-minute clip showing the president just walking around and meeting tourists in Washington, D.C. That casual ordinary-guy stunt was viewed more than 5 million times since he took the unannounced stroll on May 21 with White House counselor John Podesta in tow. 'Can't be regular. Can't be routine,' Obama is heard telling him, jacket flung over his shoulder on a warm spring day. 'It's good to be out. The bear is loose!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . NO AVERAGE STROLL: President Barack Obama walked with White House counselor John Podesta (3rd left) through the Ellipse in Washington on May 21, an event so extraordinary that 5 million people saw it on YouTube . WHAT I DID ON MY SUMMER VACATION: These kids and their parents got the shock of their lives when Obama turned up to say hello . THE BEAR IS LOOSE: For a few weeks' time in the spring of 2014, the president strayed from his schedule to shake hands and stage stunts like beers and billiards with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (right) Tourists near the White House were shocked. One told the Associated Press that she though he was a presidential impersonator. Obama took a handful of unexpected outings in the span of a few weeks, including a Starbucks run and a lunch ad the Shake Shack burger joint. The president's campaign aides playfully tweaked him in 2008 by muttering 'The bear is loose' whenever he would go off script or take an unscheduled detour to press the flesh. A Twitter hashtag, fed by West Wing staffers, pushed the message when he downed beers and shot pool with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and shook hands with a fan wearing a horse-head mask. But by mid-2014 White House insiders tried to leverage the phrase to describe an Obama trying to bend another bear – Russian President Vladimir Putin – to his will. In July as the Russia-Ukraine border threatened to disintegrate in a full-fledged Putin annexation, the media jabs came fast and furious. Putin was the bear, pundits declared. And Obama was the cub. The U.S. president's fundraising tour continued while his Russian counterpart's armies menaced to the west and solidified their control over the Crimea. White House staffers told DailyMail.com at the time that Obama was 'restless' and 'tired of his bubble.' Six years into his presidency, it seemed, he had some walking around to do. That included a May 16 stop at a Chipotle restaurant and that jaunt to Shake Shake, where he sat on the lunch counter to take a photo with workers. Americans seem to relish those moments, reminded of the charismatic Illinois senator who campaigned in 2008 on Hope and Change – long before his approval rating nose-dived amid Obamacare website woes and more serious scandals. On May 21 he handed out White House-branded M&M's to a seven-year-old girl and her four-year-old brother, who told the leader of the free world that he was actually 'four and three-quarters.' ELECTRIC SLIDE: With Vice President Joe Biden (right) looking on, Obama tried a maneuver in May that would get most Shake Shack customers booted from the restaurant . WHY HELLO, WILBUR! Obama cracked jokes on July 8 with a man wearing a horse-head mask as he detoured from his schedule to shake hands in Denver . STARBUCKS, ANYONE? On June 9 the president created his own news cycle by walking across Pennsylvania Avenue in the middle of the day for a caffeine fix . That populist moment captured Americans' imagination far more readily than a 'putting an end to sexual assault' video featuring Daniel Craig, Benicio Del Toro, Dulé Hill, Seth Meyers and Steve Carell. That PSA came in second with just over 1.5 million views, slightly ahead of first lady Michelle Obama's Mother's Day chat about a mass-kidnapping by the Nigerian terror group Boko Haram. The 2014 State of the Union address and presidential speeches on Internet 'net neutrality,' immigration and ISIS made the top ten for last year. But added together, they couldn't compete with the audience for a president, with Secret Service a few strides away, just out for a walk.","Bizarre 3-minute clip of the president strolling through Washington and meeting tourists was the White House's most-watched video of 2014 .

"Potential features for HTC’s next flagship phone, dubbed Hima or HTC One M9, have emerged following a series of online leaks. The phone is thought to include an impressive 64-bit octa-core Snapdragon 810 processor and a 5-inch screen. The leaks also suggest the next-generation device will include 3GB of RAM, run the latest version of Android, and feature a 20.7MP rear-facing camera. Scroll down for video . The details emerged after Twitter user, @upleaks, released a screenshot of the AnTuTu benchmark site showing a HTC device named HTC6535LVW (Hima), thought to be the One M9 (pictured) This would make the device similar, in terms of memory, to the LTE-A edition of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and in terms of features to the HTC One M8 Prime. According to the AnTuTu benchmark testing site, Hima will have a 5-inch screen, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080, rather than the previously rumoured Quad HD (2560 x 1440). The details emerged after Twitter user, @upleaks, released a screenshot of the AnTuTu benchmark site showing an HTC device named HTC6535LVW (Hima), said to be the One M9. The handset is also rumoured to have two cameras with the rear one featuring 20.7MP, while a 13MP camera will be included on the front. A separate leak from Steve Hemmerstoffer from Nowhere Else shows an alleged CES press shot of the phone, without the front-facing speakers of HTC's last two flagship smartphones.

"A British holidaymaker has captured a series of amazing photos that reveal the sheer power and brutality of a hungry leopard going after its prey. Kevin Wilson’s snaps show terror in the face of the hapless springbok, which met an unfortunate end as it was taken down by the ruthless predator at an African game reserve. In Kevin’s photos, the leopard sinks its teeth into the gazelle and clings on to its prey with its powerful paws while its whole body is lifted off the ground during the struggle at Etosha National Park in north-west Namibia. Scroll down for video . Photographer Kevin Wilson captured the scene as a leopard attacked a hapless springbok at Etosha National Park in north-west Namibia . Mr Wilson said the leopard took down its victim and completed the kill in some long grass less than 20 seconds after the attack began . After the kill the leopard ambled over to the truck Kevin Wilson and his wife, Janet, were in and sat in the shade the vehicle offered . In another frame, the big cat appears to be stood up on its hind legs like a human as it takes a commanding grip on the hind of the springbok. The leopard then takes down its victim and completes the kill in some long grass less than 20 seconds after the attack began. Afterwards, the leopard ambled over to the truck Kevin, 55, and his wife, Janet, were in and sat in the shade the vehicle offered. Kevin, from Leatherhead, Surrey, said he was incredibly lucky to have captured the display on camera. Kevin Wilson, from Leatherhead, Surrey, and his wife, Janet, witnessed the attack as they drove around the game reserve in a pickup truck . The leopard sinks its teeth into the gazelle and clings on to its prey with its powerful paws while its whole body is lifted off the ground . He and his wife were driving themselves around while in radio contact with two guides, who informed them about a leopard stalking prey near the Rietfontein waterhole. He said: ‘We headed there straight away and saw the leopard hiding in the long grass on the hunt for three springboks nearby, but they spotted it and ran off. ‘All of a sudden another springbok appeared and it didn't see the leopard and actually headed straight for it. ‘We moved position and I had time to get my camera focused on the leopard. The springbok almost walked on top of the leopard which then sprung into action.' Kevin Wilson said the springbok almost walked on top of the leopard, which then sprung into action, as it hid in the grass . Kevin added: ‘It immediately grabbed hold of its prey and swung on to it while the springbok tried to get away but in no time at all the leopard dragged it to the ground. ‘The whole thing took no more than 20 seconds. The sheer speed and power of the leopard was just breath-taking. ‘It was a fairly hot day and after it happened [the leopard] walked over to our car and sat in the shade and growled at us. We knew then it was time to make a move as we didn't want to be its next meal.’","Kevin Wilson, from Leatherhead, Surrey, witnessed the attack at Etosha National Park in north-west Namibia .

"Three men have been arrested on suspicion of supplying the dangerous batch of 'Superman' ecstasy pills - as the drug claims its fourth life. Police confirmed they detained a 19-year-old man, a 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man last night on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs. All three men are from Ipswich, Suffolk, and remain in police custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre awaiting questioning. Scroll down for video . Labourer, John Hocking, 20, (left) died yesterday after taking the drug while Lithuanian factory worker, Justas Ropas, was found dead on Christmas Eve at the house he shares with friends in Ipswich . Four deaths have so far been linked to the rogue batch - three of which were all in Suffolk. The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve. While John Hocking, 20, from Rendlesham, Suffolk, Gediminas Kulokas, 24, from Ipswich, and Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire, died within hours of each other on New Year's Day. All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman ‘S’ logo. It comes as the girlfriend of one of the victims said anyone who takes the drug must have a 'death wish'. Natasha Mumby tried desperately to resuscitate her partner, Gediminas Kulokas, who died at their home in the county following a night of celebrations. Another man – a friend of the couple who is also believed to have taken pills from a batch of ecstasy tablets marked with a ‘Superman’ logo – remained in hospital last night. Suffolk Police yesterday took the unprecedented move of offering an amnesty to anyone who hands in the tablets, as they desperately attempt to get them off the streets and trace the dealers. Heartbroken Miss Mumby, 30, said last night that her boyfriend, a labourer originally from Lithuania, was not a regular drug user. The pills are described as red and triangular  with a Superman logo printed on them (pictured) He had stayed up late partying at their flat to celebrate his 24th birthday and New Year’s Eve. She said: ‘I went to bed at 2am and woke up a few times because him and his friend were making a bit of noise. I had no idea that they had been taking drugs. ‘Every time I got up to tell them to keep quiet, they were looking the worse for wear. His friend popped out and when I checked on Gediminas, he was breathing in a funny way. I propped him up and went back to bed. ‘I then came back in the lounge because he was not making the breathing noise any more.’ She dialled 999 at around 9.40am on New Year’s Day and took advice over the phone on how to try to resuscitate her boyfriend. A tearful Miss Mumby, a recruitment agency manager, said: ‘Then the ambulances and the helicopter came along. They tried and tried to save him. At one point they got his heartbeat back and then it went again.’ She added: ‘He was in good health, went to the gym and ate well. He was a wonderful person who was always helping people.’ Mr Kulokas was pronounced dead at 10.10am. His girlfriend said she wanted his story to serve as a warning to others to avoid drugs. ‘If anyone else was thinking of taking them, I would say, “If you have got that pill in your hand, you either live or die”,’ she said. ‘Drugs are a death wish. Just don’t do it, because you will hurt yourself, your family and your friends. Life is just too short.’ Justas Ropas, also known as Justin, worked in a DVD factory in the Suffolk town and was found dead on Decemeber 24 . Suffolk Police said the drugs are similar to some found in the Netherlands which contained a very high amount of the substance PMMA. This gives the pills a delayed effect and users often overdose accidentally because they think the drug is not working, leading to a fatal rise in body temperature. Labourer Mr Hocking died around three hours before Mr Kulokas at his home 13 miles away. Mr Bagnall, the only victim outside Ipswich and the surrounding area, was found dead at a house in Telford at 1.45pm on New Year’s Day. It is believed he had taken an ecstasy tablet from the same batch as the men in Suffolk. Ipswich Conservative MP Ben Gummer said last night: ‘It’s very sad indeed ... if you are buying drugs you are never going to be sure about where they come from.’ Police believe the men, who were all in their twenties, may have been involved with the drug after emergency services were called to three addresses across Ipswich in the space of one week (pictured) It is believed John Hocking had been with friends who lived at the house in Rendlesham on New Year's Eve . A spokesman for Suffolk Police said this is the first time they have come across pills matching this description. The force has drawn a link between these drugs and dangerous pills with a similar appearance which were in circulation in the Netherlands last month. Those tablets had a large concentration of PMMA, which acts more slowly than MDMA, the main component of ecstasy. This causes people to take more pills because they think they are not working. PMMA can cause high body temperature and an increased heart rate. There are also concerns the pills could be linked to 120,000 similar ones seized in Ireland last month. Police say the drugs may also be in a round shape with the 'S' Superman logo embossed on them (pictured) Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths. 'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them. 'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.'

"Bedtime reading has traditionally been thought to boost a child's development - but in fact chatting while doing housework may be of greater benefit. This is according to Irish researchers who conducted a study on the impact of bedtime reading on 7,845 nine-month-old infants. They found that absent-minded conversation was four times better at improving a child's communication skills than reading to them or showing them pictures. Bedtime reading has traditionally been thought to boost a child's development - but in fact chatting while doing housework (stock image shown) may be of greater benefit, according to a recent study by Limerick University . In the study, 94 per cent of infants had a parent show them pictures; 80 per cent of nine-month-olds were read to and 66 per cent of mothers reported always talking to their children. Researchers at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) found that as well as communication skills, chatting to children was three times better at improving problem solving skills. Suzanne Egan, a lecturer in psychology at University of Limerick's Mary Immaculate College, told Eithne Shortall at the Sunday Times that she was surprised by the results. 'We would have thought that there might have been a good effect of reading, perhaps more so than the talking,' she said. Last year, a group of experts suggested that reading to children has such a huge impact on their academic success that parents should do it from birth . Scientists think that cooing at a newborn baby is a vital part of teaching them to speak. Exaggerated vowels that experts call ‘motherese’ - the ‘goos’ and ‘gaas’ that can be infuriating to non-parents - are a key part of the learning process, a study by the University of Washington suggests. Exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises, the researchers suggest. They found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they cannot see the person speaking. By the age of 11 months, before they can speak themselves, the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages, the scientists discovered. The study serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development. And the authors say the long, clear vowels that parents babble at their newborns is a key part of the process. She said that it was easier for many parents to talk to their children regularly than devote all their attention and time to reading a book. The researchers are now looking into longer-term impacts of reading and talking to children up to three years of age. Last year, a group of experts suggested that reading to children has such a huge impact on their academic success that parents should do it from birth. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said in a policy statement that story time routines benefit even the youngest children, helping them to build vocabulary. Experts say reading or storytelling in early life predicts how well children will do when they enter preschool. In previous recommendations, the AAP has discouraged parents from exposing children under the age of two years to TV, which can be detrimental to language development. A separate study by Hollins University in Virginia warned that background noise from the TV can adversely affect toddlers' language development. They say it has long been known children develop their language skills from listening to their parents - and parents speak to their children less when the TV is on. The quantity of words and phrases, as well as the number of new words spoken by the parents, was lower than when the TV was off.","This is according to an Irish study of 7,845 nine-month-old infants .

"Fashion icons such as Cara Delvigne may have created a trend for prominent eyebrows this year, but it seems nobody told North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. While giving his annual New Year speech in Pyongyang yesterday, the dictator's brows appeared significantly smaller than when he gave the same address in 2013. Images captured from both events show the brows have become further apart and significantly shorter in what appears to be a case of severe over-plucking. Scroll down for video . Brow you see them... Eagle-eyed viewers of Kim Jong Un's 2015 New Year speech (left) diagnosed a severe case of over-plucked eyebrows after noticing how much they had shrunk compared with 2013 (right) It is not yet clear whether Kim will force the rest of the country to copy his over-plucked look, as was the case after he ordered every man in the secretive nation to get the same haircut as him. The disappearing brows were spotted by eagle-eyed viewers as Kim gave his speech on New Year's Day , announcing possible diplomatic talks between North and South Korea. In a televised address from the country's capital, Kim spoke of the possibility of 'high-level' negotiations, 'if the atmosphere and conditions are met.' However he went on to blame the South and America for tension on the peninsula, while making vague promises to improve the country's economy by pursuing science and technology. Trend setter: It is not clear whether Kim plans to make the rest of the country follow his lead, as he did earlier this year after ordering all men to have their hair cut in his signature style . Happy New Year: During his address Kim raised the prospect of high-level talks with South Korea in 2015, but only 'if the atmosphere and conditions are met.' The 30-minute speech was the third Kim has delivered since he came to power, but the first after the end of the traditional three-year mourning of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has married the son of one of the country's most powerful officials, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said today. Kim Yo Jong, who is 27 or 28, was said by state media late last year to have assumed a senior position in the ruling Workers' Party. She is the only other member of the ruling Kim family known to have an official job within the government, other than Kim Jong Un. A Chinese source said: 'As far as I know, Kim Yo Jong, deputy director of the Workers' Party, got married to a son of the party secretary Choe Ryong Hae.' According to the source, the lucky man is Choe Song, second son of Choe senior. The elder Choe is a high-ranking member of the Workers' Party and widely seen as a close confidant of supreme ruler Kim. Kim Yo Jong was seen wearing what appears to be a wedding ring in a photo released by the reclusive North's official KCNA news agency today. Analysts believe that, with his father removed from the nation's consciousness, the younger Kim will begin to pursue policies more in keeping with his own set of views. It has been a bad year for Kim, who has been plagued by health problems, and for North Korea as a whole, which has become even more isolated from the world in the wake of the Sony hacks. Kim disappeared from public for three weeks in September, missing several key state events, after being pictured limping during one televised appearance. Observers suggested that he may have been deposed by high ranking military generals, but military spokesmen insisted he was only  'suffering from discomfort' due to a medical condition. That condition was later theorised to be gout brought on by eating vast quantities of cheese, especially imported Emmental, which is said to be his favourite. Relations between North Korea and America have ended the year at a low point after Sony Pictures was hacked, a crime blamed on the communist nation. The release of sensitive employee information and embarrassing email exchanges by high-level executives was seen to be in retaliation for film The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim. While North Korea has denied responsibility, it praised the hacking as a 'righteous act'. Several days later the country's entire internet was brought offline for a day in a suspected retaliatory move by American authorities, although again nobody has accepted responsibility. Kim seems to have started 2015 in a positive mood, however, and was pictured visiting an orphanage in Pyongyang today, where he was pictured smiling and playing with the children. Positive start: Shrugging off the health problems during 2014, Kim got this year off to a more cheerful start by visiting an orphanage in Pyongyang .

"Some may associate raves with drunken revelry, late nights, and heavy drugs. A sober morning dance party called Daybreaker, which had their end of year event on December 18 on a boat circulating New York, ditches the booze for coffee and granola bars and promotes a holistic start to a busy work day. Hundreds of professionals of all ages flocked to lower Manhattan last month  to board the Hornblower Infinity at Pier 40 to listen  to groovy beats by DJ Scumfrog and watch the sunrise. Sober dance party: Hundreds of New York professionals boarded a boat circulating Manhattan for the Daybreaker event to dance in the wee hours before going to work . All aboard: The Hornblower Infinity left  from Pier 40 in Manhattan for a sunrise dance cruise around the city for the latest Daybreaker event . Can't stop, won't stop: These driven individuals are so dedicated to dance that they got up early before work to sweat it out and get a killer workout . All hail dance: Despite not having any drugs or alcohol the energy in the room was intoxicating and party goers were high on life and dance moves . Live musicians on board played the saxophone and singers and drummers chimed in to create a collective tune. Rather than hit the gym at 6:30 a.m. participants dressed in workout gear, business suits, and wild costumes flooded the dance floor until 10:00 a.m. to dance for the sake of dancing all before heading into the office. Some party goers were even dressed as Santa Claus to celebrate Christmas and the new year. Tickets cost around $35 per person but all coffee, food, and juices were included in the fare. A portion of all ticket proceeds from the event were donated to Urban Arts Partnership to support arts education and youth empowerment programs at low-income schools across the city. Other Daybreaker parties have been hosted at various nightclubs turned dayclubs around New York and Brooklyn. The 'morning movement' as it is described on Daybreaker's Facebook page is popular among tech executives as it's founded by General Assembly co-founder Matthew Brimer and Super Sprowtz founder and CEO Radha Agrawal. Nice view!: The boat circulated Manhattan and the attendees got to watch the sunrise over the city that never stops dancing, even at 6 a.m. Morning meditation: Dancers took a small break to listen to a morning meditation and affirmation and learn about the health benefits of dancing sober . Celebrity appearance: Santa Claus decided to join in the dance party before a long day of checking his list twice and preparing to deliver Christmas presents . Hearts in their eyes: The founders of Daybreaker aimed to create a creative community for people to socialize, network, and build off of each other's ideas . the love boat: Attendees dressed in costumes, business attire, and nautical themed garb joined together to dance and make new friends, or even business partners . 'It's a great way to start the day off with a bang, and without alcohol,' Brimer said to Business Insider after a Daybreaker party this summer. 'It's very much a workout.' The latest Daybreaker dance event set aside a bit of time for a morning meditation and affirmation in addition to the hours of dancing. One member of the Daybreaker team took a moment to speak about the effect of sober dancing on the brain and explained that the body releases endorphins which both promote energy and immune health. He noted that the positive effects of dancing are only prevalent when the body is not ingesting substances like booze and drugs. More than a health driven dance party, Daybreaker is a networking hotspot for likeminded creatives to collaborate and feed off of each other’s positive energy, say the founders. Energizing morning: Dancers break a sweat as the music thumps through the bright and cozy party ship . The decks on deck: DJ Scumfrog plays groovy and energizing tunes to jump start the morning . 'What's exciting about Daybreaker is that it fosters this community where entrepreneurs can be creative,' Brimer said. 'So there's the physical aspect, but also the social energy, open-minded, and artistic side to it.' In one corner of the boat, a haiku station was set up in which partygoers could have a poem written for them on the spot. The event founders apparently came up with the idea for the party over a late-night falafel meal in Williamsburg back in 2013. 'Over a late-night falafel in Williamsburg a few months back, we mused over an idea. An idea about dancing before the day broke with people we love. About cultivating a community that values camaraderie, self-expression, wellness, immediacy… and mischief. About going to work with our brows slightly dewed from moving our bodies with reckless abandon, sans alcohol but with so much spirit, surrounded by the most amazing people we know,' says their Facebook page. According to Daybreaker's website as they expand they plan to host events in cities all over the world and those who wish to remain in the loop can do so here. reading an affirmation: participants were handed a reading on a piece of paper and took a moment to set goals and intentions for the day and the new year .

"A crash victim who lost part of his leg and was left unable to walk is set to become the first in the UK to have his limb rebuilt by surgeons - using donor bones. Stu Jotham was thrown from his motorbike in 2011. He lost chunks of his thigh bone and his calf bone, as well as all his knee ligaments, when he skidded across the road. Doctors feared the 29-year-old would lose the mangled right limb but after a series of 10-hour operations they managed to save it. However, Mr Jotham - who was previously a landscape gardener and martial arts competitor - was left wheelchair bound and suffering extreme pain. Four years on he still struggles to walk unaided and has been unable to work. But he is now preparing himself for a life-changing reconstruction, which will see surgeons screw parts of a donor leg on to what remains of his limb. Scroll down for video . Stu Jotham, 29 (pictured), is set to be the first man in the UK to have his leg rebuilt by surgeons using donor bones. Surgeons will screw parts of a donor leg on to the remains of his limb, to restore stability in his knee . This is the first time that a knee with attached femur (thigh bone), fibula (calf bone) and ligaments from a deceased donor will be transplanted in an operation. Doctors will bolt them on to Mr Jotham's remaining leg bones, and after two years it will integrate to his leg. He hopes it will allow him to run again . Mr Jotham lost chunks of his thigh bone and his calf bone, as well as all his knee ligaments, when he skidded across the road. Doctors feared he would lose his mangled right limb but after a series of 10-hour operations they managed to save it . Mr Jotham, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, said: 'As far as I'm aware this is the first time they are going to do it on this scale in this country so I'm a bit of a guinea pig. 'I don't mind because it will work for me and hopefully it will restore some sort of strength and stability in my knee, which is the ultimate goal. 'They want to take the femur, the ligaments and a bit of the fibula - all attached - and then bolt them on to my leg, and hopefully over two years it will integrate to my leg. 'That is obviously a huge, huge operation and I've been on a donor list for the last three years. It's a big thing to deal with. 'I'd love to find out who this donor is or his family and just sent them a letter to say thank you. 'They've literally given me bones and bits of body. 'The thought that some young bloke died somewhere and that I'm having a bit of his leg, it's a weird concept - but an amazing one.' The consultant surgeon who will be carrying out the landmark operation on Mr Jotham said he did not think it had been performed before in the UK. Mr Jotham was knocked off his motorbike in 2011 and was left left wheelchair-bound and in extreme pain. Four years later, he is still unable to walk unaided. He is pictured at his home in Gloucestershire . Surgeon James Murray said: 'We believe it is the first application of this technique in this setting.' He said the operation - known as an allograft  knee replacement - requires the correct size donor knee, which has been sourced through the NHS Tissue Bank. Mr. Murray said the complex operation will involve using parts of the donor's knee, tibia, femur and proximal fibula, along with associated ligaments and cartilage. A team of plastic surgeons, trauma surgeons and knee surgeons will carry it out. The NHS uses bone donated by living and deceased donors to help patients needing grafts. People undergoing hip replacements may be asked to donate bone removed during the procedure. But for patients such as Stu Jotham – who need a large amount for a reconstructive operation – the bone will have to come from an organ donor. The bone will have been disinfected, tested for viruses and stored in a tissue bank. It can be stored for up to five years, and there are no age restrictions for anyone wanting to donate bone after death. Surgeons use donor bone to form scaffolding, with pins, plates or screws holding the graft tissue in place on the damaged limb. Once accepted by the patient’s body, the grafted bone provides a framework where new, living bone can grow. Mr Jotham was riding to Devon for a day out with his family when he was knocked off his motorbike in Gloucestershire in April 2011. He was taken to Gloucester Royal Infirmary and then transferred to Bristol's Frenchay Hospital where surgeons warned there was a high chance he would lose his leg. Doctors took skin, tissue and muscle from his side and back to patch up his leg, which was only just supplying blood to his foot by a single vein. He recalled: 'It ripped all the skin off my leg and I went down the road on my knee which ground away a lot. 'They planted tissue from my back down into my leg and plumbed in all in amazingly. 'It was three surgeries and two of them were ten or 11 hours long. 'It was pretty intense. I think I had 10 to 11 units of blood replaced.' Mr Jotham got the call from the NHS in November telling him a suitable leg donor had been found, and the operation will take place in February. Doctors will implant one third of the anonymous donor's knee joint - made up of bits of thigh bone, calf bone and ligaments - together with artificial cartilage. 'When they told me they had a suitable donor I did get emotional,' Mr Jotham said. 'I felt disorientated. I felt all over the place. I didn't know what to think. 'I'm going to have to keep mentally strong - for my family and friends as well. Doctors took skin, tissue and muscle from Mr Jotham's side and back to patch up his leg, which was supplying blood to his foot by a single vein. He is pictured in hospital, left and right, after the procedure . Mr Jotham was riding to Devon for a day out with his family when he was knocked off his motorbike (pictured) in Gloucestershire . 'I want to be able to run again. 'Going through it has been hard, of course, but there are people in worse places than me. I have to stay positive.' The NHS Blood and Transplant authority said it believed Stu Jotham's operation would be the first of its kind to take place in the UK. A spokesman from NHSBT said: 'NHS Blood and Transplant's Tissue Services is the only tissue bank in the UK that operates from initial donor referral through to the hospitals who use the donated tissue to save and improve patients' lives. 'We provide life enhancing tissues to hospitals up and down the country. These include specially requested grafts, to meet the unique requirements of an individual patient. 'As far as we are aware this is the first time that a knee with attached femur, fibula and ligaments from a deceased donor has been supplied in the UK for this novel operation. 'We rely on the generosity of the families of people who donate their tissues after death. Thanks to them we are able to provide skin, tendons, bone and other tissues to repair or rebuild the bodies and lives of thousands of severely injured people every year. 'We wish Mr Jotham well with his operation and hope he makes a speedy recovery.'","Stu Jotham, 29, was knocked off his motorbike in Gloucestershire in 2011 .

"David Cameron has ordered Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to visit every European country before the election to build support for major reform of Brussels. The Prime Minister, who is to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel next week, wants Mr Hammond to hold talks with every member state to set out Tory demands for change. Mr Hammond has so far crossed off top-level talks with 13 countries in 11 capital cities but has barely 80 days left until the general election is called at the end of March to build an alliance in support of clawing powers back from Brussels. Mr Hammond has so far visited 11 capitals, holding top level talks with 13 European Union countries in his drive to build an alliance in support of radical reform of Brussels . Prime Minister David Cameron made clear to Mr Hammond that he expects him to visit every EU country before the election on May 7 . Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. He used a major in November to set out key demands on banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. The PM made clear he plans to form alliances with leaders in central and eastern Europe who have lost their 'brightest and best' to Britain. When Mr Hammond was appointed as Foreign Secretary in July he was told by Mr Cameron to travel to every EU country to the Tory reform plans and to discuss 'shared issues'. His tour began in in July and has so far covered 11 countries, including meetings with 13 leaders. It is understood that Mr Hammond will visit at least two more countries in the first week of January, before entering a 'new phase' of engagement with MEPs from across the continent. The general election will take place on May 7, with Parliament due to be dissolved on March 30. Mr Cameron will welcome German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Downing Street on Wednesday for talks on Europe . German chancellor Angela Merkel will visit the UK for talks with David Cameron next week. The crisis in Ukraine crisis and the European economy are expected to be high on the agenda. But Mr Cameron's plans for reform of the EU will also feature, with all eyes on securing German support for change. Mrs Merkel, who is travelling to London on Wednesday, will also visit the British Museum's Germany: Memories Of A Nation exhibition tracing 600 years of the country's history. German government spokesman Georg Streiter said: 'Federal Chancellor Merkel will speak on bilateral, European political and international questions with Prime Minister Cameron.' A Foreign Office source said: 'The Foreign Secretary has been visiting EU partners to explain our reform plans and is cautiously optimistic about the discussions he has had so far. 'These initial visits have produced positive reactions, and come ahead of formal negotiations which are set to start after the General Election. 'It's clear that this isn't just about the UK's needs, many other countries have been expressing their interest in EU reform.' He has already been to Berlin, Paris, Copenhagen, Vienna, Bratislava, Stockholm, The Hague, Rome, Riga, Dublin and Warsaw. While in Bratislava Mr Hammond held talks with his Hungarian and Czech counterparts. The biggest success of the tour to date came during a meeting in Berlin with German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister. Mr Schäuble is said to have told Mr Hammond that he would 'never let Britain leave' the EU while Mr Steinmeier said 'it is vital' that the UK remains a member. Visiting Dublin in December, Mr Hammond declared: 'I look forward to working with the Irish Government on much needed reforms in Europe that benefit all states and drive forward economic growth for everyone.' And meeting French foreign minister Laurent Fabius in Paris in September, he discussed 'reform and renewal of the European Union following the appointment of the new Commission'. Mr Hammond was in Paris in September, where he attended an international conference on tackling the threat posed by ISIS extremists . The source added: 'We're also watching the early stages of the new European Commission's reform agenda, to date there have been encouraging signs. 'A new phase is expected to start in the New Year with further engagement amongst Members of the European Parliament.' However, Mr Cameron's demands for reform have not be universally welcomed across Europe. His threat to block new members joining the EU unless movement limits remain in place until their economy matches Britain's led to him being branded a blackmailer by senior German figures. And Poland has warned it could t it will veto attempts to curb benefits paid to EU migrants in Britain. FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU: . No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years . No social housing for four years . No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK . FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS: . No support from the UK taxpayer .

"This time last year Neil Trotter was living in a three-bedroom suburban semi on a busy main road.

Medieval splendour: Neil Trotter's Grade II-listed manor house (pictured) stands in 400 acres of land and has its own private lake . This time last year Neil Trotter was living in a three-bedroom suburban semi (pictured) on a busy main road in Coulsdon, Surrey . Jackpot: Mr Trotter (pictured with his partner Nicky Ottaway) has moved somewhere rather more desirable after scooping £108million to become Britain’s fourth biggest Lottery winner . Motorsport enthusiast Mr Trotter, 41, spoke last year of his plans to buy a new house with room for horses for his partner, Nicky Ottaway, 33, and a fleet of supercars for himself. ‘There are a lot of stunning cars out there – I’m going to need a lot of garage space at the new house,’ he said. The EuroMillions winner also described how the couple hoped to find a ‘slower pace of living’ by moving to the country. After spending months looking at properties in the Home Counties, Mr Trotter recently acquired a stunning home deep in the Kent countryside. The eight-bedroom Grade II-listed manor house has been extended and renovated over the years. It enjoys sensational views across landscaped gardens and the lake, and is surrounded by woods and fields. Inside, large wood-beamed rooms and vast stone open fireplaces give the property the feel of a medieval squire’s home. There is also a separate three-bedroom oast house with a distinctive conical roof, converted from a traditional building used to dry hops for beer. Luxury: Large wood-beamed rooms and vast stone open fireplaces give the £5million property the feel of a medieval squire’s home . Room for entertaining: The eight-bedroom Grade II-listed manor house has been extended and renovated over the years and features this stunning dining hall . Plenty of room, then, for Mr Trotter and his partner, although they are likely to be visited by his daughter from a previous relationship who lives with her mother. Mr Trotter revealed last year that it was his dream to own luxury cars including a £866,000 McLaren P1 supercar and classic racers such as the Sierra Cosworth. But his new neighbours will be pleased to learn he ruled out building a race track. There was no sign of any supercars at the mansion this week, although two new Range Rovers were parked outside the oast house. It is a far cry from Mr Trotter and Miss Ottaway’s modest former home in Coulsdon, Surrey. His father bought him the property for £186,000 in 2006 but it was ‘absolutely derelict’, meaning he had to strip it back throughout and replace the roof, ceilings and floors.

Spacious: The motorsport enthusiast  spoke last year of his plans to buy a new house with room for horses for his partner, Nicky Ottaway, 33, and a fleet of supercars for himself . He made a tidy profit when he sold the house for just under £400,000 in September. Neighbours described how the couple moved out ‘almost overnight’ after they scooped the EuroMillions jackpot last March. Mr Trotter admitted at the time that he was like his namesake, Del Boy Trotter from Only Fools And Horses. He said: ‘I always knew I’m going to be a millionaire. I’m a Trotter so it’s going to happen at some stage. I have always believed, and it obviously works.’ The couple had been unaccustomed to spending money on themselves before their massive win. Mr Trotter had to buy new shirts because previously he wore his paint-spattered work clothes all the time. Speaking this week, Mr Trotter declined to comment.","Neil Trotter had been living in suburban home on busy main road in Surrey when he scooped EuroMillions jackpot .

The gift is only available to people who had an active PlayStation Plus membership, or who had already activated their free trial, on 25 December . The extra five days will be added to relevant memberships automatically on the day they are due to expire. Eric Lempel, vice president of Sony Network Entertainment wrote in a blog post: 'Since access to PlayStation Network was impacted during the holidays, we wanted to show our appreciation for your patience. PlayStation Plus lets gamers play with other people online. Membership to Plus can be purchased through PlayStation Store  for 90 days or a year.

Microsoft's Xbox Live service, was back online last Friday, although the company reported continuing problems. Sony's service was brought back online on Monday. So far, there's no evidence to link these episodes with last month's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. A group of hackers called Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down the Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation online networks. Disruptions began on Christmas day. The hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firm's poor security. The consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions. One of the most popular features of the consoles, for example, is the ability to play against friends and other users. While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. A message on the Xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were 'up and running'. Sony engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online, but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems, as thousands of users log back on. The FBI blamed that attack on North Korea, which was said to be furious about Sony's The Interview - a movie comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But the country's government has vehemently denied this. During a television interview at the weekend, a man who went by the name 'Ryan' said he, and a small group, launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on the computer games consoles. A notorious group of hackers called Lizard Squad said it carried out the hack 'for the laughs' and to expose poor online security. Ryan - who is thought to be a member of the group - gave an interview on Sky News saying a small team had masterminded the attack, adding that he understood 'it's a bit unethical'. Speaking from Finland, he said: 'This attack was basically done by three people. We had a couple of people from outside the group helping with the attacks, helping us a little bit, but most of the traffic was coming from one or two people. When asked why the group carried out the attack he said: 'Mostly to raise awareness - to amuse ourselves. 'Also one of the big aspects here was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies.' He added that he would be 'worried' if children 'didn't have anything better to do than play games on their consoles on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.' However, Sony heavy traffic  continued to cause problems for customers hoping to play their games, as thousands of users logged back on. 'From time to time there may be disruptions due to surges in traffic, but engineers will be working to restore service as quickly as possible,' the firm wrote in a blog post .

Ros Bruce said her ten-year-old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an Xbox One for Christmas. The boy was sorely disappointed when he tried to download a game and was still unable to play it more than 15 hours later.

Mark Haynes told the Daily Mail there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie, 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing. Mr Haynes, 50, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, criticised Microsoft's response to the problem after calling technical support four times only to be told by one staff member that the company 'had no idea what was going on'. Popular games such as Call Of Duty and The Sims 4 were all but useless for frustrated gamers. Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which also went down Thursday, was back online last Friday, although the company reported continuing problems . Lizard Squad first announced it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch' Analysts said the attack was a DDOS, or distributed denial of service attack, in which online networks are overwhelmed by traffic, leaving normal users unable to gain access. One of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations. This feature, however, requires an internet connection and many players were left disappointed at their inability to use it.

Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack. There are 48 million worldwide subscribers to the Xbox's internet features, and more than double that for the PlayStation, which has some 110 million. Last month, Sony announced it had sold one million consoles in the UK just eight months after launching, with a sales boost expected before Christmas. In an interview on tech website Winbeta, Lizard Squad said it had carried out the attack on Christmas Day to 'anger and reach the largest amount of people'. It claimed the attack was to highlight poor online security and that Microsoft had barely any protection at all for its Xbox online network. This weekend it was also revealed how a gang of internet hackers claiming an affiliation with anarchist group Anonymous claimed it had leaked the details of more than 13,000 users of Playstation, Xbox and online stores including Amazon. The hackers posted a document online containing username and password combinations. They also added credit card numbers as well as expiry dates. The group told their followers that they hacked the account details 'for the Lulz'. According to Dailydot.com , the hackers released account information from users of Xbox Live, Sony Playstation Network and Twitch.tv. The hackers also released details they claimed came from retailers such as Walmart and Amazon. They also released details from a host of pornography websites.

"For someone who became famous as a right-to-die campaigner, Debbie Purdy enjoyed life as much as anyone I have ever met. Despite having the most severe type of Multiple Sclerosis, her quick, self-deprecating sense of humour, her deep love of music and fierce pride in her appearance never left her. That’s why the manner of her death last week, at the age of 51, is so distressing. Instead of being allowed to die painlessly and with the dignity she’d fought so hard for, Debbie — who I’d come to know after interviewing her five years ago — was forced to starve herself to death, very slowly and very unpleasantly, in a Bradford hospice. Scroll down for video . Hilary Freeman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of just 25 and is calling for a change in the law  to allow assisted dying in this country . It’s the end she didn’t want. It’s an end none of us wants. Who would honestly wish to die in this way when it’s perfectly possible to slip away in your own bed, pain-free and surrounded by your loved ones? That’s why I, like her, want the law changed to allow assisted dying in this country. I know it’s a controversial view and no one was more shocked than I to read in this paper yesterday of the situation in Holland, where people who are not terminally ill are helped to die by medics. But that does not mean a better thought-out law in this country would not benefit us all. Ours is a country where we let vets put dying animals down, but insist that people carry on living in agony and suffer the death of nightmares. Right-to-die campaigner and  multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy (pictured) died earlier this week . This is something I find particularly frightening. Just like Debbie, I have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a neurological condition that can cause anything from blurred vision and slurred speech to blindness and paralysis. I know full well the horror of receiving the initial diagnosis and the constant worry that your symptoms might be worsening. I have felt the cold hand of fear that grips you when you think about the future, about death. How you pray you’re one of the lucky ones. How you hope against hope you don’t die like Debbie. Surely in this day and age, no one should have to go through that? I first met Debbie in 2009 after I’d interviewed her for the MS Society’s magazine about her legal battle to clarify the law on whether a person would be prosecuted for helping a loved one take their own life abroad. Ms Freeman said she was given her diagnosis by an unsympathetic doctor and sent off to deal with it alone, pictured with her partner Mickael . She invited me to the Jazz Café in London to see her husband, Cuban violinist Omar Puente, play. She greeted me warmly, throwing her arms around me with a beaming smile — you’d never have known she was in constant pain and losing the strength in her arms. I remember watching her as she danced in her wheelchair, losing herself in the music, clearly proud of her talented husband. I’d been diagnosed 12 years earlier, at the age of 25, after having vision problems and losing both sensation in and control of my legs, which made me fall over like a rag doll. After months of tests and scans, I was given the news by a rather unsympathetic doctor and sent off to deal with it alone. Like most newly diagnosed people, the diagnosis left me reeling and I feared the worst. Although MS is a highly individual disease — and rarely a fatal one (most people die of other causes) — no one knows how their condition will progress, so it inevitably makes you confront your own mortality. I knew from the start that if the day ever came when I knew only suffering and dependency, and had no quality of life, I wouldn’t want to go on living. Thankfully, unlike Debbie, who had the most disabling, progressive form of the disease, I now know that I have a more benign type. As the years have passed, leaving me still able-bodied and relatively well with only mild sensory symptoms such as numbness and tingling, I know I have been incredibly fortunate. But I also know that the majority of people with MS do eventually get worse, and that my future remains uncertain. Since my diagnosis, I’ve watched many friends steadily become disabled and dependent on others. And I’ve known a few who have reached the final stages of MS. Believe me, this is not a pleasant prospect. In ‘end stage’ MS, you become bedridden, paralysed, in pain, incontinent, unable to speak and swallow, blind and deaf, and possibly demented, too. However good my palliative care might be, I wouldn’t want to end up like this, or to become a burden on my loved ones. And, like Debbie, I wouldn’t want my partner, Mickael, to face prison for helping me to die. He’s known about my condition since we met — I’m very open about it — and he’s taken it in his stride, but it’s impossible to predict how he might cope if I were suddenly to deteriorate. Like Debbie, I’ve always believed that how and when you die should be your personal choice. Yes, I think life is precious, but only those faced with a ghastly death can know how important the manner of your passing actually is. Ms Purdy, pictured with her husband Omar Puente, was forced to starve herself to death, very slowly and very unpleasantly, in a Bradford hospice . For me, the crux of the issue is being able to take charge of my destiny. If I were ever to lose the ability to control my bodily functions, to feed or dress myself, or even to eat without assistance, the one thing left to me should be the ability to choose the timing and manner of my death. Why shouldn’t a medic be able to help me do this? I’m not saying that everyone with end-stage MS or cancer or any other condition should be euthanised, just that assisted death should be an option for them. It’s not for a judge or a doctor or a relative to decide, it’s up to the individual: a way out if you need or want it. I don’t think it’s too much to ask, after all, we’re already allowed to refuse life-saving medical treatment — for example, a Jehovah’s Witness may turn down a blood transfusion — or ask not to be resuscitated, so why can’t we ask for help in dying too? Debbie tried her hardest to win this concession for us. But even though five Law Lords ruled in her favour and insisted the Director of Public Prosecutions must clarify the law on assisted dying, those new legal guidelines, while suggesting prosecution was not likely, didn’t guarantee it. Helping someone die abroad is still illegal. I can understand the point of view of Debbie’s opponents, particularly that allowing assisted suicide would put severely ill or disabled people in mortal danger — giving greedy, exhausted or selfish relatives the opportunity to bump them off at will. But, a carefully constructed law would ensure only a sick person who is judged to be mentally capable could ask for help to die. Someone like Debbie was mentally capable of knowing how she wanted to end her life, but in the end the only choice she could make was to enter a hospice and starve herself. She was too weak to take an overdose or kill herself in another less painful way. The problem with the law as it stands is that you are allowed to make the agonising choice to refuse food, but you can’t ask for a painless injection. And the irony is that with no adjustments to the law on assisted dying, people will continue to kill themselves when they aren’t yet ready to die, when they still have quality of life, because the alternative is too horrific to imagine. Former university lecturer Cari Loder, 48, from Godalming, Surrey, who also had MS, took her own life five years ago using helium gas she’d bought on the internet. Her friends say that if assisted suicide had been legal, she’d have chosen to continue living but, aware that no doctor could help her die when her suffering got too much, she took her own life while she was still physically capable of doing so. Being able to enjoy her life — and wanting to help others do the same — was what motivated Debbie Purdy. She’d been diagnosed with Primary Progressive MS — the most severe form — in 1995, soon after meeting Omar. He stuck by her and they married in 1998, but her condition rapidly deteriorated and within three years of their wedding, she was wheelchair-bound. If it hadn’t been for the case of Diane Pretty, the Motor Neurone Disease sufferer who lost a similar court battle, Debbie might have remained in obscurity. But when Diane choked to death in 2002 — the very death she’d most feared — Debbie realised she didn’t want to end up that way (although MS isn’t a terminal illness, many of its symptoms, such as choking, are life-threatening) and so mounted her legal campaign. Like most people, I prefer to believe I will die peacefully in my sleep. But, in my darkest hours, I imagine how horrific it would be to die — helpless and paralysed — from choking. I’m not sure I’d be brave enough to face the torture of starving myself to death, like Debbie, or that I’ll have the means or resources to take myself to Switzerland. So I hope that for my sake, and for yours — I’m not just talking about MS here — that the law will change soon. Meanwhile, I shall continue to celebrate the life of Debbie by remembering the way she could make me laugh out loud about the even most serious of subjects. ‘Because I can no longer feel my legs, having them waxed is now completely painless!’ she’d joke. I’ll close my eyes and see her dancing in her wheelchair with a big grin on her face and her eyes full of life.","Hilary Freeman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of just 25 .

"When her mobile phone was stolen, Nikki Sweetman thought she would never see it again. That was until she logged on to the internet and saw someone had been taking selfies – using her handset. The poser, a pouting brunette who bears an uncanny resemblance to the victim, had apparently not realised the phone was programmed to automatically upload photos to Miss Sweetman's online account. After sharing the pictures with her friends – along with a request to 'find this tramp' – Miss Sweetman has managed to track the woman down and pass her name to police. Scroll down for video . After Nikki Sweetman's handbag, containing her iPhone 5c, was stolen, selfies of this woman appeared in the 23-year-old's iCloud photo stream . Last night, officers were still investigating the theft, which happened while the 23-year-old recruitment consultant was on her way home from a drunken work Christmas party two weeks ago. After accidentally getting into an unlicensed taxi, she promptly fell asleep. When she woke, her handbag – containing her house keys, driving licence and iPhone 5c – was missing. The taxi driver insisted Miss Sweetman did not have the bag with her when she got into the cab in Stratford, East London. But she reported the theft to police the following day. A week later, on Boxing Day, she noticed new photos appearing in her iCloud account of a striking brown-haired woman. Incensed, Miss Sweetman posted them on Facebook with a message asking her followers to help her 'find this tramp'. Nikki Sweetman, pictured left and right, had her phone stolen from a taxi in Stratford and she reported the theft to police the following day. A week later, pictures of a brunette woman appeared on her iCloud . The photos have since been shared by nearly 35,000 people across the globe. Miss Sweetman, from Dagenham in Essex, said: 'I was with friends when we saw loads of selfies of this woman coming through. 'I thought 'what the hell?' At first, we laughed and thought it was quite funny. She posted loads of photos of her earrings, which we thought must have been a Christmas present. But then I thought 'she shouldn't get away with this'. 'I'm quite angry that I'm now left with an iPhone 4, while she has my lovely iPhone 5c. 'I decided to share it on Facebook and have had hundreds of responses – including from Texas. 'Then someone who knew the woman in the photos got in touch and told me who she was.' Miss Sweetman said she tracked down the woman's Facebook profile, which showed she was a Latvian national living in London who previously worked as a hotel barmaid. Using a feature on the social networking site, she found out the selfies were taken at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford. Miss Sweetman, whose phone was worth around £500 when she took out the contract eight months ago, added: 'She now knows I'm trying to track her down and she's taken the selfies off Facebook and changed the settings so you can no longer see her location.' Implying the woman might be planning to flee the country, she added: 'I saw friends on her Facebook (page) had posted 'I hope you have your passport' after I shared her photo.' Miss Sweetman said the incident had left her worried about travelling alone. 'I'm now wary and check a taxi is licensed before getting in,' she added. 'The whole thing has made me realise that you shouldn't travel alone or with so many goods on you. It could have been a lot worse.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed they were investigating, but said no one had been arrested.","Nikki Sweetman's handbag was stolen after she took an unlicensed cab .

"NHS chiefs are investigating after two babies died within weeks of each other at a struggling hospital. The deaths of both stillborn infants have been classified as ‘serious incidents’ at the unit which has previously been criticised for its patient care and deteriorating finances. Basildon and Thurrock was one of 11 NHS trusts placed in special measures in July 2013 amid concerns over its above average death rates. Basildon Hospital in Essex is investigating the deaths of two stillborn babies in September last year . It was then given a clean bill of health in June last year, following a ‘good’ rating from the Care Quality Commission. Its maternity unit was also the first in the country to receive an ‘outstanding’ grade. However a regular assessment report has revealed that two babies died within weeks of each other in September, and the hospital has now launched a probe into the matter. One of the mothers was induced at Basildon Hospital in Essex despite staff not checking her full clinical details first. The woman was suffering from high blood pressure, or hypertension, which meant she was categorised as ‘high risk’ – though this has not been confirmed as the direct cause of the baby’s death. The other death is ‘still unexplained’ pending a post-mortem examination. Families involved in the deaths have not been named. Staff have since been instructed to carry out blood pressure tests on women with hypertension as their labour progresses, as the report concluded that there had been ‘no room for complacency’ in the monitoring of the first mother or her baby. Midwives have also been reminded to seek the opinion of medical staff on how to manage women where there is ‘any deviation from the normal’. The review looked into 37 ‘serious incidents’ at the hospital in recent months – 19 of which had ‘moderate to catastrophic’ impact on patients. Stephen Metcalfe, MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock, said he hoped there would not be a repeat of any mistakes. MP Stephen Metcalfe says the hospital is more open and transparent after previous investigations . He said: 'Every complex organisation faces a number of challenges but I have complete confidence in the team. 'The Care Quality Commission has said the trust is moving the right way. It does not mean they can be complacent but we need to work with and support them. 'If the hospital is now reporting more incidents it is because there is now a more open and transparent culture which is willing to accept and investigate mistakes and make sure they do not happen again.' However Dan Chapple, of campaign group Cure The NHS, said promises of further investigation were ‘not good enough’. He said: ‘It is a shame to see the same problems with Basildon hospital recurring at a time when the CQC has deemed this hospital safe enough to be brought out of special measures. ‘The hospital’s normal comment with these sorts of incidents is that they will learn from them but when similar incidents recur year after year it just is not good enough.’ A review last year found deaths among weekend admissions contributed to the hospital's death rate being 11 per cent higher than the average NHS hospital. In the two years to October 2012, there were 544 more deaths than expected. The trust was removed from special measures last June after the quality of services improved. But it emerged last month that health service watchdog Monitor had launched an fresh investigation into the finances of the hospital. Monitor is concerned about a predicted deficit of £14.2m because it is larger than previously expected. Monitor was told about the loss when a revised deficit plan was submitted in November and will now seek to find out why finances have deteriorated and what can be done to fix them. A Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'It is unclear at this stage whether any of the patients died as a direct result of the serious incident as they are still being investigated. 'Basildon Hospital is committed to providing all its patients with safe, high-quality treatment and care. Crucial to that is learning when things go wrong.'","Basildon hospital was previously put in special measures over death rate .

"The Conservatives will today pledge to end six-figure pay-offs in the public sector if they win the general election. Tory sources said the party’s manifesto will promise the swift introduction of a new ‘public sector redundancy pay cap’ to end the culture of obscene ‘golden goodbyes’ to fat cats employed by the State. In future, pay-offs will be limited to a maximum of £95,000 in all but exceptional cases. The BBC's former deputy boss, Mark Byford (left), received £949,000 in 2011. Katherine Kerswell (right) received a £420,000 payment in 2012 after just 20 months in charge of Kent County Council . Senior managers will also have to hand back a portion of their pay-off if they take another job in the public sector within 12 months. The new law will cover the entire public sector, including the civil service, the NHS, local government and the BBC – where some pay-offs have approached £1million. The move will enrage civil service unions, particularly as Tory sources said the cap will be applied to people in existing jobs, not just those signing new contracts. It follows public outrage over a string of gigantic payments to senior officials, many of whom went on to take other jobs elsewhere in the public sector shortly afterwards – a phenomenon known as the ‘revolving door’. Former BBC director-general George Entwistle received a £450,000 pay-off in 2012 after just 54 days in the job. The Corporation’s former deputy director-general, Mark Byford, received £949,000 in 2011. Other big winners included NHS managers Chris Reed and Karen Straughair, who received pay-offs totalling almost £1million in 2013. The married couple went on to earn £120,000 for four months’ hospital work shortly afterwards. Former BBC director-general George Entwistle (pictured) received a £450,000 pay-off in 2012 after just 54 days in the job . Council chiefs have also cashed in under the existing system. Katherine Kerswell received a £420,000 payment in 2012 after just 20 months in charge of Kent County Council. The following year, she was handed a £140,000-a-year job by the Cabinet Office. Michael Lockwood was given a £168,000 pay-off when his role as chief executive of Harrow Council was axed in February last year, only to be re-hired in November. Treasury Minister Priti Patel said last night that the time had come to end the culture of huge public sector pay-offs. She said: ‘It’s not right that hard-working taxpayers, many on low salaries, have to fund huge payouts when well-paid people get made redundant. ‘So we’re going to do something that’s long overdue and that will bring some fairness back to the system.’ Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will warmly welcome this announcement. ‘Over the last few years, these six-figure golden goodbyes have cost hard-pressed taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.’ The move has the potential to slash the cost of future public sector reorganisations. Tory sources say the cap would have saved £125million in 2011/12 alone. Only workers earning less than £27,000 will be exempt from the cap, in order to protect a small number of long-serving public sector employees on modest incomes. The plans will also extend the ability of public sector organisations to claw back payments from people who immediately take a job elsewhere. The Government has already changed the law to require some money to be repaid if a public servant receiving a pay-off of more than £100,000 takes a job in the same sector within 12 months. But the Tories now plan to remove the £100,000 threshold so this applies to all pay-offs.","Manifesto promises introduction of new ‘public sector redundancy pay cap’

"A young boy nearly killed by a dose of ibuprofen have been dealt a second devastating blow - after doctors told him he is going blind. Calvin Lock came down with a suspected viral infection in 2012 and was given a single dose of strawberry-flavoured liquid Nurofen by his mother. But the painkiller triggered an extremely rare reaction which caused his body to burst into blisters and his hair and fingernails to fall out. The now 13-year-old lost 65 per cent of his skin and had to be put on a life support machine for three days. Scroll down for video . Calvin Lock, 13,  has been dealt a devastating blow as doctors say he will go blind due to Severe Ocular Surface Disease, which affects the corneas. In 2012 he suffered a horrific reaction to a dose of Ibuprofen, causing his skin to blister and fall off (right) Calvin Lock, 13, (pictured with mother Robyn Moult and stepfather Daryn Chamber) has been dealt a devastating blow as doctors say he will go blind due to Severe Ocular Surface Disease, which affects the corneas. In 2012 he suffered a horrific reaction to a dose of ibuprofen, causing his skin to blister and fall off . His mother has released pictures of Calvin to raise awareness of Steven Johnson Syndrome, the rare reaction he suffered. Doctors initially diagnosed the then 11-year-old with chicken pox, left, after a rash appeared. But they soon discovered it was SJS which causes skin cells to die and shed, right . Another side-effect of SJS is developing Severe Ocular Surface disease, caused by excessive scarring from the reaction to Ibuprofen. He also suffers trichiasis, where the eyelashes grow inwards . Doctors initially told his family he only had chicken pox, before diagnosing Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), which causes the skin cells die and large parts to shed like a snake. But Calvin's condition worsened and he developed the more serious form of the condition, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, meaning his skin was burning from the inside out. He spent nearly three weeks in Addenbrooke's Hospital receiving treatment before being allowed back to his home in Littleport, Cambridgeshire. His mother Robyn Moult, 40, and stepfather Daryn Chambers, 49, were amazed he survived the condition, which affects around one or two people per million a year. But they have now been left devastated after Calvin developed a painful eye disease that will leave him blind in both eyes within the next two years. He has been diagnosed with Severe Ocular Surface disease  - a severe condition affecting the corneas of his eyes. Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It was named after two US paediatricians who first described it in 1922. It affects around one to two people per million and is more common among women. Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids. If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable. The excessive scarring from the reaction to ibuprofen caused cornea erosions, and scarring of the eye's mucous membranes which affect his eyelids. He also has trichiasis, where the eyelashes grow inwards and has growing vitreous adhesions which causes the gel that fills up the inside of the eye to shrink, liquify and stick to the retina - resulting in blindness. He has had to have operations to attempt to fix his sight, electrolysis to rid his eyes of his eyelashes and further surgery to stop his eyelids from turning inwards. The teenager already struggles to see the board at school, can no longer play video games. And he has to have eye drops put in every hour of every day. Calvin also suffers chronic fatigue, full body scarring, mouth and throat problems, depression, and has been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mrs Moult, who has three older children, said: 'It's an autoimmune condition which will never go away. 'His body will constantly attack itself forever and it's devastating to watch. 'Calvy feels like he has constant grit in his eye, it's extremely painful for him. I try to make him take responsibility but I also don't want to nag, I feel helpless. 'If he forgets to put his eye drops in he's left rolling on the floor in agony. The condition left him with memory loss and this means he frequently does forget. 'He struggles to run around with his friends, it's so much to recover from and he keeps trying to fight it and can't accept that his life has changed. 'His personality is different now, what he went through was so traumatic that he needs treatment for PTSD. Calvin will be talking about his experience next year at the House of Commons where we will be campaigning for National SJS Awareness and launching the first NHS Awareness Poster Campaign . 'He's so intelligent and bright but now he can't be bothered with school, he doesn't see the point because he doesn't think he has a future without his eyesight.' The couple are now planning legal action against the NHS, claiming the original misdiagnosis has made his condition much worse. They claim Addenbrooke's could have done more to prevent the infection and its side effects if staff had acted sooner. The couple say he was twice wrongly diagnosed with chickenpox and a specialist witness employed by their legal team said the diagnosis should have been put to a more senior doctor. They also believe he would have recovered quicker if he had been transferred straight away to the burns unit in Essex. Mrs Moult said: 'There should have been a thorough investigation. 'Clearly the doctor should have consulted a senior member of staff about Calvin's diagnosis. 'He definitely should have been transferred straight to the burns department to prevent more trauma and scarring. 'His care was inadequate and it's left him with debilitating conditions. 'I'm determined he will have a career and an education, and we want to be able to buy him the equipment he will need, such as audio technology, to help him through life.' Calvin fell ill on September 19, 2012 with a sore throat and Mrs Moult gave him the liquid Nurofen after his GP said he had a viral infection. Six days later he returned to the GP with a rash and was diagnosed with chickenpox - which SJS is often mistaken for - and given antibiotics. Calvin, pictured before he suffered the rare reaction to the painkiller in 2011 . The next morning, swelling and rashes had appeared across his body and he was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital. Doctors there also diagnosed chickenpox but it took 24 hours to admit him as an in-patient by which time he was struggling to breathe and unable to walk, talk or see. Calvin was put on a drip as staff started treated more than 200 painful blisters but his condition deteriorated and he was put on a life-support machine. He was transferred to a burns unit where surgeons removed affected skin from 65 per cent of his body. He has now been diagnosed with a range of eye problems which doctors warn will leave him blind, and has already endured operations to fix his sight. Calvin will be talking about his experience next year at The House of Commons where we will be campaigning for National SJS Awareness and launching the first NHS Awareness Poster Campaign. He and his mother have just had their charity SJS Awareness officially registered and started a website sjsawareness.org.uk . A spokesman for Nurofen for Children told the Mail at the time, warnings about the reactions suffered by Calvin are included on the patient information leaflet in 'consumer friendly language'. A spokesperson for Cambridge University Hospitals, who run Addenbrooke's Hospital, said: 'We are unable to comment on individual cases as this would breach patient confidentiality.'","Calvin Lock, 11, was given the painkiller to tackle a viral infection .

"In the future, your electric car will drop you off at work, drive home and charge itself using an automated charger, before coming to pick you up later in the day. That’s the vision of Tesla boss Elon Musk, who tweeted his firm is working on a ‘solid metal snake’ charger that automatically moves out from the wall. The short reveal on Twitter is just one of several new features Tesla is planning to roll out for its electric cars in the next few years. Scroll down for video . Elon Musk said his California-based Tesla is working on automatic chargers. These would autonomously charge Tesla's electric cars. In a tweet (shown) he said it would move 'out from the wall and connect like a solid metal snake'. Musk had previously alluded to the technology at a talk in October . At the moment, Tesla vehicles are charged either by using one of the company’s supercharger station, or plugging the vehicle in when at home. But, the latest technology would eliminate the need for people to manually connect their car to a charger. And, as cars become more automated, this could open up new possibilities for self-driving vehicles. Currently, Tesla has about 100 'Supercharger' stations scattered across North America and Europe that give Model S drivers a free power source when traveling long distances. The technology is designed to replenish about half of the battery power within 20 minutes. Tesla recently opened three Supercharger stations in China and plans to set up 200 more around the world, including Japan, soon. In his tweet Musk wrote: ‘Btw, we are actually working on a charger that moves out from the wall and connects like a solid metal snake. For realz.’ He previously alluded to the technology at the reveal of the Dual Motor version of the Model S back in October. ‘Something I’d like to do...is to have the charge connector plug itself in,’ he said at the time. ‘Like an articulating sort of snake, or something. Just plug itself in. ‘I think we’ll probably do something like that. So then you can just get out of your car and it’ll go park itself in your garage.’ His latest tweet confirms the company's plans to develop the technology. It’s not clear when it will be rolled out, but in another tweet that has since been deleted, Mr Musk said the technology would be used on current and future versions of the Model S. At the moment, Tesla vehicles are charged either by using one of the company’s supercharger stations, or plugging the vehicle in when at home (shown). But the latest technology would eliminate the need for people to manually connect their car to a charger . Is this what Tesla's charger might look like? A video posted to YouTube by OC Robotics showed off the Series II X125 system, which is a 'snake' that can move and support itself in mid-air autonomously, perhaps showing how Tesla's charger will move from the wall to a car . In other Tesla news, last week the firm updated its electric Roadster sports car with a huge boost to its battery, enabling it to drive 400 miles (645km) on a single charge. The upgraded battery pack along with tweaks to its aerodynamics means it will effectively double its range. To prove the capabilities, Mr Musk revealed the firm plans to drive the car from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a single trip. The firm has also made a new aero kit for the car to reduce drag by 15 per cent, and revealed tyres with 20 per cent less drag. 'We have identified a new cell that has 31 per cent more energy than the original Roadster cell,' the company said. 'Using this new cell we have created a battery pack that delivers roughly 70kWh in the same package as the original battery. 'Combining all of these improvements we can achieve a predicted 40 to 50 per cent improvement on range between the original Roadster and Roadster 3.0.'

"Police in Tanzania have arrested the father of a four-year-old albino girl who is feared to have been abducted and murdered so her body parts can be sold to make witch doctors' potions. Pendo Emmanuelle Nundi was snatched from her home in the Mwanza region in the north of the country on Saturday by attackers armed with machetes. The body parts of albino people are said to fetch up to £50,000 in  parts of deeply superstitious Tanzania where they are used to make potions and sold as lucky charms. Women carry their albino children  in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania where police  have arrested the father of a girl feared to have been murdered so her body parts can be sold to make witch doctors' potions (file picture) At least 74 albinos have been murdered in the east African country since 2000, according to United Nations experts. Regional police chief Valentino Mlowola told state television: 'We have arrested four people, including the girl's father. 'We are still in the process of interrogating them so we can find out where the girl is -- if she is still alive,' the official said, adding the attackers may have been tipped off by neighbours. After a spike in killings in 2009, the government placed youngsters in children's homes in a desperate effort to defend them. While Islam and Christianity are the main religions in Tanzania a 2010 survey found that 93 per cent of people still believe in witchcraft. In May last year two witch doctors were arrested after an albino woman was found hacked to death with her fingers and one leg removed in the Simiyu province also in the northern part of the country. An Albino family at home in Tanzania. At least 74 albinos have been murdered in the east African country since 2000, according to United Nations experts . And in August three men armed with machetes hacked off the arm of a 15-year-old albino girl in Tabora in the west of the country. A hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes, albinism affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding in remote and rural communities, experts say. In the West, it affects just one person in 20,000. In August a UN rights expert warned that attacks against albinos were on the rise because Tanzania's October 2015 presidential election was on the horizon, encouraging political campaigners to turn to influential sorcerers for support.","Pendo Emmanuelle Nundi snatched from her home by men with machetes .

"A hapless team of Muslim cyber terrorists whose aim is to hack websites belonging to the world's biggest governments and businesses have mistakenly hijacked Bristol's online bus timetable. A group calling themselves Darkshadow - an 'Arab Security Team' - took over the TravelWest website and replaced it with a sinister Islamic State-style homepage. It is believed the gang though it was an influential site used by millions to book travel around the Western world - not a West Country journey planner. Blunder: A gang of Muslim hackers, believed to be based in Tunisia, hacked a West Country bus timetable site believing it was an influential journey planner used across the Western world . Its users were shocked on New Year's Day when they tried to find out the latest bus and rail times but were met with a black Islamic banner with the message 'hacked by darkshadow', 'Muslum (sic) hackers'. However, rather than bringing the West to the brink of meltdown, it briefly deprived users of travel and congestion information in the Bristol area. Arabic music often used on propaganda films used by groups like ISIS also blasted out of their speakers. The small-scale attack was roundly mocked by bus and rail users via the group’s Facebook page. Several people began contacting the hackers asking them for travel advice in and around Bristol but are yet to get a response. The site is now back in the hands of TravelWest after bus and train travellers were unable to access the timetables throughout New Year's Day. The 'darkshadow' group's Facebook page claims they have previously successfully infiltrated webpages belonging to Philippine Airlines and the El Salvador government. But their latest botched attack has been mocked by people via their Facebook page. Spot the difference: West Country travel bosses have since managed to wrestle back control of the TravelWest site . Upset: People wanting to find out the best way around Bristol on New Year's Day were shocked to see an Islamic black flag when they tried to log on . Warning: When users Google TravelWest they still get the message that it has been hacked . Facebook user Richard Moore wrote: ‘These idiots are the laughing stock of the world. Are the buses running today?’ Another called Saki Piranha commented: ‘Can you fix this little error on the TravelWest site? Nice music by the way.’ One person asked: 'Hi. Can you tell me which bus to get from the station to travel to the city centre? It seems as though you're now giving travel information'. One person wrote: 'Oh dear, can't tell the difference between a local bus company and travel site! Pathetic.' Jenny Johnson added: 'It's a  bus timetable website. Too hard to hack something big.' The TravelWest website usually provides locals with information about train and bus times in and around Bristol. The Facebook page left on the jammed site says the hackers are based in the Tunisian capital of Tunis in North Africa. They appear to target two or three global travel websites all over the world every day. As well as posting their triumphs, the group also upload a series of posts praising Allah.

"A family got a nasty surprise when they went to Nando’s for a meal and were accidentally charged more than £6,000. Days after a father of two was mistakenly charged £59,400 for four rolls of wrapping paper, Aurel Lupsa was overcharged for his Peri Peri chicken – and ended up paying £6,235.88. Mr Lupsa, 43, a telecoms company director, said: ‘We eat at Nando’s all the time, but I’ve never had anything like this. I didn’t really notice I was overpaying to be honest.’ Aurel Lupsa was overcharged by more than £6,000 at the restaurant in Brent Cross, north London . At the end of the meal, Mr Lupsa asked for the bill and told the waitress he wanted to pay by card. He went to the till where he was presented with a bill for £62.35 and then told to check the amount on the chip and pin machine screen. But he didn’t realise the waitress had accidentally keyed in £6,235 – 100 times more than his actual bill. Mr Lupsa said: ‘I initially asked if I could put a £7 tip on my bill, but then my wife had some change, so I asked the waitress to cancel the card tip. During the confusion, she must have put in the wrong amount. Just as we were leaving, the server rushed over and said there had been a mistake. I’m definitely going to pay more attention in the future.’ While £6,235 is a large amount to pay at once, if Mr Lupsa’s account was in credit with this amount or more, the payment would have been approved. Your bank can only refuse to make a payment if you do not have enough funds, if you have broken agreed terms and conditions – such as needing two signatures for a joint account payment – or if it suspects the payment is fraudulent. Banks and card issuers use fraud screening systems to look at your spending profile and detect unusual patterns. Things that might raise concerns include making several purchases quickly, international payments or unusually expensive transactions. If potential fraud is detected, the card is normally blocked. Your bank can only refuse to refund unauthorised payments if it can prove you authorised the transaction or failed to protect your card details, or if you flag up the payment 13 months or more after it left your account. The blunder came as Mr Lupsa visited a Nando’s branch at Brent Cross in North London with his wife Bianca, 43, their seven-year-old daughter Evelyn, his niece and her husband. The table-of-five dined out on wings and Peri Peri chicken before Mr Lupsa settled the bill as a festive treat for his family on December 30. Mr Lupsa, from Barnet, North London, added: ‘Mistakes happen and I’m very glad they caught it before I walked away.’ He added: ‘I can’t believe the most expensive meal of my life was at Nando’s. It’s good chicken, but it’s not that good.’ Nando’s said they were aware of the incident and are investigating. A spokesman for Nando's said: 'Our staff were under the impression the customer ordered our 1992 vintage Peri-Peri sauce - hence the confusion! 'We immediately refunded the transaction and apologised for the error.' Last week a father told of his horror when he was charged nearly £60,000 for wrapping paper for his children's Christmas presents. Dean Baker from Birmingham complained to the Card Factory which overcharged him, but was only reimbursed following a public campaign. Mr Baker, 32, said the mistake left him unable to buy last-minute presents for his daughters Eden, seven, and 18-month-old Harriet. The cable engineer, from Erdington, Birmingham, said: ‘The girl on the till was a trainee. When I put my card in the machine she said it hadn’t worked and asked me to do it again, so I did. I didn’t think of it any more.’ The family dined on chicken wings and chips before being given the astonishing bill in north London . Mr Lupsa's chicken meal with chips. The 43-year-old said he would pay more attention to bills in the future . Mr Lupsa was with his wife, Bianca Minolachi (left) and their daughter, Evelyn (right), at the time . He only became aware there was a problem when his card was declined on Christmas Eve. ‘I went to a cashpoint and couldn’t believe my eyes when the balance came up as nearly £60,000 overdrawn,’ he said. The money has now been refunded and Mr Baker received apologies from TSB Bank and Card Factory. Last year a teenager in Wales was also left massively overdrawn after he was charged £179,932.32 for a pizza from Domino’s in Newport. Nathaniel Bolwell, 19, tried to pay for the £17.99 meal with his card. Domino’s staff were given an authorisation code of 3232– which was accidentally added to the price. When his card was declined at a supermarket, he decided to check his account. He said: ‘I was massively overdrawn. I was terrified I might have to pay it off.’ Domino’s and Lloyds Bank investigated, the money was paid back two days later and a Lloyds spokesman said the bank ‘regretted the inconvenience’.","Aurel Lupsa was dining out with his family at the north London restaurant .

"With the return of Sherlock Holmes from the dead and a dramatic festive episode from Coronation Street, last year’s television on New Year’s Day was always going to be hard to beat. But this Thursday’s bank holiday schedule of soap operas, sitcoms and old films managed it, attracting an extra 5million viewers on top of last year’s ratings. A comparison of the top five shows from both years reveals the number of viewers rose from 30million on January 1, 2014, to 35million this year. Scroll down for video . Figures showed Thursday's schedule of soap operas, sitcoms and old films saw viewers drop from 41million on January 1, 2014, to just 35million this year . An hour-long EastEnders special was Thursday’s most watched programme, with 8.5million switching on, beating the 6.8million who tuned in to Sherlock last year. Coronation Street, the second most watched show of last New Year’s Day, did not have a January 1 episode this year. BBC1 claimed four of the top five spots on Thursday – up from three last year – with Mrs Brown’s Boys, the final episode of Miranda and an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot all joining EastEnders. Fifth place was taken by ITV’s Emmerdale, with 4.9million viewers seeing character Lachlan White suffer a health scare after taking a legal high. The audience was smaller than that for last year’s offering from the soap, which was watched by 5.3million and came fourth in the list of most watched programmes. EastEnders topped the charts with a dramatic episode that saw Lucy Beale’s killer confronted, a car crash leave one person dead and Ronnie go into labour on her wedding day. It also outperformed its episode from New Year’s Day 2014, attracting an extra 2.5million viewers. Last year, the soap had 6million people tune in, placing it third, after Sherlock and Coronation Street. An hour-long EastEnders special, which featured a dramatic car crash out the Queen Victoria,  was Thursday’s most watched programme, with 8.5million switching on . The Miranda finale was enjoyed by 7.3 million - beating the 6.7 million who watched the Christmas Day episode . In Miranda’s finale, the character’s long-awaited wedding to Gary was enjoyed by 7.3million – beating the 6.7million who watched the Christmas Day episode. Esio Trot, based on Roald Dahl’s children’s book of the same name, was the only offering in the top five not to be part of an established series. It had 6.5million viewers. Starring Oscar winners Dame Judi Dench and Dustin Hoffman, the programme received rave reviews on Twitter. But while Dame Judi’s performance was called ‘legendary’ and Hoffman’s ‘perfect’, social media users were scathing of James Corden’s narration. Viewers branded The Wrong Mans star ‘awful’ and accused him of ‘ruining’ the show. One even suggested Dahl would be ‘spinning in his grave’.","Figures show 30million viewers tuned into New Year TV in 2014 .

"The U.S. Attorney's Office for . the District of Columbia will not pursue criminal charges . against John Hinckley Jr. for the death of former White House . press secretary James Brady, the prosecutor's office said on . Friday. Brady was gravely wounded in 1981 when Hinckley tried to . assassinate President Ronald Reagan in Washington. He was . incapacitated from the shooting for the rest of his life and . died in August at 73. A Virginia medical examiner then controversially ruled Brady's death a murder, . sparking an investigation by District of Columbia police into the shooting 33 years earlier. No charges: The death  of former White House press secretary James Brady, who was shot during an attempted assassination against President Reagan in 1981, was ruled a homicide in August, but prosecutors now say shooter John Hinckley Jr. will not face any charges . Attack: This photograph from March, 1980, shows a U.S. secret service agent with an automatic weapon watching over James Brady (center and Washington DC police officer, Thomas Delahanty, left) the president's secretary, after being wounded in an attempt on the life of President Ronald Reagan in Washington . Assassination attempt: Secret Service agent Timothy J. McCarthy, Washington policeman Thomas K. Delehanty, and White House press secretary, James Brady, lie wounded after shots were fired at Reagan . Reagan, a police officer and a Secret Service agent also were . wounded in the attack. Since a jury in 1982 found Hinckley not guilty by reason of . insanity, prosecutors could not argue that he was sane when he . shot Brady, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement today. In addition, before 1987 District of Columbia courts abided . by the 'year and a day rule,' under which homicide charges could . only be brought if the victim died within a year and a day of . the injury causing death, the statement said. After he was shot, Brady became a gun control activist. Hinckley has been in a mental hospital since the shooting. The prosect of him being charged over Brady's death was always unlikely, experts said. 'I think it (the medical examiner's ruling) will mean nothing,' long-time Hinckley attorney Barry Levine said in August following his client's death. 'No prosecutors will bring such a case. 'The notion that this could be a successful prosecution is far-fetched. 'There is no legal basis to pursue this.' No charges: John Hinckley Jr - pictured taking a stroll near his mother's house earlier this year - was found not guilty of attempted assassination by reason of insanity . A court . had recently ruled that he could spend 17 days a month with his family . in Virginia, but a judge warned at the time that he still 'exhibits . deceptive behavior'. As . part of a carefully monitored program, the 58-year-old is allowed to . stay on an exclusive gated estate set among the lush greens of a golf . course near Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley . was in his 20s when he fired several shots at President Reagan outside a . hotel on March 31, 1981, apparently in an attempt to get the attention . of Jodie Foster. One bullet missed the President's heart by about an inch, and he lost nearly half his body's blood supply. Campaign: After the attack, which left Brady - pictured with his wife Sarah in 2011 - paralyzed, he became an advocate for gun control . Three others, including Brady who was hit in the head by a bullet, were seriously wounded. The press secretary was left paralyzed on the left side of his body and later dedicated his life to gun control by starting the Brady Campaign which has been the most vocal campaign to outlaw assault weapons. Police officer Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy recovered from their wounds.","Former White House press secretary James Brady died in August aged 73 .

"Four-year-old Tilly Anderson-Graham was bitten up to 25 times in a vicious dog attack . A mother has slammed police who refused to investigate a vicious dog attack after the animal jumped into her car and attacked her four-year-old daughter. Samantha Anderson-Graham, 38, was driving along a country lane in Bures St Mary, Suffolk, when she saw a Lakeland terrier in the middle of the road and got out to shoo it to safety. But as she did, it leapt in through her door and daughter Tilly was frantically bitten 25 times on her arms, legs and face, as her terrified 12-year-old brother Joe looked on in shock. The mother-of-four, from Sudbury in Suffolk, was able to get the dog out of the car and reported the incident to the police but claims she was told it was her 'responsibility' for letting the dog in. It was only after Mrs Anderson-Graham sent letters, photographs and then lodged an official complaint against Suffolk Constabulary that police even recorded the crime. She said: 'The dog was on top of her, mauling her, and she was just screaming. 'When I managed to get her out the car and into my arms he was jumping up and with every jump he bit her again and again. 'At one point the dog was actually hanging off her bottom and I had to punch it to unlock its jaw. 'How can they say that a dog mauling a four-year-old girl is not a case? I've lost all faith in the police. It's disgusting.' She added that the dog initially seemed friendly and she had left it in the car while she went to knock on a nearby door to find the owner. It was while she was walking back to the car that she heard blood-curdling screams and sprinted to the vehicle to find the dog attacking her four-year-old daughter. Tilly was in her mother's car when the Lakeland Terrier jumped in through the door and started biting her . 'My heart just dropped,' she said. 'She was screaming, I was screaming, and Joe was just in complete shock. 'It went on for about three to four minutes with the dog just biting her while I tried to hold her above my chest, but it felt like a lifetime. It bit her, I would say, 20 to 25 times.' The dog eventually stopped when another driver arrived on the scene and used a belt to restrain the pet, and hunted for the owner. Mrs Anderson-Graham, who was also bitten, and Tilly were taken to West Suffolk Hospital for tetanus injections and antibiotics, and medics steri-stripped her wounds. But while taking her husband, Justin Anderson-Graham, home she claims officers told the 40-year-old electrician there was no case to answer - before officially interviewing anyone involved. She sustained injuries to her face, legs (left), hip (right) and arms before she was rushed to West Suffolk Hospital for tetanus injections and antibiotics. Medics had to steri-strip her wounds . 'He said first of all once a dog got into my car that was my responsibility,' she said. 'I told him 'I don't think so'. 'Then after he said he would look into it he said to me ""we don't know what happened in that car, you daughter could have been teasing it, there's no case"". 'I said ""excuse me, have you asked my daughter? No. She's still in bits"". I was devastated. 'It was absolutely awful and the fact I had to lodge an official complaint to get it investigated is disgusting.' After more than two weeks of apparently ignored emails to officers, Mrs Anderson-Graham lodged an official complaint and a senior inspector took on the case. Samantha Anderson-Graham, right, with her daughter. She had got out her car to help shoo the dog to safety when it jumped in and began attacking Tilly, while her terrified 12-year-old brother watched on in shock . Gamekeeper Trevor Edwards, 50, was eventually charged and he pleaded guilty to two counts of owning a dog which caused injury while dangerously out of control. The court ordered the Lakeland terrier, called Eddie, should be destroyed and he was told to pay £2,000 compensation to the family. That included £1,500 to traumatised Tilly, £300 to Mrs Anderson-Graham and £200 to Joe. A spokesman from Suffolk Police said: 'When this incident was first reported to police, the initial assessment of the officer who attended was that no criminal offences had taken place. 'A subsequent review of the circumstances found that the case warranted further police investigation, and as a result the owner of the dog was reported for a summons to court. 'We hope that the victims are happy with the outcome of the court hearing and regret any distress caused over the initial handling of this case, which is currently being reviewed.'","Samantha Anderson-Graham was driving along country lane with children .

"Relationship counsellors and lawyers have dubbed today 'Divorce Day' as it is the time when most couples file for divorce. A quarter of parents have secretly considered separating from their partner and the first day back from the festive break is when they are most likely to act on their feelings. After months, or even years, of thinking about it, the stress of a frenetic Christmas and the start of the New Year, are the catalyst for relationship breakdowns. After months or even years of thinking about divorce, the beginning of January is when couples act on it . Andrew Newbury, head of family law at Slater & Gordon, told MailOnline: 'We see a real spike in people enquiring about divorce in January, with twice as many than any other period. 'There are a whole host of reasons for this. One is the hot-house pressure of Christmas, with couples cooped up who might also have had too much food and too much alcohol. 'Two weeks at home can put pressure on couples and if expectations on Christmas are not met there can be a sense of disappointment which can lead them to look at their lives. 'Some people also discover affairs around Christmas with a text message on Christmas Day or the announcement of a new relationship. 'For others, they have been thinking about divorce for a few months or a year and they make it a New Year resolution to finally file for divorce to have a new start.' Now a support charity is calling on couples to bring in experts to help them repair their relations. A poll by OnePlusOne charity found six in 10 people in a relationship admitting to having problems, but only 23 per cent had never sought help from friends, family or professionals. Less than five per cent had turned to a professional therapist or counsellor or a support service for help. OnePlusOne Director Penny Mansfield CBE said: 'People rarely decide to separate or divorce suddenly – often they've been thinking about it for months, if not years. 'Seeking help at an earlier stage – when the first thoughts about separation creep in – can be the first step in resolving problems and make the likelihood of splitting up less likely. 'But for many people, the additional stress of Christmas and the start of the New Year bring these underlying problems to the surface, and they make their final decision to part. 'Separated parents who are able to communicate with one another effectively and are able to work out arrangements about money and the children early on have the best chance of preventing their children becoming stuck in the middle of their disputes.' A quarter of parents have considered separating from their partner and January sees a rise in enquiries . Government figures show that more than half of parents say they find it hard to access the support they need to agree future childcare arrangements when they separate. And a recent poll of children aged 14 to 18 with divorced parents found a third said their parents had tried turning them against one another during their dispute. Jo O'Sullivan, Family Solicitor at O'Sullivan Family Law, who advises relationships charity OnePlusOne said: 'We definitely see a peak in enquiries about divorce in January and by the time people come to us for legal advice, emotions can be running high. 'In TV dramas we see battling parents fighting custody and childcare issues out in court, but court should only ever be a final resort. 'Alternatives to court, like family mediation and collaborative practice, reduce the stress of a split on children and lead to better outcomes.' OnePlusOne is urging parents who are thinking of separating, or have already done so, to visit its website and find out more about its free courses, help and support.","Relationship counsellors and lawyers have dubbed today 'Divorce Day'

"A lemon-sized skull unearthed in Montana is evidence of the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in North America. It belongs to a distant relative of Triceratops, called Aquilops americanus, which was markedly smaller and lighter than its truck-sized ancestors. The discovery could help palaeontologists understand how horned dinosaurs evolved their fierce facial features. Scroll down for interactive module . A lemon-sized skull unearthed in Montana is evidence of the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in North America. It belongs to a distant relative of Triceratops, called Aquilops americanus, which was markedly smaller and lighter than its truck-sized ancestors . Experts have struggled for decades to reconstruct the early evolutionary history of Ceratopsia – herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs - in North America, because of a limited fossil record, but this latest discovery could shed new light. The dinosaur name means ‘American eagle face’. It would have weighed just three pounds (1.4kg), and was the size of a small cat, measuring just two feet long (61cm), according to the study published in Plos One. It lived in the Early Cretaceous Period - around 108 million years ago. Its diminutive size contrasts with its later, and more famous relative, Triceratops, which weighed 4,000 times more. Aquilops’ skull, which measures just 3.3 inches (8.4cm) long, has a distinctive hooked beak-like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks (illustrated) Record: Aquilops Americanus is the earliest known horned dinosaur species in North America. Name: The animal's Latin name means American eagle face. Skull features: A distinctive hooked beak-like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks. Age: The creature lived in the Early Cretaceous Period. The fossil is thought to be 108 million years old. Weight: Three lbs (1.4kg). Size: Two ft long (61cm). Family: It's a distant relative of Triceratops. Relevance: The fossil could help palaeontologists understand how horned dinosaurs evolved. Discovery: The fossil was unearthed in 1997 in Montana. Aquilops’ skull measures just over three inches (8cm) long, and has a distinctive hooked beak-like structure and a pointed cavity on its cheeks. The dinosaur lacks the later species’ trademark head shield and facial horns and is comparatively ‘no frills,’ experts at the Sam Noble Museum in Oklahoma said. The fossil was discovered by a team of paleontologists led by Rich Cifelli in 1997, and the dinosaur is now considered the oldest member of the horned dinosaur lineage in North America. Andrew Farke, the from Raymond M. Alf Museum of Palaeontology in Claremont, California, who led the study, told the BBC that the animal is closely related to similar species in Asia. ‘Aquilops lived nearly 20 million years before the next oldest horned dinosaur named from North America. ‘Even so, we were surprised that it was more closely related to Asian animals than those from North America.’ Experts predict that by studying other horned fossil records, they will find that the ancestors of Aquilops may have come from Asia. The dinosaur lacks the later species’ trademark head shield and facial horns and is comparatively ‘no frills,’ according to one expert. A 3D-printed version of the skill is pictured on a Triceratops' skull, to give people an idea of how small the newly-discovered dinosaur was . The fossil record suggests horned dinosaurs arose in Asia and spread to North America near the Bering Strait by about 108 million years ago - the age of Aquilops. Surprisingly, however, the study places Aquilops near the base of this tree, removed from horn-bearing Triceratops and other relatives (diagram pictured) If this proves true, it would support theories of an ‘intercontinental migratory event’ between Asia and North America, which palaeontologists think may have occurred in the late Early Creataceous, between 113 million and 105 million years ago. Experts have created 3D models of the dinosaur and will add details to it as they learn more about the prehistoric creature. The skull itself will be featured in a new exhibit in the museum’s Hall of Ancient Life and will sit alongside its Pentaceratops, which holds the Guinness World Record for being the largest dinosaur skull ever found. The dinosaur (illustrated), whose name means ‘American eagle face’ would have weighed just three pounds (1.4kg), and was the size of a small cat, measuring just two feet long (61cm), according to the study . The skull, unearthed in Montana is the earliest horned dinosaur species ever found in North America. Outcrops of Cloverly Formation within the Bighorn Basin of Montana and Wyoming are shown in orange . Triceratops (pictured) first appeared in the late Cretaceous period, about 68 million years ago and unlike its earlier relative, was the size of a truck.

"More snow and ice is expected to hit northern Britain today – while the South is set to enjoy unseasonably warm temperatures. Rain in the North was expected to turn to snow overnight last night, with up to an inch set to fall on higher ground in the Peak District and Lake District. The Met Office has issued ice warnings for this morning covering most of Scotland. Scroll down for video . Cold weather blasted walkers on the beach in Whitby, Yorkshire as icy winds crossed the north . Further south in Derbyshire, the early morning yesterday was bathed in sunshine at Chatsworth House . But while Scotland and northern England could also see 50mph winds, southern England can look forward to unseasonably mild temperatures of up to 13C (55F) over the weekend. Met Office forecaster Alister McHardy said: ‘We have an Atlantic weather system coming in from the West which is going to bring some outbreaks of rain to the North West. ‘We can also expect to see some quite heavy spells of snow on higher ground on Saturday, mostly across the North in areas such as the Peak District and the Lake District – a few centimetres in some areas. ‘We are also likely to see rainfall up to 15 millimetres on higher grounds in Wales. ‘But areas such as Devon, Cornwall and Hampshire can expect to see very mild conditions for the time of year.’ Forecasters have issued a yellow warning of ice for Scotland until 10am today, warning of ‘difficult driving conditions’. But tomorrow’s temperatures are likely to be milder in northern Britain.

"China's elite have angered animal rights groups by rediscovering their taste for tiger products. Wealthy Chinese are buying tiger bone wine and tiger skin rugs as status symbols to show off their riches. The wine – which is sold openly in shops – is made using the bones of tigers and sells for £200 for an eight-year vintage. China's elite have angered animal rights groups by rediscovering their taste for tiger products (file picture) The barbaric trade is on the rise because of the increase in the number of tiger farms in China. The global wild tiger population is estimated to be fewer than 4,000, but it is understood 6,000 are being held in 200 farms across China. The Environmental Investigation Agency, an international pressure group which exposed the trade, said that the increased supply has resulted in more demand. Spokeswoman Debbie Banks said: ‘The argument put forward by the tiger-farming lobby is that farmed tiger products will flood the market, relieving pressure on wild tigers. ‘This is a ridiculous notion and has turned into a disastrous experiment.’ One farm alone called the Xiongshen Tiger and Bear Mountain Village in the southern city of Guilin houses more than 1,000 tigers and 500 bears - which are farmed to extract their bile for another wine. Shops in the town sell bottles of wine in the shape of tigers and list the main ingredient as African lions and the bones of ‘precious animals’.

The zoo claims it has government approval to make wine from ‘the skeletons of animals which have died of natural causes’. The wealthy customers who buy the beverage use it for medicinal purposes and because they believe it is part of Chinese culture. Others are putting tiger pelts in their homes or giving stuffed tigers to family members.

"Michael Swales, 41, admitted theft when he appeared at Burnley Magistrates Court . A trusted friend stole more than £4,000 from under a pensioner’s mattress after he confided that he was saving the cash for his funeral. Trevor Barker, 72, who had no children, treated Michael Swales, 41, like a son and told him about the money so it could be spent in the event of his death. But the jobless lodger betrayed Mr Barker’s trust by sneaking into his bedroom and helping himself to £4,200 of the £6,000 cash. Unbeknown to retired factory worker Mr Barker, Swales was addicted to drugs and blew the money on cocaine and heroin. Yesterday Mr Barker said he had been left ‘heartbroken’ after Swales, whom he had known for 25 years, admitted theft. He will face jail when he is sentenced later this month. ‘I treated this man like my own son and he threw it back in my face,’ Mr Barker said. ‘It has broken my heart to think of what he has done. He has betrayed my trust in the most terrible way. ‘That money was there for my funeral, he only knew it was there because I told him about it. I was going to leave him the house. I wake up each morning and I want to be sick. ‘I didn’t know he had a problem with drugs, but if he had told me I probably would have given him some money to help him.’ Burnley Magistrates’ Court was told that 18 months ago, Swales asked Mr Barker – who suffers from arthritis – if he could temporarily move into his semi-detached home in Colne, Lancashire, as he was having trouble finding a flat. Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Mr Barker, who had known Swales since he was a 16-year-old apprentice at the textiles factory where he worked, agreed. ‘Mr Barker had let [it be] known to the Swales family that he had been saving up for his funeral and had managed to save about £6,000,’ Miss Akhtar said. ‘He told the defendant that if anything should happen to him, it was kept between two mattresses on his bed. Mr Barker needs two mattresses to assist him to get in bed.’ But last month, Mr Barker noticed £4,200 had gone missing. He called the police, but they found no signs of a burglary. ‘When Mr Barker was checking his money, he noticed £4,200 had gone missing,’ Miss Akhtar said. ‘He allowed Michael Swales to reside at his property and clearly he’s been taken advantage of.’ Nick Cassidy, for Swales, said the theft was ‘truly despicable’, adding that his client was sorry for his ‘grave error of judgment’. ‘He is the first to accept the discomfort the victim must feel and is truly remorseful and sorry for his actions,’ Mr Cassidy said. ‘He has, unfortunately, been battling with a drug addiction for some time. ‘On the day of this offence, he had relapsed. He was trying to fund a drug addiction whilst reliant on benefits.’ Swales was given bail on condition that he did not contact Mr Barker or go to his home. Magistrates warned him the offence was in breach of a ‘high degree of trust’. Trevor Barker, 72, who has no children, had hidden the money between his mattresses and confided in Swales because he wanted to make sure it got spent on his funeral. He says the theft has 'broken my heart' Mr Barker said: 'It has broken my heart to think of what he has done. I wake up each morning and I want to be sick. 'I didn't know he had a problem with drugs but - if he had told me, I probably would have given him some money to help him. 'He has betrayed my trust in the most terrible way and I just do not know what to do. I just can't believe it after all the help I have given him over the years. 'When he moved into his own place I gave him my three piece suite sofa, a cooker, electrical kettle and curtains. I gave him everything to set himself up and then I used to go over and take him food. I'm surprised he didn't take the shirt off my back.' He added: 'I used to work with Michael and I thought you could not have wished to have met a nicer lad. I met him when he was just 16 and the factory foreman had said to me ""will you work with that young man - he is very shy"" and I said sure.' 'I had once been a butcher when I left school and it turned out his uncle was a butcher in the place across from where I worked and I knew him. 'So I went to meet his mother and family and I have been a friend of the family ever since. It's heart-breaking to think he could betray me like this.'","Trevor Barker, 72, who has no children, confided in Michael Swales, 41 .

"Four passengers were injured today after a plane was blown off the runway amid 80mph winds, as Britain braces itself for days of grey skies and heavy downpours. The twin-propeller Saab 340 was attempting to take off from Stornoway Airport on the Isle of Lewis just before 8.30am when strong gusts caused it to veer off the tarmac and nose-dive into the grass, sparking a major investigation. It came as a deep Atlantic depression whipped Machrihanish, Argyll, with 77mph winds, while gales of 71mph were detected in Edinburgh. Depsite a wind warning remaining in place for the Shetland Islands - where gales of around 75mph are expected until about 11pm tonight - forecasters say the wind will continue to ease this evening. But it will still be a weekend of miserable weather for most people, as a band of low pressure  sweeps across the UK tomorrow, drenching the southern and central areas with up to 15mm rain. High winds caused a plane to veer off the runway as it attempted to take off at Stornoway Airport on the Isle of Lewis this morning . The twin-propeller Saab 340 was carrying 28 people and had been due to fly to Glasgow at 8.35am. Four people were injured . The incident involving a Saab 340 aircraft operated by Loganair happened at 8.33am today, amid winds of up to 80mph in Scotland . A passenger had a miracle escape after the barrier to a car park blew through the window of their Renault Clio in Ellesmere Port . Meanwhile, top temperatures will be above average for this time of year, with the mercury expected to reach a balmy 13C in the south west. London, which is around 10C today, will see highs of around 9C, while temperatures could reach 6C in Scotland and up to 7C in northern England. Today's windy weather wreaked havoc across the country, with most areas experiencing gales of at least 40mph. The Loganair flight, which was carrying 28 people, had been due to fly to Glasgow at 8.35am but remained grounded as two people were taken to Western Isles Hospital with minor injuries. Police said two men were taken to hospital, while two women sustained minor injuries, but declined medical assistance. An investigation has now been launched into the incident and a spokesman said normal operations should resume once the plane has been removed from the runway. The Stornoway area had seen gales of around 40mph, while there were also winds of 69mph recorded in Yorkshire. Amid the strong winds, a passenger had a miracle escape when a car park barrier smashed through a vehicle’s windscreen  at a shopping centre in Ellesmere Port. Police said both the driver and passenger of the gold Renault Clio escaped unscathed after the incident at the Cheshire Oaks centre. This rare natural atmospheric phenomenon was captured on the North Yorkshire and County Durham border yesterday evening . An almost-complete rainbow was spotted at night near Hutton Magna. It is known as a 'Moonbow' The phenomenon is caused by the moon's light being reflected and refracted off water droplets in the air . A stunning rainbow shone onto a herd of cows in the Peak District, Derbyshire, as the grey sky loomed behind . The car was being driven in to a car park at the time of the incident and the large barrier, which was open at the time, came crashing in to the vehicle and through a passenger window at the rear of the car. A spokesman for Cheshire Police said: 'At around 2:15pm on Thursday 1st January 2015 officers were called to an incident on Stanney Woods Avenue, Longlooms Road East in Ellesmere Port involving a car which had been hit by piece of the road barrier. 'The car, a gold Renault Clio was damaged when the barrier swung out into the middle of the road smashing through the passenger side of the windscreen. The driver of the vehicle and passenger were both uninjured in the incident.' Despite the strong gusts, yesterday was one of the warmest New Year's Days on record, with blue skies across most of the country leading to a clear evening. In County Durham, one walker spotted a 'moonbow', a rare natural atmospheric phenomenon in which a rainbow appears at night. The phenomenon, spotted at Hutton Magna, is caused by the moon's light being reflected and refracted off water droplets in the air. A couple made the most of the clear blue skies and sunshine in the market town of Helmsley, North Yorkshire this morning . The pair walked their Labrador through Duncombe Park, amid balmy temperatures which are above average for this time of year . There were clear skies and warm temperatures this morning at Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, as many parts of the UK were whipped by high winds . Rutting deer were spotted at Chatsworth this morning. Despite cold night-time temperatures, there is no immediate sign of another cold snap . This three-day forecast shows a clear day today, followed by heavy rain over many parts of central and southern England tomorrow . But tonight will see the last of the clear skies, as a band of low-pressure sweeps across the UK tomorrow, bringing up to 15mm of rain across most of Wales and south and central England. Those living in northern England will escape the worst of the wet weather and could see some sunshine. But forecasters say there could even be some snow on high grounds, including the Lake District, Snowdonia and the Pennines. Meanwhile, top temperatures will be above average for this time of year, with the mercury expected to reach a balmy 13C in the south west. London, which is around 10C today, will see highs of around 9C, while temperatures could reach 6C in Scotland and up to 7C in northern England. On Sunday, most parts of the country can expect to see some sunshine, particularly in the east of England. But there will be heavy rain in western areas, while the mercury will drop by around two degrees in most parts of the UK. Britons should also be braced for some cold nights, with an ice warning in place for most of Scotland tonight, where temperatures could plunge to -6C. Dan Williams from the Met Office said there could also be patchy fog early tomorrow and Sunday morning, due to the cold temperatures. Night-time temperatures in North Wales could reach -5C, while the Midlands and the south will remain at just above zero. However, there is no immediate sign of another significant cold snap, the Met Office said. Next week looks to be more unsettled, with high temperatures, followed by strong gales on Wednesday. Leon Brown, meteorologist at The Weather Channel UK, said a very deep Atlantic depression will pass just south of Iceland by the middle of next week bringing gales over the north on Wednesday and some heavy rain too. That rain will move southwards late Wednesday to Thursday and will be heaviest over West Wales and western England, he added.","Twin-propeller Saab 340 was attempting to take off at Stornoway Airport on the Isle of Lewis just before 8.30am .

"A group of asylum seekers in Sweden started a protest when the location of provided accommodation was not to their liking. The 40 Syrian refugees had arrived in Grytan, some 330 miles north of Stockholm, on New Year's Eve, but some refused to get off the bus. Instead, 34 refugees announced they would remain in their seats until they were taken elsewhere, and some  started a hunger strike. A group of asylum seekers in Sweden refused to get off a bus to their accommodation because they thought it was too 'cold and rural' Grytan is a small village located in Jamtland count, about ten miles south of the city of Östersund, which has a population of around 60,000. 'They were disappointed when they came here. It was cold and not a big city,' Bengt Sandin from Jamtland County Police said. The asylum seekers, who arrived in Grytan from a centre in Malmo, claimed they had been under the impression that they would be driven a short distance, but instead travelled for 15 hours. The Swedish Migration Board, however, say they were perfectly clear about where the bus was heading and that information was provided for the asylum seekers before they left Malmo. 'You are offered a place and there are currently no  places in southern Sweden,' Swedish Migration Board's Pierre Karatzian told Expressen. 'These are the places on offer, or you have an opportunity to sort out accommodation on your own.' Moaweyh Ramliy, a Palestinian man who fled from Syria, said he and the other protesters wanted to go back to Malmo, or to a city, where he said it would be easier for them to learn Swedish. 'We dont want to be here, we want to go back to Malmo,' he told Aftonbladet. The 40 Syrian refugees had arrived in Grytan, near Östersund, some 1,050km (650 miles) north of Malmo on New Year's Eve, but some refused to get off the bus . He later added: 'There are now several of us who are going on a hunger strike.' After the first night sleeping on the bus, ten of the protesting asylum seekers moved in to the accommodation, and were followed by the others on Friday. Foreign nationals seeking asylum in Sweden are offered temporary accommodation for one to three months, but cannot chose where the housing is located. 'We have experienced sometimes that asylum-seekers have a idea of what to expect in Sweden,' The Migration Board's press officer Fredrik Bengtsson told Aftonbladet. 'When that image does not correspond to reality, it becomes a problem.'","Asylum seekers from Syria were unhappy with accommodation offered .

"Police arrested a man for suspected drink-driving after he crashed his small car-based van into the side of a police station. The 49-year-old man collided into the side of Frodsham police station in Cheshire at 12.20am today. It is believed the man lost control of his Ford Fiesta van as it 'rolled' off a car park into the side of the police station.

The suspect hit the side of Frodsham Police Station in Cheshire, pictured, at 12.20am today . Officers arrested the man on suspicion of drink driving, and then tweeted a photograph of the incident on the Cheshire police official Twitter feed. Cheshire police released two tweets about the incident: “Man arrested for #drinkdrive after losing control on a car park and crashing into Frodsham police station. #epicfail”, and: “Male in Frodsham kindly handed himself in for drink driving #drivenintostationwall” The Ford Fiesta suffered a crumpled bonnet as it smashed through a fence and dropped into a hole beside the police station. A 49-year-old man is currently on bail. According to the Chester Chronicle PC Adam Norton was on duty inside the station which is between Runcorn and Ellesmere Port, when he heard a crunch. PC Norton's colleague PC Greg Thompson said: 'There’s no major damage, no structural damage, he has just pushed the fence out of the post.'

"The founders of a new US clothing brand have been inundated with criticism after they called their company IRA Apparel. The firm has been flooded with messages pointing out they share a name with the notorious Irish Republican Army, whose successors carried out bombings and attacks in Northern Ireland and Britain. The San Francisco-based firm was even forced to issue a statement insisting it has 'no affiliation with any terror groups'. A US-based skateboard clothing firm called IRA has been forced to issue a statement insisting they have no connection with the Irish Republican Army or its successors . The firm uses the acronym - which stands for Impact Reduction Apparel - to promote its caps and T-shirts . The tiny company was launched in September last year when it declared itself: 'The name that will change the game.' Its main product is called the 'IRA Skullcap', a padding cushion which can be fitted inside baseball caps for the safety of skateboarders. The company stated: 'We are scared for kids these days and have responded to the need by developing the IRA Skullcap.' Promoters of the firm later took to skate parks in California, handing out IRA stickers for teenagers to put on their skateboards. But, as the firm's reputation grew, it was quickly pointed out to them that the acronym they had chosen - which stands for Impact Reduction Apparel - had other connotations around the world. And as news of the company's name spread across the Atlantic this week, the level of criticism and mockery grew to such a point that bosses had to issue a statement. But the name caused anger on Twitter after the huge letters were emblazoned across the company's feed . After they were deluged with messages, the firm released a statement denying any connection with Ireland . It stated: 'Impact Reduction Apparel is who we are. We have no affiliation with ANY terror groups. We make products that keep skateboarders safe.' It came after one Twitter user tweeted to the company asking: 'Any plans to sell bomber jackets?' Another asked: 'Do you do anything in camouflage? What about berets?' and one posted: 'Surely that's only a Provisional name?' Website user Peter Burns summed up many people's thoughts  when he wrote: 'Jaysus lads... would have been hard to google IRA before committing your brand to it?' The company has been inundated with jokes and criticism of its choice of name . The skateboarding company is the latest to be criticised for insensitivity towards victims of terrorism in Ireland and the UK. U.S. cocktail bars have previously been chided for serving 'Irish car bombs', drinks made by mixing Baileys, Irish whiskey and Guinness. An IRA victim’s group, Fair, said last year: 'I would have expected Americans, of all people, to behave more sensitively and responsibly. How would they like it if we developed the Al-Qaeda car bomb, the Twin Towers cocktail or the 9/11 ice-cream sundae?' London's Adventure Bar was also forced to apologise after it named one of its deserts 'Sundae, Bloody Sundae', a reference to when 13 people were killed in 1972. Last year, the South Korean car manufacturer Kia announced it would not sell a model called the 'Provo' in the UK, as the name was often used to refer to the Provisional IRA during The Troubles.","San Francisco-based firm's name stands for Impact Reduction Apparel .

"Britain's smartest web experts and technology entrepreneurs could be hired by spy agencies to help tackle global threats. Plans are being drawn up to allow high fliers to join the GCHQ listening agency on a short-term contract instead of signing up as spooks for life. The scheme would be based on Teach First in which graduates spend at least two years in challenging schools before being given the option to head back to the world of business. The scheme would be based on Teach First in which graduates spend at least two years in challenging schools before being given the option to head back to the world of business . It is hoped that GCHQ would benefit from expertise from some of the county's brightest and best to help deal with the rise of cyber terrorism and tracking threats around the world. The idea has been inspired by work by the Israeli government, which has enlisted tech stars to work in the Israel Defence Forces' Unit 8200 - the equivalent of GCHQ. Many who served in the unit have gone on to set up some of the country's leading IT companies, worth billions of pounds. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said in a speech last month: 'I have long admired the Israeli start-up nation which is home to more high-tech start-ups per capita than any other country. 'What struck me most was that the Israeli culture of innovation wasn't down to the facilities or the technology, impressive though they were. 'It was the people – and the human relationships – they were the critical element. 'It came down to a group of individuals, perhaps as few as just 2 or 3, sitting together to find a solution or to work through a brilliant idea – thinking together, experimenting together, failing, learning, adapting and ultimately succeeding.' Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has spoken of his admiration of Israel as a 'start-up nation which is home to more high-tech start-ups per capita than any other country' Ministers are considering how GCHQ's intellectual property could used commercially. 'We have loads of talented people working for GCHQ - and there is no shortage of academic excellence,' a Cabinet Office source told The Independent. 'The question is can we create a secure space where business can work with GCHQ and build an eco-system between the two. 'It is not a million miles from Teach First and we have thought about that link. 'The idea is to say to graduates you do not have to sign up to GCHQ for your whole career and there are options for you in the private sector. 'There is more thinking to be done and a debate to be had about how it might work but we want to capitalise on the expertise in GCHQ in terms of IT commercialisation.' A security source added: 'Although there is more thinking to be done, we think the Israeli model is interesting and are considering if we can learn from it to build on the significant work that GCHQ already does, in partnership with industry and academia, to develop the technical skills the UK needs to meet its cyber security objectives.' Last month it emerged children as young as 13 are being given lessons in combating cyber terrorism amid concerns over the UK’s vulnerability to attacks similar to the hacking of entertainment giant Sony. Those behind the scheme include experts at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the top-secret organisation that provides electronic surveillance of the nation’s enemies. The Government is taking the scheme so seriously that next summer’s GCSE computer science exam will contain questions about cyber security for the first time.","Government is examining plans to allow brightest and best to join GCHQ .

"Hospitals are in the grip of a crime wave, with police called 175 times a day to incidents on NHS property. The list of crimes in hospital wards, car parks and waiting areas includes rape and attempted murder. The official figures raise concerns about the safety of hospital staff and patients. Police are being called about crimes every 10 minutes, a Freedom of Information request has revealed . Figures obtained from 30 UK police forces through a Freedom of Information request showed officers attended 64,728 incidents at NHS centres in 2013 - 1,700 more than in 2012. While the figures did not include the Metropolitan Police area, they showed Greater Manchester Police attended 12,726 incidents and West Midlands received 7,132 calls in 2013, increases of 320 and 249 year-on-year respectively. Police were called to cases including visitors sexually abusing staff, brawls between patients, racially aggravated behaviour and people brandishing lethal weapons such as knives. In February 2013, Elizabeth Ward-Buck, then 51, attacked a nurse and a policeman after abusing Nigerian student Gina Thompson and her Spanish friend Barbara Iniesta in the waiting room at Ipswich Hospital. She was handed a curfew and a suspended sentence and ordered to pay £265 over the violent incident. She asked the women where they were from, then shouted: 'You're coming over here and you're pleading poverty. We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis.' Staff nurse Marian Tolosa ran over to see what was happening, but Ward-Buck pushed her then attacked another patient. The aggressive woman was taken to a side room by police, but she continued her rant and even tried to assault a police officer. South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court heard that Ward-Buck had been drinking earlier in the day. Royal College of Nursing chief executive Dr Peter Carter said the rise in crimes was a 'major national problem' Northampton Chief Constable Adrian Lee, Association of Chief Police Officers' lead for alcohol harm reduction, told Sky News many of the incidents were related to drinking. He said: 'There was a time when NHS staff, through good motivations and a sense of vocation, didn't want to report crimes against people who were there to receive the service, but actually that's not appropriate because it gets the message across that you can go to a hospital and behave inappropriately - well you can't.' Irenee O'Neill, general secretary of the Independent Federation of Nursing in Scotland, said: 'Serious crime is on the increase in hospitals. I have had nurses who have been stabbed, have had broken bones or have had a knife brandished in their face. It is dreadful that medical staff trying to give lifesaving care should be at risk.' Margaret Watt of the Scotland Patients Association added: 'The problem is we don't have any security on our doors, like there is with airport security. Anyone is free to walk in with a knife. 'The security of patients and staff is paramount and these crimes are multiplying. This should give us a wake-up call. 'Doctors and nurses don't go to work to be beaten up. They go to help people and anyone who attacks them should be banned. There must be a system in place to identify those people.' Meanwhile, figures from NHS Protect released in November showed there had been 68,683 reports of assaults against NHS staff in the year to March 2014, prompting a leading nursing body's chief to call for more action. Speaking to Sky News, Royal College of Nursing chief executive Dr Peter Carter said: 'Against 68,000 reported assaults last year, there were just 1,600 prosecutions. That's lamentable. This is a major national problem and something needs to be done about it.'","Figures reveal 64,728 incidents at NHS centres in 2013 - up 1,700 from 2012 .

"Jodie Tangikara was told by another mother to 'put her boob away' when she was breastfeeding Kaiden . A mother who was told to 'put her boob away' by another woman when she was breastfeeding her six-month-old toddler has triggered an online frenzy. When Jodie Tangikara was breastfeeding her son Kaiden by the  pool at Splash Lagoon in Hervey Bay, north of Brisbane, she noticed a woman smoking a cigarette a couple of seats away on Tuesday. The 28-year-old thought it would be a good idea to glance over at the woman so she would get the hint to 'put her smoke out' or at least move away from the children playing nearby. But as soon as the woman caught a glimpse of Tangikara looking at her, she stormed over and told the mother of five: 'I think you should put your boob away.' ‘I was shocked, especially coming from another mother,’ Tangikara told Daily Mail Australia. 'The woman was smoking and standing really close to the kids but all she got from my glance was to tell me that I shouldn't have my boob out in front of the children, especially hers. 'I don't mind smokers but it was illegal of her to smoke so close to the children, especially in a public play area but I politely smiled, turned my back and continued to feed my little bub. ‘If my bub is hungry, he’s going to be fed – no matter where we are. Her comment doesn’t bother me and I didn't want to cause a scene because there were children around.' Scroll down for video . When the woman smoking made the comment, Tangikara smiled, turned her back and continued to breastfeed . Tangikara took her children to the water park. From left: Tyler, Deacon, Larissa holding Kaiden and Lachlan . After Tangikara got home from the water park, she posted her experience online, which prompted a frenzy of discussion about mothers who breastfeed or smoke in public. 'To a lady that was smoking at the water park who told me off for breastfeeding my baby. I was covered with a towel love. Get out of the park and smoke you stupid woman,’ she wrote. Several mothers said they believed the comment from the woman smoking was inconsiderate while embracing Tangikara’s decision for standing her ground and continuing to feed her baby. One woman wrote: ‘Wow. What is wrong with people these days. Feels like society is going backwards. Breastfeeding should be more acceptable not looked down on. That smoker woman should be ashamed of herself.’ Splashing time! On the companys's website in the 'rules and conditions' it clearly states as Rule No. 6: 'Splash Lagoons entire facility is a non-smoking venue' Another woman posted: ‘Just another nasty & ignorant person. I suspect she was acting more out of embarrassment for being caught smoking near children than for her actual disapproval of breastfeeding in public.’ One woman wrote: ‘Actually it is illegal to smoke within a certain distance of a child's park, has been for years. And the water park is a child's park. So breastfeeding Mum was doing what is legal, smoking woman was breaking the law.’ While another woman said: ‘Don't let her upset you, there are people who just enjoy being horrible! Breastfeeding is natural and beautiful. There are women that topless sunbathe down the road from me on there front lawn, nobody complains about them lol.' On the Splash Lagoon website in the 'rules and conditions' it clearly states as rule no. 6: 'Splash Lagoons entire facility is a non-smoking venue.' When the 28-year-old was breastfeeding her son Kaiden at a water park, she was rudely told to cover up . The 28-year-old took it to social media and has triggered an online discussion with other mothers . And it wasn’t the first time the mother of five was told to cover up when she was nursing one of her children at the shops. ‘I was feeding one of my kids when a man approached me and told me to go to the toilets so I told him “would you like to eat your lunch in the toilet?” and he just shook his head and walked off. ‘People need to realise it’s a natural thing and there’s nothing wrong with it. They need to get over themselves – it’s baby food supply so deal with it. ‘If you don’t like it, don't go out in public or just keep your comments to yourself.’ A representative for Splash Lagoons couldn't be reached.","A mother was told to 'put her boob away' after breastfeeding her baby .

"An obese dachshund has managed to lose a whopping 43 pounds after spending a year on a strictly-controlled diet plan. Dennis, whose weight peaked at an unbelievable 56 pounds just over a year ago, also had to undergo surgery in order to remove all of the excess skin left behind after he dropped the weight. The canine companion first starting piling on the pounds after being left in the care of his owner's uncle, who fed him a dangerous combination of human food and fatty dog treats. Scroll down for video . Piling on the pounds: Dennis the dachshund weighed a whopping 56 pounds when he was at his heaviest just over a year ago . Svelte: The young dog is now down to a healthy 13 pounds, thanks to the help of his devoted owner . Food fan: Despite his strict diet plan, Dennis still loves food - and even 'does a dance' when he knows it's time to eat . But now, after more than 12 months of dieting, Dennis is back to a healthy weight - and his owner, Brooklyn Burton, from West Columbus, Ohio, says she couldn't be more delighted with the results of her dog's health-focused regime. 'He now can go up and down the steps,' she told local news station WSYX. 'He never used to be able to do that. Run, even faster. He thinks he rules the house.' But Dennis hasn't completely lost his love of good food - and can always be relied upon to be particularly enthusiastic and energetic at dinner time. 'He loves when it's chow time, he does a little dance,' Ms Burton joked. 'Right before he gets his food.' Puppy eyes: The cute canine first began putting on weight when he was left in the care of his owner's uncle . Healthy and happy: These days, Dennis is much more content with his lifestyle and loves running around in the garden and being active . Then and now: Less than a year ago, Dennis weighed 29 pounds, and was suffering with a huge amount of excess skin, caused by his weight loss (L). He underwent a procedure to remove it just a few months ago (R) The devoted pet owner credits an intensive exercise program and incredibly strict diet plan as being the main reasons behind her dog's dramatic weight loss - and she hopes that other people will be able to find inspiration in what she has done for her canine, and repeat the same success with their own animals. 'We should not be feeding dogs people food,' she explained. 'And [we shouldn't] be over-feeding them and giving them excessive amounts of treats. 'Just like humans, they need diet and exercise in order to live a healthy life.' According to animal experts, a dachshund of Dennis' size should weigh between 13 and 16 pounds, meaning the young dog's previous weight could have left him at risk of serious illness and - in the worst case - death. Devoted: Owner Brooklyn Burton took Dennis in and helped him to shed his unwanted pounds . Fellow fitness fanatic: A seven-year-old dachshund called Obie hit the headlines last year after losing an impressive 50 pounds . Although Dennis has made remarkable progress during the last year, his weight loss journey is far from over. The slimmed-down dog is set to undergo another round of surgery this month, in order to remove additional excess skin from his shoulders and hind area. Dennis is not the first dachshund to stun the world with such an impressive weight loss story. In October last year, a seven-year-old sausage dog named Obie, hit the headlines after he lost more than 50 pounds in just over a year. Much like Dennis, Obie's unhealthy weight gain came as a result of too many treats, particularly scraps from the table, and too little exercise. But after a lengthy rehabilitation - and a tummy tuck procedure - Obie now weighs a healthy 27 pounds, and has even released a 2015 calendar in celebration of his weight loss.","Dennis ballooned to 56 pounds after staying with his owner's relative, who fed him 'human food' and treats .

"A rescue horse could be the world's oldest after celebrating her 49th birthday - and she still enjoys a gallop despite being almost completely blind. Orchid the Arab-Thoroughbred cross is more than double the age of most of her stable mates - but still enjoys a good gallop and roll in her field. And despite being completely emaciated when she arrived at the Remus horse sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, after being rescued two years ago, she had undergone a complete transformation. Scroll down for video . Orchid celebrated her 49th birthday yesterday and could be the world's oldest. Pictured with Remus horse sanctuary founder Sue Burton . When Orchid, pictured with stable hand Laura Barnes, arrived at the Remus sanctuary in Brentwood, Essex, two years ago, she was completely emaciated . She stunned vets not only with her incredible recovery - but also when they realised she was almost half a century old. Sue Burton, founder of the sanctuary, said: 'When Orchid was originally found she was laying on the floor, emaciated and full of sores and had given up. 'To see her today running, bucking and rolling is so heart-warming. 'She's almost totally blind but it doesn't seem to bother her too much. She's a very happy horse nowadays, full of energy and has a great attitude. 'Orchid knows her own mind which is great to see for a horse of her age. Every morning when we go down to the stables, she will bang on the door waiting for her breakfast and doesn't stop until we give her what she wants.' Rescuers knew that Orchid was an old mare, but equine dental specialists revealed that Orchid is 48 years old - while the average horse's life span is between 25 and 30 years. Staff celebrated her birthday on New Year's Day, as she has no official equine passport - because she was born before they became obligitary in 1998. And although she may be going grey and almost completely blind, she still enjoys a good roll in a field . She stunned vets with an incredible recovery and when they they found she was almost half a century old . Orchid, pictured with stable hands Chloe McCready, left, and Laura Barnes, right, is enjoying her retirement . Orchid has a carrot-free diet but goes through four to five cabbages a week or more than 200 throughout the course of the year. Ms Burton added: 'I'd say that her lifestyle in retirement is the secret to her old age. She's a very relaxed horse and lives a very stress-free life. 'She's also really determined and shows tremendous grit. 'We don't work our oldest horses. Orchid's day consists of waking up, having breakfast and then we leave her to do as she pleases in the paddock until dinner time. 'She's certainly enjoying her retirement. Horses are living much longer nowadays. 'When I first set up this sanctuary 31 years ago, 15 was a good age for a horse but now it's normal for them to live to the age of 30. 'There's been so many veterinary advancements in the past few years that we're a lot better equipped to treat the animals but it's also a matter of lifestyle. 'Orchid's very happy and relaxed. We think that's why she's lived to such a good age.' The previous record holder, Shayne, a 51-year-old liver chestnut Irish Draught cross thoroughbred, died in September last year.

Mexican immigrant Jesus Moreno emerged smiling from a California Department of Motor Vehicles office on Friday with official permission to do something he's been doing here for more than a decade: driving. The 30-year-old vending-machine installer, who has forked over hundreds of dollars in traffic tickets and car-impound fees as an unlicensed driver, became one of the first to get a permit under a new program to give driver's licenses to the nation's largest population of immigrants in the country illegally. 'It's not that I want to drive,' said Moreno, after leaving a packed DMV office in Orange County. 'It's a necessity.' Only four DMV offices were taking walk-in applicants. Hundreds of immigrants donning scarves and gloves and clutching driver handbooks braved near-freezing temperatures in the Orange County city of Stanton to try to get a place in line before dawn. 'This is a big opportunity for me,' said Sammy Moeung, a 24-year-old Cambodian immigrant eager to get a license to avoid having to ride his bike to work at his brother's doughnut shop. 'Having this is moving a step forward in life, in California and the United States.' Education: California Highway Patrol officers Armando Garcia, right, and Ray Patton explain to immigrants the process of getting a drivers license during an information session at the Mexican Consulate . Learning the rules: A crowd of approximately 80 immigrants fill a room as they listen to officials explain the process of getting a drivers license, during an information session at the Mexican Consulate . Immigrant advocates have cheered the licenses as a way to integrate immigrants who must drive to work and shuttle children to school, though the cards will include a distinctive marking and are not considered valid federal identification. Critics have questioned state officials' ability to verify the identity of foreign applicants, citing security concerns. Applicants must submit proof of identity and state residency and pass a written test to get a driving permit. Those who don't possess foreign government-issued identification on a list of approved documents can be interviewed by a DMV investigator to see if they qualify. Long lines: Immigrants line up at a California Department of Motor Vehicles office to register for drivers licenses in California . Sleeping in line: Immigrants line up after spending the night outside a California Department of Motor Vehicles office to register for drivers licenses . Waiting for hours: Immigrants line up after spending the night outside a California Department of Motor Vehicles office to register for drivers licenses . Immigrants must come back at a later date and pass a road test to get the license, which will be marked with the words 'federal limits apply.' Those who have licenses from other states are not required to take the road test again, Gonzalez said. Law enforcement officials have said the program will improve road safety because more drivers will be tested and insured. A DMV study of 23 years of crash data found unlicensed drivers were more likely to cause a fatal collision. Some immigrants who waited in line for hours Friday failed the required written test and vowed to make an appointment to return on another date to try again. About half of new driver's license applicants fail the written exam, Gonzalez said. Celia Rayon, a 49-year-old warehouse worker from Anaheim, left the crowded office in Stanton with her new permit in hand. For nearly two decades, the Mexican immigrant has refrained from driving, relying on rides from co-workers to get to her job. 'You can't go out anywhere,' Rayon said, adding that she'd like to drive to visit relatives in Georgia once she passes her road test. 'Now we're going to feel more secure.' While allowing illegals to gain licenses may improve road safety, some argue it is another burden on taxpayers who already pay out  $650 million on welfare and $500 million on healthcare for immigrants, reports Info wars. The state also grants in-state tuition to illegal aliens, costing taxpayers up to $289 million in potential revenue each year.

"Like many of us as we get older, the long-serving Mars rover Opportunity is having trouble storing its memory. The six-wheeled vehicle, which has been roaming the red planet for more than a decade, keeps wiping its data at random. Nasa believes that an ageing flash memory is causing the bouts of 'amnesia', and the agency now plans to hack the rover's software in an attempt to cure it. The stoic Opportunity rover, which has been roaming the red planet for more than a decade, keeps wiping its data at random. Nasa believes that an ageing flash memory is causing the 'amnesia' and is planning to 'hack' the rover's software so that it ignores the broken part of its flash memory . The problem has been ongoing for the last six months because the flash memory has been overwritten so many times. Project manager John Callas told Discovery News that Opportunity has both volatile and non-volatile memory. Non-volatile memory is used for long-term storage, allowing Opportunity to 'remember' its information even when it's on standby. Volatile memory, meanwhile, is similar to  RAM (Random Access Memory) found in computers. When the rover turns off, any data stored within the volatile memory is wiped. The problem has been ongoing for six months because the rover's flash memory has been overwritten so many times. And the problem is getting worse, causing the rover, in some instance, to stop communicating with mission control in Houston altogether . The problem has been found with the rover's non-volatile memory, which means it can still operate, but sometimes saves data on the volatile memory, causing the information to be lost. Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years. The rover is currently at 'Solander Point' at the rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. The rover hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet. During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals. Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water. Currently the rover is just 2,100ft (650 metres) away from Marathon Valley, which looks like ancient clay beds that would have been created when the planet was moist. 'So now we're having these events we call 'amnesia,' Mr Callas told Ian O'Neill at Discovery News. 'Which is the rover trying to use the flash memory, but it wasn't able to, so instead it uses the RAM.' And the problem is getting worse, causing the rover, in some instance, to stop communicating with mission control in Houston altogether. Before Christmas, mission control sent three days' worth of commands to Opportunity, but the rebooting problems meant that only the one day's activities were completed. 'It stores telemetry data in that volatile memory, but when the rover goes to sleep and wakes up again, all [the data] is gone,' added Mr Callas. In a process that may take a few weeks, Nasa is planning to 'hack' the rover's software so that it ignores the broken part of its flash memory. The hack will involve dividing, isolating, and shutting down one of the seven memory banks causing the problem. 'It's like you have an ageing parent, that is otherwise in good health - maybe they go for a little jog every day, play tennis each day - but you never know, they could have a massive stroke right in the middle of the night,' said Mr Callas. Before Christmas, mission control sent three days' worth of commands to Opportunity, but the rebooting problems meant that only the one day's activities were completed. Pictured is the rover's route . 'So we're always cautious that something could happen.' Opportunity has been on Mars for 10 years, despite being designed for a 90 Sol mission . A Sol, one Martian day, is slightly longer than an Earth day at 24 hours and 37 minutes. The rover's mission has been extended several times as it continues to make new and profound discoveries about the red planet. In December 2012, for instance, mission scientists announced that Opportunity was exploring a special spot on the rim of Endeavour Crater. The area, known as Matijevic Hill, was found to contain clay minerals, implying that the area was exposed to water billions of years ago. Currently the rover is just 2,100ft (650 metres) away from Marathon Valley, which looks like ancient clay beds that would have been created when the planet was moist.","Six-wheeled vehicle has been roaming Mars for more than a decade .

"A car enthusiast spent $100,000 on a custom-made vehicle which can zip over desert sand dunes and handle practically any type of terrain. Russell White, 41, from Texas, built the souped-up car, nicknamed the 'Rally Fighter' and boasts that it can  reach speeds of up to 135 miles per hour. But he readily admits that he tends to drive it around town and can only go a paltry 35mph to keep up with the pace of local traffic. Speed: The Rally Fighter is pictured here leaving a trail of dust in the Mojave Desert, Las Vegas, Nevada . Cost: Russell White spent over $100,000 to create the car that can leap over sand dunes in the desert . Owner: White, right, and his son Tim White, left, beam with pride as they are pictured with the Rally Fighter . The Rally Fighter was manufactured by a car specialist called Local Motors but was built by White who put it together with his bare hands. He said: 'The car was built to drive very fast, that's where it's happy, that's where it wants to be - you just have to be willing to be there with it. 'It can be very dangerous at times, but for me that's the exciting part. 'I like going down the roads where I don't know what's around the corner or on the other side of the hill - it just heightens the sensation of not knowing.' White, from Texas, built the car in a factory in Chandler, Arizona. He said: 'Most of the parts are collected together and prepared by Local Motors - I went to the factory and got in there with my hands. 'We started with the bare frame, and built the car to completion and drove it home 30 days later. Interior: The inside of the souped-up car is seen here, it can reach speeds up to 135 miles per hour . Custom-built: White from Texas, USA, built his street-legal car himself in a factory  in Chandler, Arizona . Terrain: The ultimate custom-made car can zip over desert sand dunes and handle practically any terrain . Attention: White admits that he gets an 'insane amount of attention' when driving the car . 'The engine is from a Corvette and the Camaro SS - it's got a 430 horsepower GM crank motor and 20 inches of travel suspension that allows for driving really fast in the desert. 'It has 420 foot pounds of torque, and passes all state emissions, comes with everything you need to install, run and get it on the road. 'The steering wheel is a Momo wheel, and the column is out of an F150.' The car is completely street legal, and turns heads wherever Russell drives it. Powerful: The engine is from a Corvette and the Camaro SS has a 430 horsepower GM crank motor and 20 inches of travel suspension that allows for driving really fast in the desert . Road worthy: It has 420 foot pounds of torque, and passes all state emissions necessary get it on the road . Spin: White said that most of the time he's only driving the car at 35 miles an hour when he is in town . He added: 'I get an insane amount of attention when I'm out driving, sometimes it's a little overwhelming - I'm still getting it after a year and a half driving it. 'Most people want to know what kind of car it is - they come up and start asking questions about it.' White drives his car in town, but his favorite place to give it a spin is in the middle of the desert. He said: 'It's a very capable car and you can only go as fast as the person in front of you, most of the time its 35 miles an hour. 'That's why I like coming out in the desert and if I see a dirt road coming along the road, you're going to see my car on the dirt road than you are on the street.'","Russell White, 41, from Texas, created the car called 'the Rally Fighter'

"In the depths of an Indonesian rainforest, scientists have identified a fanged amphibian that is the first known frog that gives birth to tadpoles, instead of laying spawn. The species was originally discovered decades ago, but it was only after a chance sighting that a scientist recently stumbled across a female with newborn tadpoles with her. Upon closer inspection, experts found the Limnonectes larvaepartus is the only  frog out of the world’s 6,455 species to give birth to tadpoles directly. Limnonectes larvaepartus (pictured) is the only frog out of the world’s 6,455 frog species to give birth to tadpoles instead of laying spawn. While the fanged species was found decades ago, it was only recently that experts have discovered evidence of the creature's unique birthing ability . The unusual member of the Asian group of fanged frogs was originally found by Indonesian researcher Djoko Iskandar. Usually grey or brown, the species measures between one and two-inches long (4cm), and weighs less than two-tenths of an ounce (5 grams). The frogs live in small streams and puddles in rainforest habitats, doing their best to avoid being eaten by larger fanged frog species, as well as predatory snakes and birds. Males possess two fang-like projections from the lower jaw that are used in fighting. Scientists have long theorised that this particular species gives birth to tadpoles, but they had never seen the creatures mate or spawn first-hand. The latest discovery was made by University of California, Berkeley, herpetologist Jim McGuire. He grabbed a frog he thought was male, but instead, he found that it was a female with a dozen newborn tadpoles with her. To make the discovery, herpetologist Jim McGuire grabbed a frog he thought was male, but instead, he found that it was a female with a dozen newborn tadpoles with her. Pictured are two newborn tadpoles of the newly described fanged frog . The new evidence of the frog’s behaviour, witnessed in the Sulawesi Island (marked on the map) rainforests in Indonesia. The unusual member of the Asian group of fanged frogs was originally found by Indonesian researcher Djoko Iskandar decades ago . Unusual features: 'Fangs' for fighting and its ability to give birth to tadpoles - the only known species of frog to do so out of 6,455. Breeding: The species is one of 12 to have evolved internal fertilisation. Usually, the male grips the female in amplexus - known as the frog mating embrace - and releases sperm as the eggs are released by the female, outside of her body. The eggs, or frogspawn, mature through stages including the aquatic tadpole larval phase, typically limbless with a tail that propels it through the water. Family: The Asian group of fanged frogs . Habitat: Indonesian rainforests in small streams and puddles . Size: One and two-inches long (4cm) Weight: Less than two-tenths of an ounce (5g) ‘Reproduction in most frogs could not be more different from human reproduction. 'In this case, what is most interesting, ironically, is that the reproductive mode is more similar to our own,’ Dr McGuire said. The new evidence of the frog’s behaviour, witnessed in the Sulawesi Island rainforests, is published in the journal Plos One. ‘Almost all frogs in the world - more than 6,000 species - have external fertilisation, where the male grips the female in amplexus (the frog mating embrace) and releases sperm as the eggs are released by the female,’ Dr McGuire said. Those eggs, or frogspawn, mature through stages including the aquatic tadpole larval phase, typically limbless with a tail that propels it through the water. ‘This new frog is one of only 10 or 12 species that has evolved internal fertilisation, and of those, it is the only one that gives birth to tadpoles as opposed to froglets or laying fertilised eggs,’ he added. Dr McGuire said: ‘It's totally unclear why this mode of reproduction has not evolved more frequently. ‘My favourite topic when it comes to frog evolution and diversification is the bewildering variation in reproductive modes that occur. Frogs exhibit all sorts of interesting twists.’ Some frogs in Africa that also engage in internal fertilisation are known to give birth to froglets that never go through the tadpole stage. Others carry eggs in pouches on their back, brood tadpoles in their vocal sac or mouth, or transport tadpoles in pouches on their backs and sides. Two known species of female gastric brooding frogs, both of which are now extinct, were famous for swallowing their fertilised eggs, brooding them in their stomach, and giving birth out of their mouths to froglets. The fanged female frog is pictured right with the live tadpoles offspring behind her. The new evidence of the frog’s behaviour, witnessed in the Sulawesi Island rainforests, is published in the journal Plos One .

"Mark Chanko, 83, a Korean War veteran and father-of-five, was killed by a truck in 2011. His death was featured on ABC show NY Meds without his family's permission . A widow whose husband died after being hit by a truck has revealed the horrifying moment she watched his last breaths broadcast on a reality TV show. In August 2012, Anita Chanko was watching an episode of ABC's NY Med, which features Dr Mehmet Oz, when she saw her late husband Mark undergoing treatment in attempts to save his life. Korean War veteran Mr Chanko, 83, had passed away 16 months earlier at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in April 2011 after being hit by a sanitation truck on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Mrs Chanko was able to hear her husband of 46 years' last words just moments before he passed away - an intimate moment broadcast for millions of viewers that she had not given permission for. In an article, published on Friday, she told propublica.org: '[E]ven with the blurred picture, you could tell it was him. 'You could hear his speech pattern. I hear my husband say, ''Does my wife know I'm here?''' As doctors discussed her husband's fatal injuries and got ready to pronounce him dead on camera, Mrs Chanko said she 'clenched her fists so tightly that the palms of my hands almost looked like stigmata', according to propublica. Mrs Chanko and her children filed a $5million lawsuit against ABC, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and attending surgeon, Dr Sebastian Schubl. The family said that the father-of-five's death was broadcast on TV for 'the entertainment of strangers' without the family's consent. The hospital and ABC said that the patient could not be identified because his face was blurred in the footage. Anita Chanko and her son Kenneth Chanko have sued ABC and New York-Presbyterian Hospital for broadcasting the dying moments of their beloved husband and father on TV show NY Meds . However, Mrs Chanko told propublica that Mr Chanko's loved ones immediately knew it was him. Even a woman who once worked as a pet-sitter for the couple called Mrs Chanko to say that she recognized it was her late husband in the TV clip. The New York State Health Department found that New York-Presbyterian did violate the dying 83-year-old's rights and their own privacy policy. American College of Emergency Physicians spokesman, Dr Charles Pattavina, told MailOnline on Friday that although there are benefits to medical TV reality shows in keeping the public informed about healthcare, doctors must take care not to go too far. Dr Pattavina, chief of emergency medicine at St Joseph's Hospital in Maine, said: 'I think it's great when these shows seek to be informative to people about health issues and what to expect from a healthcare environment. 'But it is problematic when some shows become too driven by ratings. 'As doctors, were must be mindful not only of laws and regulations but of being sensitive to families. 'In general, if a physician sees something which is not proper or adequately sensitive, then they should say something. We should not abdicate our responsibility as leader of a healthcare team.' Dr Pattavina said that although it was rare to see people dying on TV shows, he added: 'I'm not sure it would be very helpful to the public or reassuring.' 'Lines shouldn't be crossed when it comes to privacy... and we have a responsibility to families' responses and emotions,' the doctor said. However the defendants  argued against the family's lawsuit that, legally, doctors are only barred from sharing private details only after the patient has been treated. Because NY Med had a film crew on hand, during doctors' battledto save the dying Mr Chanko, it was within the law, according to lawyers for the hospital and TV network. In November, an appellate panel dismissed the Chankos' case, according to Propublica, but the family asked for the decision to be reviewed and are working on an appeal. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from ABC on Friday. New York Presbyterian Hospital refused to comment on pending litigation. In an interview with MailOnline in March 2013, the family’s attorney, Mark Fox, said that in the operating room a studio with cameras and lights were set up, and the ABC staffers were dressed in scrubs to ‘keep the atmosphere'. Mr Fox said that having to relive her husband's death on TV left Mrs Chanko 'completely distraught,' especially since she did not know that Mr Chanko was awake when he was brought to the ER. ‘The widow was sitting there watching TV and sees this terrible thing,’ Mr Fox said. ‘They [relatives] were all horrified.’ The lawyer told the New York Daily News in 2013 that at one point during Mr Chanko's treatment the doctors working on him discussed amputating his legs and trying to stop extensive bleeding in his abdomen. After the 83-year-old had a heart attack, one of the physicians addressed his colleagues, asking: 'We all agree he's gone?' Later in the show, a social worker and Dr  Schubl, the chief orthopedic resident, break the news of Mr Chanko's death to his family in the waiting room. Mr Fox said the doctor had a microphone on, but the grieving relatives’ words were left out of the show. A camera was trained on the door of the room that the family were in. ‘They never suspected that the saddest moment of their live was being recorded,’ Mr Fox added. ABC removed the episode in question last year after the Chankos complained. NY Meds features celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left). Dr Sebastian Schubl (right), the chief orthopedic resident who treated Mark Chanko, was also named in the Chanko family's lawsuit . The attorney explained that when his client approached the hospital and ABC, they were told that the producers of the show did not think it was necessary to ask for consent in this case because the patient’s face was obscured. ‘They thought if they put a little smudge on it was enough,’ Mr Fox said, adding that Mr Chanko's voice was instantly-recognized to his family. The attorney said that all the other patients featured in the series were given release forms to sign, but Mrs Chanko was never asked for her permission. He pointed out that she would not have given it. According to his New York Times obituary, Mr Chanko, a grandfather-of-eight, served in the Korean War and later became a certified public accountant. He was described as an avid tennis and bridge player, and a lover of the arts. NY Med premiered on ABC on July 10, 2012. The eight-part medical documentary series followed the medical staff and patients of Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medical Center, both a part of New York–Presbyterian Hospital, as well as Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn. The show enjoyed high ratings throughout its run and received critical acclaim.

Pictured: The plane makes an emergency landing at Southend airport . The twin propeller plane, which was also carrying three crew members, was mid-air when there was a safety warning relating to one of the plane's two engines . The plane's automatic systems shut down one of the engines as a precautionary measure and the aircraft was able to land using one engine. Nobody was injured during the incident. Firefighters who inspected the engine said there was no fire when the aircraft landed but that it could have been 'an extremely serious incident'. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Blue Islands, which operated the flight, said the incident appears to have been a false alarm. Divisional Officer Neil Fenwick, who attended the incident for Essex fire service, said: 'This was a text book operation. The fire was out by the time the plane touched down and no-one appears to have been hurt. 'The plane landed safely on one engine and automatic fire suppression systems on board had completely extinguished the fire. 'Our crews made sure that the fire was fully out but were not required to take any further action. We left the scene in the hands of the airport.

"An Irishman is in a critical condition after he was allegedly the victim of a one-punch attack from his brother on a Sydney street. His 33-year-old brother has been charged with recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. He was refused bail and will appear in Parramatta Bail Court later today. It's alleged that a 33-year-old man punched his 32-year-old brother in the head at around 3am on Saturday morning, causing him to fall onto the footpath outside a Kings Cross nightclub in Sydney's inner city. Emergency services found him in a pool of blood and vomit on Bayswater Road outside Hugos Lounge, according to News Corp. Scroll down for video . Two Irish brothers were involved in a confrontation outside a nightclub in Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city which has left the younger brother fighting for his life . Emergency services found a man in a pool of his own blood in Kings Cross after he was punched in the head, allegedly by his own brother . The victim underwent surgery at St Vincent's Hospital, also in Sydney's inner city, with serious brain injuries. He is in a critical but stable condition. Police said that it will be another 24 to 48 hours before doctors can determine the extent of the injuries, after the swelling on the brain goes down. Police are expecting to charge the 33-year-old man and he will appear at Parramatta Local Court this afternoon. The man who has been charged and his father arrived in Australia with their father three days ago for a holiday, according to NSW Police. The victim has been travelling around Australia since June. 'This is a family tragedy that has happened on our streets,' Kings Cross detective superintendent Michael Fitzgerald. He confirmed that alcohol was not a factor in the fight. Supt. Fitzgerald said that the 'pain in the Father's eyes' as indescribable, all due to 'one punch from one brother to another'. 'To have one son facing serious criminal charges and another son fighting for his life.' The fight occurred after a 'minor' argument and the alleged culprit only gave a low range blood alcohol reading. The brothers had been at dinner with their father earlier in the evening before the father left and the two young men continued on to a bar for a drink, according to Police. It's claimed that the young man was in cardiac arrest when the ambulance was first called, according to news.com.au. A bouncer says the older brother was distraught and shocked when he realised what had happened, according to Nine News. 'He screamed when he realised how bad it was,' a bouncer told news.com.au. Police say CCTV footage showed the brothers having an argument before the 32-year-old victim pushed his older brother and a punch was then thrown. 'I was trying to calm him down, the whole situation was pretty full on,' said security guard Dion Miller, who administered First Aid to the victim as soon as he saw the incident, according to ABC News. The 33-year-old man is in police custody and helping police with their investigation. He did not sustain any injuries. A crime scene has been established and is being examined by detectives and specialist forensic officers. Police are urging any witnesses to inform Crime stoppers of anything they know about the incident to assist investigations. The younger brother is undergoing emergency surgery at St Vincent's Hospital whilst his brother assists police with their investigations.

"With courses on David Beckham, Harry Potter and politicising Beyoncé on offer at prestigious universities, it comes as no surprise that students are now able to learn the art of the perfect 'selfie'. Budding photographers will be taught valuable life skills to prepare them to face an expectant world which could present a photo opportunity at any point as part of a new City Lit course in London. As well as offering guidance on the most flattering angles and lighting, the course - officially called 'The art of self portraiture' – promises to 'improve your critical understanding' of the 'selfie'. The 'selfie' trend went viral after Ellen DeGeneres' star-stuffed Oscar photo (pictured) and now City Lit college in London is offering a course in taking the perfect self-portrait . The path to the perfect profile picture will cost you just £132 (£106 for seniors) – but potential students should be warned that it does not come with a free 'selfie' stick. It is open to all, including those who have only 'engaged in self-portrait –even in the most casual way'. But the 'selfie' enthusiasts must be prepared to share their snaps, as organisers said a critique of students' work would form an important role in the learning process. Over four sessions, students will be taught to 'use light and significant detail' in their work and 'explain ideas of space, place and surrounding issues'. Kim Kardashian is one of the most prolific 'selfie' takers, even inspiring a new trend called the 'belfie' - or 'bum selfie' (right) Even David Cameron and Barack Obama got involved, but their selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service with Denmark's prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, caused controversy . There will be a brief exploration into the notions of 'identity, self-hood and memory' as well as the opportunity to 'develop new ideas to make your photography more relevant to your aims'. It is ideal for those who have an understanding of ISO, aperture, shutter speed, white balance and how to change these on your digital SLR or bridge camera. The 'selfie' phenomenon is so widespread that it was only a matter of time before courses started offering guidance on the most flattering angles and lighting. Twitter declared 2014 as the year of the 'selfie' after Ellen DeGeneres' star-stuffed Oscar photo was retweeted more than three million times - a Twitter record. The trend became so popular that it even inspired a song, '#SELFIE' by The Chainsmokers, which racked up 267 million views on YouTube.

"Confessed: Mykel Cantrel Cooper, 23, confessed to murdering his roommate after cops paid his tab . Phoenix police say two officers' decision to pay for a troubled man's restaurant tab led to his being arrested in his roommate's stabbing death. Sgt. Tommy Thompson said on Friday the officers went to The International House of Pancakes early on Wednesday morning where a man named Mykel Cantrel Cooper, 23, said he had no money to pay for his meal. The officers concluded the man had some type of mental health issue, so they paid for his meal and tip and took him to a behavioral health facility rather than take him to jail, Thompson said. At the facility at short time later, the man told staff there he'd done 'something bad to his roommate', Thompson said. Police were contacted and went to his apartment, where they found the body of 29-year-old Steven Horkovy, who apparently had been killed Tuesday, Thompson said. The police spokesman said detectives then arrested 23-year-old Mykel Cantrel Cooper on suspicion of first-degree murder. According to a police charging document, Cooper told a detective he'd stabbed Horkovy after kicking open the roommate's door and confronting him with a knife. The police document said Cooper 'provided some limited details about the stabbing,' saying at one point he had blacked out during the assault and later claiming self-defense. A large knife with blood on its blade was found in Cooper's bedroom during a search, the document said. Cooper didn't have an attorney when he made an initial court appearance, and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said Cooper remained jailed Friday in lieu of $1 million bond.

"New York police commissioner William Bratton has urged officers not to turn their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio at this weekend's funeral. On Sunday, the city's cops will gather to pay their respects to Wenjian Liu, who was fatally shot on December 20 along with his partner Rafael Ramos. The double killing prompted a wave of anger from a faction of the NYPD who blamed De Blasio for failing to defend them during the recent anti-police protests. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Commissioner Bill Bratton, center, has urged officers not to turn their backs do Mayor de Blasio, right . And last weekend, at officer Ramos's funeral, thousands of officers turned their backs to demonstrate their frustration during De Blasio's eulogy. Pre-empting a repeat, Bratton sent a message to his force branding the protest 'inappropriate' and saying it detracted from attention on Ramos. The message read by the New York Post stated: 'A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance. 'I issue no mandates and I make no threats of discipline. But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it. Protest: Thousands of officers turned their backs during De Blasio's eulogy at Rafael Ramos' funeral . 'The country’s consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a fraction of those…officers,' he said. 'All officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos’s life and service. 'That was not the intent, I know. But it was the result.' Last Saturday, the New York City Police Department buried a hero. Tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade Rafael Ramos. His family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display. But for the last seven days, the city's and the country's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers. It was not all the officers, and it was not disrespect directed at Detective Ramos. But all the officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of Detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice. That was not that intent, I know. But it was the result. On Sunday, we will gather together again, with the rest of New York City and law-enforcement officials nationwide, to mourn for Detective First Grade Wenjian Liu. We gather to support his parents, his widow, and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short. The assassination of Detectives Liu and Ramos was an attack on us all. As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high. I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline.

"Troubled British rock star Pete Doherty has checked out of his rehab clinic in Thailand after apparently beating his heroin addiction - despite twisted 'fans' even sending him heroin by post. The 35-year-old Libertines and Babyshambles frontman – who was consuming an astonishing 3.5 grams of heroin a day before seeking rehab in the Far East in October – is now  drug-free and recording with band mates in a studio at a secret beach location in Thailand. Doherty suffered a relapse in early December after being off heroin for nearly two months, but has been 'clean' since and is now preparing to go back on stage and launching a fund to help other addicts get treatment at the innovative British-run Hope Rehab Centre in Si Racha. In a video shared exclusively with MailOnline, the musician gives a guided tour of the centre. Pointing to a fighter plane parked in the grounds of Hope, he tells the camera: 'I had this specifically brought in, just in case I need to evacuate in an emergency. 'But we couldn't move the chocks, so I got the bikes instead.' Scroll down for video . Celebrity status: One fan sent the star (pictured) heroin by post and another was chased away when trying to climb over the wall of the rehab centre . Clean: Doherty (pictured) realised drugs had crippled his creativity and he now has a sense of pride at writing and performing songs while sober . Rehab: The Libertines frontman spoke frankly about his fight against addiction in video interviews with counsellors shared exclusively with Mail Online . Junkie: Pictured in 2006, the star looked very different while performing with Babyshambles . Last month, he signed a deal with Virgin EMI along with former bandmate Carl Barat which will see them record the first new album by their band The Libertines for a decade. Doherty, who went out with Kate Moss, checked out of the rehab centre run by recovered addict Simon Mott at Christmas after a  programme involving a combination of methadone, counselling, exercise and intense therapy. At least one fan tried to send Doherty heroin in the post. 'Pete has a hard core of fans and followers and they are not all healthy minded,' said Mott, who runs Hope with his Thai wife Alon. 'He received a lot of fan mail which we searched before handing it over. Sadly, on two occasions, we intercepted drugs we had to destroy. It sickened me that there are such disgusting people out there who would go to such lengths to sabotage his treatment.' Both packages were posted in France – one arriving two weeks into his stay at Hope and the second at Christmas just before Doherty left. It is not known if the same person sent both packages. 'When I threw the second package into the fire, I could smell the familiar stench of burning heroin, something I hadn't experience since I stopped using it myself 12 years ago,' said Mott. 'Whoever did this has a warped mind.' On another occasion, Mott said, one male fan tried to climb over the wall of the rehab centre to visit Doherty but was chased away. One client, meanwhile, became so obsessed with Doherty he had to be forcibly discharged and was later arrested and deported. Band mates: Doherty (left) has signed a deal with Virgin EMI along with former band mate Carl Barat (right) Tour: Pointing to a fighter plane parked in the grounds of Hope, Doherty said: 'I had this specifically brought in, just in case I need to evacuate in an emergency.

In video interviews with counsellors shared exclusively with MailOnline by Hope, Doherty – whose career has been blighted by drug abuse and scandal – speaks frankly about his fight against addiction and his sense of pride at writing and performing songs while sober. He wrote songs in a Vietnam War-era fighter plane parked in the grounds of Hope which overlooks a stretch of quiet coastline 90 minutes south of Bangkok, on a plot of land provided by the former head of Thailand's Ministry of Transport, Dr Sribhumi Sukhanetr. Mott said he was impressed by Doherty's determination to conquer his heroin habit and said he had never known a client check into rehab with such a heavy drug habit – 3.5 grams of heroin a day. In video interviews with counsellors shortly before he checked out, Doherty - looking plump compared to his previous emaciated appearance – said he realised drugs had crippled his creativity and said he felt 'blessed' to have survived addiction.

Troubled: The career of Pete Doherty (centre) as been blighted by drug abuse and scandal. He is pictured here in 2009 being led away from court where he was due to stand trial for driving offences . Dishevelled: Doherty now looks healthy, but older photographs of him reveal a darker side to his life . 'Long before drugs, it was music that would raise my spirits or just make me want to live or believe in something,' he said. 'It's a great new drug, being clean. It's not really a drug at all – it's finding myself. 'Drugs don't make you more creative and one of the great things about being clean is that I'll be able to fulfill that side of things (my creativity) … I feel as if something inside me is shifting. 'It is almost against my better judgment. But my better judgment has got me in (trouble) more often than not. When I follow what I know is true in my heart, that's when things turn out right.' The wayward singer has struggled with his addictions for the past decade and has been in and out of rehab as far back as 2004. He was first arrested for possessing Class A substances in October 2005 and was eventually jailed in 2008 after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offences. Doherty was plunged into further controversy after a picture of him allegedly forcing his pet cat to inhale from a crack pipe appeared on the front page of The Sun in 2007. His first stint in rehab came after he was released from prison for burgling the home of former Libertines bandmate Carl Barat in 2003. He was sentenced to six months in prison which was later cut to two on appeal and the singer lasted just three days at a treatment centre. During his second rehab attempt in 2012, Doherty was thrown out after less than three weeks because staff at The Cabin, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, deemed him a 'disruptive influence'. Rehab: Simon Mott (right in left photo) and Alon (left) started the British-run Hope Rehab Centre in Si Racha where Doherty has spoken on camera about his battle with addiction . The Libertines: The 35-year-old frontman was consuming 3.5 grams of heroin a day before seeking rehab . Although he is now out of rehab, Doherty continues to travel to Hope to attend drug counselling meetings and has made arrangements to be accompanied by a Hope counsellor when he goes back on tour with The Libertines. He has also launched a Pete Doherty Hope Initiative to fund treatment for addicts unable to afford treatment which will be supported in part by proceeds from gigs and record sales and by public donations. Dylan Kerr, head counsellor at Hope, said Doherty had achieved his longest drug-free period since his teens while at the rehab centre in Sriracha – but warned that the months ahead will be challenging as he returns to the limelight. 'We saw Pete grow over the course of his treatment at Hope, which was reflected in his new found interest in nature, spirituality and positive creativity,' he said. 'Pete has a one off slip during the course of his treatment which served to help him understand how vulnerable he is in the outside world. 'After conquering a long and difficult detox it was wonderful to see the real Pete emerge with colour and a smile to his face, instead of a wasted, sweaty yellow jaundice pin cushion.' Doherty's one relapse into heroin use came when he went to Bangkok in early December for a short break from Hope, which allows its clients to come and go freely. Kerr warned: 'We are painfully aware that of the pressures he will be going out into the world with. 'The expectations on him are massive, possibly even unreasonable and unrealistic. I really wonder how he is going to maintain his recovery with so many people pulling at him from every direction.'

"The number of pensioners dying from hypothermia has nearly doubled in five years, a period when a succession of cold winters has been coupled with drastic rises in energy bills. The official figures emerged after several days of Arctic conditions which drove temperatures across the whole country as low as minus 10C (14F). They showed that 1,876 patients were treated in hospital for hypothermia in 2010/11, up from 950 in 2006/07. A succession of cold winters and a rise in energy prices has left many pensioners shivering . The number of sufferers who died within 30 days of admission shot up from 135 to 260. Three-quarters of victims were pensioners, with cases soaring among the over-60s more than any other age group. The increasing toll of hypothermia over the past five years coincides with a surge in energy costs, especially gas prices which have gone up by 40 per cent. Soaring energy bills are pushing more and more pensioners into fuel poverty, forcing them to choose between heating and eating. One industry analyst, uSwitch, estimates that eight in ten households are already rationing their energy use and have called for a cut in VAT on power bills. The row over energy prices is poised to be reignited later this month when the 'big six' energy companies reveal their latest profit figures. Campaign groups said yesterday it was 'scandalous' that pensioners in modern Britain could be suffering from hypothermia. Michelle Mitchell of Age UK urged the Government to take more action to protect those at risk of freezing to death. 'We . like to think of ourselves as a civilised society which protects the . most vulnerable,' she said. 'The fact that there are still older people . who are suffering and dying of hypothermia is deeply shocking.' A . survey carried out by Age UK last month found that half of pensioners . have turned their heating down to save money even when they are not warm . enough. Many more are so cold they go to bed when they are not tired or . move into one room to keep energy bills down. Hypothermia occurs when body . temperature drops below 35C (95F) from its normal 37C (98.6F). Symptoms . can include violent shivering, confusion, delirium and unconsciousness. Three-quarters of hypothermia victims are pensioners, with cases soaring among the over-60s . Temperatures plummeted in the UK putting thousands of pensioners living in fuel poverty at risk . The cold weather hit this residential street in Swindon, Wiltshire, last week where snow covered cars and left the roads treacherous . Energy prices have shot up in the last five years leaving eight out of 10 homes rationing their fuel, according to research . The statistics from the NHS Information Centre show that three-quarters of hypothermia cases are among the over-60s, and the increase in admissions has been the highest among this age group. In 2006/07, there were 633 hypothermia admissions among the over-60s, rising to 1,396 in 2010/11. This is a rise of 120 per cent. There have, however, been increases across all age groups. Among adults aged 15 to 59, cases have risen by 54 per cent to 276. There were 50 hypothermia cases among children aged 14 and under, a 22 per cent increase. Public health minister Anne Milton said the Government has put plans in place to tackle the number of cold weather deaths . The figures on deaths are not broken . down by age, but show that almost 20 per cent of those admitted die . within 30 days. A further 6 per cent die between 30 and 90 days from . admission. Meanwhile, . taking inflation into account, the price of gas has increased by 40 per . cent in the last five years to 3.4p per kilowatt hour. Electricity . prices have risen by 21 per cent to 11.8p per kilowatt hour. This . has led to a surge in the number of pensioners in 'fuel poverty', which . means the costs of energy bills make up more than 10 per cent of the . household budget. Age UK says that more than three million older people in England – nearly 1.2million of whom live alone – are in fuel poverty. This total is a quarter of all pensioners and has trebled since 2003. The elderly receive cold weather payments if the temperature falls below a certain level, but campaigners argue that the money is clearly not enough to stave off hypothermia in many cases. The parent companies of Britain's big six energy firms are expected to announce total profits of £15billion in the next few weeks, although UK consumers only contribute a small part of these profits as far as at least four of these firms are concerned – RWE nPower, E.ON, Iberdrola (Scottish Power) and EDF (France). Ofgem, the energy regulator, says the average profit per customer in Britain was £100 last month but could fall in the summer months to £70. Neil Duncan Jordan of the National Pensioners Convention described the expected profits figure as 'scandalous'. He said: 'It is a graphic example of the failure to protect some of our most vulnerable individuals.' Last night public health minister Anne Milton said: 'We have introduced a Cold Weather Plan to reduce the number of deaths. We have also set up a Warm Homes and Healthy People Fund of £30million to pay for local authority projects to reduce effects of cold weather. 'Winterwatch is also providing professionals and the public with updates and practical advice from the Chief Medical Officer.' The Department of Health said the main cause of excess winter deaths was not hypothermia but heart and respiratory disease.","1,876 patients treated for hypothermia in 2010/11 .

"A St. Louis man has been charged  with making threats against police and the St. Louis City Justice Center on Twitter. Jason Valentine, 35, faces 10 felony counts of making a terrorist threat, the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office said on Thursday. Valentine is being held on a $100,000 cash-only bail, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which did not specify which jail. Charged: Jason Valentine, 35, allegedly sent a slew of tweets threatening to 'kill a pig' in St Louis . It wasn't clear from online court records whether he has an attorney or when his first court appearance would be. Valentine allegedly tweeted about 'Kill a pig Night' throughout December, the probable cause statement said, and that he threatened an explosion at the Justice Center on Wednesday. 'St. Louis City Justice Center Mysteriously Exploded 12/31/2014,' one tweet read, according to the statement. Another said, 'New Years Eve Massacre Kill A Pig Night.'
