"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday will launch three days of hearings into the circumstances surrounding the US Airways Flight 1549 emergency landing on New York's Hudson River. In January, passengers of US Airways Flight 1549 had to be rescued out of the Hudson River after a bird strike. Looking into several issues from the January 15 incident -- from migratory birds to why a rear door opened after the landing -- the NTSB panel will hear testimony from key witnesses, including Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the pilot; and Billy Campbell, the only passenger scheduled to testify. On Monday, the NTSB corrected remarks made by board member Robert Sumwalt, who was quoted by The Associated Press as saying Campbell was being called to contradict statements made by flight attendant Doreen Welsh, who has said a panicked passenger opened the rear door. The NTSB said Sumwalt, who will lead the three days of hearings, was mistaken and that Campbell's written statement does not suggest Welsh opened the rear door. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said the board asked Campbell to testify because he had the most detailed statement of those people in the cabin at the time of the crash. ""Safety Board investigators interviewed 145 passengers, each of whom provided their own perspective on what happened,"" the NTSB said Monday night. ""Some of the passenger reports conflicted with the accounts of other passengers, including accounts of how the rear door was opened."" ""What was consistently reported by those inside the plane was that the water entered the aft section of the cabin immediately while everyone was still seated,"" the statement said, adding that the NTSB will focus on how the water gushing ""affected the ability of the passengers and the crew to evacuate the aircraft since two of the four slide-rafts were in the rear of the plane, on each of the rear doors, and they could not be used."" Sullenberger was the pilot in command during the flight, which lost power in both engines after hitting a flock of Canada geese. Bird detection, and standards for engines to handle bird strikes, are among subjects to be covered in the hearing. Other topics include pilot training for ditching and forced landings on water, and cabin-safety training, emergency procedures and equipment. CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Hearing will cover several topics, including why rear door opened after landing .

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN)  -- Inspired by images of Iranians taking to the streets to support the opposition presidential candidate, Michelle May decided to head to Tehran. Michelle May, an American and Irish national, was detained and forced to leave Iran. ""I just felt a real need to be there with my friends, and I just wanted to be a part of what could possibly be history,"" May told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday. ""So I made arrangements at the last minute."" May, who is an American and Irish national, used her Irish passport to travel to Tehran just days before the street demonstrations turned violent as Iranian authorities cracked down on those protesting the results of the June 12 election. ""I had been there two times before, and I feel very connected to the country and the people there,"" she said. ""I have a lot of friends."" Her third visit took a terrifying turn Saturday shortly after she checked for the latest news at an Internet cafe in Tehran. ""This young man befriended me. I was trying to download CNN to find out -- this was the day after the ayatollah gave his prayer on Friday,"" May said. Afterward, the man helped her hail a taxi outside the cafe to meet one of her friends for lunch, she said. ""About half an hour into that ride, the next thing I know, there are two motorbikes on either side of my taxi,"" she said. ""He's on the back of one of them, and three big Basij guys are on the other, and they pull me over. I knew what was happening."" The Basij, Iran's feared volunteer paramilitary group, has cracked down on the thousands of protesters in the bloody aftermath of the Islamic republic's disputed presidential election. ""I was terrified, and I immediately started screaming, saying no, no, no,"" May said. The young man climbed into the taxi and told her to go with him and the three other men. ""So I stood up to get out of the taxi, but then I thought I'll make a scene on the street, maybe they'll leave me alone,"" she said. ""However, that didn't work. I think because everyone's just terrified of the Basij right now."" She was forced into a car and held for more than an hour. Her captors accused her of spying, and after much back-and-forth they drove by a police station where about 50 Iranian police were hanging out. ""I actually trust the police there so I banged on the window, and the guy next to me, the one who spoke English, said, 'OK, we'll stop.' ""They brought me into the police station where I was questioned there. And I had a pretty good idea at that time that everything was going to be OK because they really had nothing on me,"" May said. ""I'm not a terrorist; I'm not a spy. So they really had nothing to go on."" She was told to leave the country, and she headed for Dubai where she spoke to CNN. May said she admires the bravery of the Iranians protesting in Tehran. ""I don't even know how they're doing it, because honestly everyone I know there is just scared,"" she said. ""They know that they're risking their lives, but they are so fed up that they're willing to do that.""","Michelle May, an American and Irish national, had been to Iran before .

"WESTERPLATTE, Poland (CNN) -- On a sand swept stretch of Afghanistan, a high-ranking Polish general put his country's mission there into perspective. The repurcussions of World War II lasted decades for Poland. He explained to a NATO delegation that Polish troops remind Afghan locals of two things about the mission: They are not Soviets and they know how difficult it is to live under foreign occupation. It is hard to ignore the incomparable price Poland paid during World War II. It was attacked by Germany, invaded by the Soviets, and became home to the notorious Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. After six brutal years, Poles were the victors in war but losers in peace, living for four decades under Soviet repression. Many here will tell you they still have not come to terms with their fate after the war. Seven decades after the start of World War II, the conflict still defines Polish identity and history. September 1, 2009 in Westerplatte, Poland turned out to be a blue sky day even as dignitaries and notably the leaders of Poland, Russia and Germany turned out to remember the dark horrors that so changed their histories. The leaders laid wreaths to honor the 'Defenders of Westerplatte', the men who died in the battle that started it all. It was here at this strategic port on the Baltic Sea, Danzig, now Gdansk, that Nazi Germany's surprise attack on Poland triggered six years of bloodletting, a savage Holocaust and the death of more than 50 million people. The Polish Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, called it a war against humanity itself. Tusk also answered critics who felt his country and the world should now move on from World War II. He warned that if anniversaries are not marked and ceremonies not planned, there may be nothing to shield us from the brutality of future wars. But still today the events of the last 70 years have left their mark and fueled some modern day controversies. Send us your war stories . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin tried to appeal directly to the people of Poland in an open letter. He reminded them that at least 27 million Russians died in the conflict but also warned against equating the Soviet Union's role in World War II with the menace of Hitler's Nazism. ""..exploiting memory, anatomizing history and seeking pretexts for mutual complaints and resentment causes a lot of harm. "" wrote Putin. He backed that up with public comments saying, ""If we talk about an objective assessment of history, we should understand that it had no one color. It was varied and there were huge number of mistakes committed by many sides. All these actions, in one way or another, created conditions for the beginning of a large-scale aggression by Nazi Germany."" Putin was at the heart of a tug-of-war over the war. Some Poles say Stalin was as evil and complicit as Hitler during the war. Russians say that callously overlooks the sacrifice of Russians in defeating Nazism and liberating Europe. In fact, it took German Chancellor Angela Merkel to put their achievement in perspective. She said that a unified, peaceful Europe was a blessing and indeed a miracle.","Poland helped win the war but lost the peace .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- A north Georgia pastor was shot to death by police when he struck an officer with his car after he was seen in a vehicle with a drug suspect, authorities told CNN. Authorities say they found nothing illegal in Jonathan Ayers' car after he was slain during a drug sting. Jonathan Ayers, pastor at Shoal Creek Baptist Church in Lavonia, Georgia, died after the incident Tuesday afternoon in the nearby town of Toccoa, Georgia, police said. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) is looking into the shooting. An undercover drug task force team had set up an operation at a local business, and had a woman under surveillance -- someone they had bought drugs from on two previous occasions, GBI spokesman John Bankhead told CNN Thursday. The officers saw the woman in a car with Ayers and saw what they believed was a drug transaction, Bankhead said. They followed the car as Ayers dropped the woman off at a gas station. The undercover officers wanted to question Ayers about what they had just seen, he said. ""They approached the vehicle. They were in plain clothes. They identified themselves as police officers, which civilian witnesses say happened. They also had badges around their necks."" Ayers put the car in reverse and backed up, striking an officer, Bankhead said. According to Bankhead, Ayers then put the car into drive, and another officer fired into the car, hitting Ayers, because he thought his life was in danger. ""The subject kept going and drove off,"" Bankhead said. ""And later he ran off the road. He was taken a local hospital, went into surgery and died an hour later."" The incident was caught on the gas station's surveillance camera. Watch surveillance video of Ayers' car hitting officer » . Police later determined what they had seen was not a drug transaction, but ""other circumstances were involved, and that's part of the investigation,"" Bankhead said. The woman who was in the car with Ayers was taken into custody and faces drug charges, Bankhead said. Stephens County sheriff Randy Shirley has placed both officers involved in the incident on paid administrative leave, he said. The officer that was struck by the car was treated and released at a local hospital. No drugs and nothing else illegal was found in Ayers' car, Bankhead said, ""even though what occurred would make any undercover officer working drugs think that was a possibility. I can't get into that, but that's what we're looking at."" Shirley told CNN the drug task force unit comprises three Georgia counties -- Stephens, Habersham and Rabun. Ayers' sister did not return a call from CNN Thursday. Ayers maintained a blog, in which he wrote that he had three loves in life: ""Jesus Christ, my wife Abby, and the Church."" Toccoa is about 95 miles northeast of Atlanta. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Authorities say Jonathan Ayers was in car with drug suspect .

"GDANSK, Poland (CNN) -- At least 20 world leaders gathered Tuesday in Poland to commemorate the start of World War II 70 years ago -- a conflict in which 6 million Poles died. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin (right) chats with his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk in Poland on Tuesday. Germany's pre-dawn invasion began when the battleship Schleswig-Holstein fired on the Westerplatte military base in Gdansk harbor on September 1, 1939. The attack set off a chain of events that eventually embroiled all of the world's major powers in the war. Polish World War II veteran Romuald Bardzynski, said: ""I was a soldier on the front, a corporal in the cavalry. On September 16 I was injured. We were fighting against the Germans but I was shot by the Soviets. I was wounded three times. ""But the worst thing for me is the land in eastern Poland which was occupied by the Soviets ... and to this day we cannot come to terms with it. ""The Russians took half of Poland, and after the Polish fighting on all the world war fronts it turns out that after the war Poland was 77 sq km smaller! This was a great loss for us."" Eugeniusz Cydzik, another Polish veteran, added: ""We have to talk about what happened ... to make sure it doesn't happen again. ""The young generations, like the boy scouts for example, are continuing the memory of those who perished. We take them to the sites of the battles. We even found munitions from the 1914 [war]."" WWII lasted until September 2, 1945 when Germany's ally Japan signed an unconditional surrender. Leaders from many of the warring nations were in Gdansk on Tuesday for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cemetery of Defenders at Westerplatte, with commemoration speeches to take place in front of the Westerplatte memorial. Among those attending were German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin -- leaders of the two nations that once held power over Poland. Merkel said on Tuesday that her country unleashed ""endless suffering"" by starting the war, but also recalled the fate of ethnic Germans expelled at the end of the conflict.  Watch as Poland marks start of WWII » . ""Germany attacked Poland, Germany started World War II. We caused unending suffering in the world. Sixty million dead ... was the result,"" Merkel said on German television, according to Agence-France Presse. Send us your World War II stories . ""But the expulsion of well over 12 million people from areas of the former Germany and present-day Poland is of course an injustice. This must also be recognized,"" she said. Poland first came under German influence at the start of the war, but was later dominated for about 40 years by the Russian-led Soviet Union as the Cold War between East and West settled in after World War II. A dwindling group of veterans, now in their 80s and 90s, was also due to attend. Later on Tuesday, many of the world's leading classical musicians, playing together as the World Orchestra for Peace, performed a concert in Krakow to mark the 70th anniversary.

"(CNN) -- Phillip Garrido had a story to tell -- about how God helped him overcome the evil inside him. Phillip Garrido, a registered sex offender, was arraigned in California on Friday. The campus at the University of California at Berkeley was his pulpit, and he hoped his neighbors and customers of his printing business would become his flock. He wanted to share his story with anyone who would listen, including law enforcement. Just days before he was arrested and an 18-year-old kidnap mystery was solved, Garrido walked into an FBI office in San Francisco, California, with a stack of documents. The purported writings were a two-part manifesto. First he discussed the ""Origin of schizophrenia revealed."" Some who know him say Garrido spoke of having schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder. In the second part of the documents, Garrido detailed his struggle with sexual urges, in writings he titled ""Stepping into the light."" In the documents, obtained by CNN, Garrido confessed his past aggressive sexual impulses, but said he is no longer that man.  Listen to Garrido speak of ""heartwarming"" story » . Garrido and his wife were charged last week with crimes relating to the abduction of 11-year-old Jaycee Lee Dugard in 1991 and her captivity in a hidden shed-and-tent compound in the couple's backyard in Antioch, California. They pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, kidnapping and false imprisonment.  See photos of Dugard's living conditions » . After his arrest, Garrido said documents he gave to the FBI would be key, that they would help people understand who he really was. He told a local television reporter the documents would show a ""heartwarming story,"" one that helped him ""completely"" turn his life around. KCRA: Read transcript of Garrido's interview after his arrest . The documents provide a glimpse into the mind of a man who said he thinks he has a God-given gift. The power to control minds with sound was his salvation, he said, and would help others before they committed violence. He wrote that he wanted to share his story to provide ""solid hope for everyone who suffers from the many forms of aggressive sexual behavior as well as other problematic behaviors."" Garrido spoke of his sexual urges during his trial in 1977, when he was convicted of abducting and raping a 25-year-old casino worker in a mini-warehouse. He spent 11 years in jail for those crimes. He testified about his sexual fantasies, which included masturbating while reading magazines, watching movies, and in restaurants or bathrooms. In his writings, he detailed how hard it was for him to control himself. Garrido wrote that he realized he couldn't control his impulses and they were plaguing the ones he loved. ""Certain behaviors cause a great deal of pain in myself and those who are victimized by those behaviors, especially our family and my wife,"" he wrote. That pain made him try to change from the predator he had become, he wrote. He said he began forcing himself to look at attractive women, but would not allow himself to act. ""See how beautiful she is to look at,"" he would tell himself. In time, Garrido wrote, he began to stop physically acting on his feelings. As time went on, Garrido wrote, he kept those sexual compulsions at bay, beginning with controlling masturbation, which he said in the past had often taken place in public. He wrote that he became free and able to experience sexual enjoyment for the first time with his wife, though it was unclear whether he was referring to Nancy, his legal wife, or to Dugard, the mother of two of his children. He claimed he realized how wrong he had been in the past. ""I realized I never needed to act or do the things I used to believe was so great and stimulating,"" Garrido wrote, referring to what he called ""one of the most powerful freedoms imaginable."" ""I began to weep telling her 'I am so sorry for the things I did in the past,' "" Garrido wrote about his wife, adding that he experienced a feeling of remorse he never had before. That feeling of salvation was something Garrido believed was a gift. He said he thought it meant it was up to him to help other sexual predators turn their lives around. ""It will begin to open a new pathway for us all. God willing, I will be teaching this and other skills Christ is providing for me in the prisons throughout the U.S. as well as overseas,"" he wrote.","Suspect Phillip Garrido gave FBI documents just days before he was arrested .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's state-run news agency said Thursday that the country has sent a letter to the United Nations announcing that ""reprocessing of spent fuel rods is at its final phase and extracted plutonium is being weaponized."" The Yongbyon nuclear facility, home of North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea can also now enter the final stage of uranium enrichment, it said in the letter to the president of the U.N. Security Council, according to state-run KCNA. When enriched to a high degree, uranium can be used as weapons-grade material. Plutonium can be used in atomic bombs. Despite stating in the letter that they ""totally reject"" a Security Council resolution in June that demanded that the country no longer pursue nuclear weapons, the North Koreans said they are ""prepared for both dialogue and sanctions,"" KCNA reported. The government also warned, ""If some permanent members of the UNSC wish to put sanctions first before dialogue, we would respond with bolstering our nuclear deterrence first before we meet them in a dialogue,"" according to KCNA. The news comes on the heels of the Obama administration's latest attempt to restart stalled nuclear negotiations with the reclusive state. In the coming days, U.S. envoy Stephen Bosworth and the director of the State Department's Office of Korean Affairs, Sung Kim, will meet with officials representing China, Japan, South Korea and Russia -- all countries partnering with the United States in talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea quit the talks in April after the U.N. Security Council censured Pyongyang for a long-range rocket test that month. In the letter Thursday, Pyongyang stated that it ""never objected to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and of the world itself. What we objected to is the structure of the six way talks which had been used to violate outrageously the DPRK's sovereignty and its right to peaceful development."" Tensions had eased somewhat in recent weeks on the Korean peninsula, giving hope to the resumption of nuclear talks with the North. In August, North and South Korea agreed to resume cross-border tourism, ease border controls and facilitate cross-border family reunions, signaling a warming in relations that had been tense for most of the year. Cross-border traffic between North and South Korea returned to normal Tuesday, after eight months of restrictions by the North. Recent meetings between Korean officials are in stark contrast to the tense public statements the nations made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. The two Koreas have officially remained in conflict since the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953, which ended in a truce, but no formal peace treaty was signed.","North's media reports N.

"CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (CNN) -- Hurricane Jimena weakened to a Category 3 storm Tuesday afternoon, but remained dangerous as it bore down on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California, with the resort town of Cabo San Lucas in its path. Jimena bears down Tuesday evening on Baja California, with the resort town of Cabo San Lucas in its path. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Erika formed in the Atlantic on Tuesday, east of the northern Leeward Islands, the National Hurricane Center said. Jimena's maximum wind speed dropped from 125 mph to 120 mph (195 kph), according to the U.S. National Weather Service's 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) update. ""A gradual weakening is forecast during the next 24 to 48 hours,"" the weather service said. ""However, Jimena could be near major hurricane strength when it makes landfall."" The storm's center is forecast to come ashore on Thursday morning, but the weather service warned that ""because it will be moving parallel to the coastline, any slight change in direction could have a huge impact in the location and timing of landfall."" Mexico's government extended a hurricane warning for most of the southern half of the Baja peninsula -- from Punta Abreojos on the peninsula's west coast to Mulege on its east coast, according to the National Weather Service.  See the storm's projected path » . A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected within the warning area in the next 24 hours and people should quickly prepare ""to protect life and property."" ""A dangerous storm surge along with battering waves will produce significant coastal flooding along the Baja California Peninsula,"" NWS said. On its current track, Jimena's center will approach the peninsula's southern portion later on Tuesday and central Baja California peninsula by Thursday, the weather service said. In addition to damaging winds, the storm could bring as much as 15 inches of rain, forecasters said. Jimena -- the 10th named storm of the Pacific season -- was centered about 85 miles (135 km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, according to the weather service. It was traveling north-northwest near 12 mph (19 kph). On Tuesday, the skies in Cabo San Lucas were overcast and gusts of wind began to pick up. There were good waves for surfing, but popular beaches were devoid of tourists. Red flags warned people to stay out of the water, in case they needed any reminding. The day before, airlines offered extra flights to leave the area. Lionel Alvarez, who runs a resort hotel called ""Las Ventanas al Pariaso"" in the town of San Jose del Cabo, found a silver lining to the coming storm. ""The wind is refreshing a little bit because of the high temperatures we've gone through in the past few days,"" he said. But Alvarez, like other locals, had work to do in preparation of Jimena. ""We protect the property by dismantling all that could be dangerous, fly or can be broken,"" he said. Authorities had asked about 10,000 people to evacuate the area, but many had decided to wait out the storm. Cuauhtemoc Morgan, a local resident of Los Cabos who sent videos to to CNN's iReport, said residents had protected every home in his neighborhood, fortifying windows with masking tape. Lines at supermarkets were long with worried residents preparing for the storms, Morgan said. See iReport videos . Authorities were setting up shelters in schools and trying to devise a plan to protect the homeless, he added. The Pacific isn't the only place seeing action. As of 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, tropical storm watches were issued for the Caribbean islands of St. Maarten, Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, Anguilla, St. Martin and St. Barthelemy by the governments of France, the Netherlands Antilles, and Antigua and Barbuda, according to the hurricane center. A tropical storm watch means that tropical storm conditions, including winds of at least 39 mph, are possible within 36 hours.  See Erika's projected path » . Interests in the northern Leeward Islands, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should monitor Erika's progress, forecasters advised. Erika's center was about 390 miles (625 km) east of the northern Leeward Islands, the hurricane center said. Its maximum sustained winds were near 50 mph (80 kph), with higher gusts. While Erika meandered Tuesday afternoon, it was expected to start moving west-northwest at about 9 mph during the night. ""Some slow strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days,"" forecasters said. Tropical-storm force winds extended outward up to 105 miles (170 km) from Erika's center. The storm was moving west-northwest at near 9 mph (15 kph), and was expected to continue doing so for the next couple of days, the hurricane center said. Tracking maps put the storm east of the Bahamas by Sunday. On the forecast track, Erika should remain northeast of the Leeward Islands, forecasters said.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A NATO airstrike on a pair of hijacked fuel trucks early Friday in northern Afghanistan killed at least 90 people -- a mix of Taliban militants and civilians, NATO and provincial officials said. A victim of an ISAF airstrike on a hijacked oil tanker is carried into the Kunduz hospital on Friday. Capt. Elizabeth Mathias of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, also known as ISAF, said the military believed there were no civilians near the trucks at the time of the attack. NATO learned afterward that was not the case. ""Based on what we know, there were civilians there,"" Mathias said. Local Afghan officials were quoted as saying in some news reports that nearly half the people killed in the airstrike were civilians who rushed the fuel trucks. Mathias declined to confirm those numbers. Investigators are trying to determine who was at the site and whether a mistake was made, Mathias said. She said a local NATO team is already in Kunduz province conducting an investigation with Afghan forces and another team from the central office is on its way.  Watch more about the airstrikes » . ""Because of the prevalence of reports of civilian casualties, we don't want to be seen as ignoring the situation,"" Mathias said. ""We don't want to wait. If something happened, we want to apologize."" Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is following the investigation, his public affairs officer, Lt. Col. Tadd Sholtis, said in an e-mail. ""He takes the possible loss of any innocent life seriously, and while he will not rush to judgment on the facts, he is following the investigation very closely,"" Sholtis said. Brigadier General Eric Tremblay released a statement that said, ""ISAF will do whatever is necessary to help the community, including medical assistance and evacuation as requested. ISAF regrets any unnecessary loss of human life, and is deeply concerned for the suffering that this action may have caused to our Afghan friends.""  See images of the strike aftermath » . Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths and reiterated that no civilians should be killed or injured in anti-terrorist military operations. Sholtis said McChrystal ""has been in touch with President Karzai and leadership of the major ministries on the incident."" Karzai's office issued a statement saying he had ordered a delegation to the area to investigate the incident and report back to him as soon as possible. The delegation includes representatives of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, National Directorate of Security, and the Provincial Administrative Department, according to the statement. A spokesman for the provincial governor, Mahboobullah Sayeedi, said more than 90 people were killed. The fuel trucks were hijacked late Thursday in Kunduz province and were spotted several hours later on the banks of the Kunduz River, ISAF said. The hijacked vehicles became stuck in the Chardara area of the Ali Abaad district while trying to cross the river, according to Sayeedi. Militants had commandeered the trucks, which were carrying fuel for NATO forces, he said. People tried to empty fuel from the tankers when they couldn't go any farther. With the trucks stuck on the riverbank, the German commander of the NATO forces called in the airstrike around 2:30 a.m., the German military said. No German soldiers or planes were involved in the airstrike, but a German patrol made it to the site about 10 hours after the attack and came under small-arms fire, the German military said. The patrol continued its investigation Friday afternoon.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French trader accused of a multi-billion-dollar fraud at banking giant Societe Generale will go on trial next year, a lawyer for the bank said Tuesday. Kerviel faces up to five years in prison if convicted of fraud charges. Jerome Kerviel will face charges including forgery, breach of trust, and introducing fraudulent data into the bank's data system, Societe Generale lawyer Jean Veil told CNN. He faces a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to €375,000 euros ($538,000), Veil said. The bank also will ask that Kerviel reimburse them for almost 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion), ""which probably he will not pay,"" Veil said. The trial is expected to start in the first half of 2010, perhaps in May or June, Veil said. It will take place at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, he said. Kerviel, who is now free on bail, was arrested last year after Societe Generale unveiled trading losses of more than $7.2 billion. The bank attributed the losses to fraud by Kerviel, who traded European index futures for the bank. Kerviel is the only one charged in the case. His assistant, Thomas Mougard, was cleared of charges Monday, Veil said. Societe Generale believes Kerviel alone was responsible for the losses, which the bank announced in January 2008. Kerviel maintains he was not acting alone, Veil said. ""The decision of the (court) confirms 100 percent the complaint of the bank, and that Kerviel was alone when he organized this massive fraud and that he was acting completely out of his (own accord),"" Veil told CNN.","Jerome Kerviel faces charges including forgery, breach of trust, false data entry .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A California woman who turned up alive 18 years after being kidnapped at age 11 is reconnecting with her family after nearly two decades apart, her aunt said Thursday. Tina Dugard speaks to the media Thursday about how her niece Jaycee is reconnecting with her family. Police said Thursday that the man charged with abducting and raping Jaycee Lee Dugard had been accused of raping a 14-year-old in 1972, but those charges were dropped for unknown reasons.

Dugard is spending time in ""a secluded place, reconnecting"" with her mother and younger sister, said Jaycee's aunt, Tina Dugard, who spent time with them. The two children born to her during her captivity are ""clever, articulate, curious girls,"" she said. ""This is a joyful time for my family,"" she said. ""Jaycee remembers all of us."" Jaycee Lee Dugard was kidnapped in 1991 from a bus stop near her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, and discovered last week. Authorities say a couple kidnapped her and raised her in a compound of tents and outbuildings in the backyard of their Antioch, California, home for 18 years. Nancy and Phillip Garrido have been charged with a total of 29 felonies, including the rape and kidnapping of Dugard, who police say gave birth to two daughters fathered by Garrido during her captivity. The Garridos have pleaded not guilty. Philip Garrido is a registered sex offender. Tina Dugard appeared in Los Angeles on Thursday to read a statement on behalf of her family.

""They are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them."" The girls are 11 and 15. ""Although they have no formal education, they are certainly educated,"" she said. ""Jaycee did a truly amazing job with the limited resources and education that she herself had, and we are so proud of her."" Tina Dugard said Jaycee's mother's smile is ""as wide as the sea."" ""Her oldest daughter is finally home,"" she said. Dugard, now 29, is enjoying catching up on the years missed with her family, Tina Dugard said. ""She is especially enjoying getting to know her little sister, who was just a baby when Jaycee was taken,"" she said. ""Not only have we laughed and cried together, but we've spent time sitting quietly, taking pleasure in each other's company."" The Dugard family statement thanked the law enforcement and social agencies involved in reconnecting them. ""Their support and professionalism have been invaluable,"" it said. A trust fund has been established for donations to help Dugard, the aunt said. ""It has come to my family's attention that there may be unauthorized solicitation of funds to support Jaycee and the family,"" she said. The family released three photos of a young Dugard. One was taken at her grandmother's home when she was 3. A second showed her dressed as a punk rocker the Halloween before her abduction.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Who's the greatest driver of all-time? Michael Schumacher? Maybe Alain Prost? Ayrton Senna perhaps? In an exclusive interview with CNN, three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart had no hesitation in naming his choice for the greatest driver of all-time. Three-time F1 champion, Jackie Stewart back in his heyday. ""My hero, and the man I most respected and probably still do is Juan Manuel Fangio."" Stewart told CNN. It's not misty-eyed nostalgia for a bygone era that persuades ""The Flying Scot,"" as Stewart became known. And it wasn't just Fangio's tally of world titles that convinced Stewart; it is the manner in which the Argentine legend saw off his rivals. Who do you think is the greatest? ""Fangio won five world championships almost in a different car every year. He had the dignity, the style and the ability,"" Stewart explained. What's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. Though Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. ""His batting average was very good and he didn't race in too many grands prix."" Clark -- who was tragically killed racing at Hockenheim in 1968 -- won 25 of his 73 Formula One races. Stewart's record is comparable, winning 27 from 100 starts. It's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes. ""I'm on record as saying winning is not enough, it's easy to win. Most people win. To be successful, like a Fangio or a Jim Clark is more difficult.""  See our photo gallery of Formula One's greatest drivers » . As much as Stewart admires seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, he's finds it hard to put the German in the same league as Fangio or Clark. ""Not to take anything away from him [Schumacher], but his car was so dominant and his team had so much in terms of money and resources,"" Stewart said. ""Although he has won more, his batting average isn't as good -- from starts to wins -- as Fangio or Clark."" Stewart, who retired from Formula One in 1973, is a great admirer of the current crop of drivers and he singled out Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel as potential legends of the future. But they have a long way to match Stewart's record of three Drivers' Championships, let alone Fangio or Schumacher. Do you agree with Jackie Stewart? Or do you think that Michael Schumacher is the greatest? Have we missed anyone you think deserves special mention?

"CIANJUR, Indonesia (CNN)  -- More than a day after a major earthquake jolted Indonesia's Java Island, killing at least 57 people, there is still no word from remote villages along the coast, a relief worker told CNN Thursday. Soldiers try to dig out the body of a victim buried by a landslide caused by the earthquake. ""This earthquake has injured hundreds of people and (destroyed or damaged) thousands of houses,"" World Vision's Katarina Hardono said. ""We worry that the number can be easily more because in many places, actually the coastal areas, we still (haven't gotten) any news."" Rescuers are still searching for dozens of people feared trapped in a quake-triggered landslide in Cianjur in West Java. They pulled several bodies from the rubble Thursday bringing the death toll from the quake to 57. ""The death count has been thankfully low, but we have to remember that tens of thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed and children and adults are urgently in need of relief items,"" said Hardono, who spoke to CNN from the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Rainfall Thursday hampered the rescue efforts in Cianjur, where the landslide buried at least 11 homes where 32 people live, local officials said.  Watch description of the evacuation after the quake hit » . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited Cianjur, and vowed to free up nearly $500,000 (5 billion rupiahs) for emergency response efforts, according to the state-run Antara news agency. He said there was no need for foreign assistance just yet. ""Until now the Indonesian government is still able to handle it by itself using existing national resources,"" he said, according to Antara. Rescuers in Cianjur used their hands and rudimentary tools to try to pry away the rocks, some that were bigger than cars. No heavy machinery could be brought in to help in the rescue effort because many roads in the area were blocked.

"(CNN) -- A former ""Manson family"" member who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and is now terminally ill faces her 13th parole hearing on Wednesday. Susan Atkins, shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders, has a parole hearing Wednesday. Susan Atkins, 61, has terminal brain cancer. As of earlier this year, she was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. However, despite her declining health and an impressive prison record, Whitehouse wrote, ""there is still a very real chance the Parole Board will nonetheless insist her release would be a danger to society."" The hearing will be held at the Central California Women's Facility at Chowchilla, California, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins was moved to the Chowchilla facility from the California Institution for Women at Frontera last year because of her illness.  Watch Linda Kasabian describe the murders » . ""Last we heard, she is expected to attend,"" Thornton said Tuesday of Atkins. The proceeding is scheduled to be held in a hearing room, but depending on Atkins' condition, it could be held at her bedside, Thornton said. The panel is expected to render its decision following the hearing after deliberating behind closed doors, she said. Atkins -- California's longest-serving female inmate -- has been denied parole 12 times previously, Thornton said. She was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969. She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles ""Tex"" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night. Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress, who was eight months pregnant, 16 times. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate ""asked me to let her baby live. ... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" After killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home at the time, but three of Tate's houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage. If the panel decides to grant Atkins parole -- called a ""tentative suitability finding"" -- the decision is subject to a 120-day review process by the California Board of Parole Hearings, Thornton said. If it still stands, the matter then goes to the governor's office. The governor's options include allowing the decision to stand, actively approving it, modifying it or reversing it, according to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Web site. However, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has previously opposed Atkins' request for compassionate release -- a request made by terminally ill patients wishing to be released before death. The Board of Parole Hearings unanimously denied that request in July 2008. It was also opposed by Debra Tate, Sharon Tate's sister. If parole is not granted, another hearing will be set in three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years, at the discretion of the panel, Thornton said. Atkins has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson. But Debra Tate told CNN in an e-mail in March she does not believe any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were ""so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back."" ""The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,"" Debra Tate said. ""They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do."" In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins, who was known within the Manson family as Sadie Mae Glutz, wrote that ""this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day."" ""Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'"" Atkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7.","Susan Atkins has admitted she stabbed pregnant actress Sharon Tate to death .

"(Mental Floss) -- News outlets reported this week that legendary broadcaster Walter Cronkite never amended his will to include Joanna Simon, who had been his girlfriend for the last four years of his life. Cronkite's daughter said the newsman never planned to leave Simon, a former opera singer and older sister of Carly Simon, any sort of inheritance, but either way, wills are back in the news. Leona Helmsley left her dog Trouble $12 million dollars in her will. What better time to look at some of the most bizarre codicils ever written? 1. Leona Helmsley . The notoriously egomaniacal hotelier famously left $12 million to her Maltese, Trouble, while entirely cutting two of her grandchildren out of her will (for ""reasons which are known to them""). Her other two grandchildren didn't get off the hook entirely; their inheritances were contingent upon their regularly making visits to their father's grave, where they would have to sign a registration book to prove they had shown up. 2. Carlotta Liebenstein . Don't think Trouble Helmsley is the richest pooch on the block. When Liebenstein, a German countess, died in 1991, she left her entire $80-million estate to her dog, Gunther. 3. Jeremy Bentham . The 18th-and-19th-century social philosopher left the world a rather odd bequest in his will: his preserved, clothed body. No one's quite sure what Bentham was getting at with this ""gift,"" but since his 1832 death his clothed skeleton -- topped with a wax model of Bentham's head -- has been preserved in a wood-and-glass cabinet known as the Auto-Icon. It now resides at University College London and is occasionally moved so Bentham can ""attend"" meetings. Bentham didn't want for the Auto-Icon to feature a wax head; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death. However, the preservation process distorted his face, so the wax replica had to stand in. For many years Bentham's real head sat between his feet in the Auto-Icon, but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away. Mental Floss: 10 things your body can do after you die . 4. Sandra West . West, a California socialite and oil heiress, died when she was just 37 years old and requested that she be buried ""in my lace nightgown ... in my Ferrari, with the seat slanted comfortably."" Her family buried West in her powder-blue 1964 Ferrari 330 America, then covered the car with cement to deter car thieves. Good call: nice examples of that year's 330 America can now sell for well over $300,000. 5. Luis Carlos de Noronha Cabral da Camara . The Portuguese aristocrat was a childless bachelor, so he divvied up his estate by picking 70 names at random from the Lisbon phone book in 1988. When he died 13 years later, his attorneys notified the unsuspecting beneficiaries that they stood to inherit their benefactor's cash, his home, and his car. 6. Charles Millar . The Canadian attorney died a childless bachelor, but he left $568,106 to the mother who gave birth to the most children in Toronto in the 10 years following his 1928 death. This bequest prompted what Canadians called ""the Baby Derby"" as mothers raced to win the fortune. Finally, in 1938 four winners split the prize after giving birth to nine babies apiece. Mental Floss: Names you probably shouldn't give your kid . 7. Heinrich Heine . The German poet left his entire fortune to his wife, but with one catch: she had to remarry ""because then there will be at least one man to regret my death."" 8. S. Sanborn . Sanborn, a 19th-century New England hatter, left a rather macabre bequest to a friend -- a pair of drums made from Sanborn's skin. The friend received further instructions to go to Bunker Hill each June 17th and play ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"" on the drums. 9. T.M. Zink . Zink, an Iowa lawyer who died in 1930, must have had some pretty bad experiences with women. When he died he left his daughter a measly five bucks, and his wife got nothing. He stipulated that the rest of his $100,000 estate be put in a trust for 75 years, then used to create the Zink Womanless Library. The library would have no feminine decorations, no books or magazine articles by female authors, and was required to have ""No Women Admitted"" carved into the stone over the entrance. 10. Robert Louis Stevenson . When the celebrated author died, he left his friend Annie H. Ide his birthday. Ide had previously complained to Stevenson about the inconvenience of being born on Christmas, so the writer left her November 13th as a new birthday provided she take care of it with ""moderation and humanity... the said birthday not being so young as it once was."" 11. Henry Budd . It's not clear how he originally made 200,000 pounds, but when Henry Budd died in 1862, he left his substantial fortune to his two sons on the condition that neither sullied his lip with a mustache. 12. Mark Gruenwald . When longtime comic book writer and editor Mark Gruenwald died in 1996, fans of the Marvel Comics icon probably thought they'd seen the last of the former Captain America writer. Gruenwald had other ideas, though. He requested that his ashes be mixed into the ink used to print the first trade paperback anthology of Squadron Supreme, another one of his landmark creations.

"(CNN) -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity. Rifqa Bary, 17, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July. She claims her father threatened to kill her. The 17-year-old girl, Rifqa Bary, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando, Florida. Bary's parents want her back home. At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them. Also at the hearing, Judge Daniel Dawson of the Orange County Juvenile Court ordered the girl and her parents to seek the mediation within 30 days. The judge had previously ruled that the girl will remain in Florida foster care until the allegations are resolved. The parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them. They denied they ever threatened to kill their daughter because she converted to Christianity. Mohamed Bary told CNN he believes a lot of false information has been circulated about the case. ""We wouldn't do her harm,"" the father said, adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations. ""I have no problem with her practicing any faith,"" he said. But Bary conceded he would have preferred that his daughter practice the Muslim faith first. The teen had heard of pastor Lorenz and his church through a prayer group on Facebook. The girl's parents reported her missing to Columbus police, who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records. The teenager, in a sworn affidavit, claims her father, 47, was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to ""deal with the situation."" In the court filing, Rifqa Bary stated her father said, ""If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me!"" The teenager claims her father added, ""I will kill you!""  Watch the teen talk about her fears » . Also at Thursday's hearing, the judge sealed a report on the girl from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and issued a gag order for attorneys in the case. At one point during the hearing, the girl's court-appointed guardian, Krista Bartholomew, told the court: ""This is not a holy war but a case about a broken family."" Outside the courthouse after the hearing, a Muslim activist and several Christian activists exchanged words over the case.  Watch the heated exchanges » .

"Editor's note: Ivan Watson is CNN's correspondent based in Istanbul, Turkey. The Bamiyan Valley is a visually and archaeologically stunning part of Afghanistan. The region hopes to build its tourism industry. (CNN) -- Thursday is ""Chinese night"" at the Hotel Silk Road in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province. Hungry guests sip cans of Coke and nonalcoholic beer and pick at a buffet that includes General Tsao's chicken, egg drop soup and slices of sweet green melon grown in nearby fields. When a vegetarian diner arrives, the hotel's Japanese owner, Hiromi Yasui, runs back to the kitchen to whip up a dish of spinach, garlic and steamed rice. ""This is the most clean kitchen in Bamiyan,"" she boasts in heavily accented English, as she directs her staff of Afghan assistants in fluent Dari. Yasui proudly points to an electric dishwasher, perhaps the only one of its kind in this battle-scarred Afghan province. The Hotel Silk Road has been open for less than two years. The green concrete walls of this compound jar somewhat with the brown, mud brick architecture of Bamiyan Valley. But the hotel is probably the largest foreign private investment in Bamiyan's fledgling tourism industry since the overthrow of the Taliban eight years ago.  See photos of the Bamiyan Province » . Aid workers say tourism is one of the greatest economic hopes for reviving this isolated, yet visually -- and archaeologically -- stunning part of Afghanistan, a region that has seen little infrastructure development over the last eight years, even though Bamiyan is one of the safest parts of the country.  Tour the Bamiyan Valley's caves » . ""The natural resources and cultural resources here are probably the single best place for economic development to happen, around revitalizing the tourism industry here,"" says Bob Thelen, the representative for the Aga Khan Development Network in Bamiyan. The nonprofit organization has been working with the government of New Zealand to distribute $1.2 million over a three-year period to develop eco-tourism as an industry in Bamiyan. Bamiyan first attracted widespread international attention in 2001, when Taliban militants spent weeks blowing up two giant statues of Buddha. For more than 1,500 years, these colossal figures -- one was 53 meters (174 feet) high, the other 35 meters (115 feet) -- stood like sentries overlooking this alpine valley. Today, the massive caves where the Buddhas once stood are huge, empty pockets carved into cliffs that dominate the countryside. Despite the loss of these archaeological treasures, the cave network of monasteries that honeycomb the cliffs, as well as Bamiyan's breathtaking mountains and alpine lakes, continue to attract a trickle of both Afghan and foreign tourists. Hotel Silk Road owner Yasui spotted Bamiyan's potential when she first traveled here as a photojournalist in 1996. ""Before the war, this was a touristic place,"" she says. ""More than 7,000 cars a day visited here."" In the '60s and '70s, Afghanistan was a Central Asian stop on the Hippie Trail, a destination favored by hash-smoking Western visitors driving Volkswagen vans. But the Soviet invasion of 1979 plunged the country into a decades-long spiral of conflict. Bamiyan became the site of horrific massacres during the civil war of the 1990s and the subsequent rise of the Taliban. The Taliban's overthrow in 2001 seemed to open the door to new opportunity. In 2002, with the help of her Afghan husband and a Japanese investor who fronted hundreds of thousands of dollars, Yasui purchased a plot of land next to a bend in the river that runs through the valley. The couple then spent the next five years building their hotel. ""I like Afghanistan, I like Bamiyan,"" Yasui explains. ""[But in the past,] I didn't want to stay more than three days, because there was no shower, no place to sleep."" Yasui's hotel opened in 2007. Rooms cost $100 a night, pricing them far out of the range of most Afghans. Guests must remove their shoes at the entrance and wear slippers, in accordance with Yasui's strict standards of hygiene. ""The furniture has all been imported from Pakistan,"" Yasui said. ""I bought the water glasses from the PX [American military supermarket] in Kabul."" Yasui is not the only hotelier in Bamiyan. In 2003, an Afghan businessman named Raziq got a jump-start on the local tourism industry, when he and several partners rented a house on a plateau offering a spectacular view of the Buddha cliffs. The building had been housing American special forces soldiers. Raziq and his partners rechristened it the Roof of Bamiyan Hotel. Raziq, an ethnic Hazara who learned American-accented English catering to foreigners on Kabul's touristic Chicken Street, says he got his inspiration to open a hotel after he saw female Western backpackers paying to sleep on the floor of a grimy tea shop in Bamiyan's dusty bazaar. Over the last year, the Afghan government declared Bamiyan's Band-i-Amir lake, which sits 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) above sea level, the country's first national park. The New Zealand-funded eco-tourism project, in conjunction with the Aga Khan Foundation, also recently trained 22 young male and female Afghans to be professional tour guides. The three-month course included ""the relevant topics for this area, geology, archaeology, history, hospitality, English, communication skills,"" said Thelen, of the Aga Khan Development Network. One of these guides is former Roof of Bamiyan employee Jawad Wafa. Though only 23 years old, this ambitious young Afghan plans to launch a tourism and logistics company, complete with a fleet of rental vehicles and guides. ""The first thing we need to have more tourists in Bamiyan, we need security and peace. The second one is roads,"" Wafa says. Eight years after the overthrow of the Taliban, the entire province of Bamiyan has barely 3 kilometers (about 2 miles) of paved roads. Travel here from Kabul requires at least seven hours driving on a bone-jarring dirt track. But even this isolated oasis is feeling the threat of the mounting violence spreading across the country. ""Every time there is a bomb in Kabul, visitors cancel reservations,"" says Raziq, operator of the Roof of Bamiyan Hotel. And in recent months, troops from New Zealand have documented a spike in insurgent attacks, mostly along Bamiyan's border with Baghlan province, a region where Taliban insurgents have grown increasingly active. ""As much as on the one hand you can promote Bamiyan and other pockets throughout Afghanistan as secure and peaceful, there's always the very real threat of violence,"" Thelen said. Tour operators saw a dramatic drop in foreign visitors this summer, due to the uncertainty and violence surrounding the August 20 presidential elections. In fact, the handful of people seen touring the remains of the Buddha statues last week were mostly American aid workers. They were sent by their organizations from less secure parts of Afghanistan, to take temporary shelter within the mountain walls of Bamiyan Valley.","Bamiyan is one of the safest parts of Afghanistan .

"BRUNSWICK, Georgia (CNN)  -- Guy Heinze Jr., the son of one of the victims of last week's killings of eight people in a southeast Georgia mobile home, has been arrested on eight counts of first degree murder, police said Friday. Guy Heinze Jr. faces eight first degree murder charges related to a shooting at a Georgia mobile home. Investigators obtained an arrest warrant Friday evening for Heinze, 22, just hours after he had been freed from jail on charges of tampering with evidence and making false statements to a police officer, Glynn County, Georgia, Police Chief Matt Doering said. ""I can assure you that this person is responsible,"" Doering said at a news conference Friday evening. The bodies were discovered last Saturday at New Hope Plantation mobile home park, north of the Atlantic coastal city of Brunswick. Seven died in the mobile home, and the eighth died Sunday at a hospital. Doering refused to reveal how the victims were killed or the suspected motive. A 3-year-old who was injured struggles on life support at a Savannah hospital, her grandmother said. Heinze, who is unemployed, told police he was not home when the killings occurred.  Watch sheriff describe attack as ""the most heinous crime we've ever had in the community"" » . According to the earlier arrest warrant, Heinze provided ""investigators with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading up to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members."" The arrest warrant also said he removed a shotgun from the residence and hid it in the trunk of his car. A man identified as Heinze reported the slayings. He told an emergency dispatcher when he called Saturday, ""I was out last night. I got home just now, and everybody's dead. ... My whole family's dead. It looks like they've been beaten to death.""  Listen to the 911 call » . Seven of the eight victims will be buried Saturday, as a 3-year-old who was injured struggles to survive at a Savannah hospital. The toddler's grieving grandmother, Diane Isenhower, who lost four of her children in the rampage, said the child is on life support. Police said seven of the victims died in the mobile home, and the eighth died Sunday at a hospital. The funeral for Joseph L. West, 30, is to be held at mid-month. For the other seven, viewing was scheduled for Friday night, and a funeral is to be held Saturday afternoon at Youngs Island Church in Eulonia, Georgia. West was the boyfriend of Chrissy Toler, 22, who died along with her father, Russell D. Toler Sr., 44, and three siblings: Michelle Toler, 15; Michael Toler, 19; and Russell D. Toler Jr., 20. Michael Toler had Down syndrome. Russell Toler Sr. and Isenhower were divorced. Also killed were Guy Heinze Sr., 45 and Brenda Gail Falagan, 49, police said. Clint Rowe, whose wife is Isenhower's sister, said the family was having trouble coping with the losses and noted that police, too, were affected. ""They're the ones who walked in on that, so you know it wears on the police as well,"" he said. Referring to Isenhower, he added, ""It has been a long week for her.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Children with high-risk medical conditions or disabilities should be among the first to be vaccinated against H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Thursday. CDC: The H1N1 virus is spreading in the United States, particularly in the Southeast. And high-risk children under 18 years of age should be rushed to a doctor at the first sign of the virus, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, CDC director. In addition, doctors should be aware that some otherwise healthy children with bacterial infections may be more susceptible to the flu, he told reporters during a conference call. Frieden said the vaccine should be available by mid-October, and will be free at public hospitals and other sites. All schoolchildren should be vaccinated, he said. ""We also are recommending that all people with underlying conditions get vaccinated -- people who have asthma, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, neuromuscular conditions, neurological conditions that increase their risk factors and women who are pregnant,"" Frieden added. As of August 22, there had been 556 deaths in the United States associated with the H1N1 virus, and 42 of those deaths were children under the age of 18. The figures were published August 28 on the CDC Web site. Thursday, the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report focused on the pediatric cases -- 36 that were counted among the 477 flu-related deaths up to August 8.  Watch more on what the CDC had to say about H1N1 influenza » . Seven of the children who died were younger than 5 years old, the report said, and 24 had underlying disabilities, such as muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy, or one or more high-risk medical conditions. Frieden said the H1N1 virus -- which he said never really went away, judging by the cases reported this summer -- is spreading in the United States, particularly in the Southeast. ""The good news is that so far, everything that we've seen, both in this country and abroad, shows that the virus has not changed to become more deadly. That means that although it may affect lots of people, most people will not be severely ill,"" he said. He noted, however, that both H1N1 and the seasonal flu are unpredictable. Because of this, health professionals have to be ready to change their protocols based on any new information. On Wednesday, the CDC said there were six suspected cases among its approximately 7,000 employees at the Atlanta, Georgia, headquarters. Frieden referenced findings by federal agencies who were asked to study the impact of H1N1 in the Southern Hemisphere. They examined data from Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand and Uruguay, since they more closely resemble U.S. demographics and economic development. ""All countries report that after mid-July, disease activity in most parts of the country decreased. This indicates that the duration of the current influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere, in which the 2009 H1N1 virus is the predominate strain, may be similar in length to an average seasonal influenza season,"" according to the Flu.gov Web site. Earlier Thursday, the Institute of Medicine released a report recommending a major step up in protection for health workers dealing with patients suspected or confirmed to have H1N1 influenza. The institute, in recommendations requested by the CDC, said loose paper masks are inadequate because workers can still breathe in the virus. Instead, health workers should switch to a specific type of mask -- N95 respirators -- that form an airtight seal around the nose and mouth. CNN's Mariam Falco contributed to this report.","CDC: Children with medical issues should be among the first to get H1N1 vaccine .

"(CNN) -- The airline operating an Airbus A310-300 jet that crashed in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday with 153 people aboard was being monitored by EU authorities, according to France's transport minister. An Airbus 310 like the one pictured crashed while on the way to the capital of Comoros. Dominique Bussereau told French television that inspectors in his country had also noted several faults on the doomed Yemenia Airways plane, Agence France-Presse reported. ""The company was not on the blacklist (of airlines banned from European airspace) but was being subjected to closer inspection by us and was due to soon be heard by the security committee of the European Union,"" Bussereau said. The Airbus A310 was inspected in France in 2007 by the French civil aviation authority and ""a certain number of faults had been noted."" ""The plane had not since then reappeared in our country,"" he added. However, Chris Yates, an aviation analyst for Jane's Information Group, said he suspected weather and/or airport failings were a greater factor in the crash than a technical fault.  Recent plane crashes » . ""It's more than likely to be a weather-related incident. Having said that, you cannot rule out a maintenance issue,"" Yates told CNN. Yemenia Air had used the jet since 1999, on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would assist in investigating the crash. ""We are extremely saddened and our thoughts are with the families, friends and loved ones affected by this accident,"" Airbus spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma told CNN. ""We are giving our maximum support and assistance to the authorities and the airline."" ""This includes a team of Airbus experts that will go on site and our crisis center has been open since early this morning, where our specialists work in direct contact with the airline and the authorities,"" Bergsma added. ""The task now is to gather as much information as possible, including retrieval of the black boxes, to help us understand what happened. This will need time and patience."" It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation. In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s. One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A man who allegedly set off a small bomb at a Starbucks coffee shop was arrested after he made the mistake of bragging about his exploit to friends, police said Wednesday. An NYPD officer stands guard outside a Starbucks where a bomb went off on Memorial Day. New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told reporters that Kyle Shaw, 17, was arrested Tuesday night at his Manhattan apartment after a police investigation revealed that he bragged to his friends about planting the explosive outside an Upper East Side Starbucks on May 25. Shaw allegedly told his friends prior to the explosion that ""Project Mayhem"" was about to begin, Kelly said, and that they should watch the news on Memorial Day. Shaw was a fan of the movie ""Fight Club"" and imitated Brad Pitt's character from the film, the police commissioner said -- although he apparently failed to adhere to Pitt's famous line in the film: ""The first rule of Fight Club is, you do not talk about Fight Club."" The movie, released in 1999, also includes a scene in which a Starbucks is destroyed. Kelly said there is no evidence at this time to suggest that Shaw was behind other recent small explosions in the city, such as the bombings at the Times Square Army recruiting center and the Mexican consulate. Shaw made the small explosive out of a plastic bottle, firework powder, a metal cap and electrical tape, Kelly said. The blast, at 3:30 a.m. on Memorial Day, damaged a nearby bench and shattered the store's windows, the commissioner said. No one was injured in the explosion, but the bomb was powerful enough to have caused serious injuries if anyone had been nearby, Kelly said. Shaw has been charged with arson, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal mischief, he added.","Police: Suspect, 17, wanted to launch ""Project Mayhem"" with bomb .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps, now the candidates will play nice. For all their insistence on how unlike they are from one another, the three U.S. presidential candidates share some noteworthy family connections, the New England Historic Genealogical Society has found. Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, who has made his opposition to the Iraq war a linchpin of his campaign, is distantly related not only to President George W. Bush but also to another wartime leader -- former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Because of his shared ancestry with President Bush, Obama is also indirectly related to his rival on the Republican side, Sen. John McCain. McCain, it turns out, is a sixth cousin of First Lady Laura Bush. Meanwhile, Sen. Hillary Clinton, is related to beatnik author Jack Kerouac, Canadian Prime Minster Pierre Trudeau and Camilla Parker-Bowles, wife of Prince Charles of England. Clinton also shares ancestors with Grammy Award-winning singers Celine Dion and Madonna. The senator won a Best Spoken Word Grammy for the audio version of her book, ""It Takes a Village."" Rival Obama also snagged one in the same category for his book ""The Audacity of Hope."" Conservatives who sometimes accuse Democrats of being in bed with liberal Hollywood elites may have been handed one more round of ammunition by the Society's findings. Clinton, the Society said, is related to Angelina Jolie. And Obama is related to Jolie's boyfriend Brad Pitt.  Watch a report on the candidates' family trees and other news » . The New England Historic Genealogical Society, founded in 1845, says it is the oldest such organization in the country. Members spent three years tracing the lineage of the candidates. Among its other findings: . McCain, the Vietnam War veteran who spent five years as a prisoner of war, descends from a long line of kings: Scottish King William the Lion, English King Edward I and French King Louis VII. Obama, the son of a white woman from Kansas and a black man from Kenya, is ""related to millions of contemporary Americans - perhaps even a significant percentage of the population,"" the researchers said. He is cousins with six U.S presidents, including Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman and Gerald Ford. He is also linked to American artist Georgia O'Keefe, the Duchess of Windsor and two men who signed the Declaration of Independence. Most surprisingly, Obama -- the man who could become America's first African-American president -- is linked by ancestry to Robert E.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Thursday called the U.S. president inexperienced, compared him unfavorably to President George W. Bush and suggested he apologize for ""interfering in Iran's affairs."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out at President Obama on Thursday. ""Do you think that this kind of behavior is going to solve any of your problems? It will only make people think you are someone like Bush,"" the semiofficial Fars news agency quoted Ahmadinejad as saying. ""You are at the beginning of your way and you are gaining experience, and we do not wish the scandals of the Bush era to be repeated during your term of office,"" the Iranian leader said.

Watch how U.S.-Iran relations got to this point . Pro-government security forces have cracked down on the protests, with officials saying 17 people have died. Unofficial reports suggest the number is much higher. Official results gave Ahmadinejad a 2-to-1 victory over his nearest rival, former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Moussavi. Moussavi says the results were rigged. Obama has said Iranians must be free to demonstrate peacefully, and his administration Wednesday withdrew invitations to Iranian diplomats around the world to attend U.S. embassy Fourth of July parties. The extension of invitations last month was seen as a cautious outreach to Iran, which has not had diplomatic relations with Washington for 30 years.

"Editor's note: Rudy Ruiz founded RedBrownandBlue.com, a site featuring multicultural political commentary, hosts a nationally syndicated Spanish-language radio show; and wrote a guide to success for immigrants (""¡Adelante!"" published by Random House). He is co-founder and president of Interlex, an advocacy marketing agency based in San Antonio, Texas. Rudy Ruiz says people hold on to their views despite the evidence for fear of being labeled a flip-flopper. SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- As people shout over each other and tune out diverging views in town hall meetings, the health care debate is proving to be symptomatic of a major ailment threatening our nation: . A contagious culture of closed-mindedness threatens to suffocate our progress as a society. Why has it become so difficult to even consider changing our minds about important issues? Here's my diagnosis. Increasingly, the willingness to change one's position on political issues has been misread as a mark of weakness rather than a product of attentive listening and careful deliberation. During the 2004 Presidential campaign, the successful branding of John Kerry as a flip-flopper doomed his bid. Fear of ""flip-flopper syndrome"" is apparently catching like the flu, because today politicians are not alone in their determination to adhere to partisan positions despite the changing needs of our nation. Nearly everyone's so reluctant to appear wishy-washy that they stand firm even when the evidence is against their views. Three factors exacerbate this paralysis by lack of analysis: labels, lifestyles and listening. First, the labels ascribed to many potential policy tools render sensible options taboo, loading what could be rational, economic or social measures with moral baggage. This narrows our choices, hemming in policy makers. Any proposal including the words ""government-run"" elicits cries of ""socialism"" and ""communism."" Any argument invoking the words ""God"" or ""moral"" sparks accusations of ""right-wing extremism,"" ""fascism,"" or ""Bible-thumping."" Instead of listening to each other's ideas, we spot the warning label and run the other way. Second, our lifestyles favor knee-jerk reactions. The way we think, work and live in the Digital Age demands we quickly categorize information without investing time into rich interaction, research and understanding. We're hesitant to ask questions because we don't have time to listen to the long, complicated answers that might follow. And we lack the time to fact-check competing claims. In our haste, it's easier to echo our party's position than drill down, questioning whether party leaders are motivated by our best interests or the best interests of their biggest contributors. Third, we tend to listen only to like-minded opinions as media fragmentation encourages us to filter out varying perspectives. If you're a liberal, you avoid FOX News. If you're a conservative you revile MSNBC. The dynamic is even more pronounced online, where a niche media source can be found for any outlook. This silences the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and deliberation that might lead to reformulating positions, forging sustainable compromises, and developing consensus crucial to moving our nation forward on complex issues. So how can we overcome this challenge, starting with the health care debate? How do we open our minds to the possibility that we could actually learn from somebody else? Here's my prescription. For starters, we should eschew the notion that changing our minds is a character flaw. To the contrary, experts believe it's a manifestation of higher intelligence. Renowned psychologist Stuart Sutherland wrote in ""Irrationality,"" his seminal 1992 book: ""The willingness to change one's mind in the light of new evidence is a sign of rationality not weakness."" To further free our minds, we should aggressively treat the three Ls: . Let's lose the labels: from ""flip-flopper"" to ""commie,"" from ""fear-monger"" to ""right-wing nut job."" Trash the diatribe; mull the ideas. Let's engage in some constructive lifestyle management, slowing down to ponder -- and make independent decisions -- as enlightened people. We cannot allow the technological evolution to rob us of the intellectual strides of the American Revolution. We must value the art of listening, reflection, comparative analysis, and civil discourse if we're to make the most of our democracy. In the process, we should signal to leaders that we're willing to expand our horizons beyond party lines. Maybe they'll get in front of our parade, collaborating for a change. Let's request a second opinion and listen to each other. Switch channels. Visit different Web sites. Read a newspaper, while we can still find one. How about stepping into a town hall with an open mind, prepared to converse with people hailing from diverse circumstances? A range of perspectives enriches our viewpoint, empowering us to craft nuanced responses to complex situations. Ultimately, we must stop thinking that the only thing to think is what we've thought all along. As we learn more about multifaceted matters, our positions should evolve accordingly. Let's accept that it's OK to change your minds. In the end, opening our minds can only enhance the prognosis for our most cherished patient: America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rudy Ruiz.","Rudy Ruiz: It's become unfashionable to have an open mind about issues .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Congestion in Zimbabwe's prisons is set to ease a bit after President Robert Mugabe acceded to pleas by prison authorities to pardon more than 1,500 prisoners. Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has agreed to pardon 1,500 prisoners because of congestion. Mugabe granted the amnesty last month, but the Zimbabwe Prison Service is still identifying 1,544 prisoners to release. Zimbabwe's prisons are congested because the crime rate has escalated due to the country's economic collapse, prison officials have said. A senior justice ministry official told journalists Wednesday that Mugabe's clemency would benefit all convicted female prisoners and juveniles, but excludes criminals facing serious charges including rape or any sexual offenses, carjacking, conspiracy, armed robbery, murder and stock theft. ""As a short-term relief option to try and contain some of these challenges seriously and negatively impacting on the effective and efficient administration of prisons, a proposal to have a general amnesty was granted to inmates,"" said David Mangota, the Justice Ministry permanent secretary, of Mugabe's decision. The country's 42 prisons have a capacity for 13,000 inmates but are currently holding 17,000. As a result, the Prison Service has not been able to supply adequate rations to inmates. In April, a documentary showed half-naked, skeletal prisoners wasting away from hunger and diseases in some facilities. Prison officials said they are also strapped for cash, causing ""challenges"" in fulfilling basic needs for inmates, which include food, clothing and bedding, toiletries and transport, among others. One of the country's largest detention facilities, Khami Prison, has had its water cut off because the Prison Service hasn't paid its water bills, lawyers complained Wednesday. Sources said those bills now total more that U.S. $230,000. ""Offenders incarcerated should be treated humanely and with dignity in matters of health care, personal hygiene, sanitary, ablution requirements and general living conditions,"" said Josphat Tshuma, president of the Law Society of Zimbabwe. Khami Prison is located about 500 kilometers (310 miles) southwest of the Zimbabwean capital of Harare and holds more than 2,000 inmates. The water disconnection raises the possibility that diseases such as cholera could break out, the Law Society said. Last year, a number of prisoners died due to various diseases related to lack of water, hunger and inhuman and unhygienic conditions, the group charged.","Zimbabwe President agrees to pardon over 1,500 prisoners to ease congestion .

"(CNN) -- A Muslim teenager from Ohio says her father threatened to kill her because she converted to Christianity. Rifqa Bary claims her father wants her dead after she converted to Christianity. Rifqa Bary, 17, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the central Florida home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando. The teen heard of the pastor and his church through a prayer group on Facebook. The girl's parents reported her missing to Columbus police, who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records. The teenager, in a sworn affidavit, claims her father, Mohamed Bary, 47, was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to ""deal with the situation."" In the court filing, Rifqa Bary stated her father said, ""If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me!"" The teenager claims her father added, ""I will kill you!"" Mohamed Bary told CNN a lot of false information has been given and ""we wouldn't do her harm."" He knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations. ""I have no problem with her practicing any faith,"" he said, but Bary admitted he would have preferred his daughter to practice the Muslim faith first. Although Mohamed Bary said he did not expect his daughter to run away, Rifqa Bary was placed in foster care by an Orlando judge in August while the Florida Department of Children and Family investigated the threat allegations against the parents. In a court filing Monday, John Stemberger, Rifqa Bary's attorney and president of the Christian advocacy organization Florida Family Policy Council, accused the parents' Ohio mosque of having ties to terrorism and radical Islam. The Noor Islamic Cultural Center has denied the allegations. Stemberger told CNN he agreed with his client that she would be killed by radical Muslims if she is returned to Ohio. ""She is a person who is ripe for apostate killing or mercy killing. I'm not going to let my client slip away in the night by going back,"" said Stemberger. Roger Weeden, the mother's attorney in Florida, said the filing had no credible evidence but instead was meant ""just to inflame the community and the court."" Weeden said he believes the teen's attorney is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. The teen's attorney said his client has endured a history of abuse from her family. Stemberger said the young girl was forced to wear the Muslim headscarf called a hijab and was punched in the face by her father for being ashamed while wearing it. Stemberger is asking the court to keep Rifqa Bary in the custody of the state of Florida until she turns 18 in a year. Mohamed Bary, who is not a United States citizen, said he can't believe all the false allegations and the bad image caused by the situation. ""We are not bad people,"" Bary said. ""We are not like that, we are normal."" The mother's attorney said the teenager was a normal girl, a cheerleader in Ohio, and what Muslim extremist would allow his daughter be a cheerleader? At a court hearing scheduled for Thursday in Orlando, the parents will have an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them. Their attorney said the parents will deny all allegations. After the court hearing, the judge may force all the parties involved into mediation, followed by an adjudication hearing.","Teen convert says she ran away from Muslim father after he allegedly threatened her .

The ""People of Walmart"" blog features photos taken by users at the mega-chain. And, in less than a month, with no marketing to speak of, it's become the toast of the Internet. ""People of Wal-Mart,"" a gag started by two 20-something brothers and their buddy to share crazy pictures with their friends, has gone viral.

""I'm still baffled -- I really am,"" said Andrew Kipple, 23, one of the creators of the site, who said his team was frantically working Wednesday to add enough server space to handle the surge in traffic. Photos on the site, sent in by viewers all over the United States, frequently feature overweight people wearing tight clothes, bizarre hairstyles (with versions of the short-in-front, long-in-back ""mullet"" leading the pack) and fashion crimes ranging from furry leg warmers to miniskirts that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. There's a guy enjoying a can of beer outside a Wal-Mart, a guy dressed as Captain America and another guy with a goat. Yes, a live goat. Andrew and his brother Adam, 25, said they thought of the site after a visit to a South Carolina Wal-Mart where they saw a woman they believed to be a stripper, wearing an obscene T-shirt and leading a toddler in a harness. Around the next corner was a man with a beard reminiscent of the rock band ZZ Top. ""It's kind of like the light bulb went off,"" Andrew said. ""We get the e-mails already from people who are like, 'Why didn't I think of this?' We just happened to be fortunate enough to have the ability to actually follow through on it."" Their site was keeping up when it was getting about 500,000 views a day, but got swamped by a new spike in traffic late last week. The brothers, along with partner Luke Wherry, 23, say response has been largely positive -- with only a handful of complaints out of every 100 e-mails they get. A post on the group's Facebook page Thursday morning said they had gotten more than 1.2 million page views on Wednesday, even though the site was down for much of the day. The site was getting two or three photo submissions a day until last week they said -- when all of a sudden hundreds of e-mails, most with pictures, started rolling in. But not everyone appreciates the humor -- saying the site goes out of its way to mock poor and rural patrons of the store, reinforcing stereotypes along the way. ""American culture likes to single out people who appear to be different,"" said Tim Marema, vice president of the Whitesburg, Kentucky-based Center for Rural Strategies. ""Whether it's a joke or not, all depends on which side of the camera you're on."" Furthering stereotypes can strengthen the rifts between rural, urban and suburban residents and, in the worst-case scenario, can affect the way some people are treated by government and industry, he said. Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer with more than 4,200 U.S. stores and over $400 billion in annual sales, may be more prominent in rural areas, Marema said, but to use that to stereotype its shoppers doesn't make sense. ""The reality is that everybody shops at Wal-Mart,"" he said. ""If you want to find the guy in the golf shirt and khakis, he's there too."" A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. declined to comment for this story. The brothers say they don't mean for their site to be mean-spirited, and that they have standards for which photos they use. Andrew Kipple said they don't include pictures of people with physical disabilities or apparent mental disabilities and won't run a picture of a person simply because they are overweight. ""We're not going to go out and say we're not making fun of anybody or we're the nicest guys in the world. But I think you have to draw a line somewhere when you have a site like this,"" he said. ""If you have a mental handicap -- that's not funny. If you have lost a leg and you're on a crutch or in a wheelchair, some people may laugh at that, but we don't find it funny."" He denied complaints that the photos -- many of which attract a string of snarky comments from readers -- single out people because they are poor or unattractive. ""If you make a bad decision on what you're going to be out in public wearing, that's what we're looking for,"" he said. ""If you're 400 pounds, you shouldn't be wearing nothing but a pink tube top. Even if you shop at Goodwill, wherever you go, the shirts they sell have sleeves and they have your size."" Adam Kipple, who works as a Web designer for a marketing firm, said he and his brother are frequent Wal-Mart shoppers themselves and that, in a way, their site could be boon to the shopping chain. ""People [who send e-mails wanting to take pictures] say, 'I haven't been to Wal-Mart in years, but now I have a reason to go,' "" he said.","""People of Wal-Mart"" blog went viral last week .

"(CNN) -- The son of Gabon's former president was declared the winner of the country's presidential elections on Thursday, sparking violent protests in some parts of the West African nation. Two men walk by tyres set on fire by opposition supporters in Libreville, Gabon. Voters went to the polls Sunday to elect a successor to President Omar Bongo, who died in June after more than four decades in office. Bongo, 73, was Africa's longest-serving ruler. In a live announcement Thursday on Gabonese television, Interior Minister Jean Francois Ndongou said Ali Bongo received 41.73 percent of the votes in Sunday's election, with former interior minister Andre Mba Obame getting 25.88 percent and main opposition leader Pierre Mamboundou winning 25.22 percent. Opposition supporters protested the results outside the French consulate in the oil-rich city of Port-Gentil, on the country's coast. A fire broke out at the consulate during the demonstrations, a French official told CNN. The official did not want his name to be used. Some people were seriously injured in the blaze, the official said. In his first address to the nation shortly after the results were announced, Ali Bongo, 50, promised to work to improve living conditions for all Gabonese by a redistribution of the country's riches, according to Gabonese media reports. The country has multiple lucrative natural resources, including oil, timber, minerals and gems. Before the results were made public, all three candidates had previously claimed victory, with the opposition candidates denouncing what they said was fraud in the election and vote-counting. Security forces patrolled the streets in the Gabonese capital of Libreville, where violence broke out in some quarters when the results were released, according to French media reports. Libreville was deserted because residents had fled to villages for fear of post-election violence, Andriankoto Ratozamanana told CNN by phone from the capital. ""The citizens won't accept if Ali Bongo wins, because that will mean the government stole the vote,"" Ratozamanana said. ""They want change. They don't want Bongo, because he is his dad's son."" The younger Bongo, a former defense minister, was one of 23 politicians originally in the ballot. Several candidates pulled out a few days before the vote to support the opposition, said Archippe Yepmou, a media activist. The elder Bongo took power in 1967, seven years after the country's independence from France. He imposed one-party rule a year after succeeding the country's first president, who died in office. He allowed multiparty elections after a new constitution in 1991, but his party retained its grip on the government despite that. The nation of about 1.5 million has a per capita income four times that of most sub-Saharan African nations, according to the CIA World Factbook. Despite its wealth, which also comes from timber exports, a large percentage of its population lives in poverty because of poor financial management and a huge gap between the rich and the poor. CNN's Alanne Orjoux and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","Ali Bongo, son of Gabon's former president declared the winner of election .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Nancy Grace's new novel ""The Eleventh Victim.""  published by Hyperion. Nancy anchors ""Nancy Grace"" on HLN nightly at 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET. HLN's Nancy Grace makes her fiction debut with ""The Eleventh Victim."" A little something. What was it? Something...some detail was wrong.  . He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that. There was something missing. It was biting at him. He'd tried to go, walking back to his car in the dark twice now, but the nagging in his brain wouldn't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect. He looked at her lying there in the moonlight. Her dead body was absolutely stunning. Before, when she had been alive, sitting in the passenger seat of his car, talking and talking about her life and herself and her journey from Anniston, Alabama, to Atlanta to break into acting, he thought his head would blow up like a bomb. She just wouldn't shut up. What did she think it was...a date? She was a hooker. He spotted her climbing the steep steps out of the MARTA subway station downtown. She got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride. Once inside, driving, he kept looking away from the road, stealing glances at her neck. Something about it drew him. Maybe the shape, the curve -- or maybe it was the soft hollow spot at the bottom. It was the only thing about her he could stomach. Watch Nancy talk about her new novel » . He lowered the automatic windows so her conversation would fly out into the night and he wouldn't have to hear it. Her teeth and lips revolted him. The shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth. Looking over at her as she talked, Cruise thought it was the most disgusting thing he had ever seen. Back to the task at hand. What was it? It was maddening...he couldn't bring himself to leave until everything was just right...perfect, in fact. Every detail mattered. Like a delicate soufflé or performing his specialty, decorating with boiling-hot spun sugar, perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail. There, in the dark of the clearing, it hit him. Turning, he walked to his car and reached through the open window into the glove compartment and got it. The baker's twine. It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France. He had posed her on her back. The four bright-red puncture marks torn into her mid-back didn't bother him at all. In fact, the dark red against the white skin created a vivid contrast that was somehow pleasing to him. Walking back to her body, which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon, he paused again. He needed the perfect spot. He couldn't rush this or he wouldn't sleep all night. The wrist? Like a bracelet? No. She was wearing a tacky, gold-tone watch. That would ruin the whole thing for him. And he couldn't bring himself to actually touch the timepiece she wore there on her right wrist. It looked cheap; he was sure the gold-tone finish was turning dark at the edges of the band. The neck? No. It was much too close to the lip gloss. The gloss had a faint, fruity odor, foul as gasoline fumes to Cruise, and that alone made him want to retch. It would totally destroy the twine's effect. Sometime during their ""date,"" fresh, damp dirt and a little grass had smeared horizontally across her mouth and worked its way up into her nose. He left it there. That was a beautiful and poetic touch of nature, but the lip gloss...disgusting. As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night. And as he relived that moment, it came to him in an epiphany. He decided...the left ring finger. Perfect. He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand. The wrist was still limp. He tied a single, perfect bow around her ring finger just before rigor set in...before the body went stiff and cold and hard. He placed the hand back gently across her stomach. Backing away a few feet to take in the whole picture, finally, he could relax. Every detail was exquisite. Finally, he could get some sleep. The bow was perfectly symmetrical, and there, in the moonlight, it was just gorgeous. Almost like a wedding band. From THE ELEVENTH VICTIM by Nancy Grace. Copyright © 2009 Toto Holdings, LLC.

"(CNN) -- Somalis forced to flee war and drought are living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at home and in neighboring countries, including in Kenya and Ethiopia, an aid agency said Thursday. Somali refugees in Kenya queue to find out about a move to a displacement camp. Somalia has seen a rise in fighting between government forces and the Islamic militant group Al-Shabab, which wants to implement a stricter form of Sharia law or Islamic religious law. The clashes have left scores dead in recent months. The country in the Horn of Africa is also going through the worst drought in 10 years, international agency Oxfam said. ""Somalis flee one of the world's most brutal conflicts and a desperate drought, only to end up in unimaginable conditions in camps that are barely fit for humans,"" said Robbert Van den Berg, a spokesman for Oxfam International in the Horn of Africa. ""Hundreds of thousands of children are affected, and the world is abandoning the next generation of Somalis when they most need our help. Why does it seem like you matter less in this world if you are from Somalia?"" The international community has failed the refugees, who have little access to basic services such as water and medicine, Oxfam said. About 8,000 Somali refugees flock into the Dadaab camp in northern Kenya every month, the aid agency said. The camp, which has facilities for about 90,000, has 280,000 refugees who have no access to basic necessities, including clean water, Oxfam said. ""The Kenyan government has repeatedly promised to provide more land to ease the overcrowding, but has so far failed to do so,"" Van den Berg said. ""More pressure from the international community is needed to make it happen."" Kenyan officials decried the criticism. ""It is wrong to say we are not doing anything,"" said Francis Mwaka, a federal communications official. ""The Kenya government is aware of the problem and is working on a solution."" Several government departments that deal with refugee issues are planning to meet next week, Mwaka said. ""During this meeting, they will discuss the possibility of having another camp for refugees in the country or relocating some of the ones in Dadaab to another camp,"" he said. Mwaka confirmed Oxfam's report that the Dadaab camp was built to host 90,000 refugees. In Ethiopia, the Bokolmayo camp has about 10,000 people. At least 1,000 people arrive there every month, but the facilities are not adequate enough to handle the influx, Oxfam said. Meanwhile, in Somalia, insecurity has hindered international aid agencies from reaching the 485,000 people who have fled the capital, Mogadishu, to nearby Afgooye, Oxfam said. The displaced are getting help from Somalis, who do not have enough resources, it added. ""In all three locations -- Afgooye, Dadaab and Bokolmayo -- the services being provided to vulnerable and desperate people are far below international standards,"" Van den Berg said. About 1.4 million people have been displaced in Somalia and 500,000 more have fled to countries in the region, according to Oxfam. The transitional government has been mired in chaos since 1991 when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. Government officials have struggled to establish authority amid challenges by Islamist groups that have seized control of some cities.","Somali refugees living in unsanitary conditions at home and in neighboring countries .

"(Mental Floss) -- Students, we know you may not be all that ecstatic about seeing your teachers -- and the homework they assign -- as the school year starts up. Pay attention in class, though; you never know what hidden talents your teachers might have. Just look at all of these famous former teachers: . After teaching and performing music, Gene Simmons is now starring in his own reality show, ""Family Jewels."" Gene Simmons: The tongue-flicking bassist of Kiss taught sixth grade in Harlem before he became the world's most famous bass-playing demon. Simmons later revealed in interviews that his superiors canned him for replacing the works of Shakespeare with Spiderman comics, which he thought the students were more likely to actually read. Alexander Graham Bell: The telephone pioneer got his start teaching Visible Speech at the Boston School for Deaf Mutes. He developed a bond with a student named Mabel Hubbard, and when she was 19 the two married. Sting: Before he became a star with The Police, Sting taught English, music, and soccer at St. Catherine's Convent School. Sting later said of working at a convent school, ""I was the only man on the faculty. In fact, I was the only teacher not in a habit."" Mental Floss: How 10 celebrities picked their stage names . Robert Frost: Like King, Frost worked as a teacher to supplement the income from his fledgling literary career. Frost worked as both a farmer and teacher at the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire. His students called him ""the Hen Man"" because the poet was afraid of chickens, and Frost allegedly had trouble remembering to milk the school's cows on time. Lyndon Johnson: The future president got his start as a principal at the Mexican-American Welhausen School in Cotulla, Texas. He later finished his teaching degree and landed gigs teaching public speaking at Pearsall High School in Pearsall Texas and Sam Houston High in Houston. The debate team he coached at Sam Houston lost the Texas state championship by a single point; Johnson supposedly had to vomit backstage before he could bring himself to congratulate the winners. Art Garfunkel: We can't speak for Paul Simon, but at least half of Simon and Garfunkel was really, really good at math. Garfunkel nearly earned a doctorate in the subject and was teaching math at the Litchfield Preparatory School in Connecticut when ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" soared to the top of the charts. John Adams: The second president of the United States spent a few years working as a schoolteacher in Worcester, Massachusetts. Teaching didn't suit Adams, who thought his students were nothing more than a ""large number of little runtlings, just capable of lisping A, B, C, and troubling the master."" He eventually gave up the job to go to law school. Mr. T: It was hard for Chicago students to be fools when it came to gym class in the mid-1970s. You'd pay attention if Mr. T told you to do jumping jacks, wouldn't you? Sylvester Stallone: Did you know you were watching a matchup of tough-guy teachers when Stallone and Mr. T battled in ""Rocky III?""  When Sly was attending the American College in Switzerland during the 1960s, he worked as a gym teacher to earn extra spending money. Mental Floss: Sly Stallone pudding and other unique celebrity products . J.K. Rowling: The Harry Potter author worked as an English teacher in Portugal as she plotted out the early adventures of her young wizards. Andy Griffith: Before he was a sheriff, before he was Matlock, Andy Griffith was a teacher. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, Griffith taught English at Goldsboro High School. Billy Crystal: The comedian worked as a junior high substitute teacher on Long Island while he waited for his career to take off. Among the classes he subbed for: girls' gym, which must have been a great source of material. Kris Kristofferson: The country star was a Rhodes Scholar who studied literature at Oxford before joining the Army and rising to the rank of captain. Towards the end of his tour of duty, Kristofferson took a job as an English teacher at West Point, but he decided against the professorship at the last minute. Instead of heading to New York, he resigned his commission and moved to Nashville in 1965. Stephen King: Although he initially had to work in an industrial laundry after his college graduation, the horror master eventually found a teaching job that paid a cool $6400 a year at the Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. King wrote ""Salem's Lot"" while living in a trailer and working this job during the day. Mental Floss: Mojave Desert's airplane graveyard . Sir William Golding: The author's experiences as a teacher helped inform the novel that made his career. He once allowed a class of boys to debate with complete freedom, and the classroom quickly devolved into such disorder that it inspired Golding to write ""Lord of the Flies.""

"(CNN) -- Toyota must start again, ""from the bottom up,"" new president Akio Toyoda said Thursday. New Toyota boss Akio Toyoda says he will cut his salary by 30 percent. Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo, the grandson of Toyota Motors' founder said the company will focus on tailoring its product lines to customer demand in each region. Toward that end, Toyoda named an executive vice president to head each region. The company was not wrong to expand its business earlier this decade, Toyoda said, but he acknowledged that it might have overextended. Moving forward, the company's focus will be on products, rather than profits, he said. Taking responsibility for the company's $4.4 billion net loss in the most recent fiscal year, Toyoda said he would cut his salary by 30 percent. There are no current plans to close factories, a company executive said. Analysts say Toyoda must drastically cut costs, but he offered no hints as to how or even whether that would be done at his first news conference as president. The company board formally approved Toyoda, 53, for the job on Tuesday. He has been with Toyota for 24 years.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe has shown throughout her career that when it comes to voting, it's her principles and constituents that guide her, not her party. Sen. Olympia Snowe has received overwhelming support from her constituents in past elections. Those principles, analysts note, are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report, said Snowe's independent streak is ""not new behavior for her."" ""I think they [Republicans] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent-minded and they vote their state,"" she said, referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins. In fact, some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress. While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama's economic plans this year, the senator's constituents seem to agree with her. In 2006, she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote, compared to her Democratic opponent's 21 percent. In 2000, Snowe received 69 percent of the vote. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006, she said that while her views are moderate, Maine, like other New England states, has been ""naturally independent"" ""Oftentimes, I tell my leadership, don't blame me, it's just where I grew up,"" she said at the time. Snowe, 59, was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31, and served Maine's 2nd District for 16 years. She ran for Senate in 1994 and won, ""becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress,"" her Senate Web site notes. Her political career began in 1973 after her husband, Maine Rep. Peter Snowe, was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat. After two years in the state Senate, she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994, filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, who retired. She married then-Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989. In 2006, Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators, calling her ""the caretaker."" ""Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington,"" the article read. ""But while Snowe is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents."" Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time, ""They would probably both lose re-election."" Part of the so-called ""Gang of Six"" on the Senate Finance Committee, which includes three Democrats and three Republicans, she has been actively negotiating with the White House. The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six, have backed away from negotiations, although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk. Snowe said it's important to work with the other party despite criticism. ""I think sometimes, yes, I'd find myself in that position, you know, with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center,"" she told NPR last week. ""I mean, that's where the majority of Americans are. And I try to sort of build those ... bridges."" Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president's $787 billion economic stimulus package in February. For the past months, Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan, or ""trigger,"" for a public health care option as part of a key compromise. A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that's one of the things they're talking about.  Watch more on the health care debate » . The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies. ""This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable, competitive plans still do not exist,"" she said in a press release. Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals. ""What we have to do is develop a plan that's going to be available to people on an affordable basis, and, secondly, containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer,"" Snowe said in the NPR interview last week. Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate. ""Given the gravity of our economic circumstances, I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs, assist the displaced and invest in our economy,"" she said at the time about the stimulus plan. She added that it is not a ""matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief; it's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump-starting our economy."" CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Henry and Mark Preston contributed to this report.","Sen. Olympia Snowe is one of two GOP senators from Maine .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Seventy days after his sudden death, Michael Jackson will be interred in what may or may not be his final resting place Thursday evening. A private funeral for Michael Jackson will be held Thursday in Glendale, California, his family says. Only his family and closest friends will attend the private burial starting at 7 p.m. PT (10 p.m. ET) inside the ornate Great Mausoleum on the grounds of Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California. They'll then drive to an Italian restaurant eight miles away in Pasadena, California for ""a time of celebration,"" the nine-page engraved invitation said. The first page inside the invitation holds a quote from ""Dancing the Dream,"" a book of essays and poems published by Jackson in 1992: . ""If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.""  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service » . The news media -- which have closely covered every aspect of Jackson's death -- will be kept at a distance, with their cameras no closer than the cemetery's main gate. The family will provide a limited video feed that will only show mourners arriving. Little is known about the planned ceremony, though CNN has confirmed that singer Gladys Knight -- a longtime friend to Jackson -- will perform. Her song has not been disclosed. The massive mausoleum, which is normally open to tourists, was closed Wednesday as preparations were completed for the funeral. A security guard blocking its entrance said it would reopen to the public on Friday. Fans of Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities buried on the grounds have flocked to Forest Lawn-Glendale for decades, but Jackson may outdraw them all. It is unclear how close tourists will be allowed to Jackson's resting place. Security guards -- aided by cameras -- keep a constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture. The Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, ""has been called the ""New World's Westminster Abbey"" by Time Magazine. Visitors will see ""exact replicas of Michelangelo's greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta"" and ""Leonardo da Vinci's immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world's largest paintings,"" the Web site says. Jackson's burial has been delayed by division among Jackson family members, though it was matriarch Katherine Jackson who would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN. He preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California. That idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted. The mystery of where Michael Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death. After his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours following his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy. It was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena. Again, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. Though the family has not publicly confirmed where the body was taken, most reports placed it back at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision. Though Thursday's interment may settle one Michael Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death. Los Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.","NEW: Michael Jackson burial to begin at 7 p.m. PT (10 p.m. ET)

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When David Whitney traveled to Pakistan to shoot his film about a man forced to flee Afghanistan after falling foul of the Taliban he didn't expect fiction to turn into reality. A still from ""Kandahar Break."" Production of the film was halted after the crew were fired upon by suspected Taliban militia. But that's exactly what happened three weeks into shooting political thriller ""Kandahar Break"" in late 2008. Gunmen attacked the first-time director and his crew near the Afghan border. Four Pakistani crew members were shot and wounded in the incident and the entire crew was forced to flee the region. Pakistani authorities later told Whitney that the gunmen were affiliated with the Taliban and were in fact targeting the Western members of the team. ""I was very upset. It was terrifying to know that somebody was trying to attack us, trying to shoot us,"" Whitney told CNN. With the help of local security forces the team was immediately evacuated to Islamabad and put on a flight out of the country in 24 hours. Whitney had only managed to film three-quarters of the script and the film's future lay in the balance. ""When I heard that the crew members who had been shot were going to be fine I started to think like the businessman and the producer,"" says Whitney. ""I thought, 'How are we going to finish this film? We're not just going to give up.' And to a man everybody involved agreed to finish it."" After six months spent organizing financial backing, the original cast and crew flew to Tunisia to complete the movie and has been attracting interest from distributors. Despite the danger caused by shooting so close to the actual conflict zone, Whitney says he would shoot in the region again if he had the chance. ""Every place you point a camera there's a great shot. You don't have to go very far to find fantastic authentic Afghan architecture and beautiful landscapes. ""All the people are in the same sort of authentic costumes, so you don't have the problem of trying to find authenticity -- it's all around you."" Whitney hopes the authenticity will help ""Kandahar Break"" enjoy the same level of success as Kathryn Bigelow's ""The Hurt Locker"" -- the first film about the Iraq war to make a profit at the U.S. box office. Bigelow's thriller tells the story of an elite army EOD bomb squad who battle insurgents and each other, as they disarm a innumerable roadside bombs on the streets of Baghdad. Bigelow shot ""The Hurt Locker""  in Jordan, as close as she could get to the actual conflict zone. She also made use of  local actors. The film is based on screenwriter Mark Boal's first-hand experiences gathered whilst embedded with a bomb unit in Iraq. ""Because it was based on real life, we wanted to keep it as realistic as possible and keep it accurate,"" Bigelow told CNN. ""I mean this is a conflict that's still on-going so we felt responsible to the troops still there and the situation on the ground."" The cast faced grueling shooting conditions: Temperatures ranged between 115 and 120 degrees Fahrenheit (46 and 49 degrees Celsius). It was even hotter in the authentic bomb suit worn by Jeremy Brenner, who plays Staff Sergeant James. The suit weighed 60 pounds. ""You really can't explain the heat and the weight of the suit,"" Brenner told CNN. ""That certainly helped the realism of it all. There were a few moments I felt like ... I've been as close as I could've come to war without actually being in the military. ""The heat was real, the dust was real, the costumes and everything was so real that the tension [was already there],"" Anthony Mackie who plays Sergeant JT Sanborn told CNN. ""Kathryn would come to us before every scene and say, 'Remember at any moment you can die.' And we kept that in mind throughout all the scenes."" While ""The Hurt Locker,"" has made over $11 million in the U.S., previous movies dealing with conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have struggled to make money. Observers have attributed this to ""war fatigue"" suffered by audiences due to an abundance of war-stories in the media. Bigelow and Whitney are confident that cinema audiences have a thirst for knowledge about volatile regions like Iraq and Afghanistan that goes beyond what is reported on the news. ""I think the conflict [in Iraq] has been somewhat abstract for the general public, certainly speaking for myself,"" Bigelow told CNN. ""The film provides kind of a window, a lens onto what this particular conflict might be like, and gives it some specificity."" David Whitney hopes ""Kandahar Break"" can have a similar effect. ""Afghanistan is at the moment quite central to global security. I think it's good that people are looking at Afghanistan, questioning it, asking all sorts of questions. If my film can play any part in that, any small part, then I'm pleased.""","Four Pakistani crew members shot during filming of ""Kandahar Break""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's memorial service will take place Tuesday morning in the Staples Center, the 20,000-seat coliseum in downtown Los Angeles where Jackson rehearsed his show the night before he died, according to a person who has been briefed by a representative of the family. Michael Jackson was rehearsing at Los Angeles' Staples Center. His memorial will now be there. No other details about the service, set to begin at 10 a.m. Tuesday, have been revealed. Thursday, CNN learned the family trust created by Jackson to receive all of his assets includes his mother, his children and a list of charities, according to a person with direct knowledge to the contents of the trust. Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said. The children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- will also share 40 percent of the estate's assets and the remaining 20 percent will benefits charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said. Jackson's will did not specify where he wished to be buried. Many of his fans had hoped they'd get a chance to pay last respects at Neverland Ranch, which Jackson purchased in 1987, filled with animals and amusement rides, and named after the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan."" Planning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly. A public viewing at the ranch on Friday also had been under consideration, law enforcement sources said. Gregory Son, a 31-year-old musician, was among many fans who had planned to ride to the ranch to say goodbye to Jackson. ""I think he was a modern-day prophet,"" Son said outside Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood. ""We kind of lost our father."" DEA joins investigation . On Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson's death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon's passing. Two law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA probe, saying agents would look at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply. Neither official wanted to be identified because they could not comment publicly on the matter. Officially, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions to the Los Angeles, California, police department -- which would not confirm the involvement. ""We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act,"" said Sarah Pullen of the DEA. ""However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."" Speculation about the role of drugs has been swirling since Jackson died on June 25 at his rented estate in Holmby Hills. The cause of his death, at age 50, was pending toxicology results. On Wednesday, police released a car belonging to Jackson's cardiologist, Dr. Conrad Murray. They had impounded the vehicle Friday, saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications. Police did not say whether they found anything. Murray's lawyers issued a statement, asking the public to reserve judgment about the cause of death until the coroner's tests are complete. ""Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson,"" the statement said. ""We will not be responding to rumors and innuendo."" The comments were in reaction to a claim by a nutritionist who said Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for the powerful sedative, Propofol, despite knowing its harmful effects. ""I told him this medication is not safe,"" said Cherilyn Lee, a registered nurse. ""He said, 'I just want to get some sleep. You don't understand. I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep.' "" Will nominates Jackson's mother as kids' guardian . Meanwhile, details of Jackson's will -- written on July 7, 2002 -- showed that the singer estimated his estate to be worth at least $500 million. In it, he nominated his mother, Katherine Jackson, as the guardian of his three children. If his 79-year-old mother is not living, ""I nominate Diana Ross as guardian,"" Jackson stated. Singer Ross, 65, is a lifelong friend of Jackson's. The will said Jackson ""intentionally omitted"" his former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe. It will be up to a court to decide who gets custody of the children, ages 7, 11 and 12. Rowe has not publicly indicated whether she will challenge the Jacksons for custody. The two men whom the will named as executors immediately filed a request to take control of the estate. One is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death. He helped acquire Jackson's music catalog, which is worth millions. The other is music industry executive John McClain, a longtime Jackson friend who has worked with him and his sister Janet. The men said in their filing in Los Angeles Superior Court that control of the estate would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations. Judge Mitchell Beckloff held an emergency hearing Wednesday morning and decided there was no urgency to replace Katherine Jackson -- whom he appointed temporary administrator earlier this week. Another hearing has been set for Monday. -- CNN's Drew Griffin, Kathleen Johnston, Michael Carey, Paul Vercammen, Carol Cratty and Kara Finnstrom contributed to this report.","NEW: Michael Jackson trust includes mother, children, charities .

"(CNN)  -- The mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, is asking Mexican federal authorities not to pull military units out of the region for at least another six months. A Mexican soldier controls traffic at the Mexico-U.S. border customs post in Ciudad Juarez on August 16. A decision on whether to withdraw the troops is expected before September 15. The troops were sent to the city across from El Paso, Texas, in the spring of 2008 to help quell violence involving warring drug cartels. An additional surge of troops was sent this spring. That surge appeared to work at first, cutting the homicide rate in Juarez drastically. But murders in the city spiked over the summer. Figures provided by the city show that in August. more than 300 people were killed, the deadliest month so far this year. In July, 260 died and in June, 220. Those numbers were in stark contrast to 16 homicides in March, 42 in April and 60 in May. The mayor, Jose Reyes Ferriz, attributed the summer spike in violence to wars between cartels over the control of street drug-sale points. The cartels are hiring mostly youths to handle retail drug sales, he said, and that has resulted in most of the murder victims being between the ages of 14 and 25. The mayor said Juarez is not ready for the army's full withdrawal, even though he is aware the troops' presence was meant to be a temporary solution to give the city time to get rid of corrupt police officers, hire new ones and train its new force. ""We have accomplished the part that has to do with strengthening the police, but the city is in a very difficult situation. We are asking part of the army to stay and help us,"" Reyes Ferriz said. In September, 750 newly graduated police cadets are expected to join Ciudad Juarez Police Department, and another 400 in October, bringing the force to a total of about 3,000 officers. According to figures provided by the military, more than 6,000 soldiers are serving in Joint Operation Chihuahua in Juarez, of which 3,600 have been assigned to narco-traffic operations. The rest have been assigned to traffic duties and street patrols. The operation's spokesman, Enrique Torres, said the military is ""evaluating the security situation"" in the city and will be ""implementing a gradual withdrawal.""","Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz would like federal army troops to stay six more months .

"(CNN) -- Accusing local media in the Orlando, Florida, area of a ""barrage"" of coverage, Casey Anthony's lead defense attorney asked Monday to have her death-penalty case moved from Orlando to Miami, Florida. Casey Anthony is accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. ""The overwhelming majority of the media's coverage of this case has been negative for the defendant,"" says a defense motion filed in Orange County Circuit Court. Anthony, 23, is scheduled to go on trial on a first-degree murder charge in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. ""The effects of the inflammatory and negative aspect of the media coverage in this case is best witnessed in the violent and harassing protests which have dogged the defendant and her family for many months now,"" the motion says. Signed by Anthony's lead lawyer, Jose Baez, the motion says moving the trial far enough away from local media will ""not end the coverage,"" which Baez said has produced thousands of articles and TV news reports, but will ""have a chilling effect"" on coverage. Peter Odom, a defense attorney appearing Monday on HLN's Nancy Grace to provide analysis of the case, said, ""All the defense has to show is that there's been extensive media coverage. That's a cinch."" ""Secondly, that it will be impossible for them to find a fair jury pool,"" he added, referring to the Orlando area. Baez cited a number of reasons in his request to the judge to move the case to south Florida, where he says it has been covered far less and there is a ""large and diverse jury pool."" Local media in the Orlando area, he argued, have affected Anthony's chances of getting a fair trial not only in Orange County but in much of Central Florida. If the judge rejects his request to move the trial to Miami, Baez said Broward County, about a 45-minute drive north of Miami, is a second choice.","Attorney cites negative TV, media coverage in request for venue change .

"(CNN) -- Iran's parliament on Thursday approved the Cabinet nominations of a suspected terrorist and the first woman minister in the Islamic republic's 30-year history. Iran's first woman minister Marzieh-Vahid Dastjerdi. She will head the health ministry. Lawmakers approved the nomination of Ahmad Vahidi for its defense minister post. He is a former leader of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and one of six former and current Iranian officials sought by Interpol for the bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish center 15 years ago. Of those Cabinet choices approved by parliament, Vahidi won the highest number of votes. Argentina's Foreign Ministry has deplored the nomination of Vahidi, who is accused of working with Lebanon's Hezbollah militants in carrying out the 1994 attack. Marzieh-Vahid Dastjerdi was approved as the nation's health minister. She is the first female minister since the Islamic republic was founded. Iranian lawmakers gave their votes of confidence to 18 of the 21 nominees proposed by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- who entered a second term of office after a disputed presidential election. Two of those who failed to get the required majority votes enabling them to start work officially were female nominees: Sousan Keshavarz for the education ministry and Fatemeh Ajorlou for welfare and social security. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians took to the streets for more than two weeks to protest the June 12 election results, calling them fraudulent after Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. More than 1,000 people were arrested in a government crackdown, and Iran said at least 30 people were killed in post-election violence.","Islamic Republic appoints its first ever woman minister Marzieh-Vahid Dastjerdi .

"(CNN) -- A Turkish television show is offering contestants what it claims is the ""biggest prize ever"" -- the chance for atheists to convert to one of the world's major religions. The TV show offers converts to Islam the chance to visit Mecca. The show, called ""Tovbekarlar Yarisiyor,"" or ""Penitents Compete,"" features a Muslim imam, a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Buddhist monk attempting to persuade 10 atheists of the merits of their religion, according to CNN Turk. If they succeed, the contestants are rewarded with a pilgrimage to one of their chosen faith's most sacred sites -- Mecca for Muslims, Jerusalem for converts to Judaism, a trip to Tibet for Buddhists and the chance to visit Ephesus and the Vatican for Christians. Ahmet Ozdemir, deputy director of Turkish channel Kanal T, which will air the show from September, said the program aimed to ""turn disbelievers on to God."" ""People are free to believe anything they want. Our program does not have a say,"" he said, according to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. Contestants will be judged by a panel of eight theologians and religious experts prior to going on the show to make sure their lack of faith is genuine. But the show has been condemned by Turkish religious leaders. The head of the country's supreme council of religious affairs, Hamza Aktan, told CNN Turk that it was ""disrespectful"" to place different faiths in competition with each other and accused Kanal T of using religion to boost ratings. ""To do such a thing for the sake of ratings, not only with Islam but with all religions is disrespectful,"" said Aktan. ""Religion should not be the subject of this type of program."" Although Turkey has a predominantly Muslim population and culture, religion is a sensitive subject because of the country's staunchly secular constitution which outlaws most displays of faith in public life. Last year the Islamist-influenced government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan clashed with the country's constitutional court when judges overturned the efforts of Erdogan's AK Party to lift a ban on female students wearing headscarves at public universities. Aylin Yazan at CNN Turk contributed to this story.","Turkish TV show features imam, Catholic priest, Jewish rabbi, Buddhist monk .

"(CNN)  -- One FAA safety inspector was killed and another injured Tuesday when a helicopter they were on crashed into an apparently unoccupied house in Jackson, Mississippi, authorities said. The Robinson R44 helicopter that crashed is similar to the one pictured here. The Robinson R44 helicopter crashed into the duplex-style house about half a mile east of Hawkins Field airport, according to Kathleen Bergen of the Federal Aviation Administration. The two people on the aircraft were from the agency's Flight Standards District Office in Jackson, Bergen said. Names of the two were not released. Both victims were taken to the Mississippi Medical Center where one of them died shortly after arriving, according to medical center spokesman Jack Masurak. Lee Vance, Jackson assistant police chief, said the rear roof of the house sustained most of the damage from the crash, and no one answered the door when emergency personnel arrived, leading him to believe the house was unoccupied at the time. The helicopter, which was registered to a local company and operated out of the airport, was demolished in the crash, authorities said.

"(CNN)  -- The attorney for a man whose wife's wrong-way accident killed eight people on New York's Taconic Parkway in July says he will ask authorities to exhume her body to prove she wasn't drinking at the time of the accident. On CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Tuesday night, Daniel Schuler said his wife, Diane, was not an alcoholic. Dominic Barbera, attorney for Daniel Schuler, told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" he believes Diane Schuler may have suffered stroke-like symptoms and that a fire after the accident could have turned blood sugar into alcohol. ""I read from the medical autopsy report that there was charring of the body because there was a fire,"" Barbera said. ""And I found -- my doctors found numerous cases where you can actually have sugar in the blood turn into alcohol."" Barbera said Schuler may have had a Transient Ischemic Attack, which produces stroke-like symptoms but no lasting damage.  Watch why husband believes wife wasn't drunk » . The Westchester County medical examiner's office found that Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol level of .19 percent -- more than twice the legal limit -- and had marijuana in her system when she drove a minivan the wrong way on the parkway and ran head-on into an SUV. Three adults in the SUV were killed in the July 26 crash, as were Schuler and four children she was carrying in the minivan -- her daughter and three nieces. A fifth child, Schuler's son, survived. A spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, Donna Green, said that the office stands ""by the findings of the medical examiner's report."" But Daniel Schuler said he believed the report was wrong. ""I know the truth, what happened, with my wife,"" he said. ""She is not an alcoholic and doesn't drink. She is an outstanding mother."" Barbera and Schuler said they wanted to have the body exhumed for further examinations to prove that the accident was not caused by a drunken driver. Attorneys for the family of Daniel Luongo, 73, one of the victims in the SUV, rejected the Schuler family's contention. ""The scientific evidence indicates that Diane Schuler was intoxicated and under the influence of marijuana at the time of the crash,"" they said in a statement. ""Any claims denying her responsibility for this tragedy are wholly unsubstantiated, and the Luongo family finds these claims appalling, offensive and hurtful.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A judge Wednesday approved Katherine Jackson's request that Michael Jackson's estate get the bill for the cost of this week's burial of her son. A private funeral for Michael Jackson, here in 2002, will be held Thursday in Glendale, California, his family says. More than two months after his death, the pop singer will be interred in a private ceremony Thursday evening at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California, the Jackson family said. A short hearing was held Wednesday morning before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff to consider Katherine Jackson's petition. The special administrators of his estate -- in control of the purse strings until the will is probated -- did not object to the Jackson family's request. The cost of the burial is a secret -- kept under court seal by Beckloff's order -- but it is believed to include paying Glendale police to handle traffic and security around the cemetery. The ceremony, which will be closed to the public and news media, is set for 7 p.m. at the cemetery's Holly Terrace in the Great Mausoleum, a family spokesman said. On July 7, Jackson's family and friends gathered at Forest Lawn's Hollywood Hills cemetery for a short service just before a public tribute to the singer in downtown Los Angeles. There has been widespread speculation about the whereabouts of Jackson's body. It has remained a closely guarded secret. The pop star's siblings and parents have been divided over where to bury him, several family members have said. Older brother Jermaine Jackson has said he wanted the singer to be buried at his former Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, while others have objected. The burial comes less than a week after the Los Angeles County coroner made public his conclusion that Jackson's June 25 death was a homicide. The coroner ruled that the anesthetic drug propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the death. Los Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation into the singer's death. No one has been charged.","Michael Jackson will be interred in private cermony Thursday night, family says .

"(AOL Autos) -- Since there have been cars, people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them. AOL Autos put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars. Drivers of the dependable Camry know what's important in life, says expert. Our panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit. Rest assured, these experts did not pull any punches. Toyota Prius: Green no matter its color . Brinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius . ""Buying a Prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel,"" said Brinley. ""Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations."" Bell adds, ""New Prius buyers want to be part of the 'green' club."" ""Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements,"" said Brinley. Markwalder opines: ""There's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic, a Prius driver will be at the front of the line, self-righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world."" We're just quoting here, folks. Chevrolet Corvette: Performer for the mid-life crisis . The Chevy Corvette ""seems to be more often a reward car. Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data. Only 11 percent of Corvette owners are in Gen Y or Gen X."" Bell adds: ""Sadly, the usual stereotype of the Corvette buyer as a 57-year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven."" Better car than its image suggests . Bell sees another side to the Corvette. ""It is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet,"" said Bell. ""It's an affordable giant-killer."" Markwalder adds, ""There have been 1.5 million Corvettes produced since 1953, and while plenty of old guys drive them, they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30+ mpg highway fuel economy."" Toyota Camry: A major transportation appliance . ""I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry,"" said Bell. ""It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common. But to many drivers, these words are exactly all they are looking for, making the Camry their own personal rock star. A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car."" Dodge Challenger: The transcendent pony car . The Dodge Challenger looks more like its original than the 2010 Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro. According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y. Auto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. ""All ages stop and stare at this car,"" said Bell. ""Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd."" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging. Ford F-150: Working man's truck . According to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man. Markwalder confirms with this: ""Basic Ford trucks, like the XLT, make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living."" Bell adds, ""We'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine."" Mercedes-Benz R-Class: A marketing mystery . ""With 2008 sales of only 7700 vehicles, we don't have enough information about buyers to provide a strong picture of why somebody drives an R-Class,"" said Brinley. ""The more expensive GL-Class and ML-Class SUVs each sold three times as many."" Markwalder states, ""The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality."" Bell quips, ""My experience tells me that its few buyers are attracted to its three-pointed star (badge appeal) or the large discounts because the R-Class hasn't sold well."" The R-class, a ""tweener"" that is somewhat minivan, somewhat wagon and somewhat crossover, has few rivals. Only the Ford Flex and the new Toyota Venza seem to come close. Experts' first thoughts . Bell on Chrysler Sebring Convertible: ""I hope it's a rental."" Brinley adds, ""It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y."" Bell on the Honda Insight: ""They're members of the Prius Alternative Club for Honda lovers."" Markwalder on Smart ForTwo: ""Experimenters with a sense of humor who would rather sprint away from a light than hold up traffic.""","The model of car you drive may be telling people all about you .
Prius drivers: College educated, want to be part of the ""green club""
Corvette: An ""affordable giant-killer"" for men in midlife crisis .

"(CNN) -- Comedy is hard; dying is easy. Any stand-up will tell you that. Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen play comedians in ""Funny People."" Let's have a hand, then, for Judd Apatow. Hollywood's most successful contemporary comedy producer isn't resting on his laurels but continues to push toward risky subject matter: male sexual insecurity in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" unwanted pregnancy in ""Knocked Up"" -- and now the big C. No, not cancer -- though Adam Sandler's superstar comedian George Simmons is stricken with an appropriately eccentric form of leukemia. No, this latest film's true subject is Celebrity and the funny things it does to people. Apatow's most personal (and also most self-indulgent) film, ""Funny People,"" shuffles between three competitive Angelino roommates scrambling to grasp a rung on the showbiz ladder (Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Jason Schwartzman), Simmons' multimillion-dollar Malibu mansion and the L.A. comedy clubs that sometimes bridge the gap between anonymity and fame. Apatow and Sandler know these worlds well enough. The movie begins, in fact, with old home video footage of young Adam goofing off, making prank phone calls while his roommate Judd sniggers behind the camera. It's one of the few times we see Sandler really having fun and cutting loose. This is mostly a restrained, subdued and admirably unsentimental performance. It feels natural that Simmons -- faced with his dire prognosis -- should return to the comedy circuit to wrestle with his imminent extinction before a roomful of strangers, even as he decides to keep his condition a secret from everyone around him. It's actually not so hard in his case because he doesn't have any real friends, only ""showbiz friends."" The exception is Ira Wright (Rogen), a struggling young comic who lucks into a job as his hero's joke writer slash personal assistant. Simmons is by turns demanding, generous, friendly and abusive, and Ira couldn't be happier. The cross-currents are intriguing: He's getting his first taste of the high life, just as George is trying to savor his last days by reliving his first steps on the circuit. True to form, Apatow negotiates the perilous terrain of existential doubt with his fall-back weapon of choice, the penis joke. Some of these are choice (Ira's real last name is ""Wiener,"" pronounced ""Whiner""), but many, many more feel flabby and redundant. There's even an Andy Dick joke, in the form of Andy Dick himself -- one of several celebrity cameos, the oddest of which is surely Eminem, wondering aloud if George wouldn't be better off dead. We must be approaching the 80-minute mark by then, about the time many comedies start wrapping things up. But it's a question that doesn't seem to have occurred to Simmons or the filmmakers before, and it spurs Apatow on to develop another hour of additional material in which George, miraculously recovered, pursues the love of his life (Leslie Mann), Ira in tow, without much consideration for her two daughters or her husband (Eric Bana). It's as if the movie bred its own sequel. There's plenty of funny stuff here. Bana has a ball as the obtuse Aussie, but despite all the blue jokes, this is a more modulated, pensive effort than Apatow's previous hits. He's improved, a little, as a director (perhaps the credit belongs to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who ensures that for once it doesn't all look like a sitcom), but Apatow is still in dire need of a good editor. His instincts are generous. He wants to give us the six-course meal, and to go around the table, give everybody the chance to tell us a funny story. As a result ""Funny People"" is consistently entertaining but also rather grueling -- as if we're watching two or three different movies at the same time. At least one of these -- the tribulations of the young roomies -- we've seen before, and amusing as these guys are, they properly belong in the deleted scenes category. But Apatow isn't one to kill his babies, that's for sure. He's more likely to write them an additional scene or three. (Mann is Mrs. Apatow, and their two daughters also figure large.) Still, if you're not averse to too much of a good-ish thing, and can stomach another of those terminal Hollywood illnesses that leaves the patient with no discernible ill-effects, ""Funny People"" is a fairly shrewd and nonjudgmental dissection of how celebrity skews and contaminates even the most intimate relationships. The rich and famous aren't the only narcissists in this game, it seems. We're all a bit funny that way. ""Funny People"" is rated R and runs 146 minutes.

"BRUNSWICK, Georgia (CNN) -- Seven of eight people killed last week in a southeast Georgia mobile home were laid to rest Saturday. The caskets were laid side by side for graveside ceremonies Saturday in Eulonia, Georgia. The funerals at Youngs Island Church in Eulonia, Georgia, were held for Chrissy Toler, 22; Russell D. Toler Sr., 44; Michelle Toler, 15; Michael Toler, 19; Russell D. Toler Jr., 20; Guy Heinze Sr., 45; and Brenda Gail Falagan, 49. The funeral for the eighth victim, Joseph L. West, 30, is to be held at mid-month. Police have arrested Guy Heinze Jr., the son of Guy Heinze Sr., on eight counts of first-degree murder. Seven caskets for the seven victims stood side by side for the burial under sunny skies at a nearby cemetery. More than 200 mourners attended the funeral, including William Heinze, father of one of the victims and grandfather of the man accused of the killings. ""I've never seen so much love and support at a funeral,"" William Heinze told CNN affiliate WJXT. William Heinze also said he doubted that his grandson, Guy Heinze Jr., was responsible for the killings. ""We want to know what really happened,"" he said. ""The police may think they know what happened, but we want to really know the truth."" Investigators obtained an arrest warrant Friday evening for Guy Heinze Jr., 22, just hours after he had been freed from jail on charges of tampering with evidence and making false statements to a police officer, Police Chief Matt Doering of Glynn County, Georgia said Friday. ""I can assure you that this person is responsible,"" Doering said at a news conference Friday evening. The bodies were discovered a week ago at New Hope Plantation mobile home park, north of the Atlantic coastal city of Brunswick. Seven died in the mobile home, and the eighth died a day later at a hospital. The chief refused to reveal how the victims were killed or the suspected motive. A 3-year-old who was injured was on life support at a Savannah hospital, her grandmother said. A man identified as Guy Heinze Jr. reported the slayings. He told an emergency dispatcher when he called last Saturday, ""I was out last night. I got home just now, and everybody's dead. ... My whole family's dead. It looks like they've been beaten to death.""  Watch report on funerals and arrest from CNN's Sean Callebs » . According to the first arrest warrant, Heinz provided ""investigators with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading up to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members."" The arrest warrant also said he removed a shotgun from the residence and hid it in the trunk of his car. The killings have made people in the southeastern Georgia city of more than 16,000 uneasy, a waitress at a restaurant said. ""There's still a lot of concern that that many deaths at one time can not have been done by one person,"" Lucinda Bennett, a waitress at the 4th of May Cafe, said. ""There is still a little bit of nervousness in the area over whether they have got everyone that was involved with it."" Linda Davis, who works at a barbershop in the city, said everyone is puzzled over the slayings. ""You don't go in and kill eight people and nobody hears screams or shots or anything like that with trailers that close together,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The ocean water around Chatham, Massachusetts, is playing host to some unwelcome guests this holiday weekend: sharks. Only 41 unprovoked shark attacks have been reported in the U.S. since 2008. At least one large shark sighting was confirmed Friday by Greg Skomal, shark expert for the state's Division of Marine Fisheries. That sighting occurred off the eastern shore of Monomoy Island, a National Wildlife Refuge off the southern elbow of Cape Cod, according to Lisa Capone, Massachusetts Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs press secretary. The species, though not confirmed, was ""most likely"" a great white shark, she said. The sighting came a day after Skomal reported as many as five large sharks were seen near the island, about a mile or more away from Chatham's Lighthouse Beach, a public swimming area. Capone said Skomal was searching the area of the island Friday afternoon, though weather conditions were ""not ideal,"" with fog and wind. Meanwhile, officials were advising residents and visitors to be cautious while visiting the beaches this weekend. ""It is the eve of the last holiday weekend of summer, and we want to make sure folks on the Cape are aware,"" Capone said. Chatham's Harbor Master's office issued a public notice after the sightings Thursday, saying the waters surrounding Chatham are ""now a year-round home to a few thousand seals."" Seals are a main source of food for large sharks, and as recently as August 28, a large shark was seen feeding on the body of a seal near Chatham's waters, the notice said. It advised people to avoid swimming near seals. A statement issued Friday by Chatham town officials said ""beaches will be closed immediately"" if a shark is sighted. Paul Zuest, general manager of the Chatham Bars Inn, said he and his staff also have been instructing their guests to be cautious. The hotel, about two miles away from where the sharks were spotted, has posted signs providing information on the sightings. George H. Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research and curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History's International Shark Attack File, said that on average, sharks have killed four people annually worldwide for the past several years. ""The chances of us as individuals entering the sea and not coming back as a result of a shark attack are slim to none when you consider the millions upon millions of people that go into the sea each year,"" he said. The museum's shark attack file lists 41 unprovoked shark attacks in U.S. waters in 2008, with one fatality, in California. Most of the attacks, 32, occurred in Florida. Massachussetts has recorded only four shark attacks since 1670, two of which have been fatal. The last fatal shark attack in Massachussetts occurred in 1936.","Shark expert confirms at least one large shark sighting Friday .

"LAWRENCE, Kansas (CNN) -- It started with a sore throat. Then her chest was burning. Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas. University of Kansas freshman Arielle Spiridigliozzi said she thought her symptoms were signs of allergies, or maybe even a sinus infection. It couldn't be H1N1, she thought. But it was. ""I mean, I'd never, ever guessed that coming into freshman year I would get the friggin' swine flu,"" Spiridigliozzi said. Now she accessorizes her royal blue T-shirt with a mask. A stuffy nose, body aches, fever and coughing make up the litany of symptoms, Spiridigliozzi, 18, and her roommate, Kaitlyn Perry, 18, said they have suffered. For more than a day, the girls have been stuck in their suite, on what they call ""lockdown.""  Watch more about life on ""lockdown"" » . University officials have asked the girls to stay in their dorm suite to limit exposure to other students. The school provides door-to-door delivery from the campus dining hall, giving the girls one less reason to have to leave their immediate four walls. Spiridigliozzi has abided by the the university's request, worried that she could infect another. But she doesn't understand how she ended up in this situation in the first place. ""We took all the necessary precautions. Like, we really did. It wasn't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything,"" she said. ""I was hand sanitizing. I was being very careful. I don't know how this happened."" But she only has to look to her roommates for an answer, as illness has rapidly made its way through her suite. When Perry became ill it struck her suddenly. While shopping, she came down with a fever and started feeling like she didn't have the strength to stand, she said. Perry's flu hasn't been confirmed as an H1N1 strain, but a third roommate, the first to get sick, they said, was diagnosed with H1N1. Then a fourth roommate got sick, illustrative of a spreading flu pattern the girls said is obvious from the empty seats in classes. The university estimates about 340 students, or 1 percent of the student body, have flu they suspect is H1N1, said Patricia Denning, medical chief of staff at Watkins Health Center. The number of cases could be higher if students were not seeking care from campus doctors and nurses, she added. She said she has not heard of any students being hospitalized because of the flu. Vaccines are unlikely to help much this year, because supplies are not expected until late October and require about five weeks from the first inoculation -- two are required -- before they become effective. So, to make life easier for the sick, the school's medical center has distributed what it calls a ""flu kit,"" which includes a mask and a home-care instruction sheet, Denning said. The tip sheet borrows from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's information on H1N1. It says to drink lots of fluids, eat three small meals a day and get plenty of rest, Denning said. ""And so it just goes through simple common-sense things that we all know we need to do that sometimes, when mothers and dads aren't around to remind them, this will help remind them,"" she said. Spiridigliozzi and Perry will get to wander outdoors again once their fevers have dissipated for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications, they said. They are eager to get back to their normal lives. Spiridigliozzi is tired of the soup and Jell-O, and Perry looks forward to playing Frisbee again. ""So boring"" is how Spiridigliozzi described their isolation. With all this free time, at least the freshmen -- on campus for only two weeks -- aren't falling too far behind in their school work. ""I got all my homework done,"" Perry said. ""Yeah, I've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks, probably,"" added Spiridigliozzi. CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.","Spread of H1N1 among roommates illustrates how quickly virus jumps around .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Expanded testing across India in the past three years shows a 2,000 percent jump in the number of HIV cases among children, the country's health minister announced Wednesday. An HIV-positive Indian child at a government treatment center. More than 14,000 children get free care. In November 2006, health authorities counted 2,253 children in India with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, Ghulam Nabi Azad told parliament. The number went up to a ""cumulative total"" of 52,973 in May this year, he said. The huge increase in the number of confirmed cases may be due to the expanded testing for the virus. India, home to more than a billion people, currently has 217 facilities for HIV/AIDS treatment and 5,155 counseling and testing centers. The minister insisted that overall, HIV prevalence had decreased in India from 0.45 percent in 2002 to 0.34 percent in 2007. At present, 758,698 HIV-positive patients are being treated under the country's AIDS control program, Azad said. More than 232,908 AIDS patients, including 14,474 children, are receiving free treatment at the designated facilities, he added. Authorities say mother-to-child transmission is a major source of infection among children. Last year, 19,986 pregnant women among more than 4 million tested were found to be HIV-positive, said Azad. Of them, 10,179 received treatment to prevent transmission to their babies.","Expanded testing across India shows 2,000 percent jump in child HIV cases .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq awarded a lucrative oil contract to BP and China National Petroleum Corp., government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said Wednesday, while rejecting other companies' offers for other oil fields. BP and China National Petroleum Corporation have won a lucrative oil contract in Iraq. The joint BP-CNPC bid was for the al-Rumeila oil field, one of the largest in the world. The energy companies are expected to increase production at the oil field by 50 percent, to 285,000 barrels a day, for a service charge of $2 for each additional barrel produced, al-Dabbagh said in a statement. The Iraqi government rejected bids for five other oil fields and a natural gas field because the bidders did not agree to the service charge set by the Ministry of Oil, he said. The Ministry of Oil rejected the idea that the failure to award more than one contract made the much-anticipated auction a flop. Iraq did not say how much the BP-CNPC bid was worth. It runs for 20 years. Oil Minister Hussein Shahrastani chaired the government-sponsored auction for the oil and natural gas field contracts Tuesday, after a day's delay due to a sandstorm. Much of the auction was broadcast live on state television, which Ministry of Oil spokesman Assem Jihad told CNN was a sign of the transparency of the process. He said the government was satisfied with the auction, even though only one contract was awarded, because the contract was for Iraq's largest oil field. Iraq plans to open bidding this year on 10 more oil fields and one natural gas field, all of which are undeveloped, Jihad said. The companies whose bids were rejected Tuesday have been given time to review their offers, he said. Iraq has some of the largest oil reserves in the world, with an estimated 115 billion barrels -- tying Iran for second place, behind Saudi Arabia's 264 billion barrels, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration in the United States. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report.","Iraq awards lucrative oil contract to BP, China National Petroleum Corporation .

"(CNN) -- Mr. Ravenblade, Mr. Xtreme, Dark Guardian and hundreds of others. Some with elaborate costumes, others with haphazardly stitched outfits, they are appearing on city streets worldwide watching over the populace like Superman watched over Metropolis and Batman over Gotham City. Geist patrols the Rochester, Minnesota, area, with a group of like-minded and similarly dressed colleagues. As people become disillusioned from financial woes and a downtrodden economy and look to put new purpose in their lives, everyday folks are taking on new personas to perform community service, help the homeless and even fight crime. ""The movement is growing,"" said Ben Goldman, a real-life superhero historian. Goldman, along with Chaim ""Life"" Lazaros and David ""Civitron"" Civitarese, runs the New York-based Web site Superheroes Anonymous as part of an initiative dedicated to organizing and making alliances with superhero groups. According to Goldman, who goes by the moniker Cameraman because of his prowess in documenting the movement, economic troubles are spawning real life superheroes. ""A lot of them have gone through a sort of existential crisis and have had to discover who they are,"" Goldman said. People are starting to put value in what they can do rather than what they have, he said. ""They realize that money is fleeting, it's in fact imaginary."" Estimates from the few groups that keep tabs put the worldwide total of real-life superheroes between 250 and 300. Goldman said the numbers were around 200 just last summer. Mr. Ravenblade, laid off after a stint with a huge computer technology corporation, found inspiration for his new avocation a few years ago from an early morning incident in Walla Walla, Washington. ""I literally stepped into a woman's attempted rape/mugging,"" Mr. Ravenblade said. While details were lost in the fog of the fight, he remembers this much: ""I did what I could,"" he said, adding that he stopped the crime and broke no laws. ""And I realized after doing what I did, that people don't really look after people."" Public response to real-life superheroes has been mixed, according to Mr. Xtreme, who founded the Xtreme Justice League in San Diego, California. ""Sometimes it's been really positive with people saying, 'Woohoo, the superheroes are here,' and then the usual barrage, saying 'Oh, these guys are losers.' Other times people will look kind of freaked out, and then sometimes people just don't know what to think about us."" Like Peter Parker kept his Spider-Man identity from his editor boss, Mr. Extreme and Mr. Ravenblade have asked CNN editors to keep their identities secret. The current superhero movement started a few years ago on MySpace, as people interested in comics and cool caped crusaders joined forces, Goldman said. It goes beyond the Guardian Angel citizen patrols of the early 1980s, as the real-life superheroes of today apply themselves to a broadly defined ethos of simply doing good works.  Watch Crimson Fist help the homeless in Atlanta » . Chris Pollak, 24, of Brooklyn, New York, can attest to the appeal. ""A lot more people are either following it or wanting to go out and do it,"" Pollack, who goes by the name Dark Guardian, said. By ""do it,"" he means patrol the harrowing streets late at night. ""A lot of kids say they're real-life superheroes [on MySpace],"" Mr. Ravenblade said. ""But what are you doing? Being in front of a computer is not helping anybody."" Comic book legend Stan Lee, the brain behind heroes such as Spider-Man and the X-Men, said in his comic books doing good -- and availing one's self -- was indeed the calling card for superheroes. ""If somebody is committing a crime, if somebody is hurting some innocent person, that's when the superhero has to take over.""  See a photo gallery of some real-life superheroes » . ""I think it's a good thing that people are eager enough to want to help their community. They think to do it is to emulate the superheroes,"" Lee said. ""Now if they had said they had super powers [that would be another thing]."" Without super powers, real life superheroes confess to a mere-mortal workload, including helping the homeless, handing out fliers in high-crime areas and patrolling areas known for drug-dealing. Mr. Ravenblade said he and some of his superfriends would soon be trying to organize a Walk for Babies fundraiser in Portland, Oregon. ""We work with charities that help children,"" he said. ""We think a lot of crimes happen because of people who didn't get a lot of love when they were younger. We do what we can to help that there."" ""Homeless outreach is the main thing I like to do,"" said Chaim ""Life"" Lazaros, of Superheroes Anonymous. ""We give out food, water, vitamins, toothbrushes. A lot of homeless people in my area know me, and they tell us about what they need. One homeless guy said 'I need a couple pair of clean underwear.'"" For Christmas, Lazaros said his group raised $700 in gifts and brought them to kids at St. Mary's Children's Hospital in New York. ""They were so excited to see real-life superheroes,"" Lazaros said. iReport.com: Searching for Cincinnati's caped crusader . Many of the real-life superheroes even initiate citizen's arrests, but what's legal varies by state. And in North Carolina citizen's arrests are illegal. Real-life superheroes who grab a suspected villain may find themselves under a specter of trouble. ""Not a good idea,"" said Katy Parker, legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina. ""Seeing as how there's no citizen's arrest statute [in the state], people who do this are running a serious risk of getting arrested for kidnapping, and being liable for false imprisonment."" ""Vigilantism is never a good thing,"" said Bernard Gonzales, public information officer for the Chula Vista, California, Police Department. He's had some interactions with real-life superheroes. ""The very best thing a private citizen can do is be a good witness."" Mr. Ravenblade said he's just that. ""If you're a real-life superhero you follow the law. If you catch somebody you can't just tie them up and leave them for the cops, that's for the comics. You have to wait for the cops and give them a statement,"" Mr. Ravenblade said. iReport.com: Cincinnati superhero speaks . While citizens helping out in the community is encouraged, Gonzales said the costumes can go. ""Where these people are out in public, and there's children around and everything, and these people are not revealing their identities, it's not a safe thing."" But the costumes go with the gig, right down to the do-it-yourself approach to good deeds, including, apparently, recycling. ""The costume I have is simple,"" said Mr. Xtreme. ""I made it myself. I had a graphic designer design it for me and just took it down to the swap meet and had somebody imprint it on for me.""

"(CNN) -- A young Iranian woman named Neda is gunned down in one of the most iconic images of the last week. Another walks down the street, defiantly showing off her hair and body in a revealing dress. And still another woman says she's not scared of paramilitary forces -- no matter how many times she gets beaten. Women have taken to the streets of Tehran. ""This shows the new face of Iran,"" one expert says. ""When they want to hit me, I say hit. I have been hit so many times and this time it doesn't matter. I just want to help my brothers and sisters,"" says the 19-year-old woman whose identity is being withheld by CNN for her safety. Amid the clashes and chaos, there has been a recurring scene on the streets of Tehran: Women, in their scarves and traditional clothing, at the heart of the struggle. Some are seen collecting rocks for ammunition against security forces, while video showed one woman trying to protect a fallen pro-government militiaman wounded in the government crackdown. At Shiraz University, riot police clubbed women dressed in black robes. ""Don't beat them, you bastards,"" one man yells. When security forces come to attack, the 19-year-old woman protester says she looks them in the eye and asks: ""Why do you kill your brother? Why do you hit your mother, your sisters?"" ""We all tell them, if you're Iranian, you shouldn't do that to your people, to your own country's people,"" she told CNN by phone.  Watch woman stand up in defiance to power » . But it's the woman known as Neda who has become the symbol of women on the front line that has galvanized opponents of the Iranian regime. In a widely circulated video, Neda is seen in the middle of protests over the weekend. She is shot and drops to the ground. Blood runs from the side of her mouth as a few people, including her music professor traveling with her, press on her chest and shout her name. One pleads, ""Do not be afraid."" The camera closes in on her face as her eyes roll back and are still. Karim Sadjadpour, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the image of Neda and other women at the protests showed the difference from the 1979 revolution. ""The iconic pictures from the revolution 30 years ago were bearded men. This shows the new face of Iran -- the young women who are the vanguards of Iran.""  See images of protests » . Abbas Milani, the director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, agreed that Neda was becoming a symbol for all the women who have become involved in the turmoil that has followed the disputed election. ""She will become the image of this brutality and the role -- the truly significant role -- that women have played in fighting this regime. I think that women are the unsung heroes of the last few years. They are the ones who began chipping away the absolute authority of the mullahs."" The protests haven't just been confined to Iran's everyday women. The daughter of former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was arrested over the weekend while taking part in a protest. She was later released. In addition, Zahra Rahnavard, the wife of Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose apparent defeat in Iran's presidential election has sparked the unprecedented demonstrations, campaigned for her husband, an unusual step in politics in Iran. Her public support of his candidacy underscored his professed support for women's rights.  Learn more about the timeline of events » . And in another act of defiance, apparently from after the election, a woman who appears to be in her 20s or 30s walks down a street in Tehran, showing off her body in a revealing dress and displaying her long, curly hair. In Iran, women are forbidden to show their hair, and they must keep their bodies covered. ""Lady, is it a revolution already?"" one female driver says as she passes by. The 19-year-old demonstrator, who spoke by phone with CNN, says women are out in the streets in much larger numbers than men. She provided CNN with images of paramilitary forces on Saturday confronting protests, just before she was beaten. She says she was beaten again during protests Monday. ""The women are all together and they say, 'We're going to stay here.' There are so more [women] than men,"" she said, referring to the number of women protesters. ""Until now, the women didn't have a chance to express themselves, to say that we are important in our country's future. But now, they can play an important role in our freedom. It's a good chance for us."" Is she optimistic? ""I'm absolutely optimistic, because history has taught me that all the revolutions start like this,"" she said. ""Every revolution has violence and some people die, but nothing stays like this forever.""

"(CNN)  -- More than 100 police officers and others were searching Friday in a southeastern Louisiana parish for a murder suspect who escaped from jail with three other inmates, a law enforcement official said. Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, remains at large, authorities in Louisiana say. Searchers are still focusing inside St. Tammany Parish, on the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, 30 miles north of New Orleans, said Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office. At large is Timothy Murray, 29, who is charged with murder, Bonnett said. Authorities believe Murray may have been injured during the escape, but Bonnett wouldn't elaborate. The inmates escaped about 9 p.m. Thursday from the St. Tammany Parish Jail in Covington, Bonnett said. As many as 250 sheriff's deputies, Covington police officers, Louisiana State police and corrections officials were involved in the search overnight, using dogs, two helicopters and thermal-imaging equipment loaned from Livingston Parish, Bonnett said. The other three men were found about 1:30 a.m. Friday in a wooded area about a mile from the jail, he said. Three of the inmates were awaiting trial; one already had been convicted, Bonnett said. The captured inmates were Gary Slaydon, 27; Eric Buras, 30, and Jason Gainey, 27. Slaydon is charged with attempted murder. Buras is a murder suspect and Gainey has been convicted of murder, Bonnett said. He said the escape was not discovered until a resident and Covington police reported seeing what appeared to be inmates in jail uniforms walking down a street. About the time those calls came in, jailers were doing a routine head count and found the four men missing, Bonnett said. He said the means of escape was under investigation, but it has been determined that their escape wasn't due to human error. He repeated what St. Tammany Parish Sheriff Jack Strain said early Friday: ""Four inmates were able to defeat the structure of the maximum security area of our jail."" Deputies have canvassed neighborhoods, going door to door to warn residents that an inmate is still at large.","Four inmates escape from jail in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana .

"(CNN) -- Searchers have recovered the bodies of three people who were aboard a Yemenia Airways jet that crashed off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, a spokesman for Yemen's Civil Aviation department said Tuesday. A man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France. Capt. Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Qadir also told reporters that a child who was reported found alive was a 5-year-old boy. He did not give further details of the child's condition. ""The French said that (Wednesday) they will send more French units to the accident location in order to retrieve the bodies and possibly that they may be able to locate people who are still alive,"" he said. The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Qadir said the jet took off from Sanaa shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. Searchers have not located the plane's data recorders, Qadir said, and investigators were not speculating on the cause of the crash. ""The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),"" he said. ""That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport."" But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that several years ago France banned the plane, a A310-300, because of safety concerns. ""People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,"" Bussereau said. ""It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful because none of this information is verified."" Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash. ""This plane is just like any other plane,"" he said. ""It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash."" It was the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.  Recent plane crashes » . Former pilot and aviation analyst John Cox said there were no similarities between the two incidents. ""These are two dramatically different airplanes flown by two different airlines,"" Cox told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The accidents happened at two different regimes of flight. And Airbus has hundreds of millions of hours flying safely.

At first, Comoros officials said there were no signs of survivors among the dead bodies floating in the choppy waters. But then rescuers found the child.

I'm just saddened for the loss of everybody else,"" he added. The Yemeni crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni. The plane tried to land, then U-turned before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. Officials did not know why the plane could not land, he said. Flight 626 was expected to be a four-and-a-half-hour flight. The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni, off the east coast of Africa, about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) south of Yemen. The crash occurred about 1:30 a.m., Nadhoim said. There was no indication of foul play behind the crash, the official in Yemen said. Yemenia Air had used the jet since 1999 on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would assist in investigating the crash. ""The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident,"" the company said in a statement. In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.   One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May, and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

"(CNN) -- When the highly anticipated movie ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" opened Friday in theaters, many fans had already seen it. The pirating and distribution of ""Wolverine,"" starring Hugh Jackman, is being investigated by the FBI. The online leak of a pirated, unfinished version of the 20th Century Fox film a month ago sent federal authorities springing into action and stoked a heated conversation within the entertainment industry about digital piracy. Piracy of upcoming films is not new, but the theft of ""Wolverine"" is especially troubling for an industry concerned with a stalled economy and the financial bottom line. It's rare for high-quality copies of a big-budget blockbuster to appear on the Internet more than a month before the film's release, experts say. Within a week of ""Wolverine's"" March 31 leak, more than a million people had downloaded the movie, according to TorrentFreak, a blog devoted to the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol.  Watch intrepid reporter look for answers » . ""Unfortunately, the recent leak of the Fox film 'Wolverine' provided a stark backdrop to the impact that digital piracy has on the large investments that producers make in creating state-of-the-art films,"" said Rep. Howard Berman, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, who oversaw a congressional hearing on piracy after the leak. ""During our hearing in Los Angeles, director Steven Soderbergh said that in 2007, the entertainment industry generated a trade surplus of $13.6 billion,"" Berman added. ""Imagine what those numbers would be if we could rein in piracy."" Bootleg, or illegally copied, movies have long been a thorn to the film industry. In 2003, a version of Universal's ""The Hulk"" appeared on the Internet two weeks before the film opened. A New Jersey man pleaded guilty to the theft. And in 2005, a pirated print of ""Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith"" was uploaded to the Web within hours of the movie's release. But where Hollywood's biggest headache used to be murky, muffled copies of films taken by someone who snuck a camcorder into a theater, today's pirates are getting more sophisticated and gaining access to better-quality goods. Greg Sandoval, who covers media and digital entertainment for CNET News, said that in the digital age, thieves can gain access to near-perfect advance copies of films on DVD that have greater potential to undermine a movie's box-office prospects. And even studios' attempts at safeguarding their products against piracy, such as by encoding DVDs with digital watermarks that allow authorities to trace individual copies, aren't enough, Sandoval said. He said tech-savvy thieves have figured out how to strip such watermarks from DVDs. ""When you're talking about digital content ... it's impossible to lock it down completely"" from theft, Sandoval said. ""These hackers are very creative. Sometimes, they're one step ahead of the security experts."" 20th Century Fox issued a statement vowing to prosecute the ""Wolverine"" thief ""to the fullest extent of the law."" The FBI is investigating, but as of Thursday, no arrests had been made. Darcy Antonellis, president of technical operations for Warner Bros. (which is owned by the parent company of CNN), said the growth of technology has aided the pirates. ""Digital piracy has continued to increase with greater access to [files] and improved broadband services,"" said Antonellis, who helps oversee Warner Bros.' anti-piracy efforts. ""As broadband services increase their capacity to support legitimate services, they also enable increased illegal file-sharing. Technologies have evolved to encumber such distribution but must compete with the strength of viral or super distribution of content."" The bad guys aren't the only ones keeping up with the technology. Keith Bolcar, special agent in charge of the FBI's cyber division in Los Angeles, said agents and their partners as ""doing everything we can to keep up with the learning curve of technology, hopefully just as fast as our criminal subjects."" The FBI meets routinely with studio representatives to share intelligence, to discuss strategy and to detect and fix vulnerabilities in security measures, he said. ""While I can't discuss investigative techniques, we employ a myriad of sophisticated methods to solve these crimes,"" said Bolcar, whose office is investigating the ""Wolverine"" leak. ""Our investigators receive extensive training and are technologically savvy."" Hollywood also faces the challenge of protecting digital files that pass through so many hands while in production and post-production. Antonellis said Warner Bros. works diligently to safeguard its properties. ""Each project, for us, is unique, with its own unique set of challenges,"" she said. ""Whether there are 50 or 500 people involved in the process, we try to focus on ownership/responsibility of our assets throughout the entire production through to distribution process."" John Malcolm, director of worldwide anti-piracy operations for the Motion Picture Association of America, said digital piracy can take many forms, including peer-to-peer file sharing and streaming. Malcolm said the association is conducting a lot of outreach to universities and Internet service providers to help them address piracy that occurs over their systems. The issue is global, Malcolm said, as evidenced by pending litigation in France that would shut down Internet accounts of illegal downloaders. The association is in litigation against an Australian service provider, iiNet, to try to establish the legal parameters of its responsibility in policing its system, Malcolm said. ""In some cases, we are making great progress with ISP, and in some cases, it's a little bit tougher going,"" Malcolm said. ""After all, it's their broadband that's being eaten up, and it slows down their systems."" Berman, D-California, said advances in technologies that enable filtering and other anti-theft tools will help curb piracy. So will creating more sites where viewers can legitimately access movies, shows and music, such as Hulu and the recently announced Vevo, a partnership between Universal Music and YouTube. ""Given how pirated materials often damage computers with viruses, spyware and other problems, consumers will continue to embrace the innovative, legitimate sites that are becoming more and more available,"" Berman said. Malcolm agrees. He said there are more than 350 sites that legitimately distribute digital content. If a person is a true movie lover, they will want to respect the art, the artists and the countless people behind the scenes who make the magic happen, Malcolm said. ""I hear periodically, 'Well, Tom Cruise has enough money' or 'Tom Hanks has enough money,' "" Malcolm said. ""I would say to movie lovers, stick around and watch all of the credits. When you see hundreds of names scrolling across the screen, those are the people whose talents contributed to making that movie, and they need to make a living.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Military hardware that can be used in nuclear devices and ground fighting can be easily purchased In the United States and shipped overseas, a government investigation revealed Thursday. This inclinometer, which can be . used in homemade bombs, was easily bought and shipped overseas. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) watchdog agency set up fake companies to obtain military and dual use items -- which have both military and commercial use -- in the United States and ship them overseas, according to a report made public at a House subcommittee hearing. The domestic purchases allow buyers to avoid U.S. restrictions on sales to foreign entities, it noted. Items purchased in the bogus transactions included parts for making nuclear devices and guiding missiles that could carry nuclear warheads, as well as night-vision devices, body armor and other hardware for ground combat, said the report provided to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. ""There appears to be a gigantic loophole within our laws that makes it easy for our enemies to get hold of our superior military technology and use it against us,"" said Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan. Gregory Kutz, a GAO managing director who led the 13-month investigation, said it found ""sensitive dual-use and military technology can be easily and legally purchased from manufacturers and distributors within the United States and illegally exported without detection."" He stressed that no laws were broken by any of the companies that sold items to the undercover GAO operation, and that the magnitude of trying to check all overseas travelers and shipments made it impossible to halt illegal export of the items under current law. Committee members said the lack of regulation or export controls made the situation particularly troubling. ""The scandal here may be what is legal, not what is illegal,"" said Rep. Greg Walden, R-Oregon. However, he warned against excessive regulations that could stifle necessary commerce in items used by law enforcement, medical and other industries. Kutz held up some of the items purchased by undercover investigators, including a small device that looked like a spark plug called a triggered spark gap. The item has medical applications and can also be used to detonate a nuclear weapon, he said. Kutz also displayed a small device called a gyro chip that can be used to steer guided missiles. Other items on display in the committee room included some used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that target U.S. soldiers in Iraq, as well as sophisticated body armor and night-vision devices. Undercover investigators complied with all required checks in purchasing the equipment, Kutz said, including the submission of end-user agreements that forbid exporting the equipment or using it in any nuclear, biological and missile weapons. Such documents amount to an ""honor system"" pledge, rather than any enforcement mechanism, he said. The only further checks involved are confirming the validity of credit cards and the existence of Web sites, Kutz said. Most of the transactions took place by e-mail and telephone calls. ""The kind of front company we used and the kind of scheme we used is the kind being used by terrorist organizations today,"" Kutz said. ""This was not a hypothetical situation; this is being done."" The investigation shipped some of the dual-use items to ""a country that is a known trans-shipment point for terrorist governments and foreign governments attempting to acquire sensitive technology,"" Kutz said. He declined to name the country, but said it was in southeast Asia and that the shipments were simple packages labeled documents and sent by regular mail. ""As GAO proves, a cardboard box and the U.S. Postal Service is all it takes to move dual-use items out of the country,"" said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts. One of those duped by the investigation -- Nicholas Fitton, a technology dealer in Georgia -- told the committee he complied with all required checks in selling an F-16 engine computer to what he thought was a legitimate U.S. buyer. Asked by Stupak why anyone other than the military would need such a device, Fitton said his customers often are museums, collectors and film companies seeking authentic items. Fitton said existing regulations were counter-productive, with seemingly harmless items associated with military gear more tightly controlled than the dual-use items of the investigation. At the same time, he said, making the system too restrictive would harm the competitive ability of U.S. manufacturers. Export laws in the United States have remained virtually unchanged since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Anne-Marie Lasowski of the GAO told the committee. She called for a ""holistic"" approach involving all agencies charged with security and commerce for an issue involving billions of dollars in exports.","Watchdog agency GAO buys military hardware, ships it overseas with ease .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle's star on the Walk of Fame. From left, musicians Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison's relatives for dedication of his star. ""There's someone here from every important stage of George's life and career,"" Harrison's widow, Olivia, said. Harrison, who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001, becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star. John Lennon was the first. The new star is next to the iconic Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records, the distributor of much of Harrison's music for the past five decades. Tuesday's ceremony coincided with the Capitol/EMI announcement that it will release Harrison's first solo greatest hits collection -- ""Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison"" -- on June 16. Actor Tom Hanks said the world changed for him in January 1964 when he heard his first Beatles song. ""That's when we escaped the doldrums and moved on to a brighter, better, more joyful future,"" Hanks said. Superstar musicians Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne attended the star's dedication, but they did not address the crowd. Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event, with some traveling from as far as Liverpool, England. ""We all have deep feelings for George, because he was such a deep-feeling person,"" Olivia Harrison said. ""He was a beautiful, mystical man, living in a material world,"" she said. ""He was funny as the day is long and just as perplexing."" His son, Dhani, 30, joked about his father's star. ""It's good, it's lovely and it's nice and shiny and I'm glad it's not outside of Frederick's of Hollywood,"" he said. Harrison was just 15 when schoolmate Paul McCartney asked him to join his and John Lennon's band, the Quarrymen. The band evolved into the Beatles and the rest is history. Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles. Songs penned by Harrison included ""Taxman,"" ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun."" Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music. In 1971, he helped organize the star-studded ""Concert for Bangladesh"" at New York's Madison Square Garden. In addition to his post-Beatles solo career, Harrison played with several groups -- most notably the Traveling Wilburys, alongside Petty, Lynne, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Harrison's star next to Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- An internationally known Catholic priest who was shown in photographs last week embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman on a Florida beach has admitted they had a two-year affair. The Rev. Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman. The Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called ""Father Oprah"" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' ""Early Show"" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said. The priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks. ""I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,"" he said Monday. The photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as ""Padre Alberto,"" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: ""Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover."" Other media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world. In a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a ""scandal."" ""Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,"" Favalora said. ""Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest."" Cutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program. ""I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,"" Cutie said. The priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement » . ""I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,"" Cutie said. ""I understand fully that this is wrong. ""I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,"" he said. ""I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate."" He also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have ""both struggled"" with the relationship, he said. ""She's also a woman of faith,"" Cutie said. ""She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy. Obviously, you know, through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that."" Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says. In addition to his TV and radio appearances, he has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, ""Real Life, Real Love."" Before being removed, he was president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace in Miami.","Catholic priest was removed from duties in Miami archdiocese .

"(CNN) -- A Philadelphia-area day care center said Thursday that members of a private swim club made racist comments about the center's children, and the club then canceled their swimming privileges. Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care center say club members made racial remarks. The Creative Steps Day Care children -- ages kindergarten through seventh grade -- went to the Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, on June 29. The day center's director, Alethea Wright, had contracted to use the club once a week. During their first visit, some children said they heard club members asking why African-American children were there. One of the boys told the Philadelphia Inquirer that a woman at the club said she feared the children ""might do something"" to her child. Days later, the day care center's $1,950 check was returned without explanation, Wright said. The stepfather of one of the children was filing a complaint against the club with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, the panel's chairman, Stephen Glassman, said Thursday.  Watch one of the children say what he heard at the swim club » . The commission is investigating the allegations, spokeswoman Shannon Powers said, and will attempt to resolve the conflict out of court. ""Protests and public outcry won't do much to help these families, but the Human Relations Commission can determine the facts and hold people accountable for any illegal acts of discrimination,"" State NAACP President J. Whyatt Mondesire, who serves as a commission member, said in a press release. Sen. Arlen Specter's office said the Pennsylvania Democrat has sent a letter to the Valley Swim Club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps, saying, ""I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today."" On its Web site, the Valley Club disputed the allegations of racism. ""We had originally agreed to invite the camps to use our facility, knowing full well that the children from the camps were from multi-ethnic backgrounds,"" the statement said. ""Unfortunately, we quickly learned that we underestimated the capacity of our facilities and realized that we could not accommodate the number of children from these camps. All funds were returned to the camps and we will re-evaluate the issue at a later date to determine whether it can be feasible in the future."" CNN attempted to speak with club President John Duesler on Thursday. He said he had no comment and asked CNN to leave the club property. But Duesler told two Philadelphia television stations that the children had changed ""the complexion"" and ""atmosphere"" of the club. A small group of protesters gathered in front of the club Thursday and said they think Duesler's statements prove that the club's action was racially motivated. ""I was hoping it wouldn't be something that was so blatantly apparent. I was hoping that it was overcrowding,"" one protester said. ""When I read the statement by the club president, it made it blatant."" Jim Flynn, who said he was one of the club members who made a complaint against the children, said it was not racially motivated. ""There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards,"" he said. ""As general members, we were not told that they were coming. If we knew, we could decide to not come when the pool was crowded or come anyway. We could have had an option."" He said two other day-care centers, neither of which included minority children, had previously been similarly disinvited. A private Philadelphia boarding school said Thursday that it plans to help the day care center. ""We thought it was appalling what happened,"" said Girard College Admissions Director Tamara Leclair. She is meeting with the director of Creative Steps to sign a contract allowing the children to use Girard's facilities this summer, as early as Monday. ""We've had a wonderful response. I even received an e-mail from a woman in Florida telling us we did the right thing. ""","NEW: Club says facility could not accommodate the number of children .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- A 16-year-old Hong Kong boy makes two phone calls for delivery: One for pizza, the other for the drug ketamine. Two teenage girls are found semi-conscious in a car park after overdosing on ketamine. A 13-year-old boy joins a gang and is given free ketamine. Glass capsules containing ketamine, which has become the drug of choice for Hong Kong's youth. These are anecdotes told to CNN by police, a family doctor and a former gang member. Ketamine has become the drug of choice among young people, as the number of people under 21 taking drugs has surged 57 percent in the last four years in Hong Kong, said Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong. ""We started off with a very small number of young people taking drugs. We are now more worried about the trend,"" Wong said. ""We don't want a runaway trend; that's why we are stepping up action."" Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer, can put users in a dazed stupor for about two hours, doctors said. Long-term use of ketamine can impair cognitive function and damage internal organs.  Watch Pauline Chiou's report on ketamine sweeping Hong Kong » . An oversupply of the drug in Hong Kong and the fact that it is cheaper than other narcotics makes ketamine popular with young people, said Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau. One gram of ketamine sells on the street here for $13 and is enough to be shared with two other people, while cocaine, for example, sells for $103 a gram, Fok said. The drug is legal for medical use, but it is trafficked into Hong Kong from other parts of Asia, such as India and mainland China, and sold on the streets illegally, Fok said. Police have recently stepped up their efforts to crack down on drug use at clubs and bars in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a city in mainland China just across the border. Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong, mostly under the age of 30, were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here. However, narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse. ""Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds. That's what our recent data from last year shows,"" Fok said. ""They want to find some other places to take drugs."" The problem has gotten so bad that authorities have decided to do something never done here before: random school drug tests. Beginning in September, some two dozen schools will conduct tests, as part of a trial program. Officials say the drug screening will most likely be in the form of urine tests, though they are still working out the details. Ketamine can be detected in urine for at least three days, doctors said.  Watch a doctor explain how the test works » . Dr. Cheng Chi Man, a family practice doctor, runs a seminar that trains doctors to detect the signs of drug abuse in young patients: drowsiness, skin problems, frequent urination (ketamine can affect bladder function) and frequent sick leave. ""When we were 10 years old, we were still in primary school watching TV and eating candy. But they are now taking drugs."" Alman Chan, principal of Hong Kong's only drug rehab school for youth, the privately-run Christian Zheng Sheng School, said he has watched as drug use has grown.  See photos of the rehab school in remote Hong Kong » . ""Just look at our school development. I was here 14 years ago. At that time, I was the only teacher. I had 18 kids. I only had one student who was 15,"" he said. ""But now, I have one third -- about 40 of them -- who are 15 years old or younger. That shows you the number of students getting into drugs is bigger and also getting younger and younger."" There were a few reasons why children were getting involved with drugs, such as troubled homes and difficulties at school, he said. ""People are more concerned about material things and they are getting lost,"" he added. Hong Kong Police have arrested children as young as age 13 for drug offenses, according to Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong. Police last week reportedly busted a network that allegedly recruited teenagers to sell illegal drugs-- mainly to students. One of those arrested -- a 14-year-old school dropout -- was found with 28 grams of ketamine, according to the South China Morning Post. But ketamine abuse is not limited to young people. It is the second-most popular drug among all age groups in Hong Kong, Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau said. Many young drug abusers end up in Alman Chan's drug rehab school for youth, which is located in a remote part of Lantau Island west of Hong Kong. CNN visited the campus, which is home to 99 boys and 24 girls. The closest road is a three-hour hike through the woods. Chan calls the school ""the last stop before jail"" for drug abusers. That was the case for Tai Ming Hung's son Keith, a former gang member. She learned he was using ketamine when he ended up in the hospital after taking the drug a few years ago. ""I was in denial. I just didn't believe it was true. When I first heard about it, we all didn't know how to react, because we hadn't heard of those drugs before,"" she said. ""I didn't really understand why we have these harmful drugs in the world. And I was so afraid that it would kill my son."" 18-year-old Keith, who said he began using ketamine at the age of 13 when he joined a gang, has recovered and is now living at Chan's school. ""I have a feeling that he's really growing up, he keeps improving,"" his mother said. The school's curriculum involves regular school subjects and chores. The goal is for each student to finish their court probation and either sit for the university exam or continue on to a vocational school. Many of the students have become interested in video editing and photography. There is a video lab on campus and the students showed CNN some video projects they have done. Other students run a pizza parlor and tea shop on a neighboring island. The average stay at the school is three years and students are encouraged to plan for life after rehab. ""We have vocational training. We help them get some marketable skills; therefore, they may get a job or continue training afterward,"" Chan said. ""I believe everyone deserves a second chance.""","Police: Ketamine is the top drug of choice among young people in Hong Kong .

"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) -- Bjorn Ulvaeus was one half of the songwriting genius behind Swedish pop legend ABBA. After the band split up in 1982 Ulvaeus turned his talents to writing musicals, including ""Mamma Mia,"" now a blockbuster movie. Bjorn Ulvaeus on the ABBA phenomenon: ""I'm amazed how this could happen. I'm just grateful and humble."" He took My City_My Life on a tour of his home town of Stockholm and talked about his past and future as pop royalty. CNN: What is the secret of ABBA's success? Bjorn Ulvaeus: I think the secret behind the fact that our songs are still around and that ABBA became so big is a lot of factors together. But one of them was definitely that we put so much effort into song writing. We hardly ever toured, we just wrote and wrote and produced the records over a period of seven or eight years. So it's the songs, plus I think the two girls, the voices -- the blend was unique and very special. CNN: Where did get the inspiration for your songs? BU: Well mostly in song writing my experience is that there isn't so much inspiration as hard work. You sit there for hours, days and weeks with a guitar and piano until something good comes. But the urge to write is something you have to have. A conviction, an ambition to write and never stop until you think, ""This is the best I can do."" Watch Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . CNN: What drives you? BU: In my career the push has always been to take another step, to try something new. That means that after ABBA, when we split up in 1982, we were onto writing a musical [""Chess""] because we hadn't done that before. CNN: How do you feel about working in the theater? BU: Every time I sit in the audience and watch a show that I have been involved with, it is such an amazing feeling to see all those people around me, knowing they are actually watching and enjoying something I have written. That is such a feeling of pure joy that never goes away and that's why I guess I'm so attracted to work in the theater. CNN: How did ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" come about? BU: When you have a big hit on the West End and on Broadway with a musical, as we had with ""Mamma Mia,"" there is always the question, ""when are you going to do the movie?"" Some people say you shouldn't do it until the actual stage musical is on its last legs, but I don't think that matters. We had been on Broadway for seven or eight years and eight or nine in the West End and we thought now is the time to make that movie. CNN: How has Stockholm changed over the years?

"(CNN) -- A diary reported to have come from a top Colombian guerrilla leader killed last year says key officials in Ecuador accepted money from the rebels and had connections with Mexican drug gangs. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, has been at war with the government for decades. The money was meant to finance Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa's 2006 election campaign, Marxist rebel Raul Reyes is said to have written in a diary allegedly obtained after his death. Ecuador denies the allegations and has asked the Organization of American States to investigate. ""The president of the republic did not know anything about this and never sent any emissary to finance his electoral campaign,"" Interior Minister Gustavo Jalkh said at a news conference Wednesday. Ecuadorian officials released excerpts from the diary Thursday. Wednesday's revelation was the second instance in two weeks tying Correa to donations from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC. Last week, Colombian media broadcast a 2008 video in which guerrilla leader Victor Julio Suarez Rojas, widely known as Mono Jojoy, said the rebels donated money to Correa's campaign. The guerrilla group also had conversations with Correa's emissaries and has reached ""some accords, according to documents that we have,"" Suarez said in the videotape. Correa denied those allegations, asking the nation's civil service commission to investigate. FARC issued a statement Tuesday denying that the rebels have ""given money to any electoral campaign of any neighboring country."" The guerrillas accused the United States and Colombia of manipulating the Suarez video to make Correa look bad. FARC has been at war with the Colombian government for more than 45 years. In the latest allegations, Reyes, FARC's second-in-command until his death in March 2008, identifies the Ecuadorians who had contacts with the rebels as former head of security Gustavo Larrea, former under secretary for governing Ignacio Chauvin, retired Col. Jorge Brito and dentist Luis Ayala. ""Larrea, Brito and Dr. Ayala, I am sure, move among the Mexican drug cartels and, in order to have free reign, collaborate with the CIA,"" Reyes wrote, according to the state-run Notimex news agency in Mexico. ""For them, I am the true loot, and turning me over would be their major deal."" Ecuadorian Interior Minister Jalkh and Foreign Minister Fander Falconi declined Wednesday to confirm the diary's authenticity, attributing to it ""neither truth nor falseness."" Instead, they said they turned it over to the Organization of American States so that the hemispheric body can verify its authenticity. Ecuadorian officials also turned a copy over to the nation's attorney general. The 20-page diary goes from July 2007 to February 23, 2008, seven days before a Colombian bombing attack killed Reyes at his camp inside the Ecuadorian border. In addition to Reyes, the attack killed 24 people, including four Mexicans and an Ecuadorian. As a result, Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Colombia in March 2008. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, an ally of the leftist Correa, also strongly objected to the attack and sent tanks to his country's border with Colombia in March 2008. On Tuesday, Chavez froze relations with Colombia and recalled Venezuela's ambassador after Colombia revealed that the FARC had gotten hold of shoulder-launched anti-tank grenades that Sweden sold to Venezuela 20 years ago. Reyes' diary portrays a rebel leader who feels trapped and betrayed. ""No matter how much Nacho [Ignacio] Chauvin insists, as well as correspondence from Larrea, I don't see any convenience in staying at the Angostura camp that I occupied as a result of Col. Brito,"" Reyes wrote. ""I know that Larrea is behind all this."" Writing about the Angostura camp on the border with Colombia, Reyes said, ""This place is a trap. They have me tied up here under the pretext that I should receive the international delegations. All this stuff is very false."" He goes on to doubt the people who come to see him at the jungle base. ""The revolutionaries who visit me, save for a few people, only want money and deals. I ask myself, how many of them are infiltrators who work as double agents? I feel the presence of double agents in Correa's intimate group, without a doubt."" Giving money to Correa was a waste, Reyes wrote. ""Trusting Correa was suicide,"" the diary said.

"(CNN) -- It takes seven minutes to execute a death row inmate, according to the state of Texas. Mike Graczyk poses outside the Texas death chamber prior to an execution in January. At that rate, Mike Graczyk has spent about 40 hours of his life watching men -- and a few women -- die. Graczyk, a correspondent for The Associated Press, is believed to hold a macabre record. He's almost certainly watched more executions than anyone else in the United States. ""I can't possibly imagine there's been someone present at more than Mike,"" said Michelle Lyons, the spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, which uses lethal injection at its execution chamber in Huntsville. Since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, no state has executed more inmates than Texas. And no one has witnessed more of them than Graczyk. He's on the witness list for 315 of the state's 439 executions -- more than any other reporter, prison employee or chaplain --  and no records were kept for another 80.  Interactive map: See how Texas compares with other states » . In his early days, he kept count. But he eventually stopped. He didn't want to know. ""In one circle, I was perceived as putting notches on my gun belt,"" the 59-year-old reporter said. ""I didn't like that."" Prison regulations in Texas require The Associated Press to be given one of the five designated media witness passes for each execution. Graczyk works in the AP's Houston bureau -- it's closest to the state's execution chamber in Huntsville. Since the early 1980s, he's made the hourlong drive north almost every time an inmate has faced the needle. The first was March 13, 1984, for the execution of James ""Cowboy"" Autry, convicted of shooting a female store clerk between the eyes with a .38-caliber revolver while arguing over a six-pack of beer. She died, along with a former Catholic priest that Autry killed at the crime scene. ""The first time definitely leaves an impression on you,"" Graczyk said. There are others that stand out along the way. Graczyk remembers Bob Black, convicted of killing his wife and trying to collect the insurance money. ""I walked into the death house, and he was strapped to the table and he said, 'Hey Mike, how are you doing?' It threw me for a loop."" Graczyk said it's normal for him to know the name of the condemned and not uncommon for the reverse to be true. There have been others who greeted Graczyk by name with a needle in their arm. Once, while waiting to be let into the death house, a prisoner phoned him in the media holding area. It was the inmate whose execution Graczyk was about to witness. ""He said, 'I just wanted to call and make sure you were OK.' I was flabbergasted."" Over the years, the inmate's name has slipped from Graczyk's memory, but not the unexpected phone conversation. ""I don't think he had any family to call,"" he said. There was Ponchai Wilkerson, who once nearly escaped from death row and, years later, coughed up a handcuff key as he lay dying from his injection. There was the ""Candy Man,"" Ronald Clark O'Bryan -- convicted of poisoning his child's Halloween candy with cyanide -- and the gauntlet of college students wearing Halloween masks who showed up to cheer. And Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman executed in Texas since the 1800s. He remembers a network correspondent crying after her death -- and another blow-drying his hair. Of the entire death chamber ritual, Graczyk said, it's the final statements that stick in his mind. Some have been confessions. Others were denials. Poetry. Prayers. Bible verses. Curses. Emotions ranging from defiance to resignation. There was Jonathan Nobles, an electrician who stabbed two people to death. He sang ""Silent Night."" ""Ever since then, I think of him on Christmas or Christmas Eve when I'm in church,"" Graczyk said. ""That's the kind of thing that haunts you."" The person who may come closest to Graczyk's status also felt things that haunted him. Don Reid, a writer for the AP and, before that, a Texas newspaper, witnessed 189 executions in the 1960s, when Texas still strapped inmates to ""Old Sparky,"" the nickname for the state's electric chair. The experience changed Reid, who died in 1981, from a supporter of the death penalty to an opponent. He wrote a book, ""Have a Seat, Please,"" chronicling that transformation. Graczyk said he doesn't worry about the mental toll of watching so many deaths. His bosses with the AP have offered counseling. He's declined. ""To see someone go to sleep -- not to sound insensitive -- but the carnage at the murder scene is harder than what you see in the death house in Huntsville,"" he said. Over a 25-year career, Graczyk said, the executions have only been a small portion of his work. He finds balance in those other stories. As a journalist, Graczyk never answers the question when friends ask his own views on the death penalty. ""I'm not sure I really know,"" he said. But as long as Texas keeps executing people, Graczyk said, it's important that he keep showing up. The next execution in Huntsville was scheduled for Thursday before the condemned, convicted murderer Kenneth Mosley, was granted a reprieve until September. If the execution goes ahead then, Graczyk plans to make the drive. ""I would hate for the state of Texas to take someone's life and no one be there,"" he said. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Texas reporter has covered executions in Texas since the early 1980s .

"(CNET)  -- At a hacker conference no one is safe. Demographic of Defcon conference for hackers is older, wiser and employed. When I first went to Defcon in 1995, the halls were mobbed with teenagers and attendees seemed more concerned with freeing Kevin Mitnick and seeing strippers than hacking each others' computers. Jump forward to Defcon 17 this year, which was held over the weekend in Las Vegas, things certainly have changed. The attendees are older and wiser and employed, most of the feds aren't in stealth mode, and even the most savvy of hackers is justifiably paranoid. ""Welcome to the hacker world,"" said Defcon founder Jeff Moss. The evolving demographic of Defcon attendees shows that the hacker community, like all of us, is aging. But it's also a reflection of how the threat landscape has changed. Web site defacements have given way to much more serious risks like financial fraud and unaddressed critical infrastructure weaknesses. It's a cornucopia of phishing e-mails, cross-site scripting attacks that poke holes in trusted Web sites, and criminals harvesting credit card numbers and selling them on the underground equivalent of eBay with guarantees of service and support. Defcon and Black Hat, the pricier and more corporate sister confab held the two days preceding Defcon ($120 for Defcon registration versus $1,395 to $2,095 for phased registration at Black Hat), offer a forum for researchers to share information about vulnerabilities they find in software, hardware and systems. Targeted this year were everything from the iPhone and surveillance video feeds to e-parking meters and security underlying the Domain Name System. Vendors and users weren't the only ones who need worry. Attendees had plenty to fear and security experts themselves weren't spared. On July 27, Web sites belonging to a handful of security researchers and groups were hacked and passwords, private e-mails, IM chats, and potentially sensitive documents were exposed on the vandalized site of security golden boy Dan Kaminsky. (Mitnick, whose jailing in the '90s for computer crimes made him a cause celebre at ""Free Kevin"" benefits at Defcon at the time, was among those attacked.) There were more widespread threats at the shows, too. Anyone using the Wi-Fi networks at the events had better be careful lest they get their password sniffed and posted on the Wall of Sheep. Then there was the USB thumb drive that was passed around among attendees of Black Hat that was found to be infected with the Conficker virus. Reporters who aren't nearly as geeky as the sources they interview are always easy prey. One reporter was concerned about being hacked via the local area network in the press room after a rare Blue Screen of Death crashed his laptop. Last year, three French men were expelled for sniffing the press room LAN at Black Hat. They said they had obtained eWeek's and CNET's passwords but failed to prove the CNET allegation. This year, three South Koreans registered as press were ejected for asking questions that led organizers to believe were on an intelligence-gathering mission instead of merely reporting, according to the IDG News Service. I had a panic of my own at Defcon this year. I was connected to the Internet using an EVDO wireless card and a virtual private network and was startled a short while later when a Web page opened up out of the blue and I noticed the VPN was disconnected. Granted it looked like a legitimate page for my wireless carrier, but not wanting to take any chances I immediately logged off. (See ""Defcon: What to leave at home and other do's and don'ts"" for tips on how to best protect yourself.) Unfortunately, I had neglected to disable the Wi-Fi on the laptop. Because Windows XP event logging is lacking, it's not clear whether someone may have spoofed the name of a wireless network the laptop is configured to automatically connect to. Time to call the help desk. At least I didn't use any automatic teller machines at the hotel. Defcon organizers confirmed on Monday that a fake ATM was discovered in a lobby of the Riviera Hotel where the event was held, right near the hotel security office. The ruse was up after someone looked through the camera hole using a flashlight and saw a PC inside. Meanwhile, Chris Paget, a security expert who works at Google, reported on Twitter that he lost $200 from a compromised ATM at the Rio Hotel over the weekend. There are multiple Diebold ATMs with the skimmers inside at the Rio casino, he tweeted, later adding: ""Secret Service just called back. They're taking it seriously, reading between the lines it seem(s) like there's more going on here."" There is no evidence that the fake Riviera ATM was planted by anyone at Defcon, and in all likelihood the hacked Rio ATM was not associated with the hacker show. Heightening the paranoia at Defcon was the report from event organizers on Saturday that there was a confirmed Trojan on the CD the conference hands out to all attendees. The report turned out to be false. Also arousing suspicion were the Defcon badges, which featured a built-in microphone, LED, digital signal processor, and custom circuit boards designed to be hacked as part of a contest. I prudently popped the battery out of my badge after discussing the microphone capability with another journalist. Some attendees chose not to wear the badges at all, even without the battery, tucking them in satchels and digging them out every time they needed to display them. As it does every year, Defcon also had its share of stupid attendee tricks--one arrest reportedly for carrying a concealed weapon and another for bungee jumping off the hotel roof. But those are par for the course when you mix booze and rebellious youth trying to out-impress each other. It was the other stuff--the hacking and viruses and sniffing--that made me and others at the show jumpy. Security guru Bruce Schneier, however, brushed it off as the mere cost of doing business. ""This is the way hackers play,"" he said. ""This is the experimental battlefield. It's not bad; it is just what it is. Defcon has an important place in computer security."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. CNET, CNET.com and the CNET logo are registered trademarks of CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman was arrested early Sunday on suspicion of choking and restraining MTV reality show star Tila Tequila, police said. Shawne Merriman is accused of restraining reality TV star Tila Tequlia as she tried to leave his home, police say. However, Merriman's attorney denied the allegations, saying more than a dozen other people were at Merriman's house in suburban San Diego, California, at the time of the incident and ""witness after witness after witness will back up his story 100 percent.""   Authorities responded to a disturbance call about 3:45 a.m. Sunday from a woman who said she had been choked and restrained by a male, the sheriff's department of San Diego County, California, said in a statement. When police arrived, ""the reporting party identified herself as Tila Nguyen, aka Tila Tequila, and her alleged assailant as Shawne Merriman,"" the statement said. ""Nguyen told deputies she had been choked and physically restrained by Merriman when she attempted to leave his residence,"" the statement said.  Watch Merriman's side of the story » . Nguyen signed a citizen's arrest at the scene, and Merriman was taken into custody on suspicion of battery and false imprisonment, according to the statement. Deputies didn't see any physical injuries on Nguyen, but she asked to be transported to a local hospital, sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said. Nguyen's condition was not immediately known. Merriman's attorney, Todd Macaluso, told reporters that Nguyen was ""extremely intoxicated and inebriated"" and that the player tried to make arrangements for her to leave the house. ""At no time did Mr. Merriman assault her. At no time did Mr. Merriman keep her against her will,"" Macaluso said. ""His intentions were nothing but good. ... We're very confident that this matter will be resolved without any charges being filed whatsoever."" Caldwell said alcohol ""was involved"" on Nguyen's part. Caldwell didn't elaborate. Merriman was released from jail late Sunday morning. Caldwell said she didn't know whether Merriman was released on bail or on his own recognizance. The district attorney's office will determine whether criminal charges will be pursued, Caldwell said. As Tila Tequila, Nguyen starred on the MTV reality shows ""A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila"" in 2007 and ""A Shot at Love 2 With Tila Tequila"" in 2008. On her Twitter account, Nguyen did not mention the incident but tweeted about going to meet Merriman on Saturday. In a statement posted on the Chargers' Web site Sunday, team General Manager A.J. Smith said it is ""disappointing to hear about the issue involving Shawne Merriman."" ""We'll continue to monitor the situation and let the legal process run its course,"" Smith said. Merriman, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, is entering his fifth year with the Chargers and the NFL. He recorded at least 10 sacks in each of his first three seasons, but he was limited to one game last season because of a knee injury that required surgery. The Chargers begin their 2009 NFL regular-season campaign on September 14 in Oakland, California, for a game against the Raiders.","NEW: Merriman's attorney says NFL player didn't assault Tila Tequila .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- The death toll from a flash flood in Indonesia's capital grew to 98 people on Sunday as rescuers widened their search for more than 130 other people in the aftermath. Members of a search and rescue team look for bodies near  Jakarta. The nation's health ministry said 62 women, 31 men and three students had been killed. Of those, 12 bodies remained unidentified, ministry spokesman Rustam Pakaya said. Another 13 people were missing. The search for the missing will be called off Sunday night, he said. The flood started Friday morning after heavy rains caused waters to smash through a dam and rush into Jakarta.   The breach unleashed a torrent of water that plowed into hundreds of homes in what some survivors described as a suburban ""tsunami."" About 1,500 volunteers -- mostly students from two flooded universities in Jakarta -- are assisting in the search and rescue effort, said Mardjito, a social affairs ministry official who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name. He said rescuers started using heavy machinery to lift debris. Still, the death toll is expected to rise. At least 50 people were injured and nearly 1,500 have been displaced. Mardjito said a camp for survivors so far has adequate supplies as members of political parties continue to send food, blankets, flashlights and other items amid a major election year. Sleeping residents were taken by surprise by the powerful flash flood as it crashed through the crowded Cirendeu district near Jakarta early Friday.  Watch scenes of the flood devastation » . Drenched and shivering survivors were taking refuge on the rooftops of their homes as rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to reach them, said social affairs ministry official Mardjito. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, currently on the campaign trail ahead of the elections later this year, has said he had ordered senior ministers to visit the scene of the disaster. ""On behalf of the government, I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty,"" he said, according to the official Antara news agency. The rain obliterated a 255-meter-long section of the dam, releasing a wall of water from a 20-hectare lake that some survivors said reminded them of the tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004. ""They said they had heard loud rumbling sounds like during a powerful earthquake. They later found out that the sounds came from the water rushing out from the dam's lake,"" according to Antara. Floods from heavy rains are an annual occurrence in and around Jakarta, a low-lying city on the northern coast of Java island, where poor infrastructure often results in polluted canals and rivers overflowing their banks and spilling into thousands of homes. In 2007, 38 people were killed and 430,000 forced from their homes when storm water 3 meters deep in some places swamped 75 percent of the capital, which is home to about 9 million people. With poor sanitation and a hot and humid climate, the risk of water-borne diseases is usually a major concern following floods in the city, where mosquito-transmitted malaria is also a threat. CNN's Andy Saputra contributed to this report.","At least 98 dead, many more missing, from flash floods in Jakarta .

"(CNN) -- A whistle-blower who helped shed light on misconduct among the ranks of contractors working as guards for the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan is back home in England sooner than he expected after he resigned in the fallout of the scandal. ""It was just downright stupid,"" Terry Pearson says of guard misconduct in Afghanistan. Terry Pearson, who worked as an operations manager for contractor R.A. International at Camp Sullivan in Afghanistan, said he witnessed mistreatment among the guards employed by ArmorGroup North America, who were housed at the camp. ""It was just downright stupid, some of the things they were doing,"" Pearson told CNN. ""And insensitive."" Allegations surfaced last week that contractor ArmorGroup allowed mistreatment, sexual activity and intimidation within the ranks of private guards hired to protect the embassy in Kabul. The company and U.S. officials are investigating. Wackenhut Services Inc., the corporate parent of ArmorGroup, said in an e-mail it is ""fully cooperating"" in the investigation. Fourteen guards were fired and the entire management team for ArmorGroup in Kabul was to be replaced, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said. The actions of the embassy guards went beyond pranks or laughs, he said. ""When you start encouraging people to drink alcohol running off someone's body parts,"" Pearson said, pausing for a moment, ""a bit over the top.""  Watch Pearson describe guards' ""insensitive"" conduct » . He took his grievance to his superiors as well as those of ArmorGroup. The answer he received was, ""'they're just letting off steam,' and I think that's the way they looked at some of the incidents that happened,"" Pearson said. Pearson said he was looking for a change of behavior, not for mass firings. But at Camp Sullivan, he was made to feel that he had done something wrong and he resigned. Pearson said he reconsidered the resignation almost immediately after he submitted it, but it was too late. ""Although we are now aware of the alleged events at Camp Sullivan ... the employee's resignation was not associated with this matter,"" R.A. International said in a statement. The scandal came to light last week when the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and briefed reporters on its findings, which it said were based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul. Speaking with CNN at his hometown of Liverpool, England, Pearson said that given a chance to go back, he would have taken the same stance. ""Dignity at work and respect at work is more important than having a job yourself,"" he said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- John Travolta, still in mourning over the death of his teenage son earlier this year, issued a rare public statement urging fans to see his latest movie, ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" which he filmed last year. John Travolta stars as a villainous ex-inmate in ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" which opens in theaters Friday. ""I promise, you won't be disappointed,"" said Travolta, who plays a deranged ex-inmate who takes hostages on a New York subway. Travolta did not join co-star Denzel Washington in the promotional tour for the movie -- which hits theaters Friday -- because he said his family needed ""additional time to reconcile our loss.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A former State Department employee and his wife, who are accused of spying for Cuba for nearly 30 years, will remain in jail as they await trial, a judge ruled Wednesday. An artist's sketch shows Walter Kendall Myers, 72, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers, 71, in court Wednesday. Walter Kendall Myers, 72, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers, 71, are charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government, wire fraud and providing classified information to Havana, according to court documents. U.S. Magistrate John Facciola ordered the couple Wednesday held without bail after a prosecutor said they posed a flight risk. Investigators found a calendar showing that the couple planned to sail to the Caribbean in November, federal prosecutor Michael Harvey told the court. The two have the financial means to obtain false documents and flee to Cuba with their sailboat or through Mexico or Canada, he said. ""They are unworthy of this court's trust,"" Harvey added. The couple was quiet and expressionless during the proceedings Wednesday. Kendall Myers sat with his arms folded across his chest, while his wife sat with her arms at her side. They stared straight ahead, and did not appear to acknowledge anyone in the courtroom. A defense attorney urged the court to allow them to remain in their home, where they could visit with their children. ""You could disable the sailboat, freeze their funds and require ankle bracelets,"" Thomas Green said. The judge allowed the couple to meet briefly with their son after the court proceedings, but turned down the request to allow them to go home. He said he was concerned that the two would go to the Cuban Interests Section or the embassy of a country that has diplomatic relations with Cuba. Such a move would put them beyond the reach of federal law enforcement agencies. The State Department has not described what information the Myerses may have passed to their Cuban handlers, but said more information would come out after a full assessment. A senior State Department official said Kendall Myers was an ""upper-level civil service employee"" at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research who ""had come up in the ranks."" U.S. officials did not discuss the Myerses' motives for their alleged work for the Cuban government. Conviction on the wire fraud charge would carry a sentence of up to 20 years; illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government would carry a sentence of up to 10 years; and the conspiracy charge would carry a sentence of up to five years. Myers retired from the State Department on October 31, 2007. He had viewed more than 200 classified reports on Cuba in his final months, even though he was an analyst on European issues at the time, court documents say. The couple has been held without bail since pleading not guilty Friday. A future trial date has not been scheduled.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A legislative candidate was killed, along with his wife and two children, bringing campaigns for statewide offices in the southeastern state of Tabasco to a halt, the state-run news agency Notimex reported. PRI candidate Jose Francisco Fuentes Esperon was killed, along with his wife and their two sons. The bodies of Jose Francisco Fuentes Esperon, his wife and two young sons were found inside their home in the capital of Villahermosa on Saturday. According to local reports, Fuentes' wife was shot in the head, and the boys, ages 10 and 13, had been asphyxiated. Less clear was the candidate's fate. Some reports said that his body had signs of torture and had a wound on his neck, which may have been from a gunshot. As of Sunday, authorities had not released a motive for the crime, though speculation of a drug cartel hit or a robbery circulated in Tabasco. Fuentes' party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, immediately announced a campaign moratorium for all of its candidates for the state's October 18 elections. Other political parties followed suit. ""The PRI cannot go out at this moment and ask citizens for their vote when it finds itself with a broken heart because of the homicide of its candidate,"" Tabasco PRI director Adrian Hernandez Balboa said, according to Notimex. In response, the Tabasco state government offered all political candidates protection during their campaigns if they requested it, a statement from the office of Gov. Andres Granier Melo said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon called Granier to offer his condolences and show his support for the investigation, the statement said. The weekend slaying was not the first time an entire family has been killed in Tabasco. In February, a Tabasco police official who had arrested a drug trafficker a week earlier was killed together with his mother, wife, children and nieces and nephews. His brother, also a state police officer, was wounded, as were two others. The day before Fuentes and his family were killed, unknown gunmen fatally shot two state police officers in Villahermosa and injured two others.","Bodies of Jose Francisco Fuentes Esperon, wife and 2 sons found inside their home .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man arrested with his wife on anabolic steroid possession charges claimed to have sold steroids to professional hockey and baseball players in the District of Columbia, but the National Hockey League and Washington Capitals said Wednesday they doubted the allegation. Richard Thomas and his wife, Sandra, were arrested Tuesday night at their home in Lakeland, Florida. Richard Thomas, 35, told officers he sold the steroids to unidentified players on the NHL's Capitals and the Washington Nationals of baseball's National League, said Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida. ""Richard Thomas told us that he sold steroids to ballplayers on those teams,"" Judd said after the arrests late Tuesday night. ""Now, is that one ballplayer to two ballplayers? We don't know."" NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said the league would investigate the claim, but added that the Washington Capitals ""have no knowledge of any aspect of this allegation."" ""Capitals players were subjected to no-notice testing five separate times over the past two seasons pursuant to the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and there was no indication of any improper conduct or wrongdoing,"" Daly said in a statement issued Wednesday. A separate statement by Capitals president Dick Patrick said the team had ""no reason to believe there is any merit to this story,"" but would fully cooperate with the NHL's investigation. MLB.com, the Web site of Major League Baseball, reported Wednesday that the league would look into the allegation involving the Washington Nationals. The report posted on the Web site of the Washington Nationals quoted Nationals president Stan Kasten as saying the team knew nothing about the steroids claim, and that the league was handling it. Thomas and his wife, Sandra, 49, were arrested Tuesday night at their home in Lakeland, Florida, on 21 counts of possession of anabolic steroids, importation of anabolic steroids and maintaining a residence for drug sales, Judd said. He said the couple has been charged with 10 counts of steroid possession with intent to distribute, 10 counts of importing the drugs and one count of maintaining a residence for drug sales. According to Judd, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Philadelphia received information that the Florida couple would be receiving a shipment of steroids. Judd's office then obtained a search warrant for the Lakeland home, where officers found steroids from points outside the United States, including Iran, he said. The arrest report says Richard Thomas told officers he was ""the biggest steroids dealer in central Florida."" Bond for Richard and Sandra Thomas was set at $215,000 each, said Carrie Eleazer, spokeswoman for the Polk County Sheriff's Office, and Sandra Thomas was released on bail Wednesday afternoon. The two are scheduled to make an initial court appearance Thursday. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Couple arrested in central Florida on anabolic steroid possession charges .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Bone-dry conditions in an area that has not seen a major fire in more than 60 years pushed a Southern California wildfire from 45,000 acres to more than 100,000 acres in a matter of hours Monday, fire officials said. A charred fire truck sits at the bottom of a hill Monday near Acton, California. Two firefighters died in the vehicle. The Station fire, burning in Angeles National Forest north of Los Angeles, has forced thousands of evacuations and threatened thousands of structures -- including major communications installations on Mount Wilson, said Mike Dietrich, the U.S. Forest Service's incident commander. ""This is a very difficult firefight,"" Dietrich said. ""This is a very angry fire that we're fighting right now. Until we can get a change in weather conditions, I'm not overly optimist."" Weather forecasts show little change in conditions for the next four to five days. The fire, which has sent plumes of thick smoke spiraling as much as 20,000 feet into the air, is creating its own wind patterns, making it unpredictable, officials said.  See images of the wildfire » . ""This fire is headed just about anywhere it wants to right now,"" said Dietrich, who earlier said the blaze had ""a mind of its own."" Fire officials said Monday they had issued evacuation notices for residents of the 10,000 homes under threat. Nearly 100 homes were added to the notices Monday afternoon. But six people in the evacuation area had refused repeated requests to leave, said Commander David Fender, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's incident commander. ""There's six individuals, they're up there, they've been asked to leave three times,"" Fender said. ""They refuse to leave. That's their choice."" Earlier reports indicated the six were trapped at their Gold Canyon ranch and firefighters were unable to reach them, but Fender said he had no indication that was true. ""They've all shared that they do not want to leave,"" he said. The fire claimed the lives of two firefighters Sunday. Capt. Tedmund Hall, 47, and Specialist Arnaldo Quinones, 35, were killed when their vehicle went down a steep, 700-foot embankment, Dietrich said. Hall was with the department for 26 years and Quinones for eight years.  Watch a fire official give details on the ""tragic"" accident » . Dietrich said the blaze had destroyed two communications arrays in the area but had not flared up on Mount Wilson, home to 20 television and radio transmission towers, fire and police communications equipment and the Mount Wilson Observatory. That area is under a critical threat and a strike team is in position to protect the observatory. But, Dietrich stressed, ""My No. 1 priority is our firefighters' safety."" ""If they have to abandon the position, there's no facility that is worth a human life,"" he said. Despite the difficulties, Dietrich told reporters that firefighting teams ""will not rest until it's out.""

""I am confident in the state's response as these fires continue to burn throughout California."" The governor on Monday toured damage left in the wake of the 49 Fire in Placer County, in northern California. As of Monday, the fire had burned 275 acres and was 50 percent contained.

The Station fire started Wednesday and had destroyed 18 structures by Sunday. At least 10,000 homes, 500 businesses and 2,000 other structures are threatened by the fire, which exploded in size over the weekend, fueled by low humidity and high temperatures. Evacuations have been ordered for an unspecified number of residents. One of them was Elsa Aguirre, 57, who left her ranch home in Altadena, California, early Saturday. She, her husband and her cat were at a Red Cross shelter in a high school on Monday. Aguirre brought a box of mementos with her, including her mother's tea set from Argentina. ""The challenge is going to be going back to reality because I've been looking at the fire and the mountains from where I am,"" she said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Valentino Rossi is one of only a handful of champions in the modern era whose popularity has transcended their sport. As the Italian maestro closes in on an eighth world title, CNN charts the rise of the charismatic king of two wheels. Valentino Rossi celebrates his 102nd victory at the Brno Grand Prix in the Czech Republic. Born in Urbano, Italy in 1979, Valentino Rossi's achievements in the sport are nothing short of extraordinary. Eight world titles, 102 wins and over 150 podium finishes have already made him the most successful rider of all time. Rossi began racing karts as a ten-year-old, before moving to two wheels in 1992. Four years later in his first Grand Prix season he won -- aged seventeen -- at the Brno circuit in the Czech Republic in the 125cc World Championship. The following year he clocked up a record 321 points in winning his first 125cc World Championship title. 1998 was meant to be a learning year on the more powerful 250cc bikes, but Rossi finished second overall before going on to take the title the following season. His progress in the 500cc class in 2000 and 2001 followed an identical trajectory to that in Rossi's two seasons racing 250cc bikes. In 2002, he was crowned MotoGP champion in his first season, finishing 140 points clear of his nearest rival, one-time fight opponent and fellow countryman Max Biaggi.  Click here to view Rossi's career highlights » . Three more MotoGP titles -- including two for his new team Yamaha -- followed in succession. But when it seemed as if he was going to dominate MotoGP for the rest of the decade, Rossi experienced the first real blip in his career, crashing out of the final race of the 2006 season in Valencia. In the process, Rossi handed his rival -- American Nicky Hayden -- the title. A year later Rossi finished third. A poor season by his standards was compounded by the split from his long-term girlfriend Arianna Matteuzzi, a fall out with his manager Gibo Badioli and the Italian government chasing him for eye-watering amounts of unpaid taxes -- Rossi eventually coughed up an estimated $42 million. Rossi returned to winning ways in 2008 notching up his fifth world title and is on course for a sixth this year. He is affectionately known as ""The Doctor"" by his fans on account of his clinical overtaking maneuvers out on the track, but it's his wit and easy charm off it that have also helped propel him into the super league of sport's rich list. Rossi is famous for a succession of colorful and often playful helmet motifs which he rotates almost as much as his hairstyle underneath. His post race celebrations have taken in all manner of bizarre antics including chicken costumes -- he gave a lift to a man wearing one -- blow-up dolls and porta loos -- he visited one on a victory lap at the Spanish Grand Prix in Jerez this year. His skills on two wheels haven't gone unnoticed by the bosses at Ferrari's Formula One team. Rossi first tested a Ferrari in 2004 and he revealed this week that he spoke with Ferrari about the possibility of him replacing Luca Badoer in the upcoming Italian Grand Prix at Monza on September 13. But Rossi told Ferrari that he would prefer to concentrate on this year's MotoGP. With five rounds to go, Rossi is where he likes to be. In front. With 25 points separating him from his young rival and Yamaha teammate Jorge Lorenzo, few would back against the great man relinquishing his title come the season's end.","Italian legend is closing in on a ninth world title in 2009 and sixth MotoGP crown .

"(CNN) -- In a field largely still in its infancy, scientists are making headway toward using stem cells to treat heart ailments. The FDA regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials. The major focus of stem cell research in cardiology is promoting regeneration of the heart or preventing scar formation, said Jeffrey Karp, who runs a stem cell biology lab at Harvard University. One study reporting successful results in humans involves harvesting patients' own stem cells, purifying them, and injecting them directly into the heart muscle. The stem cells have a surface marker called CD34, which means they are capable of growing new blood vessels. The study, sponsored by Baxter Inc., is the largest adult stem cell study for  heart disease in the U.S., said Dr. Douglas Losordo, cardiologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, who is leading the trial. The researchers will present their one-year findings from Phase II of the trial in September, Losordo said. ""It's important to point out that this is a use of a patient's own body's repair capabilities,"" Losordo said. If everything goes well, it's conceivable this treatment could be widely available in a little over four years, he said. The target patient population, consisting of end-stage cardiac patients who have tried all other available therapies, is about 300,000 to 900,000 people, he said. So far, researchers have not found side effects from this method, Losordo said. However, because it is an invasive surgical procedure in which stem cells are delivered through a catheter, there is a risk of perforation of about 1 percent, he said. There is also a small risk of blood clotting from the drug, GCSF, which mobilizes stem cells. Injecting stem cells into the heart muscle carries the risk of arrhythmia, said Techung Lee, associate professor of biochemistry at the State University New York at Buffalo. But Losordo said this risk is theoretical in his trial, and is believed to be very low with CD34 cells in general. Lee and colleagues are working on a less-invasive technique. In a study in mice, they injected stem cells from bone marrow into skeletal muscles of limbs. They found that the stem cells produced growth factors that traveled to the heart, in addition to stimulating the muscle itself to make growth factors that also improved cardiac function. The challenge for translating this method to humans would be that, while each mouse needed only a few million stem cells, each human patient would need close to a billion stem cells for the therapy -- which would be far too expensive and logistically difficult. ""This is a problem that's been experienced by everyone in the field,"" Lee said. He estimates that his method could be available clinically in five years, after researchers find ways to reduce the required number of cells by a factor of 10 or even 100. Another therapeutic possibility is giving a patient an IV of stem cells, which would come from a stem cell bank or a company. The challenge is that the cells may not have the right homing receptors to land in the heart, Karp said. Karp's group is working on an approach to chemically modify the surface of cells to enhance their targeting to specific sites. Results from animal models have shown promising results for targeting sites of inflammation, he said. ""Essentially we know the ZIP code of vessels within a certain tissue, we can program the address on the surface of the cell,"" he said. Lee's and Karp's teams use adult mesenchymal stem cells, which may develop into connective tissue, lymphatic tissue, and blood vessels. These stem cells are largely interchangeable between patients and don't require matching, as organ transplants do. However, as more becomes known about the relatively new field of stem cell therapy, a more specific matching system may be required, said Dr. Joon Lee, cardiologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Some stem cell therapies for the heart are being tested in human clinical trials. Osiris Therapeutics Inc. is enrolling patients in a phase II trial for Prochymal, which contains mesenchymal stem cells. The company intends to use this drug, which gets injected into the vein, to repair heart damage in patients who have just experienced their first heart attack. More than 90 percent of research on using stem cells to repair the human heart involves adult stem cells, Lee said. That means the controversy about using stem cells derived from human embryos is largely absent from this line of research. For developing treatments that involve transplanting stem cells from adults, there is no ethical concern about the use of embryos, Lee said. Embryonic stem cells are advantageous in research because they can be grown more easily than adult stem cells in a culture, and are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into any of the various cell types of the body, according to the National Institutes of Health. But it is not yet known whether tissues derived from embryonic stem cells would cause transplant rejection, whereas this does not seem to be a problem with adult stem cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates which adult stem cell techniques are allowed to go into clinical trials and sets the requirements for more routine use. Whether the FDA will become more or less lenient in these respects is unclear, Lee said. It's not unfathomable that within the next two to five years, some FDA-approved stem cell treatments will be available for cardiovascular disease, Lee said. Karp has a longer view -- five to 10 years before stem cell treatments become widely available for heart problems, he said. The biology of stem cell treatments for the heart is not well understood, said Dr. Ronald Crystal, chief of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. One of the challenges is that once a stem cell gets put into a person's body, no one can get it out, Crystal said. This is the opposite of other kinds of medications -- for instance, a person may get sick from taking too many aspirin, but eventually the drug leaves the system. Not so with stem cells, he said. Crystal expressed general caution about the future of stem cell research, which is still experimental, for heart patients. ""This is a good idea, but patients and families should not expect immediate results,"" he said.","Most stem cell research targeted at the heart uses adult stem cells .
The FDA regulates adult stem cell techniques that are allowed to go into clinical trials .
Unlike organ transplants, adult stem cells generally can be given to any patient .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A wicked opportunity is brewing at Wookey Hole Caves in western England. Aspiring witches audition for the job Tuesday at Wookey Hole Caves in England. Applicants are flocking to the town of Wells in Somerset Tuesday in the hopes of being selected as the caves' new resident witch. With the promise of £50,000 ($82,000) per year, and a spacious cave to boot, more than 2,000 candidates are stashing their wart remover and grabbing their broomsticks to persuade a panel of judges to choose them. The winner will portray the notorious witch that is said to have haunted the caves in the Dark Ages. The witch lived in the cave with goats until an abbot threw holy water on her, turning her to stone, legend says. Locals say her frozen figure can still be seen in the caves today. Legend has it that the witch cursed crops, caused disease and soured milk in the area, audition organizers say. Today, the caves at Wookey Hole are part of a tourist attraction with rides, a circus, theme parks and restaurants. The company that runs it, Wookey Hole Ltd., pays the witch's salary on a year-long contract. The would-be witches have one minute to perform for the panel Tuesday, employing their best cackle and whatever props they can carry, organizers say. The position won't necessarily go to a woman; male and transgender witches are also invited to apply. Applicants are told they must, however, be knowledgeable in the history of witchcraft, be willing to travel, sleep overnight in caves, and cannot be allergic to cats. Organizers say they've had applications from men, women and 230 mothers-in-law.","Wookey Hole Caves in western England looking to hire a witch .

"(CNN) -- Members of the nation's oldest black sorority have accused the organization's president of using her sorority credit card for personal items and its board of directors of spending too much on her. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority President Barbara McKinzie denies the claims in the lawsuit against her. The suit alleges that the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority's board of directors signed off on spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on President Barbara McKinzie and commissioned an expensive wax figure of her. McKinzie denied the allegations, saying they are ""without merit."" The most ""outlandish representation"" in the lawsuit, she said, is the allegation that the sorority spent $900,000 on a wax figure of her. Two wax figures -- one of McKinzie and one of the sorority's first president, the late Nellie Quander -- were purchased by the hostess chapters of the sorority's centennial convention last year, not the national AKA organization, for a total of $45,000, McKinzie said. The lawsuit says the sorority's board of directors approved the use of $900,000 for the wax likeness of McKinzie ahead of the centennial celebration. Edward W. Gray Jr., an attorney representing the plaintiffs, acknowledged that the sorority disputes the lawsuit's account of the statue's price tag. However, he said, ""we have no way of knowing what the actual number was. We hope that it was as little as they say."" He added that $45,000 is still a large amount of money, although, ""certainly, it's a lot better than $900,000."" He called the alleged conduct ""shocking and bordering on illegal."" The wax figures are to appear in the National Great Blacks in Wax museum in Baltimore, Maryland, according to AKA. The museum said they are on a traveling exhibit. The lawsuit, filed last month in a Washington superior court, also accuses McKinzie of using her sorority credit card for ""designer clothing, lingerie, jewelry, gifts and other excessive and inappropriate expenses of a personal nature."" It demands that the sorority fire McKinzie and the board of directors and that the alleged damages be repaid. The lawsuit says that by using her credit card for personal purchases, as well as for ""properly reimbursed expenditures,"" McKinzie amassed American Express points, which she then redeemed for a 46-inch television and gym equipment. It also says that the sorority's board of directors had agreed on compensation for McKinzie without the approval of the sorority's policy-making body. The compensation, it says, included a $4,000-a-month stipend that McKinzie is to receive for four years after she leaves office. The board of directors also voted to buy a $1 million life insurance policy for McKinzie, a purchase that was also not approved by the policy-making body, the lawsuit says. McKinzie denied the accusations. ""Allegations about personal use of AKA funds are false and unsupported by the organization's audited books,"" she said. The ""malicious allegations leveled against AKA by former leaders are based on mischaracterizations and fabrications not befitting our ideals of sisterhood, ethics and service."" The lawsuit also blames McKinzie and Betty James, the executive director for the organization's corporate office, for financial decisions they made for the sorority. The sorority's claimed deductions on its federal tax returns in 2006 and 2007 were ""unreasonably large and inappropriate, thus exposing the sorority to potential IRS claims and obligations,"" the suit says. Furthermore, the sorority's policy-making body has not approved McKinzie's investment philosophy, which ""has caused the shifting of several million dollars of the sorority and foundation funds from cash and cash equivalents to stock and bond investments."" McKinzie said in her statement that under her leadership, ""accounting and budgetary practices have been tightened, erasing past IRS liabilities and cost overruns."" In addition to McKinzie, James and the sorority, the lawsuit names other members of the board of directors and the AKA Educational Advancement Foundation Inc. as defendants. AKA was founded in 1908 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","Alpha Kappa Alpha members say board OK'd $900,000 for wax figure of president .

The judge ruled Mohammad el-Gharani was not an enemy combatant and directed the military ""to take all necessary and appropriate diplomatic steps to facilitate the release"" of el-Gharani from the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. El-Gharani, now 21, was among the first terrorism suspects and enemy fighters sent to the U.S. military prison camp. His arrival in 2002 came after he was seized by Pakistanis at a mosque and transferred to the U.S.-led coalition. He has been in custody since. El-Gharani's lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, demanding the government justify its continued detention or release him. Details of his case have not been widely released, but his lawyer said he was accused of working with al Qaeda 10 years ago, at age 11. The court ruling also alleges el-Gharani, a citizen of Chad, was an al Qaeda courier and participated in the battle of Tora Bora in late 2001 in Afghanistan. But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon noted serious questions were raised about another detainee who implicated el-Gharani. Leon said that given the ""substantial and troubling uncertainties regarding petitioner's conduct and whereabouts prior to his detention by Pakistani forces, the [U.S.] government has failed to establish a preponderance of the evidence"" that el-Gharani was an al Qaeda agent. The judge gave no timetable on when the suspect -- also called Yousef -- must be freed. Under U.S. and international policy, he could not be sent to a country where he might face torture or severe physical mistreatment. The Bush administration has said it has had difficulties finding countries willing to take many Guantanamo prisoners awaiting release. El-Gharani's lawyers have alleged mistreatment by his captors, including cigarette burns and verbal abuse. Court records allege he was a native of Saudi Arabia who left that country around 2001 and moved to Pakistan. He denied that he was fleeing the fighting in Afghanistan when he was captured across the border in Pakistan. Another Guantanamo detainee, Canadian Omar Khadr, was 14 or 15 when he was captured six years ago. Military prosecutors formally charged him in April 2007 with killing Sgt. Christopher James Speer, a U.S. soldier whose reconnaissance patrol was ambushed in Afghanistan in 2002. The American died nearly two weeks later. Khadr and el-Gharani remain among the youngest of Guantanamo's approximately 250 prisoners. The civil case is el-Gharani v. Bush (05-429).","Mohammad el-Gharani, now 21, not an enemy combatant, U.S. judge rules .

"(CNN) -- Yemenia Airways is canceling all its flights between Yemen and the Comoros Islands after this week's crash on the same route, the airline said Saturday. Bahia Bakari holds her father's hand as she lies on a stretcher in a plane after landing in France. One more flight between Sanaa and Moroni is scheduled for Sunday, but all flights on the route are canceled after that, Yemenia said. A Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. One person, 13-year-old French girl Bahia Basari, survived for hours in the Indian Ocean clinging to the debris of the downed plane. She arrived home in France on Thursday, where she was reunited with her father.  Watch teen survivor from crash » . She is the only known survivor from the crash, which killed her mother. The Airbus 310 plane tried to land at the airport in Moroni, then made a U-turn before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. The Comoros Islands are between the east African country of Tanzania and the island nation of Madagascar. French and U.S. divers are helping to search for debris and bodies. The French military has detected a rescue beacon, but rescue workers say the wreckage is difficult to reach in deep waters. The plane's data recorders have yet to be found, said Capt. Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Qadir, a spokesman for Yemen's civil aviation department.","Teenage girl only person to survive plane crash off Comoros islands .

"(CNN)  -- The Brazilian military said late Friday it is calling off the search for bodies of passengers and crew from the Air France plane that crashed into the Atlantic earlier this month. Wreckage from Flight 447 spotted by search teams in the Atlantic last week. It was unlikely that any more bodies would be found, the military said. So far, search teams have found 51 of the 228 people who died when Air France Flight 447 plunged into the sea June 1, according to the military. They have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, the military said. The bodies were handed to Brazilian authorities for identification while the debris and luggage were given to French aviation investigators, the military said. In the 26 days of the search operation, the Brazilian air force used 12 planes along with aircraft from France, the United States and Spain, the military said. The Brazilian navy used 11 ships. Ships remain in the search area hundreds of miles northeast of Brazil in an effort to find the flight data recorders, the Brazilian military said. Last week investigators said they were running out of time to find the recorders which could prove crucial to working out what caused the disaster. Officials remain in the dark about what caused the airliner to plunge into the sea off the coast of Brazil. The wreckage is believed to be about 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) deep, amid underwater mountains and mixed in with tons of sea trash. A French submarine and other vessels are searching for black boxes by attempting to trace their locator beacons, which send out acoustic pulses, or ""pings,"" to searchers. The U.S. Navy has contributed two high-tech acoustic devices -- known as towed pinger locators -- which have been attached to French tug boats and can search to a maximum depth of 20,000ft (6,100 meters). The firm which makes the recorders, Honeywell Aerospace, has told CNN it has a 100 percent recovery record from air accidents. Honeywell said it was hard to estimate how much battery life the locator beacon on the recorders had, as it depended on the conditions, but it is typically around 30 days. One recorder taped radio transmissions and sounds in the cockpit, such as the pilot's voices and engine noises. Sounds of interest could be engine noise, stall warnings, landing gear extension and retraction, and other clicks and pops. From these sounds engine revs per minute, system failures, speed and the time at which certain events occurred could often be determined, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. CNN's Claudia Dominguez in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Brazilian military: Unlikely that any more bodies would be found .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The parent company of a security contractor said Thursday it is ""fully cooperating"" in the investigation of allegations that the contractor allowed mistreatment, sexual activity and intimidation within the ranks of private guards hired to protect the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. A spokeswoman for a watchdog group says hazing at a camp for security guards went ""well beyond partying."" The allegations came to light earlier this week when the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and briefed reporters on its findings, which it said were based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul. The company, ArmorGroup, North America, has a security contract with the State Department to provide services through July 2010. Wackenhut Services Inc., the corporate parent of ArmorGroup, e-mailed a statement on Thursday in response to questions about ArmorGroup's private guards in Kabul. ""Our contract with the Department of State requires us to refer all questions to the Department of State, director of public affairs. We are fully cooperating with the DOS in the investigation of the recent incidents referred to in the letter from"" Project On Government Oversight, said the statement, sent by Wackenhut Services spokeswoman Susan Pitcher. On Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy said it was taking the allegations very seriously. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of all Embassy personnel -- Americans and Afghan -- and respect for the cultural and religious values of all Afghans,"" the embassy said. ""We have taken immediate steps to review all local guard force policies and procedures and have taken all possible measures to ensure our security is sound."" The watchdog group said it began receiving whistleblower-style e-mails two weeks ago, some with graphic images and videos, that are said to document problems taking place at a nonmilitary camp for the guards near the U.S. diplomatic compound in Kabul. ""This is well beyond partying,"" Danielle Brian, executive director of Project On Government Oversight, told reporters earlier this week after showing a video of a man with a bare backside and another man apparently drinking a liquid that had been poured down the man's lower back. She said that ranking supervisors were ""facilitating this kind of deviant hazing and humiliation, and requiring people to do things that made them feel really disgusted."" In the letter Project On Government Oversight sent to Clinton, Brian wrote that the problems are ""posing a significant threat to the security of the embassy and its personnel."" Among the recommendations from the group: immediate military supervision of the private security guards, a review of whether the contract should be revoked and consideration as to whether government forces should replace private security in a combat zone.

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho has admitted he was left angered by the decision to sell Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona, although the Inter Milan coach reveals he is delighted to welcome Samuel Eto'o to the San Siro. Jose Mourinho believes Inter Milan have done good business in selling Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona. Inter are on the verge of completing a deal which will see them receive 45 million euros ($64m) plus Eto'o for Ibrahimovic after both players agreed terms with their prospective clubs. Mourinho knows it will be a blow to lose last year's leading goalscorer in Serie A but, speaking about the deal for the first time, admitted it is a fantastic bit of business. ""I was a bit angry because no coach is happy to lose Ibrahimovic,"" the Portuguese told Sky Italia. ""But no one is not happy to have Eto'o -- we have lost a top player but we have taken another one. If I talk as a coach and a man on the pitch, I say that I don't want to lose this player. If I talk as a manager, I say that Inter have done great business,"" added Mourinho. Mourinho feels Ibrahimovic will adapt to life at the Nou Camp in no time but insists he would not make a similar move. ""He had this dream and wanted to go,"" added the Nerazzurri coach. ""He told me he would miss me and I told him exactly the same thing. He's going to a club in which I worked for four years, Barcelona are an extraordinary club and he will be happy. ""I didn't give him any advice but I spoke to him a few days before the final decision. I told him that if he wins the Champions League with Barcelona he won't be doing anything extraordinary, seeing as they have won it twice in three years. I like doing something extraordinary, not what's normal.""","Jose Mourinho angered by the decision to sell Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Barcelona .

"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) -- Bjorn Ulvaeus was one half of the songwriting genius behind Swedish pop legend ABBA. After the band split up in 1982 Ulvaeus turned his talents to writing musicals, including ""Mamma Mia,"" now a blockbuster movie. Bjorn Ulvaeus on the ABBA phenomenon: ""I'm amazed how this could happen. I'm just grateful and humble."" He took My City_My Life on a tour of his home town of Stockholm and talked about his past and future as pop royalty. CNN: What is the secret of ABBA's success? Bjorn Ulvaeus: I think the secret behind the fact that our songs are still around and that ABBA became so big is a lot of factors together. But one of them was definitely that we put so much effort into song writing. We hardly ever toured, we just wrote and wrote and produced the records over a period of seven or eight years. So it's the songs, plus I think the two girls, the voices -- the blend was unique and very special. CNN: Where did get the inspiration for your songs? BU: Well mostly in song writing my experience is that there isn't so much inspiration as hard work. You sit there for hours, days and weeks with a guitar and piano until something good comes. But the urge to write is something you have to have. A conviction, an ambition to write and never stop until you think, ""This is the best I can do."" Watch Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . CNN: What drives you? BU: In my career the push has always been to take another step, to try something new. That means that after ABBA, when we split up in 1982, we were onto writing a musical [""Chess""] because we hadn't done that before. CNN: How do you feel about working in the theater? BU: Every time I sit in the audience and watch a show that I have been involved with, it is such an amazing feeling to see all those people around me, knowing they are actually watching and enjoying something I have written. That is such a feeling of pure joy that never goes away and that's why I guess I'm so attracted to work in the theater. CNN: How did ""Mamma Mia! The Movie"" come about? BU: When you have a big hit on the West End and on Broadway with a musical, as we had with ""Mamma Mia,"" there is always the question, ""when are you going to do the movie?"" Some people say you shouldn't do it until the actual stage musical is on its last legs, but I don't think that matters. We had been on Broadway for seven or eight years and eight or nine in the West End and we thought now is the time to make that movie. CNN: How has Stockholm changed over the years? BU: A city like Stockholm, being so dynamic and following trends, develops all the time. It's gradually changing but you can hardly see that. It is changing in a very healthy way that cities should change. CNN: How would you describe Stockholm in a few words? BU: Stockholm is unique in the world in that it's built on, I think, 14 islands. There are so many bridges and it doesn't have any high-rise buildings to speak of. It's quite spread out and open and airy with lots of parks. See photos of Bjorn Ulvaeus in Stockholm » . CNN: Let's talk about the cultural scene in Stockholm. BU: There is a very vibrant cultural scene in Stockholm. There are lots of places where there are concerts and there are loads of museums and theaters. There is everything really, and eventually there is going to be an ABBA museum as well. CNN: When will that happen? BU: I don't know -- I like to be arm's length when it comes to a museum about oneself. Other people should do that. CNN: That's quite a Swedish trait... BU: A lot of Swedes are quite modest and unassuming. I think that's actually the closest you can get to a national trait, if there is one. CNN: How does it feel that people from different generations are still enjoying ABBA songs? BU: In a way I'm kind of a bystander looking at this phenomenon that is ABBA, which is still around, and that I thought would be finished in 1981 and forgotten. I'm amazed how this could happen and I don't know why it happened. I'm just grateful and humble. I just sit back and enjoy. CNN: What would you like your legacy to be? BU: I would like for my children to feel that what I left behind was something that I did whole heartedly and with honesty, and something that was the best I could do and hopefully that they too can enjoy.","Bjorn Ulvaeus is half of the songwriting pair behind Swedish pop legend ABBA .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday called on the state bar to overlook a technical error and allow a paralyzed law school graduate to take the bar exam next week. Arnold Schwarzenegger says a technical error shouldn't stop the law school graduate from taking the bar exam. ""It is outrageous that someone who has overcome so much in life is penalized by a bureaucratic error that prevents her from taking the bar exam next week,"" the governor said in a statement. ""Government should work for the people, not against them, and I'm calling on the state bar to allow Sara Granda to take next week's test. Sara is a fighter, and I am with her all the way."" The state bar's Web site never processed Granda's application for Tuesday's test because California's Department of Rehabilitation paid her $600 fee with a check, according to the Sacramento Bee. The Web site requires a credit card number, but Granda said she was assured by a state bar representative that she was properly registered with the check, the newspaper reported. Granda, 29, a University of California-Davis Law School graduate, has petitioned the California Supreme Court to allow her to take Tuesday's test. She said she was ""surprised"" to hear about Schwarzenegger's statement in her defense. ""I'm not used to a lot of attention,"" she told CNN television affiliate KCRA. She said she went to the governor's office last week, ""but they wouldn't let me in."" ""So I knew there was no way that the governor was going to get involved,"" she said. Granda was paralyzed from the neck down after a car accident in 1997, when she was 17. The accident happened a month before she was to attend California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, on a full scholarship, according to the Sacramento Bee. Granda, who has been studying 11 hours a day for the bar exam with the help of assistants, said she wants the state of California to resolve the matter because it spent about $100,000 for her education. ""I worked very, very hard for every cent,"" she told KCRA. ""So for everything to come together in the end and for it to just kind of fall through on such a minor, minor detail.""","Bar's Web site didn't process Sara Granda's payment to take bar exam .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson. Debbie Rowe will not pursue custody of the children she bore with Michael Jackson, a lawyer says. The agreement does not involve any financial payments to Rowe ""apart from the continuation of spousal support payments"" that Michael Jackson personally agreed to make to Rowe after their divorce, the lawyers said. Rowe will get visitation rights with the children and the ""timing, frequency and manner of visits shall be implemented according to the best interests of the children, as determined by a child psychologist selected jointly, and paid jointly,"" by Jackson and Rowe, the announcement said. Rowe never publicly said if she would fight Jackson's 79-year-old mother for custody of her son and daughter -- ages 11 and 12 -- and a court hearing concerning custody was delayed several times this month while lawyers for the two talked. Jackson's youngest child, 7, was carried by a surrogate mother, whose name has not yet been released. Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of the three children soon after his death last month.  Learn about other notable custody cases » . The agreement must be approved by the judge. A custody hearing is set for Monday before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff. Beckloff will also hear arguments Monday about Jackson's estate and who will control it. Katherine Jackson is asking the court for more involvement in the estate's business.  Watch what may have happened in Jackson's final hours » . Jackson family lawyer Londell McMillan said the family was pleased the custody matter was ""resolved and was handled in a caring, thoughtful and courteous manner by the parties and their representatives."" ""We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page,"" McMillan said. ""Accordingly, although important issues had to be resolved, this was no legal contest but rather simply a process (of) doing the right thing for the right reasons."" Rowe's lawyer, Eric George, said the women and their lawyers ""engaged in a dignified discussion that resulted in a dignified outcome."" ""The sole consideration between the parties was the best interests of the children,"" George said. ""I'm proud to have worked with such professionals who represented Ms. Jackson, and I am particularly proud of Deborah for her integrity and selflessness."" Efforts to resolve who will control Jackson's estate have not been so amicable. Earlier this month, Beckloff granted temporary control to the executors named in his 2002 will: John Branca, Jackson's longtime personal attorney, and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime friend. McMillan, in a statement issued Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will. But, he said, she wanted the judge to order the executors to disclose information about what he said was ""a suspicious circle of relationships"" involving them. He said the executors ""have either denied Mrs. Jackson access to critical information or insisted on ... onerous and unreasonable restrictions"" to information about deals they are making on behalf of the estate. McMillan, in an interview with CBS Thursday, estimated the Jackson estate was worth $2 billion, while the executors have estimated in court that its value is around $500 million. The will placed all assets into a family trust benefiting his mother, his three children and unnamed charities. Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death on June 25. ""They read the news on the Web and the reports,"" McMillan said. ""I really tried to push the media to be responsible in how they try to handle this matter because there are three precious children involved."" The oldest child -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., more commonly known as Prince Michael -- was born in February 1997. A daughter -- Paris Michael Katherine Jackson -- was born the next year. Details of how the children were conceived -- and who was the biological father -- have been closely guarded amid much public speculation. The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents. Jackson later agreed to additional support. Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children. A California appeals court later ruled her rights were improperly terminated, opening the door to a possible custody battle.

"(Budget Travel) -- Just a two-hour detour from Paris, the Loire was once a playground to Renaissance royals. Now its vaunted châteaux are attracting enterprising young couples and artists who have remade them into captivating -- and surprisingly affordable -- inns. Surrounded by 10-foot-high limestone walls, Le Clos d'Amboise offers an unexpected sanctuary in the town of Amboise. CHINON . Hôtel Diderot . ""If you've never eaten a brioche with fresh Ste. Maure goat cheese, honey and walnuts for breakfast, then you haven't been to the Loire,"" says Laurent Dutheil, who is justifiably proud of the simple breakfasts he serves at his 23-room hotel in the western corner of the valley. Dutheil also produces dozens of fragrant artisanal jams such as apple-lavender and quince-cinnamon. (Sadly, they aren't for sale, but you can buy Dutheil's recipe book, ""Jam in the Cupboard."") The traditional foods fit well with the hotel's venerable atmosphere: Diderot is housed in a sprawling 15th-century home that the Chinon-born Dutheil, along with his two sisters, Martine and Francoise, bought and renovated six years ago. Budget Travel: See the hotels . Dutheil tackled structural issues, taking care to keep the exposed oak beams and original stone walls intact, while his sisters refurbished the rooms with cheerful striped wallpaper, toile bedding, and 19th-century armoires they scavenged on trips to Paris. The largest room, which sleeps four, has double windows with views of a courtyard. In the distance lie vineyards full of the red Chinon grapes much loved by 16th-century novelist and satirist François Rabelais. 4 rue de Buffon, 011-33/2-47-93-18-87, hoteldiderot.com, rooms from $72. THÉSÉE . Le Moulin de la Renne . A tunnel of towering fir trees leads to the entrance of this converted 19th-century mill in Thésée, on the banks of the Cher River. Guests are greeted by an enormous Bernese mountain dog named Alpha and his equally friendly owners, Véronique and Christophe Villanfin. There are 13 guest rooms, decorated with items such as embroidered quilts and framed puzzles of boats assembled by jigsaw fanatic Véronique. Jazz enthusiasts, the Villanfins host occasional concerts featuring local groups, including Les Bras'Coeurs, a quartet that performs Georges Brassens standards. The soirees are held in the restaurant, known locally for its coq au vin: rooster stewed in cabernet bottled at Le Chai des Varennes winery next door. 11 route de Vierzon, 011-33/2-54-71-41-56, moulindelarenne.com, closed Jan. 10--Feb. 10 and 10 days in Nov., rooms from $76, entrées from $15.75. CIVRAY-DE-TOURAINE . Château de l'Isle . The Château de l'Isle is quiet to the core -- unless you count the chorus of quacks coming from the duck pond on the 35-acre grounds. The 18th-century manor house had been abandoned for 10 years when Denis Gandon bought it in 1986 and transformed the place into a 12-room hotel. Still, the château somehow feels like a private home: A portrait of Gandon's grandfather hangs over a 100-year-old antique table in the dining area, and an amiable Jack Russell terrier entertains guests with endless rounds of fetch. The stylish bedrooms have exposed wood beams and beds draped with coverlets in shades of crimson and marigold. Budget Travel: See the hotels . In the summer, breakfast is served in an expansive glassed-in terrace overlooking the garden. A nearby potager (or kitchen garden) supplies produce for some of chef Fabrice Cherioux's breakfast treats, such as a zesty tomato confiture. 1 rue de l'Ecluse, 011-33/2-47-23-63-60, chateau-de-lisle.com, rooms from $69, breakfast $13. CHENONCEAUX . La Roseraie . This 18-room hotel in Chenonceaux was a must-stay on the itineraries of political notables after World War II, when the Allies were trying to figure out how to piece Europe back together. Winston Churchill, Harry Truman and Eleanor Roosevelt all, at one time or another, laid their heads at La Roseraie. (A letter from Roosevelt still hangs in the breakfast room.) In 2000, Sophie and Laurent Fiorito acquired the property and completed a top-to-bottom renovation. There is no such thing as a standard room here -- tiny singles have just enough space for a twin bed, while one suite fits a family of five. The decor is equally varied. One room has a Louis Philippe-style dresser and a crystal chandelier; another shows off a modern pink-checkered sofa. The hotel's best asset is its proximity (a five-minute walk) to Château de Chenonceau, which Henri II gave to his beloved mistress, Diane de Poitiers; the massive 16th-century building hovers over the River Cher. 7 rue du Docteur Bretonneau, 011-33/2-47-23-90-09, hotel-chenonceau.com, closed Nov.--Jan. and Mar., rooms from $85. AMBOISE . Le Clos d'Amboise . Surrounded by 10-foot-high limestone walls, in the heart of the old market center of Amboise, this 17-room mansion inn offers an unexpected sanctuary from the town's bustling, narrow streets. The bedrooms come equipped with decorative elements such as mahogany four-poster beds and original fireplaces, while the common room features wood floors modeled after those at the Palace of Versailles. Most of the rooms overlook the hotel's private park, landscaped with 100-year-old magnolias and a pine tree that survived the French Revolution. A pool by the rose garden is perfect for a cool dip after relaxing in the wood sauna, housed in a former stable. Just a 10-minute stroll from the hotel stands the riverside castle that belonged to King François I -- part medieval fortress, part Renaissance royal house. The king became famously enthralled by Leonardo da Vinci during a 1515 excursion to Italy, and he set up the painter in a gabled redbrick château (now a museum), just down the road from his castle. 27 rue Rabelais, 011-33/2-47-30-10-20, leclosamboise.com, closed Dec.--Jan., rooms from $98. LIMERAY . Auberge de Launay . Between the two of them, François and Hélène Thévard have honed their hospitality skills at some of the world's most well-respected hotels, including Le Meurice in Paris and the Savoy in London. After years helping manage other people's properties, the couple -- with their two small kids, Emma and Alexandre -- packed up their Paris apartment and bought an unassuming farmhouse in the secluded hamlet of Limeray to convert to a 15-room inn. ""I grew up in the region, so when we made the decision to open our own place, I knew that I had to come back to the Loire,"" says François. In keeping with the spare design of the house, the decor at the Auberge is simple -- bedrooms are outfitted with neutral suede sofas, blond-wood floors and minimalist photographs of daisies and landscapes. The duo oversees the daily lunch and dinner service at the on-site restaurant, which serves local specialties such as butter-poached Loire eel and chicken with mustard cream. The house dessert, a salted-caramel fruit tart, is baked with apples picked in the hotel's orchard. Le Haut Chantier, 011-33/2-47-30-16-82, aubergedelaunay.com, closed Dec. 15--Jan. 15, rooms from $72, two-course dinner from $26. ONZAIN . Château des Tertres . This mansion in the heart of the Loire once belonged to the mother of novelist Marguerite Duras (who mentions the château in her famous work ""The Lover""). Later, in the 1960s, its marble hallways were filled with students from a nearby engineering school, which used the building as a dorm. In 1992, another curious owner took over management of the 14-room château: Bernard Valois, an artist who kept the mansion's 19th-century detailing (high ceilings, gilded mirrors) but added contemporary design flourishes, such as a photograph of a mysterious pair of eyes in the foyer. Last year, Valois and his wife, Christine, redecorated a former gatekeeper's house as a contemporary four-room cottage with knockoff Jackson Pollock paintings and sculptures that resemble enormous eggs. ""My husband likes to turn things that seem ordinary into the extraordinary,"" Christine says. ""He designed a 'Sputnik' bidet that has Japanese robots stationed around the tank."" Valois also tends a 12-acre garden of roses and clematises, where guests can find a shed stocked with complimentary bikes for exploring the area's 186 miles of riding paths. 11 rue de Meuves, 011-33/2-54-20-83-88, chateau-tertres.com, closed Oct. 19-Apr. 1, rooms from $94. CHITENAY . Auberge du Centre . When Gilles Martinet's grandmother found herself widowed at the end of World War I, she started selling milk and eggs to make ends meet. One thing led to another, and her home eventually became a guesthouse and restaurant specializing in French country fare, like chicken sautéed in fresh cider.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It's Geek Pride Week in Atlanta as thousands of fans take over four downtown hotels for Dragon*Con, an annual celebration of science fiction, fantasy, comics and gaming. Karen Lee and husband Dillan dressed like comic book characters for Dragon*Con in Atlanta, Georgia. Where else -- OK, other than San Francisco or New Orleans -- are city streets shut down for a ragtag parade of zombies, superheroes, robots, Klingons and Middle Earth dwellers? Where else can comic book collectors rub shoulders with movie stars, vampires, alternate-history speculators and Harry Potter look-alikes, all while taking part in a lively game of Godzilla Bingo? The whole thing is a bit of a shock to college football fans in town for the season-opening game between Alabama and Virginia Tech, one of whom called it a ""freak show."" But those aliens grow on you after a while. ""At first I thought it was really strange,"" Hokies fan Emily Nardone of Ashburn, Virginia, said. ""But now I see everybody's having so much fun. And I enjoy looking at the freaks."" One Dragon*Con ""freak"" getting a lot of looks was Karen Lee of Cullman, Alabama. She was dressed a dramatic, cleavage-baring winged costume inspired by ""Dawn"" comic book artist Joseph Michael Linsner. Lee made the costume by hand at home. ""My living room is completely demolished,"" she said. Her husband, Dillan, made up as the Batman character Two-Face, said he could attest to the condition of the living room. Lee is entered in a Dawn look-alike contest with a top prize of $1,000. ""The theory behind the concept of Dawn is just paying homage to women of all shapes and sizes,"" she said. ""She can be blonde, brunette or redhead. So basically, it's just inviting women to get up there and do their interpretation of what they think beauty in women is."" iReport.com: Share your pics and videos from Dragon*Con . Fashion augmented with gadgetry is what drew Pendleton, South Carolina, librarians Gypsey Teague and Marla Roberson to a Dragon*Con workshop on Steampunk costuming. Steampunk is sci-fi set in a Victorian aesthetic. Think pearl-handled, brass-barreled ray guns. The movies ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""Wild Wild West"" are examples of the genre. ""Anything your imagination can come up with, you can do,"" Roberson said as she marveled at a vendor's shoes that had little copper boilers and compasses on them. But it seems there's a certain element of snobbery in Steampunk. A crew of Steampunk pirates entered the room, decked out in their tricorn hats and eye patches. Teague was not impressed. ""Where's your molecular destabilizer?"" she sniffed. Out in the hallway, Steampunk time travelers Candace and Kane Bacon were just arriving. They're new to the game, but Kane had a copper staff with dials on top and a big metal backpack with dials and knobs strapped to his back. A large brass key dangled from the sash around Candace's waist, and she carried a basket of dinosaur eggs they'd found. ""Some of it we had just [lying] around the house, antique stuff,"" Candace said. ""Other parts we got from Lowe's. The backpack is made from radio parts; my dad is in the radio business, and he got some old radio parts for us. And yard sale gadgets.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Latino immigrants living in Suffolk County, New York, have been living in an environment of intolerance and attacks against them, a report released Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center said. The atmosphere of intolerance is stoked in part by anti-immigrant groups, an indifferent police department, and county leaders themselves, according to the report. The law center, which researches and keeps tabs on hate groups, became interested in the Long Island county after the November 8, 2008, murder of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorian immigrant in Patchogue, New York. Prosecutors allege that the killers were a group of teenagers who targeted Latinos as part of a sport they called ""beaner-hopping."" After four months of research in Suffolk County that included interviews with more than 70 Latino immigrants, 30 local religious leaders and other community leaders, the law center said it found a pattern of ethnic intolerance going back 10 years. Low-level harassment of Latinos in Suffolk County is common, the report said. ""They are regularly taunted, spit upon and pelted with apples, full soda cans, beer bottles and other projectiles,"" the report said. Latino residents riding bikes have been run off the road and others have been beaten with baseball bats or shot at with BB guns, the report said. ""Our feeling is that what we found is really the tip of a very ugly iceberg,"" Mark Potok, who edited the report, said at a news conference Wednesday. ""We were told stories that are absolutely hair-raising."" The findings point to a disturbing larger trend, the report said. The situation in Suffolk ""is a microcosm of a problem facing the entire United States, where FBI statistics suggest a 40 percent rise in anti-Latino hate crimes between 2003 and 2007,"" the report said. Tuesday night in Patchogue, the same city where Lucero was killed, a church frequented by Latinos was vandalized with anti-Mexican graffiti, Potok said. The climate of fear in Suffolk County was created in part by anti-immigration voices that found sympathetic ears in the area, according to the report. Anti-immigrant groups, such as the now-defunct Sachem Quality of Life, ""heavily influenced the tone for public discourse on immigration in the area,"" the report said. This stance was adopted by county leaders themselves, the law center said. In August 2001, county legislator Michael D'Andre said that if his community were ""attacked"" by Latino day laborers, ""we'll be up in arms; we'll be out with baseball bats."" In March 2007, another county legislator, Elie Mystal, said of Latino day laborers looking for work, ""If I'm living in a neighborhood and people are gathering like that, I would load my gun and start shooting, period."" Both men later apologized for their remarks, according to news reports. Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy, who was also criticized in the report for employing measures seen as anti-immigrant, responded to the report Wednesday with a list of facts he says were distorted or taken out of context by the law center. For instance, a statement in the report that raids evicted day laborers from their homes in Suffolk County was distorted, Levy's office said. The action in question affected a condemned house where 60 people were living in hazardous conditions, the statement said. The law center's contention that Levy tried to downplay the significance of the Lucero murder was a misrepresentation of a comment the executive made to a reporter, the statement said. The law center report also said Latinos who had suffered harassment and crimes against them seldom reported them to police because they seemed indifferent. ""Many said police did not take their reports of attacks seriously, often blaming the victim instead,"" the report said. The law center recommended that police receive training to take hate-motivated crimes more seriously, and that area leaders avoid language that could be conducive to inciting violence against immigrants.","New York county studied by Southern Poverty Law Center after slaying .

"(CNN)  -- A motorized parachute crashed into a crowd at a Labor Day festival in Hooper, Utah, injuring at least six people, including children, authorities said. Spectators scatter as a motorized parachute plummets Monday in Hooper, Utah. The parachute was operated by a man and his son who were on the aircraft, but neither was injured when it dropped to the ground amid spectators. Scores of people had gathered Monday for what was to have been a candy drop from the motorized parachute, according to Lt. Lonnie Eskelson of the Weber County, Utah, Sheriff's Department. Video from the incident showed the small craft in the air, approaching the crowd, when it quickly lost altitude and came down as spectators ran for safety. Spectator Damon Martin said the crowd was waiting for the scheduled candy drop when the wind picked up.  Watch vehicle slam into crowd » . The motorized parachute ""gets just over the field, they start dropping the candy and all of a sudden he starts to descend real quick.

"(CNN)  -- Iran's supreme leader blamed enemies and outsiders on Monday for the turmoil that followed last month's presidential elections, according to an Iranian news agency. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused the West on Monday of meddling in Iran's affairs. To a gathering in Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused Western governments of having ""clearly meddled in the internal affairs of Iran"" and the American and European media of depicting Iranians ""as rioters,"" according to Fars News Agency. He warned that meddling from presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers would hurt those nations' relations with Iran, according to Fars. He said Iranians would see through the ""lies"" of Western governments and ""know that your objective is to create doubt amongst them and propagate hate against the system of the Islamic Republic."" While ""disappointment and sorrow"" from voters when their candidate lost the June 12 election was ""natural,"" Khamenei said, he condemned involvement by ""outsiders"" in the civil unrest that gripped the country after the balloting. Government results showed that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad won in a landslide over his nearest rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi. Widespread street protests followed, during which at least 20 demonstrators died and more than 1,000 were arrested, according to Iranian state-run media. The numbers of casualties and arrests could not be independently verified by CNN because the Iranian government has banned international journalists. The crackdown on the media followed widespread dissemination of video of the mass protests. Khamenei described American and European media coverage of the protests as ""disrespectful to the people of Iran."" Despite any internal differences, Iranians would come together against their ""enemy,"" he said, referring to outsiders. ""When it comes to confronting the enemy, even with various differences and viewpoints, [Iranians] will become united and be as one punch against them,"" he said.","Ayatollah says West ""clearly meddled in the internal affairs of Iran""

"NORCROSS, Georgia (CNN) -- Beneath seven flat-screen TVs and one large pulldown screen, members of the Racquet Club of the South gathered Monday to watch and celebrate one of their own. Members of the Racquet Club of the South erupt when Melanie Oudin beats Nadia Petrova. Melanie Oudin, 17, of Marietta, Georgia, has taken the tennis world by storm at the U.S. Open. The 70th-ranked female has upset some of the sport's biggest female stars, including Russian aces Elena Dementieva (No. 4 seed) and Maria Sharapova (No. 29 seed, who has been ranked No. 1 worldwide in the past). And on Monday, she beat 13th seed Nadia Petrova in three sets. Her latest win makes her the youngest American to make the quarterfinals since Serena Williams in 1999. ""It's still so surreal,"" said Anne Keeton, player liaison at the club, before the match started. ""She sort of wins no matter what happens. She's there going for it and not giving up."" At this suburban club, co-owned and co-directed by Oudin's longtime coach, Brian de Villiers, articles about the local tennis phenom dot the walls. In the Grill, on a Bud Light message board above drink specials, are the words ""Congratulations Melanie!"" And a photo of her mixed in with other young players is posted near a downstairs fitness room. Blending in with others and not retreating to ""a Melanie court"" is part of what makes her special, Keeton said. When there was a flood on some indoor courts this year, she was down there squeegeeing with everyone else. ""She so lovely and so accessible,"" Keeton said. ""It couldn't happen to a nicer kid."" The restaurant buzzed as tables filled with more than 80 onlookers who were courtside in spirit. They feasted on a spread laid out to mark the special occasion as the match started.  Watch friends, family cheer Oudin on » . When Petrova took the upper hand, and the first set, fans erupted into applause with each of Oudin's hard-earned points and offered encouragement like ""There we go!"" When she pumped her fist in celebration, they did the same. And when a play didn't go her way, they groaned in unison. Her skills were apparent from an early age, said Turhan Berne of Norcross, a coach and tournament director who's known Oudin since she was 9. He watched her rake in wins, beating older kids and snagging No. 1 junior rankings in the country and world. ""But you know when I knew she was going to be something?"" he said. ""She would play with anybody her coach had her hit with. ... She always gave back. She's very grounded. Her parents and coach did a great job not letting her fame and success change her into a different person."" As Oudin came back for the second set, the crowd held its collective breath. With every point she earned, they hooted, hollered and exchanged high-fives. They booed when they saw Petrova losing her cool, banging her racquet against the net after losing a big point. ""C'mon, Melanie!"" people screamed as the tiebreaker began in the second set. When Oudin took that set, they rose to their feet, screamed, did happy dances and shared hugs. ""It's awesome,"" said Kathleen Brady of Norcross. ""We are so glad her opponent double-faults."" ""Bless her heart,"" Lisa Wells chimed in with a laugh, offering the Southern tagline to downplay any insult. Earlier in the day, John Sklare joked that the young pro learned something from him. Over the winter, the Alpharetta psychologist often played on the indoor court beside her. ""I knew she was good, but I didn't know she was that good -- and that's what we're all finding out now,"" he said. He spoke about what a ""great kid"" Oudin is but then added that what he likes best about her is how quiet she is on the court. Sklare, a former writer for Atlanta Tennis magazine, said he called Sharapova ""Screamapova."" Oudin, on the other hand, is ""like a stealth fighter,"" he said. ""She's quiet, but you know she's there."" Her overall attitude is as inspiring as her play, said Jeannette Latimer of Decatur, Georgia, whose 11-year-old daughter, Kelsey, has been playing for five years. ""She shows the kids not to get upset on the court,"" Latimer said. ""She's always so positive. If the kids learn nothing else from her, it's her mental toughness."" But Kelsey has been more intent on studying Oudin's moves on the court. ""I think she has a nice top-spin forehand,"" Kelsey said. ""I think it's better than mine."" With Oudin up 5-2 in the third set, anticipation hung in the air. ""Both of them are pressing each other, but to see the 70 [ranked player] outplaying 13, that takes heart,"" Ernie Jensen of Woodstock said. Going into the match point, some rose to their feet. Together, the hordes clapped, carrying Oudin to the win. When she took the match, earning her first quarterfinal seat in a Grand Slam, the room exploded. They stood by and watched, smiling widely and some wiping away tears as Oudin gave her victory speech. ""It's like something so big happening to all of us all at once,"" said Jennifer Silverberg of Alpharetta. ""Watching her, it's like watching your own little girl. ... My heart's still going crazy.""","Melanie Oudin, 17, moves into quarterfinals with latest win .

"Editor's note: The following story, based on testimony in Phillip Garrido's trial for a 1976 kidnapping, contains some sexually explicit material. Phillip Garrido is show in an early mug shot taken in connection with the 1976 rape and abduction case. (CNN) -- Fifteen years before the girl was held captive in the shed, there was the woman in the warehouse -- and at least one other woman who escaped capture. Phillip Garrido, who with his wife is charged in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, had been convicted of kidnapping before. When he stalked, kidnapped and raped Katie Callaway Hall on November 22, 1976, he fulfilled an overpowering sexual fantasy that he had methodically planned for weeks, according to court records obtained by CNN. He told police it was his second kidnapping attempt of the day. Those facts came to light in Garrido's 1977 trial, in which he was convicted and sentenced to 50 years for kidnapping and rape. In her testimony, Hall said Garrido asked for a ride in her car, then bound and handcuffed her before taking her to a small warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he repeatedly raped her for 5½ hours. It was not an act of impulse. ""He told me he had been renting it [the small warehouse] for a couple weeks, preparing it,"" Hall testified.  Watch how Garrido prepared for and explained the kidnapping » . It is CNN policy to withhold the identity of alleged victims of sexual assault. But in this case, Hall recounted her ordeal last week in an interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" saying it changed her life forever. ""I had to tell everyone I met what had happened to me -- because I didn't feel like myself. It was as if I had to explain why I wasn't 'normal,' "" she said.  Watch Hall describe her ordeal » . She was not his first victim that day. The trial transcript reveals that Garrido told authorities that one hour before Hall's kidnapping, he tried to kidnap another woman, who wrestled away and escaped. And, police in Antioch disclosed last week that Garrido was charged with raping a 14-year-old in 1972, but the charges were dropped because the victim refused to testify.   Watch details of the 1972 case » . In the case involving Hall, CNN reviewed the 1977 trial documents, which include Garrido's psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of Hall and Garrido. The documents reveal a pattern of behavior that Garrido is accused of repeating in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, who was recently found after being kept in a shed for 18 years. The 32-year-old documents also detail Garrido's self-described struggle with drugs and his efforts to control his sexual obsessions.  Can sex offenders be cured? » . Garrido and his wife, Nancy, have pleaded not guilty to charges involving Dugard's abduction, but police say he admitted kidnapping her in his initial interview. Police say Garrido and his wife kidnapped Dugard outside her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, and took her to an elaborate compound hidden in the backyard of their Antioch, California, home more than 160 miles away. Tucked behind overgrown trees and a fence were tents, outbuildings and a soundproof shed where Dugard lived with the two daughters she had with her captor. Out of sight . Garrido took great pains to make sure nobody could find the camp, not even the parole officer who visited twice a month at times, police said. Hall, too, was taken directly to a carefully prepped small warehouse after her kidnapping. As they drove from South Lake Tahoe, California, where she was abducted, to Reno, she tried to persuade Garrido to rape her in the bushes. ""I asked him, couldn't we just pull over and get it over with,"" she testified. But Garrido was determined. ""You might as well get that our of your mind; you are going with me, you have got no choice,"" Hall testified Garrido told her, according to court transcripts. ""I have it all planned."" He had set up the mini-warehouse in Reno exactly as he wanted, and worked to ensure nobody would inquire about it. He asked a man who lived in a storage unit 30 feet away to call him should any unknown vehicles show up. The mini-warehouse was meticulously furnished. On the other side of an unassuming metal, garage-style door, the walls were covered in long, heavy rugs hanging from the ceiling. Thick opaque plastic sheets were scattered throughout, creating a maze-like atmosphere that prohibited anyone from seeing all the way through, Hall testified. Staging the attacks . In the back, Garrido created a space set up like a stage. At the center was a mattress covered with an old, red satin, hole-ridden sheet and a fur blanket, Hall testified. Illuminating the bed were red, yellow and blue stage lights, with a stack of pornographic magazines and a projector alongside it. His intent, a prosecution psychologist said, couldn't have been clearer based on the methodical planning. From the moment she got to the mini-warehouse, Hall said it was clear to her Garrido was a man on a mission. ""He knew what he was doing,"" she testified. ""[He] knew exactly how he was going to do it."" She testified that it was there that he raped her for 5½ hours. As he drank wine and she smoked a small bit of hashish, Hall said she kept track of the time by listening to a radio, which regularly announced the time. Hall didn't know that she wasn't originally part of the plan, although Garrido alluded to the fact he hadn't targeted her, saying it wasn't intentional that she was taken. ""Could have been anybody,"" Hall recalled him saying, adding he told her it was her fault because she was attractive. He didn't say that his original plan had gone awry one hour earlier. Victim managed to escape . Despite his planning, there was one thing Garrido hadn't accounted for -- that one of his intended victims would fight back. One hour before Hall was kidnapped in her own vehicle, Garrido asked a different woman in South Lake Tahoe, California, for a ride. Like Hall, she obliged. But when he tried to handcuff her, he only secured one hand. ""She jumped out of the vehicle, struggling with him,"" prosecutors told the judge during a private conversation during the trial. When he unlocked the one handcuff, she escaped by jumping out of the moving car and running up the street. That kidnapping attempt came to light in a conversation between the prosecutor, defense attorney and judge in the case, according to the trial transcript. Despite prosecutors' wishes, the details of the first kidnapping attempt were kept from the jury, after a judge ruled they weren't necessary to prove Garrido's intent to kidnap. The court documents also discussed Garrido's use of marijuana, cocaine and LSD, which Garrido said was so heavy it fueled his sexual desires and sometimes pushed him to a point he could no longer control them. He said he responded to the urges by masturbating in drive-in movie theaters, restaurants, bathrooms, bars and while watching partially clothed or naked women in their homes. An interest in young girls . Though police have recently said they never expected Garrido would have kidnapped someone as young as Dugard based on his record, Garrido's own words during his trial showed young girls did grab his attention.  Watch how Garrido slipped through the cracks » . He admitted masturbating in his car while watching small girls outside their school. Sometimes, he said, he would open the car door, get out and pull down his pants. His own explanation of his sexual fantasies hinted at an obsession with sexual bondage and captivity. ""There has been a type of bondage pictures,"" he said, when asked if certain images heightened his arousal. ""Women in handcuffs, chained."" On the night he took Hall captive and bound her with a leather strap in her car, he said he took four hits of LSD, a drug that he said he used daily for at least four years, sometimes taking up to 10 hits at a time. He said when he used the drug it acted as a sexual stimulant. ""I had this fantasy that was driving me to do this inside of me,"" Garrido testified. ""Something that was making me want to do it without -- no way to stop."" Garrido said the urges would strike and continue to build until he was ""overcome"" with sexual cravings. Hall was curious, too, even during her kidnapping, what would make Garrido do this to her. So she asked him. ""He said that he didn't get off on pain,"" Hall recalled during her testimony. ""It was just a fantasy he had to live out.""","Trial transcripts show Phillip Garrido tried to kidnap woman before Katie Hall in 1976 .

"(CNN) -- After stints as a guard in the jails of Washington, D.C., and on the streets of post-Katrina New Orleans, Stephen Tyrone Johns had settled in to a job he liked at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, family members said. Security officer Stephen Johns reportedly opened the door for the man police say was his killer. ""It seemed to be kind of laid-back -- it didn't seem to be that dangerous,"" Leroy Carter, the stepfather who helped raise Johns since he was 3, told CNN affiliate WUSA-TV in Washington. ""He had wanted to be on the Metro Police force or places like that, but I would have rather him been where he was. ""But it just backfired."" Johns, 39, was shot and killed while on duty Wednesday -- allegedly gunned down by an 88-year-old white supremacist who stepped into the museum with a rifle and began firing. Johns is remembered by friends and family as a ""gentle giant"" -- he stood 6 feet 6 inches, according to Carter. And he lived up to the moniker to the very end. One of his last acts was reaching out and opening the door for the man who shot him, police said.  Watch museum officials pay tribute » . James von Brunn, an outspoken Holocaust denier who had served six years in prison for a 1981 kidnapping attempt, was shot and wounded by Johns' fellow officers. He remained in critical condition Thursday at George Washington University Hospital. Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, was a resident and native of Temple Hills, Maryland. In the hours following the shooting, friends and co-workers repeatedly remembered ""Big John"" for his quiet, friendly nature. ""To look at him initially he was very intimidating,"" said Alan Burkee, a friend and former co-worker at the museum. ""But he was very shy. ... He had a great demeanor -- very pleasant, very courteous to all the visitors that came in and the staff that worked there."" Friends said Johns was an avid Washington Redskins fan and loved to travel, but lived just 10 minutes away from where his mother and stepfather raised him. He had an 11-year-old son, Stephen Jr., and recently had remarried, according to friends. ""He was a pretty great guy,"" Stephen Johns Jr., known as ""Little Stephen"" to family, told WUSA. ""He was always there for me when I was down or sad."" Carter had picked up Stephen after school to tell him the news of the shooting, and the two were on the way to the hospital when Johns died. Steve Maritas is organizing director with the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America -- of which Johns was a member. He said the way Johns and his fellow officers responded Wednesday saved lives -- and it flies in the face of the stereotype of the run-of-the-mill security guard. ""If that was the case, there would have been 50 people shot yesterday,"" said Maritas, whose organization represents more than 30,000 officers nationally and about 5,000 in the Washington area. ""These guys are very highly trained, highly paid officers. It's not like they're just there wearing a uniform."" Johns had worked for Wackenhut Security Inc. since 2003. Maritas said Johns and his colleagues trained for days like Wednesday -- when years of safety and quiet give way to a sudden burst of terror. ""Hopefully, you'll never have to use your gun,"" he said. ""But you get a situation where you get a crazy guy like this -- it happens within two or three seconds."" For Carter, there will always a clear reminder of the stepson he raised as his own. Little Stephen, he said, looks and acts just like his father did at that age. Carter said he takes comfort knowing that the roughly 2,000 people visiting the Holocaust museum at the time of the attack were able to walk away unharmed. ""That guy wouldn't have stopped until he was stopped,"" Carter said.","Stephen Johns was prison guard, worked in New Orleans before museum .

The two met not long after Carson began hosting the game show ""Who Do You Trust?"" in 1957. iReport.com: Share your memories of Ed McMahon . ""Johnny didn't look as if he was dying to see me,"" McMahon, who was hosting a show on a Philadelphia TV station, told People magazine in 1980 about the pair's first meeting. ""He was standing with his back to the door, staring at a couple of workmen putting letters on a theater marquee. I walked over and stood beside him. Finally the two guys finished, and Johnny asked, 'What have you been doing?' I told him. He said, 'Good to meet you, Ed,' shook my hand, and I was out of the office. The whole meeting was about as exciting as watching a traffic light change.""  Watch McMahon discuss meeting Johnny Carson » . Though McMahon was surprised to be offered the job as Carson's sidekick, the two soon proved to have a strong chemistry. Carson was, by nature, introverted and dry-witted; McMahon was the boisterous and outgoing second banana, content to give Carson straight lines or laugh uproariously at his jokes (a characteristic much-parodied by comedians).  Watch Comedian Joan Rivers recall McMahon » . Carson made cracks about McMahon's weight, his drinking and the men's trouble with divorce. McMahon was married three times; Carson, who died in 2005, had four wives. McMahon was also the show's designated pitchman, a talent he honed to perfection during ""Tonight's"" 30-year run with Carson, even if sometimes the in-show commercial spots fell flat. For one of the show's regular sponsors, Alpo dog food, McMahon usually extolled the virtues of the product while a dog eagerly gobbled down a bowl. But one day the show's regular dog wasn't available, and the substitute pooch wasn't very hungry. McMahon recalled the incident in his 1998 memoir, ""For Laughing Out Loud."" ""Then I saw Johnny come into my little commercial area. He got down on his hands and knees and came over to me. ... I started to pet Johnny. Nice boss, I was thinking as I pet him on the head, nice boss. By this point the audience was hysterical. ... I just kept going. I was going to get my commercial done. "" 'The next time you're looking at the canned dog food ...' -- he rubbed his cheek against my leg --  ... reach for the can that contains real beef.' Johnny got up on his knees and started begging for more. I started petting him again ... and then he licked my hand."" McMahon also promoted Budweiser, American Family Insurance and -- during the most recent Super Bowl -- Cash4Gold.com. Entertainment Weekly named him No. 1 on its list of TV's greatest sidekicks. Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 6, 1923. His father was a promoter, and McMahon remembered moving a lot during his childhood. ""I changed towns more often than a pickpocket,"" McMahon told People. He later joined the Marines and served in World War II and Korea. Though McMahon was well-rewarded by NBC -- the 1980 People article listed his salary between $600,000 and $1 million -- his divorces and some poor investments took their toll. In June 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported that McMahon was $644,000 in arrears on a $4.8 million loan for a home in Beverly Hills, California, and his lender had filed a notice of default. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, told CNN's Larry King that McMahon had gotten caught in a spate of financial problems. ""If you spend more money than you make, you know what happens. And it can happen. You know, a couple of divorces thrown in, a few things like that,"" said McMahon, who added that he hadn't worked much since the neck injury. McMahon later struck a deal that allowed him to stay in the house. He is survived by his wife, Pamela, and five children.

"(CNN) -- When Clifton Green and his wife adopted an adorable little girl from Ethiopia, they knew they would eventually have to deal with the hair issue. Clifton Green learned how to care for his daughter Miriam's hair, which is very different from his own. The Atlanta, Georgia-based couple, who are white, had read books about transracial adoptions that addressed how to deal with Miriam's springy curls that grew in full, dark and strong after a toddlerhood of baldness. Green took it upon himself to learn how to care for and style his daughter's textured tresses. ""We didn't have any skills, but we had the desire,"" said Green of learning to do his now 5-year-old daughter's hair. ""It's the culture, it's important and we want to honor it and respect it."" For many African-Americans, having a child walk around with unkempt hair is an almost unpardonable sin. That desire to be well groomed extends into adulthood and the multitudes of hairstyles are as diverse as the black community itself. There are naturals, weaves, chemically relaxed styles, braids and dreadlocks, to name just a few. Far from being superficial, black hair and its care goes well beyond the multibillion-dollar industry it has become and is deeply rooted in African-American identity and culture. ""Barbershops and beauty salons are perhaps second only to black churches as institutions in the community,"" said Ingrid Banks, an associate professor of Black Studies at University of California, Santa Barbara and author of a forthcoming book on contemporary black beauty salon culture.  iReporters share their hair-stories » . ""It's not about hair per se, it's about what hair means, particularly for black women in terms of racial identity, identity based on gender and ideas about power,"" she said. ""On one level, hair matters because race matters in our society. For black people, our hair has been infused with these racial politics."" Banks points to the ideas, which continue to linger, that if a black woman straightens her hair she is ""selling out the race"" and/or ""embracing the white standard of beauty"" while women who wear their hair in natural styles are ""blacker than thou."" ""When we think about that, there is no other racial or ethnic group in which those ideas come to bear on someone's politics,"" said Banks, who gathered data for her book by traveling to black hair salons across the country. ""No one is saying that about white women, Asian women or Latino women."" Erin Aubry Kaplan, who wrote an article about Michelle Obama's hair and its implications for Salon.com, believes the first lady's straightened and perfectly coiffed style helps her image. ""She has been criticized about many things, but I think that underneath the criticism about her being radical or too outspoken about race is this uneasiness people have about her being this tall, dark-skinned woman,"" Kaplan said. ""So her hair is important, because if she is tall, dark-skinned and has an Afro then she becomes really scary."" Sound off: Is there such a thing as 'good hair?' That unease was also evident in 2008 when The New Yorker magazine ran a cover with a drawing portraying Michelle Obama wearing an Angela Davis-style Afro while fist bumping her turban wearing husband. ""[The cover] I think was meant to poke fun at what people really fear,"" said Kaplan, who added that as a black woman who does not have kinky hair, she has had her own share of issues. ""I understood the intent, but we aren't at the point where we can laugh at black images, because every black image resonates and reflects on black people as a whole."" Robert Morris can relate to the perceptions that black hair can evoke. The CNN iReporter recently cut the dreadlocks he had been growing for years and said that along with the physical makeover came an attitude shift in how people responded to him. Check out Morris' iReport on his change . ""I wasn't as approachable when I had the locks,"" said Morris, who now sports a shorter, cropped do that he is enjoying. ""It seemed like I had the stigma of being 'the angry black man.' "" People's possible reactions to hair caused another iReporter to lose sleep. Tamille Johnson said her decision to get kinky twists kept her up the night before her visit to the salon. Read Johnson's concerns in her iReport . ""It was really surprising to me because I was so afraid what people would think about them and I didn't think I would feel that way,"" Johnson said. ""Whenever I would get my hair done, I would get straight styles and I did not know if people would think that the kinky style was pretty."" Johnson, an administrator at UC Berkeley, said she found the experience to be soul searching and she came to terms with the fact that as long as she thought her hair was beautiful, that was all that mattered. That attitude is one Renae Valdez-Simeon hopes to impart to her two daughters. Because her children are biracial, Valdez-Simeon said she has often heard comments about her children's ""good hair."" Go to Valdez-Simeon's iReport . ""When a child has straight hair, they are told they have 'good hair' and while people aren't telling children with curly hair that they have 'bad hair,' in essence that is what you are saying because you are saying that straight hair is good hair,"" Valdez-Simeon said. Valdez-Simeon, whose site Mixtkids.com is billed as ""One Mom's journey to raise empowered mixed-race children,"" said she has increasingly heard the comments because her 7-year-old sports tight, curly ringlets while her 1-year-old's hair has yet to curl.   ""I try to explain to people that good hair is not straight hair, it's healthy hair,"" said Valdez-Simeon, who also said all of the comments have come from African-Americans. Comedian Chris Rock saw the same attitudes in his young daughters and it helped motivate his new documentary ""Good Hair."" The film is narrated by Rock and explores black hair from a variety of angles, including the booming $9 billion generated by the black hair industry and the science behind chemical relaxers used to straighten hair. Rock also visited the Bronner Bros. International Hair Show in Atlanta, a twice-a-year event that has been in existence since the company started in 1947. Janet Wallace, hair show manager, said as many as 50,000 attendees have come annually to each of the events to see the latest trends, services and products available. Stylists and the public alike are enthralled by the art form that is hairstyling, Wallace said. ""People want to look good from the cradle to the grave,"" Wallace said. ""Hair is fun because there are so many adornments and things you can do with it."" Green acknowledges that he has not reached that level of artistry yet, but takes pride in styling his daughter's hair well. On weekends, the Emory University professor can be found wielding the various combs, brushes and products he has found that work for Miriam's hair (Carol's Daughter is a favorite at the moment). While he said he's still not that good with ""rows,"" the cornrow style that braids the hair close to the scalp, he can work other braided styles, twists and an occasional French braid. The ritual of doing Miriam's hair is not only a time of bonding for the pair, but also an opportunity for him to honor his daughter and her heritage. Green has kept his sense of humor about the many people who express surprise that he is so well educated about and skilled with black hair. ""I don't want people to look at her and tell she has white parents,"" he said, laughing.","Hairstyles tied to black culture and identity .

"(CNN) -- Piracy is expected to pick up in the high seas off Somalia after a lull caused by monsoon season, maritime officials warned Monday. Suspected Somali pirates sit behind bars during the first hearing in their trial at Aden port court on July 15. The Combined Maritime Forces urged crews to take up safety measures, including using recognized transit corridors in the Gulf of Aden and reporting to the European Union's security center before transit. ""The prior preparation and vigilance of merchant mariners at all times of day and night is more important now than ever,"" said Rear Admiral Caner Bener of the Combined Task Force. International forces made up of more than 30 ships and aircraft from 16 nations will continue patrolling the waters to help fight pirates, according to officials. ""While our ability to deter and disrupt attacks has improved over time, we are constantly adapting the way we do our business as the pirates adapt and modify their tactics,"" Bener said. The waters off Somalia are rife with pirate activity, despite increased measures by military forces and shipping companies to ward off attacks. Heavily armed pirates have struck the busy Indian Ocean shipping lanes and the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. They have captured dozens of vessels and hundreds of hostages, making off with millions of dollars in ransom. It was unclear whether a ransom was paid. The Gulf of Aden, off northern Somalia, has the highest risk of piracy in the world.","Earlier this month Somali pirates release German ship held since May .

"(CNN) -- Nearly a decade has passed since Bill Clinton left the White House, but despite becoming a private citizen, the former president never left the public eye. Former President Clinton receives flowers from a girl Tuesday upon landing in Pyongyang, North Korea. While much of his time has been devoted to global philanthropic interests and speeches, Clinton has never strayed too far from the campaign trail and remains one of the world's most recognizable statesmen. Clinton, 62, jumped back onto the world stage Tuesday with an unannounced trip to North Korea on a mission to negotiate the release of two imprisoned American journalists. North Korean President Kim Jong Il later pardoned and released the journalists. They were traveling back to the United States with Clinton on Tuesday night. The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea. Clinton arrived to a warm welcome in Pyongyang.  Watch more on Clinton's North Korea trip » . There is a lot of nostalgia in Pyongyang for his administration, when relations between North Korea and the U.S. were stronger, said John Glionna, the Seoul, South Korea, bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times. ""Well, I think most of the people that I talked to in Washington earlier today were of the opinion that Bill Clinton is a big enough personality that would not risk the loss of face of him showing up in Pyongyang and returning empty-handed,"" Glionna said. Clinton's high profile has led critics to accuse him of upstaging his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, especially when he was making headlines while campaigning for her unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid. His first major verbal stumble during that campaign came in the run-up to the New Hampshire primary when he told a crowd that then-candidate Obama's claim to have been an early and consistent opponent of the Iraq war was ""the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen."" In the ensuing media uproar, many Democratic activists -- African-Americans in particular -- came to believe that the former president had belittled Obama's entire campaign effort. And while stumping for his wife in heavily black South Carolina, he seemed to try to minimize the impact of an Obama win by noting that the Rev. Jesse Jackson also won the state in 1984 and 1988 but went on to lose both nominations by wide margins. Critics accused the former president of trying to peel off Obama's white supporters by marginalizing him as the black candidate. Clinton's hesitancy to back Obama once he locked in the Democratic nomination also fueled the storyline of the Clinton-Obama riffs. But in a high-drama moment last year at the Democratic National Convention, both Clintons announced their wholehearted support for their party's nominee. Bill Clinton's name was tossed around as a possible pick to fill his wife's vacant Senate seat after she was selected as secretary of state. His name comes up in discussions of possible Supreme Court picks that Obama might have the opportunity to make. Before his wife's presidential campaign, Clinton focused most of his efforts on the William J. Clinton Foundation. The foundation's projects include the Clinton Global Initiative, which seeks to combat poverty and climate change and promote health and education programs worldwide as well as separate initiatives directed at childhood obesity, global warming, HIV/AIDS and malaria, inner-city entrepreneurship and economic growth in Latin America. It also funded the construction of the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. The foundation boasts more than 800 staff and volunteers around the world. In his post-presidency, Clinton also has shared the stage with former President George H.W. Bush on numerous occasions. The two teamed up to establish the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund and Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund. They toured the tsunami-ravaged areas following the 2004 disaster, and they teamed up again the following year to lead relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Clinton also has taken time to author a couple of best-selling books. His 2004 memoir, ""My Life,"" sold more than 400,000 copies the first day it was available. Later that year, Clinton underwent heart bypass surgery after experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. A biting Vanity Fair article published last summer suggested that Clinton's surgery left him in an altered state of mind -- one marked by constant anger and rage. The Clinton campaign hit back, saying that theory is ""false and is flatly rejected by President Clinton's doctors who say he is in excellent shape and point to his vigorous schedule as evidence of his exceptional recovery."" In a sharp critique of the article, Clinton spokesman also criticized Todd Purdum, national editor of Vanity Fair, for not giving enough attention to the former president's charitable works through his foundation since leaving the White House. ""Most revealing is one simple fact: President Clinton has helped save the lives of more than 1,300,000 people in his post-presidency, and Vanity Fair couldn't find the time to talk to even one of them for comment,"" spokesman Jay Carson said. While the 42nd president's image has gotten a few bruises over the years, Clinton has held on to his reputation as a master politician with a penchant for making news. CNN's Kristi Keck and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Kim Jong Il pardons two U.S. journalists, state-run news agency KCNA says .

"(CNN) -- When Albert Budacz was young, he prided himself on having good eyesight; he never wore glasses. But as he eased into his late 40s, he couldn't see as well. ""I noticed a change in my vision,"" he explained. ""Primarily in church when I would open a Bible, or something like that, I had to position myself under a light to see it."" Ophthalmologist Dr. Sharon Solomon examined Albert Budacz  and found age-related macular degeneration. Concerned that he was beginning to lose his sight, Budacz went to his ophthalmologist, Dr. Sharon Solomon with the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins. He was found to have the beginnings macular degeneration, an eye condition that occurs when the central portion of the retina -- called the macula -- begins to deteriorate. Until recently, people with age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of severe vision loss in Americans older than 60, had few treatment options. But now, thanks to new research and advancing technology, there are more vision-saving choices. Early signs of macular degeneration-related vision loss include shadowy areas or fuzzy distortion in a person's central vision. ""A patient told me recently that he noticed when he was driving that the streetlights were slanted; the poles themselves were slanted,"" Solomon said. ""That's a classic sign of the beginning of this disease."" Although obesity, smoking, high blood pressure and certain drugs can cause it, age is the primary risk factor. ""As people approach their 50s and later, they may have little yellow deposits that develop underneath the retina, and that's called drusen,"" Solomon explained. ""Those deposits are the hallmark of what we call early age-related macular degeneration."" There are two forms of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD: the dry form, known as non-neovascular, and the wet form, called neovascular. The dry form, which Budacz has, is more common. According to the National Eye Institute, about 85 to 90 percent of patients with advanced macular degeneration have the dry form. Dry macular degeneration is caused when drusen begin to accumulate in and around the macula. Drusen, those yellowish deposits, are debris from deteriorating tissue. With dry AMD, there is usually a gradual loss of central vision. Over a period of years, dry AMD can progress to a gradual deterioration of retinal cells, which can result in severe vision loss or lead to the wet version of AMD. As of now, there is no FDA-approved treatment for dry macular degeneration, although a few drugs and devices are in clinical trials.  Health Minute: Watch more on new therapies for macular degeneration » . However, studies have shown that supplements and a healthy diet can slow the progression of dry macular degeneration. A recent National Eye Institute study found that certain nutrients such as beta carotene (vitamin A) and vitamins C and E may reduce the risk of progression of early-stage AMD by 25 percent. Solomon says these antioxidants have a positive effect. ""They're known as 'preservision,' "" she said, noting that they are commonly given to certain patient groups to slow their progression to advanced macular degeneration. Other research has shown that B6, B12 and folic acid may help prevent age-related macular degeneration. In a study of more than 5,000 women, researchers noted those who took a combination of B6 and B12 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had a 34 percent lower risk of developing AMD then those taking a placebo. Although the studies showed strong results, the American Academy of Ophthalmology cautions patients to talk to their eye doctors about which supplements are best for their condition before they start popping vitamins. In the wet version of macular degeneration, abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina and leak blood and fluid. This leakage causes permanent damage to light-sensitive retinal cells, which die off and create blind spots in central vision. Doctors say it's the body's misguided way of attempting to supply the retina with more nutrients and oxygen. Instead, the attempt creates scarring, leading to severe central vision loss. Up until recently, there's been very little doctors could do for the wet form of macular degeneration. But over the past decade, there have been a few treatments developed to slow its progression. Cold lasers are now used to freeze the abnormal blood vessels responsible for destroying the macula; they have a 60 percent success rate. And within the past three years, researchers pinpointed a protein in the eye, called vascular endothelial growth factor, that stimulates the development of blood vessels. Injectable drugs that inhibit VEGF are now FDA-approved and available; without VEGF, there is little to encourage the growth of blood vessels in the retina. ""They actually have a 90 percent chance of stabilizing vision and a 30 to 40 percent chance of improving vision,"" Solomon said. ""This is the first therapy that we've had that can actually [reverse] vision loss."" Most ophthalmologists prefer an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure. They promote yearly eye exams as the easiest way to keep macular degeneration in check -- and warn against waiting for a crisis to schedule a checkup. ""We typically pick up a patient when, all of a sudden, they've had an acute, abrupt loss of vision or change in the quality of their vision,"" Solomon said. ""And sometimes it's too late."" Albert Budacz was lucky. He caught his macular degeneration in time. He's stopped smoking and takes antioxidants to slow the progression of the disease. And although he may not have the eyesight he had as a young man, he can still see pretty well with or without glasses. And to him, that's all that matters.","Age-related macular degeneration causes central vision loss .

It must be something like the thousands of curious, intriguing and spectacular images taken by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera mounted on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The University of Arizona, Tucson, which operates HiRISE, has just released a new batch of these photos taken in the last several months. You can check out the full set here. They reveal an alien landscape of craters, valleys, ridges, channels, weird surface patterns and other features in incredible detail.

The camera isn't looking straight down, but is pointed 22 degrees east so we get a better view of the crater's slopes, ""comparable to a view from an airplane window,"" the university says. Looking at some of the photos, you feel like you're flying over the Grand Canyon or the Sahara. Others are distinctly extraterrestrial in nature. In all cases, the images reveal lots of details about the surface of our neighbor in the solar system.

"SOUTH CHINA SEA (CNN) -- Aboard the Svend Maersk, the sound of the ship's five-story high engine permeates like a heartbeat through the four-football field length of ship. Chief Officer Christian Vium talks to CNN's Eunice Yoon as night falls on the bridge of the Svend. It's also the heartbeat of the world economy, as the Maersk takes its thousands of containers filled with shoes, computers, furniture and fireworks from China to markets in Europe. But a more telling sight is when the massive vessel nears Singapore and passes by dozens of idle ships. ""A lot of ships have been taken out of service or laid up. Instead of sailing with half empty ships, it's cheaper to lay up the ship,"" said Bo Nikolaisen, captain of the Svend. ""I feel lucky, of course, that I am on a ship that is still working."" A 10 percent drop is expected this year in the shipping business, which one analyst called ""a $20 billion black hole."" It's an industry that is a prime indicator of the global economy -- 90 percent of world trade is carried on ships such as the Svend Maersk to ports and onto shops around the world. CNN sailed with the crew of the Svend Maersk for four days as the ship sailed from Hong Kong to Malaysia to get a sea-level view of the industry. What stands out on these vessels is the incredible size -- the vessels stack 15 stories high -- and streamlined crew: Only 21 men are required to run the ship. The crew comes from Denmark, Germany, Romania and the Philippines. ""We've been joking that the ship was the United Nations at sea,"" said Captain Nikolaisen. ""There are many nationalities, sometimes eight, maybe more. They are professionals -- most of them -- and they know that we cannot afford to be unfriendly to one another."" Some of the crew are over 60; among the youngest is 24-year-old recruit Joey Lamasan. Lamasan still has trouble sleeping since he left his village in the Philippines. But here, he can earn triple what he would make back home. ""The salary in the Philippines is too small compared to the salary on board the ship,"" said Lamasan, who is on a six-month contract -- typical for many young seafarers. Piracy has been making the news in recent months, exacerbating economic concerns of the financial crisis. More common than large-scale theft of multi-million dollar cargo is thieves coming on board and stealing cash, computers and personal items. But what they fear the most ""would be fire or explosion,"" said Captain Nikolaisen. ""We cannot run away."" Life on the boat -- like the scenery -- can be repetitive. There is no mobile phone service, no booze, and limited Internet access. Many of the seamen work in two four-hour shifts... to stay alert. Meals and coffee breaks are routine. Free time is usually spent alone in the cabins, playing computer games together, or occasionally calling home on a satellite phone. ""Ten to 15 minutes just to hear how it's going and keep contact. Also it's nice for the kids too. So they can still remember what Dad sounds like,"" Captain Nikolaisen said. After two months on the high seas officers get two months' vacation. ""When I am out here I miss the family,"" Nikolaisen said. ""And when I am at home I miss a little bit being at sea.""","The shipping industry is expecting a 10 percent drop this year .

"Editor's note: Reza Sayah is one of the few Western journalists reporting from Tehran after the Iranian government placed restrictions on coverage. A man in the crowd holds up a photo of Ahmadinejad during Khamenei's address at Friday prayers. TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- People in the crowd sang songs of tribute as they waited. When he arrived, they stood and welcomed him in unison: ""Praise be to God and to his prophet, Mohammed."" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader for two decades, took the stage during Friday prayers at Tehran University with a few notes on small pieces of paper in his left hand. He leaned on the lectern with his right arm, crippled in an 1981 assassination attempt. He was ready to put an end to a week of unrest. First, a sermon about the dangers of division and disunity, using the language of Islam. Then came secular sentences, decidedly direct. He praised the huge turnout at the polls as a victory for Iran but criticized post-election turmoil as the work of Iran's enemies -- the United States, Israel and Britain. ""The enemies want to destroy our confidence. They want to create doubt about the election,"" Khamenei said. A full hour passed before he delivered a verdict that supporters of opposition presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi did not want to hear. ""Eleven million votes difference?"" he asked. ""Sometimes there's a margin of one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand, or one million, maximum. Then one can doubt, be concerned that there has been some rigging or manipulation. ""But there's a difference of 11 million votes. How can vote rigging happen?"" To be clear, he reminded the crowd of the victor at the polls. It was the man sitting in the front row: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He was the ""the absolute victor,"" Khamenei said. ""If political elites want to ignore or break the law and willy-nilly take wrong measures which are harmful, they will be held accountable for all violence and  blood and rioting."" Few in the crowd were disappointed with the cleric's words. ""Death to America!"" the people chanted repeatedly, interrupting Khamenei's speech. ""Death to Israel."" Noticeably absent Friday was Moussavi, the man who had sparked Iran's unrest by calling for a recount of the votes. Absent, too, were Moussavi's supporters, who did not take to the streets to protest as they had done in previous days. There were no signs and placards on the streets. Or people clamoring for change. The tens of thousands who showed up for Friday prayer were a stark contrast to the demonstrators. They were mostly religious conservatives, supporters of Ahmadinejad. And they had a message for the president's opponent, though it was not always consistent. Some were conciliatory. ""The nation should come together,"" one said. ""We are all one."" Others took a hard line: ""They must stop with the demonstrations, otherwise there will be consequences."" Just what those consequences might be may become apparent Saturday afternoon, when the demonstrators are expected again on the streets of Tehran. But for now, Iran's supreme leader had issued his warning clearly: Enough is enough.","Supreme leader sermonizes about dangers of division and disunity .

"(CNN)  -- Five-time defending champion Roger Federer is bidding to match the record of a controversial tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1920s but died in disgrace. Tilden dominated tennis in the 1920s with his own trademark style. American Bill Tilden achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended Hollwyood stars such as Charle Chaplin, but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge, which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953. Tilden won his six straight U.S. Open titles from 1920-1925 - a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system - where the champion automatically qualified for the final - in 1911. Under that system, Richard Sears won the first seven editions of the U.S. Open (then the U.S. National Tennis Championships) in the 1880s. Tilden, who claimed his seventh U.S .Open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist, goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. A relatively late starter, Tilden struggled to get into his college tennis team in Pennsylvania, but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the First World War as he reached the U.S. Open finals of 1918 and 1919. He reached his peak in the 1920s, winning his first U.S. Open title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years. Tilden also led the United States to a record seven straight Davis Cup titles as well as claiming three Wimbledon titles. His famed ""cannonball"" services worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the U.S. Open and Wimbledon were staged. Tilden never won the French Open being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts, in 1927, and 1930 on clay. He won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at Wimbledon in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit . Eventually joined by the likes of Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and Don Budge, Tilden remained a star attraction until well into his 40s, filling arenas such as Madison Square Garden in big money matches. But off the court, Tilden was a controversial figure, battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question and being accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate. Tilden, who never married, saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor. He served seven-and-a-half months of a year jail term but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16-year-old male hitchhiker. Tilden served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community. His friendship with Hollywood stars such as Chaplin and a love of the theatrical world saw Tilden pour much of his riches into less than successful Broadway productions. He died a tragic figure in 1953, having a stroke in Los Angeles as he prepared for a trip to play in the U.S. Pro Championships despite his 60 years of age. Tilden was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1959 and in any polls of all-time great tennis players always features in the top order.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Three men charged with sexually exploiting Cambodian children are being brought back to the United States to face prosecution, the Justice Department announced Monday. The men are among the first charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. The initiative, Operation Twisted Traveler, is an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. ""The men charged in this investigation apparently thought they could pursue their abhorrent desires by leaving the United States to prey on children in another country, but they were sadly mistaken,"" U.S. Attorney Thomas P. O'Brien said in a statement. ""We are now working closer than ever with officials in other nations and concerned private parties to take every effort we can to identify and prosecute sex tourists, as well as to provide every protection we can to the world's children."" Ronald Boyajian, 49, Erik Peeters, 41, and Jack Sporich, 75, are each charged with international travel and engaging in sexual contact with minors, a charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years, according to the Justice Department. They are slated to make their first appearances in federal court on Tuesday, the Justice Department indicated in a news release. The defendants are charged with international travel and engaging in sexual contact with minors, a charge carrying a maximum prison sentence of 30 years for each of their alleged victims, according to the department. They are charged under the federal Protect Act, enacted six years ago to strengthen federal laws relating to predatory crimes against children outside U.S. borders, the department added. The three defendants were apprehended, according to Immigration and Customs officials, as a result of information provided by the human rights organization International Justice Mission and the group Action Pour les Enfants, which combats child exploitation. All three men have been previously convicted of sex offenses in the United States, the Justice Department noted in its statement. ""These types of cases are disturbing not only because young, defenseless children were victimized in unspeakable ways but also because the defendants went to such lengths to engage in their dark activities overseas,"" O'Brien said at a news conference. He highlighted the case against Peeters, who was convicted on child molestation charges in 1990. ""Our case against Mr. Peeters outlines evidence of him allegedly molesting Cambodian boys, paying them small amounts of money -- $5 to $10 -- and possibly taking digital pictures of his young victims while they were naked,"" O'Brien noted. He said Peeters molested at least three boys in Cambodia over the course of several months. One of the boys was 12 years old when the abuse is said to have started. Boyajian is said to have ""engaged in sexual activity with a 10-year-old Vietnamese girl in an area outside Phnom Penh frequented by child sex tourists known as 'Kilo 11,' "" the Justice Department statement said. Sporich, according to Action Pour les Enfants investigators cited in the government's criminal complaint, repeatedly hosted three Cambodian boys at a residence outside the city of Siem Reap. The complaint states that Sporich ""was known to drive his motor bike through the neighborhoods while dropping Cambodian (money) on the street in order to meet kids."" The new charges ""clearly demonstrate to the Cambodian people that the United States will not tolerate this type of abuse,"" said Carol Rodley, the American ambassador to Cambodia. ""These cases not only signal to the Cambodian victims our commitment to justice, but they will also act as a powerful deterrent for those individuals who are contemplating traveling to Cambodia to engage in illegal sexual activity with minors."" The International Labor Organization estimates that at least 12.3 million adults and children are victims of forced labor, bonded labor and sex slavery each year. Cambodia is one of several countries recently added to a U.S. ""watch list"" because of what a State Department report calls a worsening human trafficking record in that country.","Operation Twisted Traveler is crackdown on U.S. sex tourism in Cambodia .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- You don't want to monkey around on a blind date, especially if your friends are also taking an interest in the same dark, handsome stranger. Jookie, as she is known, studies a poster of French gorilla Yeboah, who is heading for London Zoo. So when three female gorillas at London Zoo heard that they would soon be visited by a brooding French hunk -- well, they went a bit bananas. The latest development in Anglo-French relations sees Yeboah, a 20-stone 12-year-old, leave his current home at La Boissiere Du Dore Zoo, Pays de la Loire, northwest France and head for the British capital by the end of the year. There he will be greeted by gorilla trio Zaire, Effie and Mjukuu, who were given posters of their prospective boyfriend for the first time Thursday. One female gorilla shrieked in delight, while another wedged the poster in a tree to stare at it. A third, clearly overcome by emotion, held the photo close to her chest -- then ate it. Their reception was somewhat unsurprising. The zoo has been without a male gorilla since the demise of Bobby, a silverback, in December.  Tracey Lee, team leader at London Zoo, put in a good word for the hirsute lothario on the London Zoo Web site, saying Yeboah is ""a very charming, fun loving and intelligent gorilla."" But whom will Yeboah choose to charm first? Zaire, at 34, is the oldest female gorilla and has been at London Zoo since 1984. The zoo says she's ""happiest when she's taking down and rebuilding her nest in various spots around the island. She loves to play with fabric and often drags it around with her all day. "" Then there's Effie, 16, who ""enjoys seeing toddlers and often makes her way over to the glass when they come to see her,"" according to the zoo Web site.   Finally there's 10-year-old Mjukuu, or ""Jookie."" Dan Simmonds, a keeper at the zoo's Gorilla Kingdom, says she ""has this 'butter wouldn't melt look' to her, and she gets away with murder.""  ""The other two females get along with her very well; she seems to have them all wrapped around her little finger.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the most unexpected controversies of the Obama administration came to a head Tuesday as the president delivered a hotly debated back-to-school speech to students across the country. President Obama speaks to students Tuesday at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia. Many conservatives expressed fear over the past week that the president's address would be used to push a partisan political agenda. Obama, however, avoided any mention of political initiatives. He repeatedly urged students to work hard and stay in school. ""There is no excuse for not trying,"" he told students at Wakefield High School in Arlington, Virginia.  Watch Obama speak to the students » . ""This isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future."" Read text of Obama's speech to students (pdf) Several Cabinet officials are slated to deliver similar messages at various schools across the country throughout the day. In the past week, news of Obama's speech had upset some parents. ""Thinking about my kids in school having to listen to that just really upsets me,"" suburban Colorado mother Shanneen Barron told CNN Denver affiliate KMGH last week, before the text of the speech was released. ""I'm an American. They are Americans, and I don't feel that's OK. I feel very scared to be in this country with our leadership right now."" But Amy Veasley, a parent from the Dallas, Texas, area, said Monday that she was surprised by the controversy. ""The president of our country wants to call our students to action. I'm not sure why parents wouldn't want their students to hear out the leader of our country,"" she said. A Baltimore, Maryland, teacher who asked not to be identified bemoaned the fact that the country has ""become so polarized that we believe that our president is an enemy and not our leader."" During George W. Bush's presidency, she said, ""whether I disagreed or not, I still saw him as a leader."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama's speech . White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday that ""it's a sad state of affairs that many in this country politically would rather start an 'Animal House' food fight rather than inspire kids to stay in school."" Some school administrators had decided to show the president's speech, but others decided against it. And others were leaving the decision in the hands of individual teachers. One school district in Toronto, Ohio, decided to air the speech live for students in the third grade and up but not show it to younger children, according to CNN affiliate WTOV. Nine out of 550 students attending the Toronto schools showing the speech chose not to watch it, WTOV noted. Toronto Superintendent Fred Burns said the parents of the nine children were concerned that the speech was too political.  Watch students respond to Obama's speech » . ""It's a very charismatic speech,"" Burns told WTOV. ""It's very much a speech to help kids get involved in education and finish school."" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a possible contender for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, said Sunday that Obama's speech could disrupt an already-hectic first day of school for many students. ""I think there's concerns about the disruption,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" calling the scheduling of the speech a ""little ham-fisted"" by the White House.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry talk about school speech uproar » . Education Secretary Arne Duncan, however, noted that Obama's speech was not unprecedented. President George H.W. Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington school in fall 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. In November 1988, President Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Some of the controversy over Obama's speech involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" Duncan said Sunday that the passage was poorly worded. Some politically conservative figures said they had no problem with Obama speaking to students about education. ""I think there is a place for the president ... to talk to schoolchildren and encourage"" them, former first lady Laura Bush told CNN Monday. Parents should follow Obama's example and ""encourage their own children to stay in school and to study hard and to try to achieve the dream that they have,"" she added. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that Obama's speech was a good idea if the message is a positive one about completing school. ""It is good to have the president of the United States say to young people across America, 'Stay in school, study, and do your homework,' "" Gingrich said. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer accused Obama last week of trying to ""indoctrinate America's children to his socialist agenda."" ""Now that the White House got their hand in the cookie jar caught, they changed everything,"" he said Monday. After reading the text, he said, ""My kids will be watching the president's speech, as I hope all kids will.""","President Obama speaks to students about education's importance .

"(CNN) -- Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi plans to form a new political party aimed at reining in the power of the Islamic Republic's leadership, a leading reformist newspaper reported Sunday. Mir Hossein Moussavi is reportedly seeking to form a new political party in Iran. Moussavi told supporters the party will be focused on upholding ""the remaining principles of the constitution,"" according to Etemad-e Melli, a newspaper aligned with fellow opposition candidate Mehdi Karrubi. He is expected to file papers with Iran's Interior Ministry to establish the party before hard-line incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is sworn in for a new term, the newspaper reported. The announcement comes after weeks of protests over Iran's disputed presidential election and an attempted clampdown by Iran's clerical leadership. The clerical leadership has declared Ahmadinejad the winner of that vote. Moussavi, a former prime minister, was the leading challenger to Ahmadinejad in the June 12 balloting. The official results showed Ahmadinejad winning with more than 62 percent of the vote. Moussavi and Karrubi have consistently rejected those results as fraudulent and demanded a new vote. Their supporters turned out in crowds estimated in the hundreds of thousands to demand the results be overturned. Iran's Guardian Council, which oversees the elections, has declared the official count will stand.","Mir Hossein Moussavi seeks to curb power of clerics, reformist newspaper reports .

"MOSCOW, Russia -- President Obama arrived in Moscow on Monday for a summit with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev aimed at trying to ""reset"" the U.S.-Russian relationship. But he also may have a less publicized goal: figuring out who's really in charge here. President Obama, right, and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev walk by an honor guard in Moscow on Monday. When Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, engaged in his first summit with his Russian counterpart, things took an odd turn. Bush said -- now infamously -- that he looked into then-President Vladimir Putin's eyes and saw into his soul, and basically found he was a good guy that Americans could do business with. Oops. The Bush-Putin relationship ended up getting pretty chilly, which is why the new U.S. president is now trying to warm things up. Obama gets his first shot at literally looking into Putin's eyes Tuesday, when he has a sitdown with the man who is now prime minister of Russia, a post that many international analysts believe allows Putin to continue to pull the strings behind the scenes. Obama's outreach to Medvedev started sooner, their first meeting coming back in April at the G-20 summit in London, and it's been bearing some fruit for Obama. Russia recently signed on to sanctions against North Korea, and this week both sides will officially announce that Russia has agreed to let U.S. military equipment headed for Afghanistan fly over Russian territory.  Watch Obamas arrive in Russia » . Both sides are also hoping to announce significant cuts in nuclear arms, though there are still major hurdles to clear, such as Russian suspicions about U.S. plans for a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe. In an interview with The Associated Press late last week, Obama seemed to be trying to work through the sticking points by driving a bit of a wedge between Medvedev and Putin. ""The old Cold War approaches to U.S.-Russia relations is outdated and that it's time to move forward in a different direction,"" said Obama. ""I think Medvedev understands that. I think Putin has one foot in the old ways of doing business and one foot in the new."" Ouch. If he wants to accomplish some key goals in Moscow, such as winning Russian cooperation in dealing with Iran's nuclear program, why would Obama fire a rhetorical shot like that at Putin -- if, in fact, he's really in charge here? It could be that Obama is trying to flex his muscles a bit for American domestic political consumption to show he's not rolling over to Russia, amid Republican charges that he's soft on foreign policy. It's a move Putin knows well, having perfected the art of flexing his muscles at then-President Bush as a way of asserting Russian nationalism in recent years.  Watch Russian students talk about Obama's visit » . Whatever the intention of Obama's words, the back and forth with Putin is a reminder of the high stakes here. Of course, the president's second stop in Italy for the G-8 summit will be important too, with a packed agenda including Iran, the financial crisis, climate change and eradicating world poverty. The first African-American president's third and final stop at the end of the week in Ghana will also get wide international attention. But it's this first stop where Obama will get a big diplomatic test as he juggles, among many issues, who's really in charge here.","President Obama meets with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Monday .

"URUMQI, China (CNN)  -- Reports of alleged syringe stabbings in a restive western Chinese city are generating a bit of panic, but doctors say some people have incorrectly concluded they were attacked with needles. People's Armed Police units equipped with armored personnel carriers take positions in Urumqi on Saturday. ""In the patients we have seen in the last couple of days, there are many which we believe were not actually punctured with needles,"" Wang Hanbin, a Peoples' Liberation Army doctor examining people in Urumqi, told reporters on Saturday at a briefing. Wang said about 20 cases are being investigated closely and samples were being taken to laboratories in Beijing for more testing. But, he said, ""many of the patients we have seen were mainly influenced by psychological factors."" Wang, a member of a six-person military medical panel reviewing the syringe-stabbing claims, attributes the false reports to widespread fear and lack of medical knowledge. ""Many of the patients did not actually see their attacker or the act of others attacking them with needles. Some patients who had needle puncture wounds experienced some discomfort in the area of the wound, and showed some symptoms, but couldn't give an accurate account of what they perceived to have been a needle attack."" This is the latest crisis plaguing Xinjiang province and its capital city of Urumqi, where tensions have boiled over between Uyghurs and Han Chinese. The Han Chinese are the country's dominant ethnic group, and the Uyghurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who consider Xinjiang their homeland. Ethnic Uyghurs have been blamed for the alleged syringe stabbings, and demonstrators clashed with police in Urumqi for two days this week over the issue. Protesters were demanding better police protection and a crackdown on the Uyghurs. The latest unrest left five people dead and 14 injured, according to Urumqi's deputy mayor, and the Communist party chief in the city has been dismissed from his job amid the crisis, according to state-run media reported.  Watch report on unrest in Urumqi from CNN's John Vause » . The Urumqi Public Prosecutors Office on Saturday said four ethnic Uyghurs were arrested in connection with three syringe-wielding incidents. At the press conference held by military medical personnel, the doctors said puncture wounds could not be found ""in a large percentage of the patients."" ""Some could have been bitten by insects such as mosquitoes, and in other cases there were moles, or skin pigmentation, and we couldn't find a needle puncture wound,"" said Wang, speaking at the news conference. ""Maybe they heard something from someone, then they discovered that they had a growth on their body. So, then they suspect that they may have been attacked with a needle and came to seek treatment. Some patients who came to seek treatment had some red marks or rash on their skin, but we didn't find any needle puncture wounds."" Wang urged people not to panic and urged them to immediately seek medical treatment if they think they were stabbed. He also said people need to educate themselves about medical care. Rumors have abounded in Urumqi of recent syringe stabbers trying to spread AIDS and other diseases. But another doctor, Duan Qing, explained at the briefing that would be impossible for there to be any such cases of AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or syphilis because there is a lengthy incubation period. ""Even if there are cases of such illnesses, they are unrelated to incidents. This is basic medical knowledge,"" she said. The three incidents that led to the arrests occurred in late August. A man admitted stabbing a female shopper with a pin on August 28. Authorities said a man and woman on August 29 stole money from a taxi driver after threatening him with a syringe. And in the third incident, a man resisting arrest stabbed a police officer with a syringe on August 31.","NEW: Many ""we believe were not actually punctured with needles,"" army doctor says .

"(CNN) -- There was a time when singer-actress LeAnn Rimes was considered as clean cut as they come. LeAnn Rimes, at the 2009 Lollapalooza Music Festival, is being spotted with Eddie Cibrian. Once hailed as a country music ingénue, she first captivated fans as a 13-year-old with a mature-beyond-her-years voice and a poised stage presence. After selling millions of records and amassing Billboard Music Awards and Grammys, Rimes was often held up as an example of a child star who managed to avoid the pitfalls of fame and emerge with a successful career and a happy marriage. Then rumors surfaced that she was allegedly having an affair with actor Eddie Cibrian. Now the two have both separated from their respective spouses and the ensuing scandal has cast a shadow over Rimes' wholesome, good-girl image. ""I kind of feel like the public's perception is changing towards her,"" said Lindsay Powers, staff editor for Us Weekly. ""She hadn't even announced [her] divorce yet and here she was on a beach in Cabo [San Lucas], wearing a little bikini with Eddie Cibrian rubbing suntan lotion all over her. She's like flaunting their relationship while her husband is piecing together his life in New York City on his own."" Such relationship woes among celebrities are as old as Hollywood itself. Stories of celebrity hookups on movie sets, be it Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the 1960s or Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in the 21st century, are the stuff of which tabloid dreams are made. But Rimes, who married former dancer Dean Sheremet in 2002 when she was 19 and he 21, seemed an unlikely candidate to star in such a drama. Unlike other young celebrity couples, Rimes and Sheremet were unlikely tabloid targets, choosing to live quietly and often being captured smiling and embracing on the red carpet. The pair appeared devoted to each other and seemed to take a swipe at critics of their young love when they reportedly held a ""seven year itch"" party to toast their union. In her book, ""What I Cannot Change,"" Rimes wrote glowingly of her spouse. ""My husband, Dean, has changed my heart -- and life -- in more ways than I can ever imagine,"" she wrote. ""We met in Los Angeles when I was hosting the Academy of Country Music Awards. It was almost an instant attraction."" Rumors began swirling about the singer and ""CSI: Miami"" actor Eddie Cibrian after they co-starred in the Lifetime movie ""Northern Lights."" During an interview with Matt Lauer in April on the ""Today"" show, Rimes sidestepped questioning about her relationship with Cibrian. ""I refuse to discuss tabloid rumors,"" Rimes said. ""I've grown up in the press my entire life. I think people are fascinated by my personal life, and I totally get it."" Soon after, Cibrian's wife and mother of his two young sons, Brandi Glanville, was quoted as demanding Rimes leave her husband alone. Now, Glanville is being as vocal about the breakup of her and Cibrian's marriage. She told PEOPLE in August that she sensed her husband was attracted to Rimes after double-dating with the singer and Sheremet. Rimes and Cibrian have been seen publicly golfing, vacationing and attending a concert. She announced on her Web site that she and Sheremet were ending their marriage. Jonathan L. Bernstein, president of Bernstein Crisis Management Inc., said fans are often very forgiving of stars for their bad behavior. ""The public is very tolerant of a wide range of behaviors from celebrities,"" said Bernstein. ""To the extent the public truly expected her to be someone with a clean-cut image, she may lose some fans there."" ""On the other hand, there are some people who like celebrities who lead racy, unpredictable lives, so she could gain fans at the same time."" Bernstein, the author of ""Keeping the Wolves at Bay; A Media Training Manual,"" said, ""Everybody wants to read the juicy gossip,"" but Rimes could mitigate potential damage to her career if she is real and does ""not pretend to be one thing and then be the other."" ""People like watching real-life soap operas,"" he said. ""Ultimately, if people love [Rimes'] singing, they are going to come to her concerts."" Us Weekly's Powers said Rimes and Cibrian's situation mirrors that of actress Tori Spelling and her husband, Dean McDermott. Like Rimes and Cibrian, Spelling and McDermott were both married to others when they met on the set of a Lifetime movie in 2005. Spelling and McDermott divorced their spouses, married and now are the parents of two children and stars of their own reality show on Oxygen network. As was the case with fans who rallied around Jennifer Aniston because they believed she had been wronged by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Powers said she believes Rimes' estranged husband, Sheremet, will emerge the winner of public sympathy. ""Celebrity history will show that people tend to feel bad for the person who is scorned,"" Powers said. ""I think people are always going to feel bad for [Sheremet] with the fact that LeAnn not only left him after seven years of marriage, but ran off with this man she met on the set of her movie."" Leslie Litzenberger of Santa Clara, California, has run the fan site Leannfans.com since 1995 and said the singer has a supportive fan base. All of the media surrounding Rimes has not decreased her admiration for the singer, Litzenberger said. ""The recent stories don't at all change how I feel about LeAnn,"" Litzenberger said. ""What has happened is between them. I love the person that she is and tabloid stories with quotes from supposed ""friends"" are not going to change that.""","LeAnn Rimes is divorcing her husband and has been spotted with co-star .

"(CNN) -- China has developed a vaccine for swine flu and is set to become the first country in the world to begin mass inoculations, but there are concerns over possible side effects, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. A swine flu vaccine has been approved in China and inoculations could begin in the next few weeks. WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl told CNN, ""We have to be ready for the fact that there might be adverse effects.""  ""No matter what vaccine you're looking at, sometimes there are extremely rare side effects. We don't even know what those are yet, but they will show up in one in every two or 10 million vaccinated.""  Inoculations could begin in the next few weeks, according to the South China Morning Post, before celebrations begin on October 1 to mark the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. The vaccine, PANFLU.1, was developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd and is suitable for people aged three to 60. Sinovac says the single-shot vaccine has been approved by China's National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products and has obtained the Certificate for the Release of Biological Products. It says more than five million doses will be ready by the end of September. The South China Morning Post reports Health Minister Chen Zhu as saying that some 200,000 people taking part in the anniversary celebrations will be the first to receive the vaccine. Others considered to be high priority are students aged five to 19, those with medical conditions, especially chronic respiratory and coronary diseases, and pregnant women. The inoculation program will also target medical staff and key workers, including police officers, soldiers and quarantine officials. Chen said on Tuesday that there have so far been 5592 recorded cases of H1N1 in China's 31 inland provinces, but no one has yet died from the illness. ""Due to the rising number of cases, especially since late August, we have indeed started seeing some serious cases,"" he said. The Post reported that there are plans to vaccinate 65 million people before the end of the year and that Chen admitted the amount of available vaccine was not nearly enough to inoculate the country's population of 1.3 billion people. The Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) last week approved two factories to produce the vaccine -- Sinovac, based in Beijing, and Hualan Biological Engineering, based in Henan -- according to the Post. But it reports the SFDA has announced that ""more qualified enterprises which could produce swine flu vaccines"" would be licensed by the end of September. Hartl said that in Europe, several drug firms are set to submit clinical trial data in the next few weeks, with GlaxoSmithKline likely to be among the first. Weidong Yin, CEO of Sinovac, said last week, ""With the support of the Ministry of Health, State SFDA, and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Sinovac was able to successfully and rapidly complete the clinical trials and registration process for the H1N1 vaccine.""","China has approved a swine-flu vaccine and is set to begin inoculations .

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Across the country, insurance companies, trial lawyers and legislators are closely watching a November referendum in the state of Washington that could change how insurers are required to treat their customers. Insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in Washington state. Insurance giants like Allstate, State Farm, Safeco and Farmers have poured more than $8 million into the referendum battle. Their goal is to convince voters to reject a law passed earlier this year that could force insurers to pay up to triple damages and lawyer fees if they fail to pay a legitimate claim and then lose in court. A ""yes"" vote on the referendum allows the law to go into effect while a ""no"" vote strikes the law down. Supporters of the law say it forces insurance companies to pay legitimate claims in a timely and fair fashion and frees the courts from relatively minor cases that clog the system for months and even years. One supporter, the Washington Trial Lawyers Association, has raised almost $900,000 to fight the insurance industry over the referendum. ""Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby. Kirby and his fellow Washington state lawmakers heard so many complaints from policy holders who believed insurers weren't treating them fairly that earlier this year they passed a law called ""The Fair Conduct Act."" Hearings were held, the bill was revised -- even watered down, according to Kirby -- and both the House and Senate passed it. The governor readily signed it. But the very next day a coalition, funded primarily by insurance companies, moved in to stop the law from going into effect by filing petitions for a voter referendum on the law. Representatives of the insurance industry say the law will raise premiums and that the system is working fine as it is. The law, they said, will only make things worse, and they want voters to have the final say. ""The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law. Childers said the state's own insurance commissioner sees no need for the law. ""His own information that he provided to the legislature and the public says that this law simply isn't necessary,'' Childers said. But that's not what Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler told CNN in a recent interview in Seattle. Kreidler said he strongly supports the new law and that if insurance companies act responsibly they have nothing to fear. ""If companies act in good faith, [they are] not going to have a problem,"" Kreidler said. ""It's not going to cost any more money. There's not going to be any legal action. There's going to be no treble damages, because if companies deal with their customers in good faith there's no penalty."" The campaign to woo voters has already begun. The insurance industry-backed group is already running television commercials depicting greedy lawyers planning to sue and warning consumers that the law will lead to frivolous lawsuits and higher rates. It's not a new tactic by the insurance companies. Earlier this year, CNN exposed a controversial insurance industry strategy that began in the mid-1990s. Former insiders say insurance companies began limiting or denying legitimate claims in minor injury cases and reaped billions in profits as a result. The strategy has tied up courts across the country -- over minor claims, judges told CNN -- for months and even years. How did they do it? ""It really came down to basically three elements: a position of delay, a position of denying a claim and ultimately defending that claim that you're denied,"" said Jim Mathis, a former insurance industry insider. But Robert Hartwig, with the industry-backed Insurance Institute, said the strategy was not intended to deny valid claims but to attack fraud, which, he claimed earlier this year, was rampant in minor accident cases. ""What insurers are doing is trying to monitor costs. And every insurance company is under the same pressure to do it,"" Hartwig said. Washington state resident Michelle Tribble plans to vote for the law because she says she has experienced the strategy first-hand. She says her two accidents convinced her insurance companies don't want to play fair. Tribble was working for an insurance company when she got rear-ended on the freeway. Ten weeks later she got hit again, this time by an uninsured motorist. The two accidents, she said, resulted in back injuries that required medical treatment. The first company agreed to pay but her own insurer, Allstate, refused to pay even though she had coverage. ""I just wanted my medical bills paid because I didn't want my credit being hurt,'' Tribble said, adding that the total came to about $18,000. She said Allstate dug into her medical past. ""They brought out stacks of medical records, you know, to see if I was at all deceptive."" An arbitrator sided with Tribble, but Allstate refused to pay. The case went to court, where a jury, too, ruled for Tribble. But Allstate appealed again. Finally, four years after the accident, the company paid her claim. Allstate said it could not comment on individual claims but said cases like Tribble's prove ""that the current judicial system is working.""

"(CNN) -- Samoa will switch its driving from the right side to the left side of the road on Monday in a move opponents have called ill-conceived and said will lead to dozens of wrecks and fatalities. Proponents tout the change, which no other country has attempted since the 1970s, as making economic sense. Thousands of angry Samoans protested in the streets, and one group -- People Against Switching Sides (PASS) -- unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the change in the country's Supreme Court. Opponents have also aired nightly ads depicting roadsides littered with crosses and vandalized newly-erected signs warning drivers to ""keep left."" Bus drivers have demanded the government compensate them to change the location of passenger door and the steering wheel. The nation has declared Monday and Tuesday holidays for people to adjust to the change and banned alcohol sales for the next three days. The government said it will strictly enforce the use of seat belts and has built speed bumps to prevent wrecks. Until now, most of the cars in the Pacific island nation have been imported from the United States, where drivers travel on the right side, and Samoa's neighbor, American Samoa. The change will allow the thousands of expatriate Samoans who live in their nation's biggest neighbors, New Zealand and Australia, to send used -- and therefore, cheaper -- cars to their families back home. In both those countries, drivers travel on the left side of the road. ""It narrows the bridge between the rich guys and people like us, the lower class people from the rural areas,"" Fa'aleaga Young Yen told CNN affiliate TVNZ in New Zealand.  Watch people speak out about the switch » . ""Just the freight alone cost me US $3,500 from Hawaii,"" he said. ""To send the same kind of car from New Zealand? NZ$1,400 (US$968)."" About 70 percent of the world's population drive on the right side of the road. But many countries -- primarily those that were once British colonies -- remain to the left. Many have gradually switched over the years, including Sweden in 1967, Iceland in 1968, Nigeria in 1972 and Ghana in 1974. All have gone from driving on the left side to the right. Samoa's case seems to be unique because it is steering in the opposite direction.","Samoa declares Monday, Tuesday holidays for people to adjust to change .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House released the text Monday of a controversial back-to-school speech to students from President Obama. The uproar over President Obama's back-to-school speech led the White House to release the transcript Monday. Many conservatives have expressed a fear that the address would be used to push a partisan political agenda. In the text of the speech, however, Obama avoids any mention of controversial political initiatives. He repeatedly urges students to work hard and stay in school. ""No matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it,"" he says. ""This isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country."" The text of the 18-minute speech was posted on the White House Web site so people can read it before its scheduled Internet broadcast to schoolchildren Tuesday. Read text of Obama's speech to students (pdf) Some of the president's critics have been adamantly opposed to the idea of an address by Obama to children. ""The president's speeches tend to be [about] what's wrong with the country and what can we do to fix it,"" said Bill Hogsett, a parent from Dallas, Texas. ""I believe this is the greatest country on Earth, and I try to teach that to my children. ... I don't want them hearing that there's a fundamental flaw with the country and the kids need to go forward to fix it."" Hogsett, who spoke Monday shortly before Obama's remarks were released, said he wanted to read the speech before making a final judgment. Amy Veasley, another parent from the Dallas area, said she was surprised by the controversy. ""The president of our country wants to call our students to action. I'm not sure why parents wouldn't want their students to hear out the leader of our country,"" she said. A Baltimore, Maryland, teacher who asked not to be identified bemoaned the fact that the country has ""become so polarized that we believe that our president is an enemy and not our leader."" During Bush's presidency, she said, ""whether I disagreed or not, I still saw him as a leader."" On Sunday, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that parents who are threatening to keep their children home Tuesday to avoid Obama's speech were being ""silly."" Appearing on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" Duncan emphasized that it is up to school officials whether to include the speech in the day's activities and that the message of the speech is simply to encourage children to finish school. ""That's just silly,"" he said of anyone planning to have their kids stay home because of the speech. ""They can go to school. They can not watch."" The speech is about ""the president challenging young people,"" Duncan asserted. Some school administrators have decided to show the president's speech, but others will not.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry talk about school speech uproar » . Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a possible contender for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, said Sunday that Obama's speech would disrupt an already-hectic first day of school for many students. ""I think there's concerns about the disruption,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" calling the scheduling of the speech a ""little ham-fisted"" by the White House.  Watch school reject Obama's speech on education » . ""There [are] also concerns about is this going to be done in an appropriate manner. I trust and hope that the White House will have a content that is not political and they're not using the public school infrastructure for that purpose."" Duncan, however, noted Obama's speech is not unprecedented. President George H.W. Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington school in fall 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. Read text of Bush's speech to students (pdf) In November 1988, President Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Read text of Reagan's speech to students (pdf) Some of the controversy over Obama's speech involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" Duncan said Sunday that the passage was poorly worded. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Obama's speech is a good idea if the message is a positive one about completing school. ""It is good to have the president of the United States say to young people across America, 'Stay in school, study, and do your homework,' "" Gingrich said. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer last week accused Obama of trying to ""indoctrinate America's children to his socialist agenda."" ""Now that the White House got their hand in the cookie jar caught, they changed everything,"" he said Monday. After reading the text, he said, ""My kids will be watching the president's speech, as I hope all kids will."" CNN's Lauren Kornreich and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this story.","Speech posted on Web site Monday for parents, pundits to view .

"Douglas Khayat is a psychologist for the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders//Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), working in Complexo do Alemao, one of the poorest and most violent favelas in Rio de Janeiro. RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil  -- An estimated 150,000 people live in Complexo do Alemao, where armed groups fight for turf, and fighting between police forces and ruling groups leave thousands of people trapped by violence. Complexo do Alemao, a poor area of Rio de Janeiro controlled by armed drug-dealers . There are no private or public health facilities inside Alemao and not even government ambulances enter. In this extremely violent corner of the world, residents live with a great deal of psychological trauma. In recognition of this trauma, Doctors Without Borders offers psychological support, in addition to the medical services we provide to the community in the favela. The people who call Alemao home live under a vow of silence, the unspoken code of survival that dictates that no one discuss what goes on inside the community particularly the violent episodes they endure or witness. Killings, beating, threats, expulsions, regular exposure to heavy weapons, and other forms of abuse, are all carried out by the armed groups that control the drug trafficking, imposing their own set of rules.   See images of life in the favelas » . Since October 2007, Doctors Without Borders psychologists have conducted 2,000 consultations for 1,000 different patients. For 85 percent of patients, suffering was directly related to violence. They have either been directly affected by combat, experienced the trauma of witnessing extreme violence, have had family members killed or tortured. The symptoms we mostly see are anxiety disorders, depression, psychosomatic conditions, and learning and behavior problems in children. When police enter the area, fighting often breaks out with armed groups. The state of fear created by these groups creates an environment in which psychological disorders multiply. Some get used to living this way, but others do not, particularly children.   See a report on healthcare in Brazil » . The needs are incredible, so are the stories. Last year a middle-aged man arrived at our project asking to see a psychologist. Two years earlier he suffered a series of tragic events that resulted in persistent insomnia and anxiety that almost ruined his family. He was crossing a football field holding hands with a female friend, not his wife, when suddenly a armored police car entered the community and began shooting. Everything happened in a matter of seconds. His girlfriend told him she was wounded. The shooting became so bad that he had to leave her to find shelter. She died and he could not stop blaming himself for leaving her in the middle of the field. It made his marriage hell. It started to affect his work and he began to have terrible nightmares. He started to drink a lot. But our treatment with him went really well. We helped him reevaluate others facets of his life and things started to get better, his marriage, his work. People around him reacted to his new attitude, and his life began to improve. The population trusts us because we live the same day-to-day routine they live. Our project is the only health facility inside Complexo do Alemao. During the day, we are exposed to the same environment as the residents. This experience in the same environment helps to develop a bond with our patients. For me as a Brazilian, as a middle class carioca (from Rio de Janeiro), it is difficult to experience this aspect of my country. I've grown angrier about the conditions in my city and country after doing this work. At the same time, it has been and continues to be a life changing experience, a possibility to dive into my country's soul and play an important part of people's lives.","Dr. Douglas Khayat describes life in one of Brazil's most violent favelas .

"Editor's note: We asked readers to weigh in on CNN.com Live producer Jarrett Bellini's vacation destination, and you chose South Africa. Check back for updates on his trip. Giraffes are a common sight in Kruger National Park. KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa (CNN) -- I spent two nights sleeping under a full-moon sky, nestled in my trusty hammock at Kruger National Park. Our guides provided us with tents, but I figured I wouldn't have too many opportunities in my life to slumber in the open bush on the African continent. Thus, I rested more or less exposed throughout the night, hoping that a lion wouldn't figure that he wouldn't have too many opportunities in his life to maul a sleeping American tourist in the open bush on the African continent. Needless to say, I survived, and it was magnificent. Visually speaking, I wasn't sure what, exactly, to expect from a South African safari, for my complete mental database of safari images spanned a wide variety of distinct landscapes, and most were cartoonishly obstructed by rich, middle-aged tourists covered head to toe in unnecessary beige safari gear. However, Kruger National Park seemed to fit, quite perfectly, my idea of the African savannah. Arid and brown from the winter dry season, it was a forever-long expanse of low trees and dusty earth, the kind that somehow allows the early sun to reflect that perfect glow of stunning reds and oranges. Our guide was a self-proclaimed African bushman named Elson, who seemed to have an amazing one-ness with both the land and the animals. We'd be driving down one of the many nondescript dirt roads at a fairly fast pace, only to have him hit the brakes of our jeep, slam into reverse and point out a leopard 200 yards away. It would take the rest of us a fair bit of time to finally see what he noticed at a mere passing glance. He knew the land, and he knew the animals -- a talent that proved helpful for finding the less common residents in the savannah. The other creatures carelessly came into view as though the roads and cars were just a natural part of their habitat, a mild annoyance at worst. iReport.com: Share your South Africa experiences and suggestions . Kruger National Park is roughly the same size as Israel, and here, many animals roamed right along the roadside, gnawing on whatever vegetation remained until the rainy season would flourish the plants anew. Seemingly endless miles of terrain, and there they were just feet away from us. If you didn't know you were in a national park, you might think you were in a zoo. That's how close the animals came to our jeep. Only, here, they weren't in separate enclosures, wandering aimlessly within an artificial terrain. This was truly their home, and we were only passing guests. Giraffes tore away at high branches. Elephants walked fearlessly, one-by-one across the road. Rhinos ... well, the rhinos pretty much just sat there looking stupid. But the zebras frolicked. The hippos splashed in the water. And the baboons stopped at nothing to make me laugh. Of course, the rare lions and leopards pretty much just shaded themselves under distant trees, and the crocs swam silently through the bog. But they were there. And we were there. And it was beautiful. And just as soon as it began, our time in the South African bush was over. A couple of giraffes and elephants met us by the roadside to bid our group farewell as we drove out of the park. The preserve faded silently behind us, and the road ahead paved my way to Swaziland for a short stopover before continuing to the second part of this South African journey.","CNN.com's Jarrett Bellini is traveling in South Africa .

"ANTIOCH, California (CNN) -- In many respects, Jaycee Dugard and her two daughters lived an unremarkable public life -- one that belied the horrifying circumstances that have since made front-page news. Dugard's daughters attend a birthday party two weeks ago. CNN has blurred their faces to protect their privacy. Dugard, kidnapped 18 years ago in South Lake Tahoe, California, helped manage the small printing company her alleged captor, Phillip Garrido, ran from his home in Antioch, east of San Francisco. Her two daughters, fathered by 58-year-old Garrido, attended birthday parties and, like many girls their age, shared a love for the TV show ""Hannah Montana."" The media ""made it seem like these little girls were living like wolves or jungle kids in the backyard dungeon. Perhaps that's it, but they didn't give that visual to me,"" said Cheyvonne Molino, who runs an auto wrecking yard with her husband.  See photos of Dugard's living conditions » . Garrido would often bring the girls by the yard, delivering bottles of water on hot days. The 11-year-old went by the name Angel and the 15-year-old, Starlet. ""They were polite. They were well-mannered,"" Molino said. Two weeks ago, the girls attended a birthday party for Molino's daughter, who turned 16. Again, they showed no signs of lives lived in turmoil. Customers of Garrido's printing company, Printing for Less, knew the girls' mother as Allissa.  Watch interview with Garrido » . They spoke to her about graphic design, business cards and fliers, and describe her as professional, polite and responsive. ""She was always having a very pretty smile on the face,"" said Deepal Karunaratne, who had real estate brochures printed. ""She comes and talks to me and was always smiling. She was a very pretty girl, a very pretty young lady."" The children, however, sometimes stood out. ""They were not dressed like average teenage girls. They were dressed very conservatively,"" Karunaratne said. Another customer, Ben Daughdrill, sometimes corresponded with Dugard when he used the printing service for his junk-hauling business. ""Nothing stood out,"" he said. ""Obviously, there was some brainwashing going on. That's all I can think. She had access to a phone and a computer, so obviously something went on that no one knows about."" Dugard's real identity was discovered last week and her alleged kidnappers -- Garrido, a registered sex offender, and his 55-year-old wife, Nancy -- were arrested. They face 29 felony charges, including rape and kidnapping, and both have pleaded not guilty. Authorities said the Garridos held Dugard and her daughters in a soundproof shed in the couple's overgrown, littered backyard. Garrido told Karunaratne that he had a soundproof recording studio in the backyard, said Karunaratne, who described Garrido's music as ""Christian, contemporary"" and said some songs ""were about love and romance.""  Watch aerial view of backyard compound » . Dugard and her mother and daughters have moved to an undisclosed location as they try to get reacquainted, said Carl Probyn, Dugard's stepfather. A team of psychologists and several law enforcement officers are with them, he said. In a related development, authorities in two San Francisco Bay-area cities are investigating whether disappearances dating back to the late 1980s could be connected to Garrido. Police in Hayward, about 20 miles south of Oakland, say they are investigating whether he is connected to the disappearance of Michaela Garecht, last seen in 1988 at age 9. Hayward Police Lt. Chris Orrey said there are similarities between Garecht's disappearance and Dugard's -- similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembles Garrido, she said. Orrey said there were differences as well, though she would not elaborate. But she said Hayward police have been in contact with Garecht's family and witnesses since Dugard was found alive last week. And in Dublin, about 25 miles east of Oakland, police are looking into whether Garrido was connected to the 1989 disappearance of Ilene Misheloff. Ilene was 13 when she was abducted, investigators said. Investigators announced Saturday that they were looking into whether Garrido may have been behind other unsolved crimes. Contra Costa County Sheriff's Lt. Steve Simpkins said police in Antioch and neighboring Pittsburg were searching Garrido's property ""for evidence relating to open cases."" Authorities brought cadaver dogs to search the property next door to the Garridos as they tried to determine whether Garrido was connected to a string of unsolved slayings of prostitutes in the 1990s. Several of the women's bodies were dumped near a park where Garrido worked at the time.  Watch where police are searching » .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- In Pakistan's combustible Swat Valley, some girls refuse to wear uniforms so they can make it to school without being harmed. Shiza Shahid, left, a 20-year-old Stanford University student, is helping to teach young girls in Pakistan. Other girls hide textbooks in their shawls to escape harassment. School-age girls are among the victims in the fierce fighting between government soldiers and Taliban militants in the Swat Valley. The Pakistani government said it has flushed much of the Taliban out of the area, but some fighting persists. Many girls remain banned from schools. Dozens of their schools have been bombed, and militants have burned books. A new program has taken 26 girls out of the battle-scarred region to Islamabad for a 10-day retreat, where they can learn in safer surroundings. A group of college students of Pakistani background is helping the girls. Among them are Shiza Shahid, 20, from California's Stanford University, who organized the program called Shajar-e-llm, or Tree of Knowledge. Shahid said she was moved to help after hearing about how the girls struggled to get an education. ""I think we were so angry, upset and emotional that we decided we have to do something,"" she said.  Watch as Shahid says she had to act to help the girls » . Though well-intentioned, the program sometimes seems disorganized. ""We need support. We need unfortunately more organization, more of the bureaucratic nitty-gritty that you don't want to do, but you have to,"" Shahid said. ""We are young, and that does come with the burden as not being equally trusted or seen as capable."" Nonetheless, the group has ambitions for a boys' learning retreat as well. The lessons are simple enough -- confidence-building exercises, critical-thinking lessons -- all framed in the context of Islamic values. The girls -- ages 11 to 14 -- spoke about their dreams. One wants to meet a poet; another wants to learn calligraphy. Another wants to grow up to lead Pakistan. ""I want to become president and rule this country in a good way,"" said 12-year-old Malila. One day during the retreat, the girls were taught a song about freedom of speech. As a guitarist strummed, the girls sang that God gives everyone the right to free speech and no one can take it away. Free speech seemed to end with the song, however. The girls could not risk talking about Taliban harassment, because the militants' version of Islamic law lingers. Such Islamic law, or shariah, also keeps females from going to school or going outside without their husbands. The United Nations estimates that 375,000 Swat Valley residents fled their homes during fighting that started in April. In all, 2.5 million Pakistanis were displaced in what was said to be one of the largest human migrations in recent history. Many residents have returned to their homes, but peace has not been completely restored to the region. And soon, the girls at the learning retreat will return home to the Swat Valley as well. Organizers said they hope the girls will carry a new love for education. ""There were tears and there were tough moments,"" said Madihah Akhter, a volunteer with the program. ""But the girls surprised me. They were really resilient. They were beyond their years.""","Schoolgirls victims of fighting between Pakistani soldiers and Taliban in Swat Valley .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz could lose the right to her entire portfolio of world-famous photographs if she doesn't meet a Tuesday deadline to pay back a $24 million loan she is alleged to owe. Annie Leibovitz appears before her photo of Demi Moore during an exhibition of her work in June in Madrid, Spain. Leibovitz, who has photographed everyone from the Rolling Stones to Queen Elizabeth II, put her art, intellectual property and even real estate assets up for collateral last year when she consolidated her massive debts. Art Capital Group, which restructured the debts, says Leibovitz agreed ""to make Art Capital her 'irrevocable exclusive agent'"" of the assets ""in exchange for a reduced interest rate on the loan."" Now the company is suing Leibovitz for breach of contract, saying she has ""refused to cooperate in the sale of those assets,"" according to a question-and-answer sheet on the lawsuit issued by Art Capital. It also says she has ""refused to pay to Art Capital hundreds of thousands of dollars she owed as part of the same agreement."" Asked by CNN for comment, Leibovitz's attorney, Steven Brawer, said, ""I don't have anything I can tell you."" They have until October 1 to respond to the lawsuit. In the question-and-answer sheet, Art Capital says Leibovitz ""acknowledged that in order to repay the loan she would sell her fine art, intellectual property and real estate assets. She authorized Art Capital to act as agent in the sale of those assets through which Art Capital could recoup its decrease in interest rate. She would have realized a significant gain from that sale."" It says the loan agreement gave Art Capital ""the right to sell the collateral before the loan came due on September 8 and for a two-year period thereafter."" One of Leibovitz's best known photos is of John Lennon with his wife, Yoko Ono, shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980. She is no stranger to controversy. In 1991, Leibovitz photographed a nude and extremely pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair. The issue, considered scandalous at the time, was sold in many places nationwide with a sheath of white paper. Last year, Leibovitz photographed Disney star Miley Cyrus wrapped in a bedsheet, eliciting claims that the photographer pressured the teen queen into poses that were too provocative for her young age. In July, Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz, including its right to sell her art and real estate. If the court agrees with Art Capital, it means Leibovitz could end up owing far more than she did originally. Art Capital has asked for an unspecified amount of damages in addition to the money it says the photographer originally borrowed. Art Capital -- through its affiliate, American Photography -- provides financial and consulting services to artists, galleries and art owners, and offers loans based on their intellectual property and fine art assets.","Photographer Annie Leibovitz faces Tuesday deadline to pay back $24 million loan .

"(CNN) -- Will Michael Jackson stop the world? Fans have set up impromptu shrines to Michael Jackson, including this one at his family's house. Thousands are expected to swamp Los Angeles, California, to mourn him Tuesday at the Staples Center, and the accompanying media crush will be enormous. The tribute to the King of Pop at Harlem's Apollo Theater earlier this week drew coverage from all over the world, along with a public turnout in the thousands. Given the feverish interest in all things Jackson, the Los Angeles memorial could be one of the most-viewed events of all time. ""This will obviously be a huge media event, and with Web streams of the funeral, it may be impossible to say for sure how many people watched once all is said and done, because there's still no comprehensive way to measure Web viewing,"" said Toni Fitzgerald, of Media Life, in an e-mail interview. A handful of events have earned the kind of worldwide coverage to put the world on pause, if only for a moment. The 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy ""had the nation locked in a trance for two or three days,"" recalled TV critic Ed Bark of UncleBarky.com. The world audience for the Apollo 11 moon landing has been estimated in the hundreds of millions. The BBC estimated 2.5 billion people watched the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana.   Watch Jermaine Jackson talk about his brother's legacy » . The numbers are easily exaggerated -- nobody knows how many people are watching in groups or in public places -- and the Web has complicated matters further. But in a multichannel, satellite TV, computer-and-cell phone world, the Jackson memorial could have an audience in the hundreds of millions. It was first believed the event would take place at Jackson's Neverland Ranch. But the family announced Thursday that it will hold a private ceremony Tuesday, and then a massive public memorial service at the Staples Center. Fans had until 6 p.m. Saturday to register for free tickets to the memorial service. Organizers used a computer to choose 8,750 names from 1.6 million who registered since Friday.   Watch a tour of Neverland » . ""You have to go back to the Beatles, the death of John Lennon perhaps, and the death of Elvis Presley to find a comparable figure in, not just pop music, but pop culture,"" said Entertainment Weekly critic-at-large Ken Tucker. (EW, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) ""And Jackson so self-consciously turned himself into not just an American pop icon but a global pop icon. I think this does have worldwide implications and interest.""  See how interest in Jackson's music has skyrocketed » . The circumstances of Jackson's death have led to  comparisons with Presley's in 1977, but in terms of coverage, the two can't compare. The news wasn't even the top story on CBS' ""Evening News,"" Bark recalled, and there certainly wasn't wall-to-wall nationwide live coverage of his funeral. A public viewing drew about 30,000 fans; the funeral, two days after his death, was held in Graceland's living room. But Bark said there are parallels, at least in terms of coverage, with the Kennedy assassination. ""These days it's so much harder to get a bulk audience on any given venue the way the [broadcast networks] did back then, but still the enormity [of the event] -- it's the syndicated tabloid shows ... and TMZ and all the cable networks devoting lots of attention to it, [and] the broadcast networks can't seem to do enough specials in prime time,"" said Bark. ""I do think it's comparative but in a very different way."" Officially, the sorts of events that have attracted the largest mass audiences have been scheduled entertainment or sports programs. Sixty percent of America watched the 1983 ""M*A*S*H"" finale; more than half watched the 1980 ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of ""Dallas"" and the 1977 ""Roots"" conclusion. The Beatles' first appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" in 1964 drew about 45 percent of the country. The Super Bowl is routinely the year's most watched program, with audiences north of 80 million -- about 40 percent of U.S. television households. Although interest in Jackson has been high, the number of viewing choices (and, perhaps, the traditional decline in summer viewing) has kept the ratings for individual Jackson-oriented shows down. ""Jackson's death came up in just about every conversation I had from Thursday to Sunday, and yet only 5 million people tuned in to some of those broadcast specials,"" Media Life magazine's Fitzgerald observed. Still, the public memorial service might be different. ""I expect you'll see very big tune-ins on the cable news networks and on BET, if they cover it; they had huge numbers for their BET Awards focused on Jackson over the weekend,"" Fitzgerald said. The BET Awards was watched by 10.7 million, the most ever for a cable awards show. ""With the celebrity factor thrown into the funeral, who'll be there, who'll talk, I would guess tens of millions in the U.S. will watch it on TV,"" she said. It is certain is that the news media will be there in force. ""I guess we're all going to wait and see what the spectacle is,"" Bark said. ""There may be no precedent for this.""","Public memorial Tuesday could be one of the most-viewed events of all time .

"(CNN) -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity. Rifqa Bary, 17, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July. She claims her father threatened to kill her. The 17-year-old girl, Rifqa Bary, ran away from her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July and took refuge in the home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando, Florida. Bary's parents want her back home. At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them. Also at the hearing, Judge Daniel Dawson of the Orange County Juvenile Court ordered the girl and her parents to seek the mediation within 30 days. The judge had previously ruled that the girl will remain in Florida foster care until the allegations are resolved. The parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them. They denied they ever threatened to kill their daughter because she converted to Christianity. Mohamed Bary told CNN he believes a lot of false information has been circulated about the case. ""We wouldn't do her harm,"" the father said, adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations. ""I have no problem with her practicing any faith,"" he said. But Bary conceded he would have preferred that his daughter practice the Muslim faith first. The teen had heard of pastor Lorenz and his church through a prayer group on Facebook. The girl's parents reported her missing to Columbus police, who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records. The teenager, in a sworn affidavit, claims her father, 47, was pressured by the mosque the family attends in Ohio to ""deal with the situation.""

"(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With irresponsible banking practices taking the blame for bringing about the global economic crisis, there has been a surge of interest in Islamic finance. Islamic finance is estimated to be worth $700 billion and has been growing by 15 to 20 percent per year. Now, a slew of academic courses are springing up to meet the demand of those wanting to break into an expanding market. According to ratings agency Moody's, the global Islamic finance sector is worth $700 billion and has the potential to be worth $4 trillion. What's more, the ethical principles underpinning Islamic finance are seen by some as offering a more sustainable alternative to profit-oriented conventional banking. The result is that academic institutions are lining up to offer formal training in the area. ""There is a huge demand for Islamic finance courses now, so large that it's difficult to cope with,"" Professor Habib Ahmed, Sharjah chair in the school of government and international affairs at Durham University, England, told CNN. Durham will launch a Masters degree in Islamic finance from October, becoming one of a number of European institutions to offer Islamic finance programs. ""Islamic finance has been growing by 15 to 20 percent per year for some time and there is a lot of interest at the moment. People are looking for alternatives after the economic crisis."" ""Islamic economists believe that if the principles of Islamic finance were followed the crisis wouldn't have happened. We are seeing a lot of non-Muslim countries, including the UK, France, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore encouraging Islamic finance,"" he said. There are many differences between Islamic and conventional banking practices. One fundamental difference is that Islamic banks do not charge interest. Rather than borrowers and lenders, the system is based on buyers and sellers. ""Conventional banking is biased to the seller. Islamic finance is trying to level the ethics between the two parties,"" Aly Khorshid, an Islamic finance scholar who writes for Islamic Banking and Finance magazine, told CNN. ""People think the Islamic system is based on faith, but it's based on justice. The system is based on justice for the two parties and how you get to the justice is extracted from Islamic faith,"" he said. Khorshid said that there are similarities between ""ethical investment"" schemes and Islamic finance, in that the Islamic system does not allow investment that harms people or the environment. He credits the rapid growth of the Islamic finance sector on the success of ""sukuk"" -- Islamic bonds. In the West, banks including Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and Citibank all offer Islamic finance products, catering to a niche market of Muslim borrowers. But while Islamic banks allow Muslims to take advantage of financial services that are consistent with their religious beliefs, it is the ethics underpinning Islamic finance that are attracting the interest of conventional finance institutions keen to learn lessons from the banking crisis. Although Islamic banks have suffered from the global repercussions of the economic downturn, they emerged largely unscathed from the initial banking meltdown that brought about that financial turmoil. Ahmed told CNN that is because Islamic banks are not allowed to deal in mortgage-backed securities or credit-default swaps, two of the practices accused of helping bring about the banking crisis. Khorshid said that although it's too early to say if Islamic finance has dealt with economic downturn better than conventional finance, the Islamic system has many more layers of risk assessment and management, which could help protect it from the problems afflicting conventional banks. But the growth of Islamic finance has brought its own problems. Critics say some banks use Islamic finance to package what are essentially conventional products. ""Islamic banks are also driven by the profit motive and sometimes that can dominate the ethics,"" Ahmed told CNN. While Europe is catching up with the demand for these banking products, the U.S. is lagging behind. Ahmed says that regulatory and legal changes are needed for Islamic finance to grow in the U.S., but he adds there are signs that Canada may become a North American center for Islamic finance. The lack of Islamic finance services in the U.S. is reflected in a relative lack of demand for Islamic finance courses, but in the UK there is the opposite problem. With students coming from Asia and the Middle East to get the qualifications that will help them take advantage of the Islamic finance boom, Ahmed says it is difficult for universities to find qualified teaching staff. ""Most people with PhDs in Islamic finance are working in the industry, making a lot of money,"" he told CNN. He added that Islamic finance products have the potential to appeal to the non-Muslims market, pointing out that in Malaysia the majority of customers for Islamic banks aren't Muslims. ""If people look at the principles they'll see something beneficial in terms of economics, rather than just religious reasons. It's a type of ethical finance that may be attractive to a lot of people.""","There is an increase in demand for academic courses in Islamic finance .

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A black politician campaigning in eastern Germany has become the victim of a racist campaign by a far-right party. Zeca Schall says he is not thinking of leaving Germany despite the threats. The National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) says it is trying to persuade Zeca Schall, a German citizen who came from Angola 21 years ago, to leave the country. Schall is a member of the Christian Democratic Union, the party led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and has been named as a CDU expert for the integration of minorities. The NPD's Web site calls Schall the CDU's ""quota negro"" and urges him to leave the country. ""The CDU seems to be realizing that even after years of re-education, negroes cannot be accepted as permanent guests in our state,"" said the NPD, which goes by its German initials.  Watch more about the campaign against Schall » . Schall told CNN he had never before been subjected to such a level of racial hatred. ""I am shocked,"" he said Thursday at a campaign event in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia. ""I simply cannot believe that people would do this to fellow humans."" Schall, who appears on a CDU election poster, said he is scared. ""I have police patrolling at my house day and night, and some officers stay in my house overnight,"" he said. But Schall said he is not thinking of leaving Germany and the CDU said he has the party's full support. Schall and the CDU said they have filed a lawsuit against the NPD. The situation escalated Wednesday when the NPD's national leadership held a rally in Schall's adopted hometown of Hildburghausen. Party Chairman Udo Voigt tried to speak with Schall ""and persuade Mr. Schall that he is needed more in Angola than in Germany,"" the NPD said in a news release. Police sent to protect Schall stopped the NPD's representatives from accessing Schall's premises. He is campaigning for the CDU for a state election in Thuringia, which is in the former communist East Germany. Right-wing extremism is generally a bigger problem in eastern Germany than in the west of the country, and citizens of Hildburghausen told CNN that, though most people support the politician, fascism is a problem in the area. ""Of course we have a base of right-wingers here,"" a passer-by said at the market in the town's center. But most of those questioned by CNN denounced the campaign against Schall and said he is a respected member of the community. ""I am not only a member of the CDU, I am also a voluntary firefighter at the local department,"" Schall said. Frank Schwerdt, the NPD's leader in Erfurt, tried to downplay the events. ""This is not a personal campaign against Mr. Schall,"" Schwerdt said. ""We simply feel that many citizens don't want foreigners to have a say in our politics."" The NPD has been under surveillance by Germany's Office for the Protection of the Constitution for alleged contacts with illegal neo-Nazi groups. However, past efforts to ban the party have failed on technical grounds. The NPD denies ties to illegal groups. But members of the Christian Democratic Union told CNN that, since the racist campaign started against Schall, he has received several death threats and the party will no longer allow him to do media interviews because of the risks. At Thursday's campaign event in central Erfurt, increased police presence was noticeable and CDU members said plainclothes officers had been dispatched among the crowd.","National Democratic Party of Germany trying to persuade Zeca Schall to leave country .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The struggle over health care reform intensified Thursday as President Obama sought to build on what administration officials hoped was new momentum generated by his prime-time address to Congress. In his address to Congress on Wednesday, President Obama pushed for the government to help the uninsured. Republican leaders ripped the president's Wednesday night speech, arguing that he had botched a unique opportunity to build bipartisan consensus and offer specifics on his long-awaited plan. ""Now is the time to act,"" Obama told an audience near the White House. ""We have talked this issue to death. ... The time for talk is winding down. The time for bickering is past."" The president was joined by representatives of the American Nurses Association, which has strongly endorsed the passage of a healthcare bill incorporating the president's ideas. Obama repeated several reform principles outlined in his Wednesday night address, including the need for all Americans to have access to coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions. He again insisted that his plan will provide ""more security and stability to those who have insurance,"" extend it to those who don't and slow the rate of growth in health care costs. He reiterated his call to cap out-of-pocket costs and create a health insurance exchange in which individuals and small businesses can pool resources to help bargain for lower coverage costs. iReport.com: ""Obama's speech lacked courage"" Obama has also pushed for the federal government to provide greater financial assistance to those who can't afford insurance. The president's latest call for reform came as the Census Bureau released new data showing that the number of people without health insurance rose from 45.7 million in 2007 to 46.3 million in 2008. All Americans would be required by law to have health insurance under Obama's proposal, which the administration has projected to cost $900 billion over 10 years. The requirement, Obama noted Wednesday night, would be similar to mandatory auto insurance in most states. Businesses would also be required to either offer health care coverage to workers or contribute to covering their costs of obtaining coverage.  CNN's political analysts respond to Obama's speech » . Top congressional Republicans declared Thursday that they remain staunchly opposed to Obama's plan. They also accused the president of delivering an intensely partisan speech to Congress that unfairly maligned opponents and distorted basic facts. ""I thought the speech was partisan, uninformative, disingenuous and not likely to encourage those who have honest disagreements with him to be able to work toward some kind of common solution,"" said Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl, R-Arizona. Kyl complained that Obama had made it tougher to reach common ground by constantly referring to opponents' ""unyielding ideological"" arguments and ""bogus claims."" ""Nobody can have a disagreement with him based upon a valid difference of opinion,"" Kyl said. ""It's always the other -- the motive of the other individual is a bogus motive."" Among other things, Kyl disputed Obama's claims that the Democratic plan won't add to the federal deficit. ""He wasn't referring to either the House or Senate bill that have gone through committee, because [the Congressional Budget Office] has projected that both of them have a deficit,"" he said. ""So somehow there's going to be a different bill, which is going to solve that deficit problem, I gather, but we didn't hear any detail about that."" Health care legislation has cleared three committees in the House of Representatives, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. It is currently under consideration by the Senate Finance Committee. Kyl also took issue with Obama's claim that people will have the option of keeping their current coverage if they like it. ""It's not true under the bills. Even if you like your insurance, there's a good chance you won't be able to keep it,"" Kyl claimed. Democrats and Republicans remain deeply divided over the question of whether to allow for a government-run public health insurance option. The president continued to stress his preference for such an option Thursday, saying it would force private insurers to lower costs. But he has repeatedly referred to the provision as only one alternative for increasing competition for health insurance and signaled his openness to ideas. Republicans are unanimous in opposing a public option, calling it an unfair competitor that would drive private insurers from the market and lead to a government takeover of health insurance. Obama has rejected that claim as a false allegation intended to scare people. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a strong supporter of the public option, insisted Thursday that such a provision would save ""tens of billions of dollars"" in health-care expenses. But the speaker, who has insisted that a health care bill cannot pass the House without a public option, also indicated that she doesn't consider the provision ""non-negotiable."" At a separate news conference, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, argued that if a nonprofit health care cooperative successfully expands competition and ""makes the insurance companies honest ... that would fill the bill."" The speaker nevertheless skewered the Republican opposition for failing to provide what she claimed was a reasonable alternative. Opponent of reform ""hit us with their best shot"" during the August congressional recess, she said, and their attacks amounted to little more than ""distortion"" and ""misrepresentation."" Pelosi also criticized Rep. Joe Wilson, the South Carolina Republican who heckled Obama on Wednesday night by shouting ""You lie!"" when the president denied that health care legislation would provide free coverage for illegal immigrants. The ""episode was unfortunate,"" and Wilson's remarks were ""stunning to hear,"" Pelosi said. But given Wilson's subsequent apology, she said, ""it's time to move on."" Both Democrats and Republicans have criticized Wilson for what they called a show of disrespect toward the president. Shortly after the speech ended, Wilson issued a statement that apologized for his ""inappropriate and regrettable"" comments. Obama said Thursday that he accepted Wilson's apology. ""I'm a big believer that we all make mistakes,"" the president noted during a Cabinet meeting. But it's important to have a debate ""without vitriol. ... Our goals are generally the same whether we're Democrats or Republicans."" Wilson insisted that his outburst was ""spontaneous"" and agreed with the White House that the health care debate merits ""a civil discussion."" One top Republican, however, also opined that Wilson's outburst reflected the strong passion being generated by the health care debate. ""We ought to have civil discourse in America, but don't underestimate the amount of emotion that people are feeling,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner said.","NEW: Republicans say Obama missed opportunity to build consensus .

"(Mental Floss) -- Even in the midst of the Civil War, there was still one thing the North and South shared -- a serious addiction to caffeine. Confederate troops were less likely to get a cup of coffee. In that respect, the Union clearly had an advantage. Not only did the North have more than two-thirds of the population and control most of the heavy industry, railroads, and financial reserves in the country, it hoarded supplies of the highly addictive little bean, leaving the Confederacy to wage its own war against java deprivation. Coffee: It's what's for breakfast, lunch and dinner . Throughout the Civil War, coffee was as prevalent on the battlefields as it is in offices today. In fact, the Union army was fueled by the stuff to the point that, if there was no time to boil water, the Boys in Blue would chew on whole beans as they marched. And at night, Union campsites were dotted with tiny fires, each boiling a pot of coffee like a million miniature Starbucks. Beyond caffeine cravings, Union troops loved their coffee because it was, literally, the best thing on the menu. Before the advent of helpful (and tasty!) artificial preservatives, a marching soldier's rations were neither varied nor particularly appetizing. Typically, they consisted of salted meat, unleavened bread (accurately christened ""hardtack""), and a little sugar and salt. It didn't help that Union supply chains were riddled with corrupt food contractors who charged the government top dollar for rotten, stale, and insect-ridden foodstuffs. Coffee, however, was almost always fresh because it was delivered in whole-bean form -- making it difficult for even the most dishonest supplier to skimp on quality. Not that they didn't try, of course. In fact, officials began requesting coffee as whole beans after some crooked contractors tried to up their per-pound profits by slipping sand and dirt into packages of ground coffee. In 1861, hoping to cut down on the time soldiers spent roasting and grinding beans, the army switched to a concentrated proto-instant coffee. The new concoction, called ""essence of coffee,"" was made by boiling prepared coffee, milk, and sugar into a thick gloop, which soldiers then reconstituted by mixing it with water. The product reportedly tasted every bit as bad as you'd imagine, and thanks to the corrupt dairymen who sold the army spoiled milk, it also tended to cause diarrhea. Needless to say, the Union army was soon back on the bean. Southern discomfort . Noxious as essence of coffee was, Confederate soldiers would have gladly downed a cup or two. But, because of a Union naval blockade, coffee (along with weapons, machinery, medicine, and other vital materials) was in short supply in the South. Before the war, a pound of beans would have set you back around 20 cents in Yankee dough. Once pre-war stockpiles ran out, however, the same amount was running as high as $60 in Confederate money. (Despite the undervalued currency, that was still a lot.) There was some coffee that made it into the Confederacy -- usually carried by steam-powered blockade-runner ships. But, for the most part, Southerners had to rely on coffee substitutes, including various forms of roasted corn, rye, okra seeds, sweet potatoes, acorns, and peanuts. Unfortunately, all these imitations lacked potency, tasted awful, and upset the bowels. The only slightly better alternative was tea made from the leaves of the native yaupon shrub. The good news was that it contained caffeine; the bad news was that it was incredibly difficult to digest. Luckily, there was one surefire way for Southern folk to get their coffee -- by making peace with the Union. Soldiers on the front lines often called informal truces so Rebels could swap tobacco for Yankee coffee and then dash back to their camps before they were reported missing. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- More than two dozen times in the past three years, authorities came to Phillip and Nancy Garrido's ramshackle home at 1554 Walnut Ave. in Antioch, California, a rural property where Jaycee Dugard is said to have been confined for 18 years. Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. And each time, they left without learning of the secret shed where Dugard lived. The Garridos have pleaded not guilty to charges of abduction and forcible rape. They are being held without bail in the Contra Costa County Jail in Martinez, California. After she was abducted in June 1991, at age 11, Dugard's disappearance spawned a massive search that continued, on and off, for almost two decades. Federal agents remained committed to the case, chasing thousands of leads. But they apparently never had the Garridos on their radar. The case of the missing girl evoked deep emotions that rippled across the South Lake Tahoe community. Strangers threw fundraisers and parades to raise money for search efforts. Friends and neighbors wore T-shirts bearing images of Dugard's smiling face to give the case exposure. Elementary school students toted signs that encouraged the community to stay committed to the hunt for their classmate. All they wanted was to find little Jaycee Lee Dugard. And for some of that time, authorities were visiting the home of the couple now accused of abducting her.  Watch an FBI agent talk about why clues were missed » . Interviews with public officials show that parole officers, law enforcement officials and firefighters visited the Garrido household but left without realizing that the kidnapped girl had grown to adulthood and was living in a soundproof shed hidden in the backyard. Two Dozen Contacts . There were at least 16 visits from parole officers and seven by the fire department. There was also one by the sheriff's office responding to an allegation that people were living in the backyard. State and local authorities have now begun internal investigations to find out why none of these visits uncovered the existence of Dugard, now 29, and her children, Starlet, 15, and Angel, 11. Their makeshift home of tents, tarps and sheds was tucked behind a 6-foot wall at the rear of the Garrido property. ""I feel confident the sheriff will use this as an example of how to do things better,"" said Federal Glover, a district supervisor for Contra Costa County who also heads the community's public safety committee. ""From this lesson, we will not have this type of missed opportunity occur again."" One of the first red flags authorities might have caught was in 1993, two years after the kidnapping. Garrido, who had been released from prison after serving 11 years for a 1976 kidnapping, violated his parole in April 1993. It is unclear what he did or how the violation was flagged. As a result, he was placed in federal prison for one month and then released on house arrest for three months. He returned to the Antioch home, where he lived with his wife and his elderly mother. Violation Wasn't Reported to Nevada . But the parole violation was never reported to the state of Nevada, where the first kidnapping and rape had occurred, said Gail Powell, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Public Safety. ""The state of Nevada would have taken some action,"" Powell said. ""I don't know what, but some action could have meant putting him back in prison, pulling him off parole."" In 1999, the California Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections agreed to take responsibility and authority for supervising Garrido's parole because he resided in that state. Garrido's most recent parole agent visited the home at least twice a month since December, according to California corrections officials. Sometimes the visits were unannounced, said Gordon Hinkle, a department spokesman. Parole officers also checked on Garrido frequently before 2008, Hinkle said, but he did not know how often or how many parole officers visited Garrido's residence. The parole agent who most recently entered Garrido's backyard didn't notice any children's toys or items to indicate that minors were living in the house. The agent saw a shed but assumed it belonged to a neighbor. ""There was a deceptive false impression,"" Hinkle said. ""If you were to be on the property walking around, you would have seen a big fence."" Parole Officers Carry Big Caseloads . Hinkle said the parole officer performed his duties appropriately. The parole officer was also responsible for raising suspicions when two University of California Berkeley officers notified him that Phillip Garrido came in with his ""daughters."" The parole officer called the Garridos in for questioning. California has one of the highest parolee-to-officer ratios in the country. State budget cuts are expected to strain the department this year, which could mean reducing the number of parole officers, Hinkle said. The officer assigned to supervise Garrido was also responsible for 39 other sex offenders. As recently as June, two months before Dugard was discovered with the Garridos, Contra Costa County firefighters responded to a fire on the property. They doused a car engine that had exploded into flames at the rear of the property, said department spokeswoman Emily Hopkins. They spent two hours there and then left. They also visited Garrido's property in fall 2007, after a neighbor reported fire coming from the backyard. In addition, they responded twice in 2008 and three times in 2009 to medical emergencies involving Garrido's elderly mother, Patricia Franzen. Fire department officials weren't sure whether more visits were made to the home, because computerized records date only to 2006. Neighbors Steered Clear . Neighbors who had encounters with Garrido said they didn't take the time to get to know him. Some said they knew that he was a sex offender, so they steered away from his house. Others ignored him because they thought he was strange. Betty Unpingco invited the entire neighborhood to her son's graduation party in spring 2006. She said Garrido attended and brought speakers for the party. When Unpingco and several adults noticed him talking to the high school girls, they asked him to leave. Later that night, she said, when they saw him waiting outside his home to speak to the girls, the adults escorted them home. Feeling uneasy after the party, Unpingco checked the sex offender registry and found Garrido's picture. ""It was just so bizarre,"" said Unpingco, who has 10 children. ""I warned my children to stay away from him and to always walk in twos."" She did not notify police. In November 2006, another neighbor did call police, saying she saw people living in tents behind the Garridos' house. Contra Costa County Sheriff Warren E. Rupf said he didn't think the deputy who responded knew at the time that Garrido was a sex offender. The deputy spoke to Garrido in his front yard about the allegations, but Garrido convinced him otherwise.","Officials visited Garrido home more than two dozen times in past three years .

"BURBANK, California (CNN) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang, North Korea, to help secure the two journalists' release. The families of Euna Lee, left, and Laura Ling greet them Wednesday in California. ""We feared at any moment that we could be sent to a hard labor camp, and then suddenly we were told we were going to a meeting,"" a tearful and emotional Ling said at a news conference Wednesday morning in California shortly after arriving by plane with Lee and Clinton. She spoke minutes after the two women were reunited with their families at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank outside Los Angeles. They had been detained in North Korea since March. North Korea pardoned Ling, 32, and Lee, 36, after Clinton's brief trip Tuesday to Pyongyang. ""We were taken to a location, and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton,"" Ling said, with Lee standing beside her.  Watch the emotional return at the airport » . ""We were shocked, but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end."" She expressed her and Lee's ""deepest gratitude"" to Clinton and his ""wonderful, amazing"" team.  Watch as Ling says, ""We could feel your love"" » . ""The past 140 days have been the most difficult, heart-wrenching time of our lives,"" Ling said. ""We are very grateful that we were granted amnesty by the government of North Korea, and we are so happy to be home."" She said that she and Lee are looking forward to spending ""some quiet, private time"" with their families. iReport.com: Share reaction to the freed journalists . Former Vice President Al Gore also spoke to the throngs of journalists at the news conference. He expressed his gratitude to Clinton and President Obama and his administration who ""have been deeply involved in this humanitarian effort.""  Watch Gore pay tribute to the people involved in the effort » . Lee and Ling are employed by Gore's California-based media company, Current TV. The women were arrested in March while reporting from the border between North Korea and China. In June, they were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign. On Wednesday morning, Lee bowed as she walked down the steps of the plane into a private hangar, and Ling raised her fists into the air. The women hugged their families, who were waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Lee's 4-year-old daughter, Hana, clung tightly to her tearful mother.  Watch as the women reunite with their families » . Clinton walked off the plane minutes later but did not address the crowd. ""I am very happy that after this long ordeal, Laura Ling and Euna Lee are now home and reunited with their loved ones,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""When their families, Vice President Gore and the White House asked that I undertake this humanitarian mission, I agreed. I share a deep sense of relief with Laura and Euna and their families that they are safely home."" Journalist Lisa Ling said she never gave up hope that she would see her sister again. ""We always maintained our hope and knew in our hearts that we would see Laura again; we just didn't know when,"" Lisa Ling said outside her home in Los Angeles, California. ""We are just thrilled beyond words that the day has finally arrived."" She said her sister was looking forward to eating fresh fruit and food for the first time in four months, after many meals of rice that often contained rocks. ""I can tell she has gone through a lot,"" Ling said. ""My sister has an amazing, amazing spirit, and she's a little bit weak right now, so I think it's going take a little time for her to gather up her wits and be able to talk about what she experienced."" At the White House, Obama applauded the release of the two journalists, saying, ""We are very pleased with the outcome."" Their release is a ""source of happiness not only for the families but for the entire country,"" he said.  Watch as Obama says, ""We are relieved"" » . Obama also thanked the former president and Gore for their roles in winning the women's release. ""I think that not only is this White House ... extraordinarily happy, but all Americans should be grateful to both former President Clinton and Vice President Gore for their extraordinary work,"" he said. Clinton made the trip to North Korea after the women's families asked him to travel there, a senior administration official said. Doug Ling, Ling's father, earlier reacted to the news of his daughter's release outside his home in Carmichael, California, saying it was ""one of the best days in my life."" ""I figured, sooner or later, they'd be back,"" he said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also expressed her relief that the two women were released. She spoke from Nairobi, Kenya, where she is taking part in a multination visit to Africa. ""I spoke to my husband on the airplane, and everything went well,"" she said. ""It is just a good day to be able to see this happen."" In July, Ling and Lee spoke to their families and told them that the North Koreans were willing to grant them amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. North Korea said Clinton ""expressed words of sincere apology to Kim Jong Il"" for the journalists' actions, but the administration official said he knew nothing about an apology. He said Clinton met for three hours and 15 minutes with the North Korean leader but said he did not know what issues were discussed. But he said Clinton's views on a verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are well-known. North Korea's state-run Korea Central News Agency said Clinton conveyed a message from Obama ""expressing profound thanks for this and reflecting views on ways of improving the relations between the two countries."" But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the announced agreement that Clinton was not carrying any message from Obama. Gibbs added the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March. He described Clinton's trip as a ""solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans."" Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to the stalled nuclear disarmament talks. North Korea conducted its second nuclear bomb test in May and has held several missile tests since then. The United Nations has responded by increasing sanctions on the nation. North Korea and the United States had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear program. North Korea agreed then to halt the development of nuclear weapons but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003. Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000, near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in 2000 to meet with Kim. She was the last high-ranking American official to do so before this week.

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Ann Holmes Redding has what could be called a crisis of faiths. Ann Holmes Redding says she sees no contradiction in being both a Christian minister and a Muslim. For nearly 30 years, Redding has been an ordained minister in the Episcopal Church. Her priesthood ended Wednesday when she was defrocked. The reason? For the past three years Redding has been both a practicing Christian and a Muslim. ""Had anyone told me in February 2006 that I would be a Muslim before April rolled around, I would have shaken my head in concern for the person's mental health,"" Redding recently told a crowd at a signing for a book she co-authored on religion. Redding said her conversion to Islam was sparked by an interfaith gathering she attended three years ago. During the meeting, an imam demonstrated Muslim chants and meditation to the group. Redding said the beauty of the moment and the imam's humbleness before God stuck with her. ""It was much more this overwhelming conviction that I needed to surrender to God and this was the form that my surrender needed to take,"" she recalled. ""It wasn't just an episode but .... was a step that I wasn't going to step back from."" Ten days later Redding was saying the shahada -- the Muslim declaration of belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Mohammad as his prophet. But Redding said she felt her new Muslim faith did not pose a contradiction to her staying a Christian and minister. ""Both religions say there's only one God,"" Redding said, ""and that God is the same God. It's very clear we are talking about the same God! So I haven't shifted my allegiance.""  Watch Redding say, ""Being a Muslim makes me a better Christian"" » . The imam at the Islamic Center in Seattle, Washington, where Redding prays said she brings the best of both traditions to her beliefs. ""Coming from an example of wanting to be Christ-like and coming from the perspective of wanting to follow the best example -- the example of our prophet Mohammed -- it all makes sense then,"" Benjamin Shabazz said. There are many contradictions between the two religions. While Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet, Christianity worships him as the son of God. James Wellman, who chairs the department of comparative religion at the University of Washington, said that while it is not unusual for people to ""mix and match"" beliefs, it is almost unheard of for a minister to claim two religions. ""When you take ordination as a Christian minister, you take an explicit vow of loyalty to Jesus. It's hard for me to understand how a Christian minister could have dual loyalties,"" Wellman said. Redding said she sees the theological conflicts but that the two religions, at their core, ""illuminate"" each other. ""When I took my shahada, I said there's no God but God and that Mohammed is God's prophet or messenger. Neither of those statements, neither part of that confession or profession denies anything about Christianity,"" she said. To her parishioners and family, though, Redding has turned her back on her faith and office. There was, she said, ""universal puzzlement"" at her decision to convert to Islam but still remain an Episcopal minister. ""I have people who love me very much who really don't want me to do this, and I love them very much. And I would love to be able to say, 'Because I love you I will renounce my orders' or 'I will renounce Islam' ... I hate causing pain to people who love me, that's not my intention,"" Redding said. The Episcopal Church also rejected Redding's religious choice. ""The church interprets my being a Muslim as 'abandoning the church,' "" she said. ""And that [there] comes an understanding that you have to be one or the other, and most people would say that. It simply hasn't been my experience that I have to make a choice between the two."" The Diocese of Rhode Island, where Redding was ordained, told her to leave either her new Muslim faith or the ministry. A diocese statement said Bishop Geralyn Wolf found Redding to be ""a woman of utmost integrity. However, the Bishop believes that a priest of the Church cannot be both a Christian and a Muslim."" Even though she has been defrocked, Redding said she is not capable of turning her back on either faith. She said she wants to continue speaking about and teaching religion and perhaps even travel to the Hajj, a journey to Mecca that every Muslim is supposed to make in their lifetime. Redding said she does not want her belief in two religions to diminish the value she holds for both Christianity and Islam. Each faith by itself is enough to fulfill a person spiritually, she said. ""It's all there. I am not saying you have to go somewhere else to be complete. Some people don't need glasses, some people need single lenses. I need bifocals.""","Ann Holmes Redding says she saw no contradiction in Muslim being a minister .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Jewish groups on Wednesday rejected as inadequate an apology by Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone for remarks in which he praised German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Bernie Ecclestone: ""Many people in my closest circle of friends are Jewish."" During an interview with The Times newspaper last week the billionaire spoke of the Nazi dictator's ability to ""get things done."" But after a storm of criticism, Ecclestone issued a statement on Tuesday in which he said: ""I unreservedly apologize for the remarks I made regarding Hitler in a recent interview. I am extremely distressed and embarrassed that these remarks have been used as suggesting that I support Hitler or Saddam Hussein. I would never support such people. ""I should never have been so foolish as to have been drawn into discussing these people but the fault was entirely mine, which I deeply regret."" On Wednesday Jon Benjamin, Chief Executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, rejected the apology. ""Mr. Ecclestone's comments were crass, ignorant and insensitive,"" he said in a statement issued to CNN. ""There is no excuse for praising one of history's most evil men for being good at being bad."" Tell us what you think of Ecclestone's comments . In his statement on Tuesday, the 78-year-old appeared to reignite the controversy by remarking: ""During the 1930s Germany was facing an economic crisis, but Hitler was able to rebuild the economy, building the autobahns and German industry. ""That was all I meant when I referred to him getting things done. ""I'm an admirer of good leadership, of politicians who stand by their convictions and tell the voters the truth. I'm not an admirer of dictators who rule by terror."" He told The Jewish Chronicle on Tuesday he regretted offending people who took his remarks ""the wrong way."" Ecclestone had earlier been described by the newspaper's editor, Stephen Pollard, as ""either an idiot or morally repulsive."" Germany's Central Council of Jews had urged motor racing teams to boycott Formula One over Ecclestone's comments but cautiously welcomed the apology. However one of the group's leaders pointed out that the F1 chief's remarks about the man who presided over the deaths of six million Jews had caused great pain. ""If Ecclestone says he was an idiot, I will certainly not contradict him,"" Dieter Graumann, vice president of the council, told Handesblatt newspaper. ""Apologizing is better than not apologizing. But the glorification of a mass murderer is not a trivial offense."" German media also reported that Guenther Oettinger, premier of the southern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, had canceled a meeting with the Briton at this weekend's German Grand Prix at Nurburgring because of his comments about Hitler. The F1 chief had told the German newspaper Bild: ""Many people in my closest circle of friends are Jewish.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration has decided to rescind invitations to Iranian diplomats for July Fourth celebrations overseas because of violent crackdowns against protesters in Iran, the White House said Wednesday. President Obama on Tuesday toughened his stance on Iran's crackdown on protesters. ""July Fourth allows us to celebrate the freedom and the liberty we enjoy: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to assemble peacefully, freedom of the press,"" White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. ""Given the events of the past many days, those invitations will no longer be extended."" The administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of the president's policy of engaging the Iranian regime. In late May the State Department sent a cable to its embassies and consulates worldwide informing them they ""may invite representatives from the government of Iran"" to their July Fourth celebrations. But in a fresh cable sent to all embassies and consulates Wednesday evening, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ordered posts ""to rescind all invitations that have been extended to Iranian diplomats for July Fourth events. ""Unfortunately the circumstances have changed and participation by Iranian diplomats would not be appropriate in light of the Iranian government's continued violent and unjust actions against its own people,"" said the cable, obtained by CNN. ""For invitations which have been extended, posts should make clear that Iranian participation is no longer appropriate in the current circumstances. For invitations which have not been extended, no further action is needed."" A senior administration official said Clinton made the decision, and then informed President Obama. The U.S. receptions marking Independence Day usually feature symbols of Americana, such as hot dogs, red-white-and-blue decorations and remarks by U.S. officials about America's founding fathers. One senior administration official said Wednesday the reconsideration of the July Fourth invitations is consistent with Obama's comments Tuesday, in which he said he was ""shocked and appalled"" at the violence against demonstrators. ""The president said yesterday how this plays out will affect what we do,"" the official said. Obama said Tuesday, ""If Iran chooses a path that abides by international norms and principles, then we are interested in healing some of the wounds of 30 years in terms of U.S.-Iranian relations."" Watch Obama ramp up criticism of Iran » . On Tuesday, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said an invitation to Iranian diplomats would send the wrong message to Iranians ""who are bravely standing up for the same rights and freedoms which Americans celebrate on this day."" ""The Fourth of July is a day when we celebrate democracy and reflect on the gift of freedom which all Americans cherish,"" she said in a statement. ""The Iranian people are no less worthy of freedom and self-governance than citizens of the United States."" Earlier this year, as part of the policy to engage Iran, Obama videotaped a message for the Iranian people on the Persian new year and U.S. officials have engaged members of the Iranian government. In March, Richard Holbrooke, the Obama administration's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, spoke briefly with Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, at an Afghanistan conference in The Hague. Administration officials believe the U.S. will engage Iran at some point to address issues of U.S. national security, including the nuclear issue, but the idea of bilateral engagement is in a holding pattern while the violence continues. ""I wouldn't say engagement is off the table, but it is certainly on ice,"" a senior administration official said this week.","Administration had planned to invite Iranians to celebrations at overseas posts .

"(CNN) -- Although there were no signs of missing aviation adventurer Steve Fossett Tuesday evening, an official leading the rescue said she remained optimistic. Aviation record-holder Steve Fossett is missing and a search is under way. Maj. Cynthia S. Ryan of the Civil Air Patrol said Fossett, who has been missing for a day, once walked 30 miles to get help after making a forced landing. But Ryan noted the challenge rescuers are facing as they comb the high desert region, which is covered with sagebrush and hides deep ravines. Rescuers are focusing on 600 square miles. ""It's a very large haystack,"" she said. ""And an airplane is a very small needle. No doubt about that."" The Civil Air Patrol has 10 aircraft that will be searching until dusk for Fossett, who has been missing since Monday afternoon, she said. The search will resume Wednesday at 7 a.m. (10 a.m. ET). Fossett, 63, was in a single-engine plane when he took off at 9 a.m. (noon ET) in good flying conditions from hotel magnate Barron Hilton's Flying M Ranch, Ryan said. He had planned to return to the ranch, which is about 30 miles south of Yerington, Nevada, at noon (3 p.m. ET). The search for him began about six hours later, Ryan said. Fossett did not file a flight plan, which is not required on flights using visual navigation. Fossett is the first person to solo around the world in a balloon, and has broken numerous other flight records. When he left, he had four to five hours of fuel for flight, said Ryan. ""Steve took off toward the south and was going to fly southbound, looking around for some dry lake beds for some plans he had for the future,"" Ryan said. Those plans, she said, involved testing a vehicle in an attempt to set a world land speed record. Ryan said authorities are analyzing information from radar intelligence to try to track Fossett. Helicopters and planes from Naval Air Station Fallon, in Fallon, Nevada, the Nevada Air National Guard and the California Highway Patrol are helping in the search.  Watch CNN's Miles O'Brien, who is a pilot, describe the search » . Fossett was flying in a single-engine, Citabria Super Decathlon -- a plane capable of aerobatics -- with tail number N240R, according to CAP. Fossett, though, had no parachute, which is required for aerobatics.  See where Fossett took off » . There has been no sound detected from the plane's emergency locator radio beacon, which goes off if there is a hard impact. The aircraft, with serial number 635-80, was manufactured by Bellanca, and is registered to the Flying M Hunting Club Inc. in Yerington. ""Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up,"" predicted Sir Richard Branson, president of Virgin Atlantic, in a written statement. ""The ranch he took off from covers a huge area, and Steve has had far tougher challenges to overcome in the past. Based on his track record, I feel confident we'll get some good news soon."" Virgin Atlantic sponsored the GlobalFlyer, which Fossett flew in 2005 during the first nonstop, solo flight around the world without refueling. A year later, he used GlobalFlyer again to break the world's flight distance record, traveling more than 26,000 miles in 76 hours, 45 minutes from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to Bournemouth, on the coast of southern England. He made an emergency landing during that flight after electricity on the aircraft failed over Shannon, Ireland. His goal had been to land at Kent International Airport in Manston, England. In 2006, Fossett piloted the plane to its new home, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. In 2002, he achieved the first solo balloon flight around the world, traveling 20,626 miles in 14 days. He's credited with 115 world records or world firsts, and holds official world records in five sports, according to his Web site. CNN.com interviewed Fossett last year after he published a book about his life's passion for breaking world records, titled ""Chasing the Wind."" Asked which of his record-breaking feats was his personal favorite, he said, ""The first solo around-the-world balloon flight. We had to really upgrade the technical capability of balloons and the flight was much more difficult than I'd ever imagined it would be. I tried six times over the course of six years before succeeding."" ""I think I'm a risk averse person, which might sound very strange because of the sports I'm involved in,"" Fossett said, in response to a question about whether anything scares him. ""What I do is try and reduce the risk. I don't do any of this for the thrills. I'm doing them for the personal achievement."" Asked how long he'll keep going, Fossett answered, ""I imagine that when I'm 80 years old and sitting in a wheelchair that I might do something like take a remote control airplane and try and fly it around the world. I plan to be setting and breaking records indefinitely."" The aviator was in Sparks, Nevada, northeast of Reno, in August, preparing a jet racer to break the land speed record at Bonneville Flats in northwest Utah. Fossett was born in Jackson, Tennessee, but grew up in California, where he attended Stanford University, graduating with a degree in economics in 1966. Two years later, he earned an MBA at Washington University in St. Louis and became a successful commodities broker, eventually launching the Chicago-based securities company Lakota Trading in 1980. He married Peggy Viehland in 1968. The couple have no children. His interest in adventure started early. As a Boy Scout, he grew up climbing the mountains of California. ""When I was 12 years old I climbed my first mountain, and I just kept going, taking on more diverse and grander projects,"" he told CNN in the 2006 interview. Fossett fueled his drive for adventure with the money he made from Lakota Trading.  E-mail to a friend .","Fossett was scouting locales for land speed record attempt, official says .

"(CNN) -- Although most Swedes would be too modest to say so themselves, Stockholm can stake a decent claim to being the capital of Scandinavia. Built on 14 islands, Stockholm seems to float on water. Built on 14 islands where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea, Stockholm is a soft-hued vision of light and water, the bewitching start to an archipelago of some 24,000 islands and islets. Sweden's neutrality during World War II means Stockholm was spared the bombing inflicted on most European capitals; the result is the unspoiled old town of Gamla Stan, with its winding, cobbled streets. Despite a post-war building blitz that saw the construction of some particularly uninspiring modernist architecture, it is a city where gray concrete facades are largely eschewed in favor of a smorgasbord of pastel colors, rusty reds and glowing ochres. For a capital city it's unusually green -- not just leafy and dotted with verdant parks, but environmentally sound. Stockholm proper has a population of just 800,000, avoiding the congestion and pollution that plague larger cities -- so much so that you can fish from, and swim in, the waters surrounding the city center. Cold and sometimes bleak during its long, dark winters, Stockholm comes alive during the summer, when the Scandinavian sun barely sets. As temperatures rise the city's cafe culture blossoms, only for Stockholm to become a ghost town during July, when the locals make the most of their generous holiday entitlement and slip off to holiday cottages in the archipelago. But beyond its historic heart Stockholm is a progressive, evolving city. Its financial fortunes grew with the mid '90s IT boom and shrank when the dotcom bubble burst, but it remains a hotbed of technology and communications companies. Watch ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm » . Around 20 percent of the residents of greater Stockholm are of foreign descent, giving a sense of cultural diversity -- not to mention some welcome variety to the city's thriving restaurant scene. Despite Sweden's largely anti-EU stance, Stockholm is cosmopolitan and outward looking, with a keen eye for the latest international trends. Its shops are filled with the latest in functional, minimalist Swedish design and there are enough boutiques boasting hip New York brands and cool Swedish labels to indulge Stockholmers' obsession with style. It's also the city where Swedish global exports H&M and IKEA have their flagship stores. For all its picture-postcard pleasantness and progressive civic planning, Stockholm can seem a little sterile. It's not the kind of place likely to be described as ""edgy."" Stockholmers themselves can come across as standoffish, but that's not say that they are unfriendly -- just politely reserved. Small talk is regarded with a certain suspicion meaning the locals can be hard to get to know, but it's amazing what a difference a couple of glasses of akvavit can make. Puritan legal regulations mean that high-alcohol drinks (that's anything with more than 3.5 percent alcohol) are heavily taxed and can only be bought in bars and government-run ""Systembolaget"" shops. The result is that a night on the town is expensive enough to make anyone teetotal, with Stockholmers often avoiding midweek drinking, saving their krona for weekend partying. But what Stockholm lacks in grit it more than makes up for in style. From its artfully designed coffee shops to the classic contours of its baroque and rococo buildings, this island city is endlessly pleasing to behold, especially when viewed from the water that flows like blood through its veins.","From artfully designed cafes to baroque buildings, Stockholm exudes cool .

"(CNN) -- Two words, delivered with index finger punctuating the air and directed at the president of the United States, made a little-known South Carolina congressman one of the most controversial men on the Internet -- at least Wednesday heading into Thursday. Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama. As soon as Rep. Joe Wilson was identified as the person whose angry and audible outburst disrupted President Obama's health care speech to Congress, condemnation was swift -- and brutal. Within minutes, someone had altered Wilson's entry on the online encyclopedia Wikipedia: . ""He is a [expletive] that called the president of the United States a liar on national television and has no respect for the office he holds."" When the Web site scrubbed the sentence, an even more offensive entry wormed its way in. iReport.com: ""You are disrespectful, sir"" Soon, the site disabled edit options for Wilson's entry, chalking it up to ""vandalism."" On Twitter, post after post urged users to condemn Wilson's breach of protocol, listing his Web site address and his congressional office phone number. Web surfers who visited http://www.joewilson.house.gov/ were greeted with the message: ""This site is down for maintenance. Please check back again soon."" Those who called his office number either could not get through because the line was busy, or could not leave a message because the phone continued to ring without activating voice mail. ""If he's the face of the GOP, we'll have public option by Columbus Day!"" wrote Andisheh Nouraee, a columnist for Creative Loafing, an alternative weekly in Atlanta, Georgia. Democrats on Capitol Hill piled on the condemnation as well. ""Biggest disappointment of evening, the total lack of respect show by one member for the president,"" wrote Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri. ""Never acceptable to behave like a jerk."" As ""Joe Wilson"" trended on Twitter as the most popular conversation topic -- and on Google among the most searched terms -- the lawmaker's supporters fought back. Many set up Twitter accounts and posted their first tweets Wednesday night and early Thursday. ""You have nothing to apologize for. You should be applauded for standing up and speaking the truth,"" said Jamie Sawyer of Madison, Wisconsin. ""Good for him! Too bad he had to apologize"" was a comment on the Lonely Conservative blog. ""At last the little man found his voice tonight and called Obama what he surely is, a liar,"" said another blog, Sunlit Uplands. By early Thursday, genuine tweets about Wilson were interspersed with ads for male erectile dysfunction: ""Joe Wilson Cialis $1.9 Viagra $1.1 (Web site address)"" Though Wilson issued an apology, saying his emotions got the best of him, few online bought it.  Watch Obama react to the ""You lie!"" outburst » . On the Internet, where speculation runs rife, tweeters pointed to a comment Wilson posted on Labor Day as evidence that his outburst was planned: . ""Happy Labor Day! Wonderful parade at Chapin, many people called out to oppose Obamacare which I assured them would be relayed tomorrow to DC,"" the tweet from Wilson's account said. On Facebook, where users aren't impeded by Twitter's 140-character limitation, a prolonged and nasty war of words dominated Wilson's page. ""I have no problem being called a liberal hack by illogical, fear filled, unintelligent people. and actually, I will take it as a complement,"" wrote Janine Feczko. Name-calling was met by ad hominem attacks: ""Janine, I'm sure in the trailer park where you live they gush over your incredible intellect and witty commentary. After all that toothless grin and tripple chin screams Harvard Law,"" wrote Dan Colgan. Nine hundred and 10 comments later, the battle raged on early Thursday. Amid all this, the campaign of Democrat Rob Miller, who hopes to unseat the Republican Wilson in next year's midterm elections, raked in the dough: more than $200,000 from 5,000 individuals overnight and Thursday morning after Obama's speech, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Finally, there were those who found humor in Wilson's heckle. A hastily created Web site, JoeWilsonIsYourPreExistingCondition, hurled a new insult at the politician with every click of the refresh button. ""Joe Wilson poured salt on your lawn,"" said one. Refresh. ""Joe Wilson traded the dead batteries in walkman for the fresh ones in your TV remote."" Refresh. ""Joe Wilson yells 'Freebird' at concerts."" Not everyone, however, was busy assigning blame to Wilson. Los Angeles actor and comic Paul Scheer decided to shoulder it. ""I apologize 4 yelling 'liar' during Obama's speech,"" he jokingly wrote. ""Sen McCain ate my Kit Kat while I was in the bathroom & he pretended like he didn't.""","Little-known South Carolina congressman shouts, ""You lie!"" at President Obama .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- A roadside bomb targeted a police patrol in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, killing a civilian bystander Thursday, a police official told CNN. Iraqis survey the damage after car bombs were detonated within minutes of each other in Mosul, July 9. It is the latest in a series of attacks across Iraq that have killed at least 64 people and wounded 167 others over the past two days. The deadliest attack happened earlier in the day when a double suicide bombing killed at least 35 people and wounded 65 others in the city of Tal Afar in Nineveh province, also in northern Iraq. Political tensions have recently increased in the region between Arabs and Kurds. The Tal Afar bombings occurred a day after attacks on mainly Shiite targets in Nineveh province, including a car bomb in a Turkmen area of the provincial capital Mosul, left at least 19 people dead and dozens wounded. U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq's urban centers June 30. The U.S. military had suggested keeping its combat troops in Mosul beyond the withdrawal deadline, but the Iraqi government insisted on making no exceptions for the date set in the security agreement. Also on Thursday morning, at least seven people were killed and 25 wounded when a bomb detonated in a busy marketplace in Sadr City, the vast Shiite slum in Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. Bomb blasts from a rigged bicycle a car in two predominantly Shiite neighborhoods of southwestern Baghdad wounded six people, according to the official. In Baghdad's central Karrada district, a roadside bomb targeting a convoy of Iraq's Central Bank governor killed one civilian bystander and wounded five, another Interior Ministry official told CNN. The governor escaped unharmed. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .","Official: At least 35 people killed and 65 wounded in a double suicide bombing .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Many fans will always remember where they were when they heard the ""King of Pop"" had died. The rapper The Game will always remember what he did afterward. The Game created a tribute to Michael Jackson -- video and all -- within a day of Jackson's death. That same day, Thursday, June 25, he rounded up some famous friends, recorded a song, shot a music video and got a Michael Jackson tattoo etched on his upper arm. Actually, he got the tattoo while he was in the studio recording the track. Some people know how to multitask. The tune, ""Better on the Other Side,"" isn't available for sale yet -- although he's hoping it will hit iTunes very soon. Because the record company was caught off guard, it is still playing catch-up. Game says all proceeds from the sale of the single will be donated to Michael Jackson's family. The companion music video is all over YouTube. In it, the 29-year-old shares the spotlight with Chris Brown, who sings the hook as a counterpoint to Game's rap. It's the first project Brown has appeared in since he pleaded guilty to assaulting his former girlfriend, Rihanna. The video, in various forms, had received more than 750,000 views as of Thursday evening -- not bad for less than a week in release. In the following interview, The Game (born Jayceon Taylor) recounts how the project came together -- with a little help from Lady Luck and the muse of Michael Jackson. CNN: You may be the first well-known artist to have a Michael Jackson tribute out there. The Game: I didn't want to wake up the next morning and have somebody spread a tribute all over the Internet, and I wasn't a part of it. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. CNN: Did you already have the beats pre-recorded? The Game: No. The first thing I did was call DJ Khalil ... and I told him, ""Yo, I need you in the studio, and by the time I get there, I need a Michael Jackson tribute song made [the music bed]. I need violinists, I need pianists, I need everyone in there for a production."" And then I started reaching out to Diddy. He's on a set 18 hours a day, but he said he'd get it done some way, somehow. Talked to Chris Brown. He and [his manager] Tina Davis said they were on their way to the studio -- so they told me after I do my part, to bring it over and Chris will do the hook. Before I took the beat over to Chris, Boyz II Men walked into the studio randomly -- so they took it to their studio next door, laid down all the background vocals. Then I took it to Mario [Winans], then I took it to Diddy. In the meantime, me and my boy Taydoe -- we running around to the hospital, to the Jacksons' house, to the star on Hollywood, getting all this [secondary] footage [for the video]. Crazy. CNN: This was the day he died, on Thursday? The Game: It was just the day. By Friday, everything was done -- video, everything. We did it in 15 hours.  Watch a report about Jackson's final days » . CNN: You made the music video for $500. The Game: All in tapes, $500 went to tapes, HD high-definition tapes. CNN: At the end of the video, you reveal a new tattoo. The Game: Yeah, I'll show you. I thought if I was going to get a Michael Jackson tattoo, I would get a more menacing one. (The tattoo shows the ""King of Pop"" with a bandanna over the lower half of his face.) CNN: Had you ever met Michael? The Game: I never met him in person, but he tried to mediate a truce between myself and Curtis Jackson [aka 50 Cent], and I wasn't having it at that time. CNN: How did that happen? Did somebody call you and say, ""Please hold the line for Michael Jackson?"" The Game: At first my managers called me and they said, ""Mike -- Michael Jackson -- is going to want to talk to you in an hour. Exactly an hour."" So I waited an hour, and I'm like chewing on my fingers in the hotel room ... and the phone rings and a guy comes on and he's got an English accent. He's like (affects an English accent), ""Hello Game, I have Michael Jackson on hold for you."" It was just cool. So Michael comes on, and ... he was like, ""Yo, it's Mike, and I'm a big fan of your music,"" and starts going into my songs, ""Hate it or Love It"" and ""How We Do."" And he's like, ""I'm a big fan of 50's -- every time I get in the car, I tell my driver to play 'In Da Club.' Would you guys be willing to make a truce, and then put it on my album?""  Listen to Jackson's biggest hits » . And then I was like, ""Yo Mike, we gotta slow down, man!"" This was at the height of me and 50's little beef, or whatever people called it, but I talked to him for another 35 minutes on why I couldn't do it at that time, and at that point in my career, and he was OK with that. He said one day if we decided to do it -- myself and Curtis' camp -- we could reach out to him. We never got a chance to do it. CNN: So the video also features Chris Brown. It's the first track we've heard him on since the hearing last Monday [June 22]. The Game: They were really edgy about getting on it. I think [his managers] wanted Chris Brown's first look to be kind of strategically thought out, and I came so fast with the Michael Jackson tribute -- but we talked it over, and at the end of the day, they thought it was a good idea, so we went ahead and did it. CNN: How is Chris? I'm sure you guys talk all the time. The Game: He's like a little brother to me. I talk to him all the time, and I give him my support. You know, I'm no stranger to trials and tribulations in life, and the court system. CNN: What are your thoughts about how Michael Jackson died, and how it seems as though prescription drugs may have been involved? The Game: My thoughts on Michael Jackson are always the same. It doesn't matter, the form or fashion he died in. He's iconic to me, and his untimely demise is felt around the world. You got certain people saying, ""Oh everybody's loving Michael now,"" but that's neither here nor there. Me, myself -- I loved Michael Jackson to death. My mom sent me a host of pictures with all my ""Thriller"" shirts on, and the jacket with the zippers and glove -- me, my sisters and brothers -- so I really don't care. I just know he left an impact on the world. I think he's the most cried-for human being since Jesus Christ. It's just my opinion. CNN: Are you thinking about donating part of the proceeds from the single? The Game: Oh, all the proceeds of anything that I do that has anything to do with Michael Jackson will go to his family and his children. And that's just the bottom line.","The Game records ""Better on the Other Side"" as tribute to Michael Jackson .

"(CNN) -- An employee at a New Jersey chocolate processing plant died Wednesday after falling into a vat of hot chocolate, according to a spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's office. Vincent Smith II, 29, was dumping raw chocolate into the vat for melting when he fell in from a nine-foot high platform. He suffered a fatal blow to the head from the vat's agitator, a paddle-like mechanism used for stirring the chocolate. According to the Camden County prosecutor's office, three other people were on the platform at the time. One was able to shut the machinery off quickly, but it was too late to save Smith. The facility, owned by Cocoa Services Inc., is managed and operated by by Lyons and Sons. The rectangular vat, which was 8 feet deep, 14 feet long and 6 feet wide, was churning a batch of chocolate for Hershey's when the accident occurred, the prosecutor's office said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Obama spoke at the Pentagon on Friday to those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001, telling them no words would heal their pain yet calling for a renewed resolve against the ones who attacked the country eight years ago. President Obama addresses family members and friends who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001. Obama laid a wreath of white flowers at the Pentagon, where 184 people lost their lives when a hijacked jet smashed into the military icon outside the nation's capital. ""No words can ease the ache of your hearts,"" Obama told a crowd of relatives and friends standing under umbrellas in a steady rain. The plane, American Airlines Flight 77, struck the Pentagon's west wall. Earlier in the day, the president and first lady Michelle Obama held a moment of silence outside the White House to mark the eighth anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks that killed 2,752 people. At the Pentagon, Obama was introduced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who spoke of the ""great pinnacle of sacrifice"" shown that day. ""Eight Septembers have come and gone,"" Obama said. ""Nearly 3,000 days have passed, almost one for each one who has been taken from us. ""We recall the beauty and meaning of their lives,"" he said. ""No passage of time, no dark skies can dull the meaning of that moment.  Watch a slideshow of Obama's speech and the day's events » . ""Let us renew our resolve against those who perpetrated this violent act,"" Obama said. The nation paused at the moments when the planes crashed into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon -- symbols of America's financial and military might -- and at a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Officials believe that plane's target was either the White House or the Capitol. There was silence at the site of the former World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m., the time the first plane struck the North Tower, followed by another at 9:03 a.m. when a jet struck the South Tower. iReport.com: 9/11 emotions surge back in sculpted tributes, memories on video . Family members and friends of those killed read their names in solemn roll calls at each site as bells tolled. In London, England, U.S. Ambassador Louis Susman and his wife, Marjorie, laid a wreath at the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square. At ground zero in New York, a woman whose husband worked on the 94th floor of one of the twin towers recalled that day. ""The pain can still be so sharp. ... I realize how much my life has changed,"" she said, mentioning that her children have now grown and she has grandchildren. Her husband left many lessons, she said, including ""the courage to be kind."" Just before the first moment of silence, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the newly established September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance, designated by Obama. ""Appropriately, the city of New York has taken up that call. From this day forward we will guard the memories of those who died by rekindling the spirit of service and help keep us strong,"" Bloomberg said. At the Web site set up for that day, people were listing their charitable acts. One man who spoke to the crowd at ground zero remembered his brother, a partner at a law firm near the twin towers and a longtime volunteer firefighter. He rushed ""toward the inferno,"" to do what he could to help, the brother said. ""He was there when the tower collapsed."" Near Shanksville, people gathered at a field where the 40 passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 died. The passengers and crew, aware of the fate of  other hijacked planes, fought the men who had taken control of their aircraft, leading to its crash. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell gave the keynote address at the 2,200-acre site, where a $58 million memorial is scheduled to open in 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the attacks. More than 1 million people already have visited the field, Powell said. No one could capture the terror the 40 people aboard Flight 93 must have endured, Powell said. They were strangers to each other who ""represented the very best diversity that is America,"" he said. ""In place of fear, they found the courage of attack,"" he said. ""They seized the moment, and they lost their lives in so doing. We are here to ... honor their spirits."" Powell said he believes the United States is safer since the attacks. He pointed to improvements in the visa system, which gives officials a better idea of who is coming into the country; creation of the U.S. Homeland Security Department and beefed-up security at airports. Powell said there also have been improvements in law enforcement and intelligence-gathering. Engaging the terrorists in Afghanistan also is a solid move, he told CNN. ""But you can't rest on that. You have to keep studying the problem. You have to keep trying to get into their mind. And so it may be a long and continuous fight that may never end."" The level of concern about terrorism in the United States is roughly half of what it was immediately after September 11 and is down 20 points since the five-year anniversary in 2006, according to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll. Thirty-four percent of Americans think an act of terrorism is likely in the United States over the next few weeks. More than six in 10 have confidence in the Obama administration's ability to protect the nation.","Obama: ""Let us renew our resolve against those who perpetrated this violent act""

"(CNN) -- Writer and producer Larry Gelbart, most known for his work on the hit television series ""M*A*S*H,"" died Friday morning in his Beverly Hills, California, home, his wife said. He was 81. Larry Gelbart said, before ""M*A*S*H,"" a TV set only produced  feeling ""if you touched it while you were wet."" Gelbart died of cancer, Pat Gelbart said. The family will hold a private memorial service. Throughout his career, Gelbart developed a portfolio of more than 40 works spanning radio, television, theater and film. His fascination with radio as a child inspired him and influenced his evolving career. ""I never had any aspirations of [a] literary career, but writing for radio seemed to be a natural extension of being such a radio fan,"" Gelbart told CNN in 1999. ""So when I got my chance, that's what I did."" Barely out of high school, Gelbart began as a comedy writer for radio in the 1940s. He wrote for various programs, including the Fanny Brice show and ""Duffy's Tavern."" While in the Army, he wrote for Armed Forces Radio. Later, he joined the staff of Bob Hope's show and jump-started his own television career as a TV writer for the star. Gelbart went on to write skits for the live comedy ""Your Show of Shows"" in 1953, winning two Emmys for his work. ""'Your Show of Shows' was successful, was wildly successful. Not just because it got there first, but because it got there first with so much,"" Gelbart said. The 90-minute variety program was one of the first televised sketch comedy shows. Gelbart took his work to another stage, winning two 1963 Tony awards for his Broadway musical hit, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum."" In 1972, Gelbart helped create the Korean War comedy drama ""M*A*S*H."" The show went on for another 11 years, although Gelbart only wrote and produced ""M*A*S*H"" for the first four seasons. ""M*A*S*H"" won 50 awards, including eight Golden Globes. ""M*A*S*H"" was so popular it lasted much longer than the Korean War itself, and was seen as a commentary on American involvement in the Vietnam War. Gelbart also was involved in the short-lived sequel, ""After MASH."" For Gelbart, ""M*A*S*H"" mixed a bit of comedy with drama, allowing viewers to connect more with the story. ""I said once that the only way before 'M*A*S*H' you would get any feeling out of your television set is if you touched it while you were wet,"" Gelbart said. He added: ""We gave the audience permission to feel bad. Because America was feeling pretty rotten then, we were at war in Vietnam. And once the war stopped we didn't start feeling really terrific right away, if we ever will again about that situation."" Gelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film ""Tootsie,"" ""Oh, God!"" in 1977 and the 2003 film ""And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself,"" which starred Antonio Banderas. ""Tootsie"" earned Gelbart an Oscar nomination for best writing.","Gelbart died of cancer at age 81, his wife says .

"(CNN) -- One of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the Los Angeles, California, area has been accused of desecrating the remains of those buried there, according to a lawsuit. The cemetery holds the remains of celebrities such as Groucho Marx and Lenny Bruce. The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that employees at Eden Memorial Park, in Mission Hills, California, ""intentionally, willfully and secretly desecrated the remains of deceased individuals,"" often moving them to make room for new remains. Attorney Michael Avenatti, who filed the suit, told CNN that his investigation revealed that as many as 500 graves may have been torn up without the families' permission. ""We allege that Eden Memorial Park and its management for the better part of 15 years were engaging in improper burial practices, including the desecration of graves and the improper disposal of human remains,"" he said. The lawsuit is filed by F. Charles Sands, whose parents are buried at Eden Memorial Park, against the cemetery and its owner, Service Corporation International, based in Houston, Texas. The company is the largest owner of cemeteries and funeral homes in the United States.  Watch what the lawsuit says workers did to remains » . This is not the first time Service Corporation International has faced allegations of digging up graves and moving bodies to make room for new remains. It reached a $100 million settlement with families of people whose remains were desecrated at Menorah Gardens in Florida. The company also reached a $14 million settlement with the Florida state attorney's office over issues related to those claims. A number of celebrities are buried at Eden Park, including comedians Groucho Marx and Lenny Bruce, according to several Web sites that track burials of celebrities. Anthony Lampe, the general manager of Eden Memorial Park, said he had not seen the lawsuit and referred inquiries to Service Corporation International. Company spokeswoman Lisa Marshall said the allegations in the lawsuit were not valid. She said SCI had investigated and confirmed burial issues at Eden Memorial Park in 2007, but she could not provide specifics of that investigation. The lawsuit alleges groundskeepers were secretly instructed to break buried concrete interment vaults that contained caskets that were already buried, using backhoes. It also alleges human remains would often fall out of the broken caskets, and those body parts were either scattered or thrown away. In one case, Avenatti said, a human skull was discarded. ""We have uncovered evidence that the groundskeepers and others at Eden Memorial Park have been instructed to break off or break apart that concrete vault and, at many times, that exposes human remains,"" Avenatti said. Asked about the seriousness of the allegations, he said, ""If the allegations are proven true, this is incredibly horrific."" The lawsuit said that under Jewish tradition, ""the deceased are typically required to be interred within 24 hours, thereby leaving little time to obtain consent to move an encroaching vault in an adjacent plot and giving defendants a motive to desecrate human remains and commit other immoral acts rather than comply with the law.""","Eden Memorial Park, in Mission Hills, California, is large Jewish cemetery .

"(CNN) -- Felipe Massa has revealed that he hopes to be at his home Brazilian Grand Prix -- but he won't be behind the wheel of his Ferrari. Felipe Massa has been given the all-clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track. The 28-year-old had aimed to be able to return to racing before the end of this Formula One season, but is resigned to getting fit for 2010 following his horrific crash in July. Massa is now able to begin his rehabilitation after having plastic surgery on Monday to repair the broken bone in his cranium that resulted when a loose spring from Rubens Barrichello's Brawn hit him in the helmet during qualifying in Hungary. The operation, at the Sao Paulo's Albert Einstein hospital, took around four and a half hours, Ferrari revealed on its official Web site. Massa told UK newspaper The Guardian that his next step was to head to Europe to use a simulator and drive go-karts as part of his fitness evaluation. He had hoped to return to action at Interlagos -- where his 2008 world championship dream was crushed by Lewis Hamilton despite winning the race -- on October 18, but said that he would only be there as a spectator. ""That was the race I wanted to come back in, but it's difficult to say if it would've been possible. It will be difficult to watch it, but I will be there,"" Massa said. He told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that he still held a slim hope of driving in the final race of this season in Abu Dhabi on November 1. ""In 2010 I'll be back for sure and 100%, but it would be a dream to drive in Abu Dhabi,"" Massa said. Massa will be replaced by Giancarlo Fisichella for the final five races of 2009, with the veteran Italian having been released from his contract by Force India to take over from test driver Luca Badoer. He said he had never doubted that he would that he would get behind the wheel of a Formula One car again. ""It is my life,"" Massa, who is expecting his first child in November, told The Guardian. ""For me, the worst thing that happened was not being able to race. If you can't drive that's terrible. ""But my wife has already asked me, at least 10 times, 'Are you sure you don't feel any doubts or worries?' ""Always, I say, 'No, because this is what I like to do.' If I don't drive then I am not the same person. Ever since I was a small boy this is my life. This is what I like to do.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to approve sending thousands of additional forces to Afghanistan to deal with the growing threat from roadside bombs, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Friday. Marines detonate a roadside bomb. Injuries from the bombs have increased 700 percent in two years. Over the past two weeks, Gates has concluded that there are not enough forces or equipment in Afghanistan to protect U.S. troops from the threat of roadside bombs, Morrell said. The secretary, he said, wants to send these forces ""as soon as possible."" Morrell said the deployment would be separate from any that might be requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal. The plan could send nearly 3,000 troops, another U.S. military official familiar with the proposal said. He said Pentagon planners have already identified some of the units that would be sent. This official asked not to be identified because no final decision has been announced. Plans have been in place to set the U.S. troop level in Afghanistan at 68,000 since earlier this year, when President Obama approved an additional 21,000 troops. The decision comes at a sensitive time politically. In the last few days, two key Democrats have questioned sending additional troops. ""I don't think there's a great deal of support for sending more troops to Afghanistan in the country or in Congress,"" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told reporters Thursday. On Friday, Sen. Carl Levin,  the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee who has recently returned from Afghanistan, said the emphasis should be on training and increasing the size of the Afghanistan army before considering more U.S. forces. ""Our primary goal should be to strengthen the Afghan army and the police, to provide the necessary training and equipment and also to see if we can't reintegrate some of the lower-level Taliban people, who are the young people who aren't the religious zealots but are being taken advantage of by the leaders,"" Levin, D-Michigan, told MSNBC. Gates himself has been a vocal opponent of expanding the U.S. presence for fear that the forces would be seen as occupiers by the Afghan population. But last week, he softened that position, saying McChrystal had made a persuasive argument that the concern should not be on the size of the forces but on their conduct. Morrell said the proposal may not raise total U.S. troop strength above 68,000, because some of the units already scheduled to go could be sent not fully staffed or others already there could be sent home. Still, ""the secretary has already determined this is a requirement that needs to be fulfilled,"" Morrell said. ""The forces there now require more IED protection."" The troops would specialize in route clearance, explosive ordnance disposal, medical treatment and intelligence-gathering, Morrell said. ""We owe this to the troops already committed to the fight,"" he said. Since 2007, the number of roadside bombs in Afghanistan has jumped 350 percent, according to the Defense Department. Though many are found before they detonate, the number of troops killed has increased by more than 400 percent and the number wounded is up more 700 percent over the last two years. One U.S. military source told CNN that the Taliban's capacity to manufacture bombs, train attackers and target U.S. troops has grown over the past year. On September 8 near Kandahar, troops seized five tons of ammonium nitrate, more than twice the amount used in the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1995. On August 27, C-4 plastic explosives were found in Herat by Afghan troops. Afghanistan's rugged terrain and dirt roads make it easy to quickly hide roadside bombs. ""You have disturbed earth all the time,"" said Gen. Montgomery Meigs, former head of the Department of Defense's IED Task Force. ""Especially close to villages and close to intersections -- that just makes the seeing and finding, even by soldiers' eyes, a lot more complicated."" The Taliban have proven adept at adjusting their strategy as circumstances change. Seeing that troops were routinely stopping ahead of culverts to search for bombs that could be hidden under the roads, insurgents have started placing the bombs ahead of the culverts.","Defense secretary finds not enough forces in Afghanistan to protect U.S. troops .

"(WIRED)  -- Scofflaws could hack the smart cards that access electronic parking meters in large cities around the United States, researchers are finding. ""Cities all over the nation and all over the world are deploying these smartcard meters,"" researcher says. The smart cards pay for parking spots, and their programming could be easily changed to obtain unlimited free parking. It took researcher Joe Grand only three days to design an attack on the smart cards. The researchers examined the meters used in San Francisco, California, but the same and similar electronic meters are being installed in cities around the world. ""It wasn't technically complicated and the fact that I can do it in three days means that other people are probably already doing it and probably taking advantage of it,"" said Joe Grand, a designer and hardware hacker and one of the hosts of the Discovery Channel's ""Prototype This"" show. ""It seems like the system wasn't analyzed at all."" Grand and fellow researcher Jake Appelbaum presented their findings Thursday afternoon at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. The researchers did not contact the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or the meter maker prior to their talk, and asked reporters not to contact those organizations ahead of their presentation, for fear of being gagged by a court order. At last year's DefCon hacker conference, MIT students were barred from talking about similar vulnerabilities in smartcards used by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority after the MBTA obtained a restraining order. They spoke with Threat Level about their findings prior to the presentation. ""We're not picking on San Francisco,"" Grand said. ""We're not even claiming to get free parking. We're trying to educate people about ... how they can take our research and apply it to their own cities if they are trying to deploy their own systems or make them more secure.... Cities all over the nation and all over the world are deploying these smartcard meters [and] there's a number of previously known problems with various parking meters in other cities."" San Francisco launched a $35-million pilot project in 2003 to deploy smart meters around the city in an effort to thwart thieves, including parking control officers who were skimming money from the meters. The city estimated it was losing more than $3 million annually to theft. In response, it installed 23,000 meters made by a Canadian firm named J.J. MacKay, which also has meters in Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Canada, Hong Kong and other locales. The machines are hybrids that allow drivers to insert either coins, or a pre-paid GemPlus smart card, which can be purchased in values of $20 or $50. The machines also have an audit log to help catch insiders who might skim proceeds. To record the communication between the card and the meter, Grand purchased a smartcard shim -- an electrical connector that duplicates a smartcard's contact points -- and used an oscilloscope to record the electrical signals as the card and meter communicated. He discovered the cards aren't digitally signed, and the only authentication between the meter and card is a password sent from the former to the latter. The card doesn't have to know the password, however, it just has to respond that the password is correct. The cards sold in San Francisco are designed to be thrown out when the customer has exhausted them. But the researchers found that the meters perform no upper-bounds check, so hackers could easily boost the transaction limit on a card beyond what could legitimately purchased. They could also program a card to simply never deduct from the transaction count. ""We're residents of San Francisco and our taxes are going towards a broken system that they could potentially be losing money on and we pay the consequences of that,"" Grand said.

"TEANECK, New Jersey (CNN) -- Actress Angela Logan has played many roles off-stage to earn a living. She's worked as a teacher, model and hairdresser and is studying to be a nurse. Angela Logan samples a bite of her Mortgage Apple Cake as Bake Me A Wish! founder Josh Kaye looks on. But when she fell into foreclosure on her Teaneck, New Jersey, home, Logan turned to baking an apple cake her family had always loved. ""It was a flash of desperation,"" Logan said. ""I thought, 'Wow. We could sell these cakes, they're so good.' "" Logan named her delicacy Mortgage Apple Cake and resolved to sell 100 in 10 days at $40 each to meet a mortgage payment, pay off bills and qualify for a federal program that could lower her monthly payments. She advertised the cake to everyone she knew, including her classmates. ""The hardest part was saying, 'Can you buy my cakes, this is my problem,' because admitting to your friends that you're in foreclosure, and that you need their help, that's a hard thing to say,"" Logan said. Two years ago, a contractor promised to renovate Logan's brick-and-stucco home. But instead, Logan says he took the money and did only a portion of the work -- leaving the entire second floor bare to the beams and plastic wrap still covering much of the exterior. Logan's financial squeeze tightened when one of the actress' talent agencies shut down without paying her for commercial work. The 55-year-old divorced mother of three fell far behind on her mortgage and other debt payments, leading her to seek help from Consumer Credit Counseling of New Jersey. Counselor Pamela Glass brainstormed with Logan to envision potential extra sources of income. ""We put our heads together to make extra money,"" Glass said. ""I said, 'Take a look at what you can do.' She said, 'I bake once in a while'. I said, 'Well, maybe you can do some baking.' "" When Logan asked, neighbors, fellow church congregants and classmates responded. Soon she was baking night and day, two cakes at a time. Al Hamdi, general manager of the Hilton in nearby Hasbrouck Heights, heard of Logan's plan and offered the hotel's four giant ovens, letting her accelerate production. ""She was going to do something out of the box to save her home and her family. That was the inspiring part for us,"" Hamdi said. Logan figures she's baked about 200 cakes -- double her goal. And since qualifying for the federal Make Home Affordable program, her monthly mortgage payment is dropping by nearly 20 percent . Other Americans in a financial bind can also find creative answers to their cash crunch, Logan said. ""Find your talent. Find something you can do that will help,"" she said.  Watch as Logan describes the circumstances that led her to bake the Mortgage Apple Cake » . Many hobbies have the potential to generate extra cash: teaching a skill like playing an instrument or speaking a foreign language; home repairs for those who are handy; even dog-walking or pet-sitting for animal lovers. ""Some people have extra skills they don't use,"" Glass said. Internet retailer Bake Me A Wish! got a whiff of the Mortgage Apple Cake and is preparing to mass-produce it and share the proceeds with Logan. The company says it already has 650 Mortgage Apple Cake orders. ""We're going to be baking cakes together, develop a whole line of cakes, Angela Logan Cakes,"" said Josh Kaye, president of Bake Me A Wish! Escaping foreclosure could propel Logan to a new career in baking.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy ""The Proposal"" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in ""The Proposal."" Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe. Reynolds, meanwhile, is just refining his dry comedy thing, learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks. Who knew these two would, hmmm, complete each other? Working together, both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. iReport.com: ""Proposal"" has ""plenty of laughs"" Something borrowed: The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from ""The Office""). The snappy screwball dialogue in Pete Chiarelli's script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates ... it's all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Bronx woman has been charged with murder and robbery in the death of an 89-year-old Nazi concentration camp survivor, and police said a man is still being sought in connection with the death. Felix Brinkmann dances at a 2008 birthday party. ""He was not the kind of guy who had enemies,"" his son says. Angela Murray, 30, was arrested Saturday, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office, and is accused of strangling Guido Felix Brinkmann on Thursday in his Upper East Side apartment. Murray was arraigned Sunday and charged with one count of murder in the second degree and three counts of robbery. Brinkmann, a native of Latvia, was a Holocaust survivor who escaped death for a year while he was in the Mauthausen, Ebensee and Auschwitz camps. He had been slated for the gas chambers five times, but each time, he used his fluency in German to talk his way out, said his son, Rick Brinkman, who spells his last name differently. After the war, he was stunned to discover his wife, who had also been shipped to Auschwitz, alive and well in Poland. The Brinkmanns immigrated to America, where Brinkmann spent years in the bar and nightclub business, co-founding the Adam's Apple disco in Manhattan in 1971. In recent years, he had been the real estate manager of a mixed-use building in the Bronx, working ""seven days a week, without fail,"" Rick Brinkman said. On Thursday, the building's superintendent grew concerned when Brinkmann did not show up for work. He notified Brinkmann's son and received permission to enter the father's apartment, where he had lived alone since his wife died last year. Brinkmann was found face-down in his bedroom, his hands bound behind his back and his body showing blunt-force trauma wounds, police said. Brinkmann's blue 2009 Honda Civic had been stolen, along with one of two safes in his apartment, police said. The vehicle was later recovered in the Bronx. Rick Brinkman speculated that the killing was random. ""Anybody who knew him really liked him,"" the son said. ""He was not the kind of guy who had enemies.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For almost four months, fans of Michael Jackson were holding what were deemed by concert promoters AEG Live as the ""Hottest Tickets on the Planet."" Queues for tickets to Michael Jackson's concert wind outside the O2 Arena in London on March 13, 2009. Now some 750,000 would-be concert-goers have been left with slips of paper that, while steeped in sentimentality, won't entitle them to see the hyped spectacular that was promised to be Jackson's farewell concerts. It's unclear whether all fans will receive a full refund. Early Friday morning, AEG Live's Web site was still promoting the concerts, announcing there were just ""17 days until show time."" After midday, all reference to the shows had been removed. Late Friday afternoon, the O2 Arena was still saying that ticketing information would be available ""in due course."" And callers to Ticketmaster's customer service number were still being greeted the message, ""Ticketmaster is aware of the news relating to Michael Jackson. We have no official information at this stage. As soon as we have any information we will immediately contact all customers who have booked tickets through Ticketmaster."" Seatwave, Europe's biggest online market for fan-to-fan ticket sales, told CNN that customers who bought tickets via its Web site would receive a full refund, the cost of which would be covered by an insurance claim which could top £2 million ($3.2 million). ""This is what you buy insurance for. Unfortunately it's always for these kind of terrible circumstances,"" Joe Cohen, Founder and CEO of Seatwave told CNN. The official secondary ticketing partner for the shows, Viagogo, also promised fans a full refund. Consumer rights group Which? warned fans who bought tickets from third parties, including auction Web sites such as eBay, may have more difficulty getting their money back. Michael Jackson was scheduled to play 50 shows at the O2 Arena in London, a grueling schedule for even the fittest pop star, according to celebrity media advisor, Simon Astaire. ""He needed money, there is no question about that, hence his 50 dates at the O2. It's easy to say today and I think one has to be respectful today, but it was a stretch to do 50 concerts in the way he wanted to do in that time frame. Even for the fittest, most grounded individual it's very, very difficult,"" he told CNN. According to estimates by ""Billboard,"" unconfirmed by the promoters, Jackson's concerts would have netted the singer $50 million in ticket and merchandise sales. Back in March, tickets for an initial run of ten concerts sold out at the astonishing rate of 11 tickets per second, a feat Chris Edmonds, the Managing Director of Ticketmaster UK called a ""live entertainment phenomenon."" Demand for the tickets prompted organizers to add another 40 dates to the schedule. The London shows were to be the first step in a multi-phase package with Jackson, including plans for a 3-D live concert film and a 3-D movie based on Jackson's ""Thriller"" music video. It's not known at this stage how much of the cost of Jackson's canceled concerts will be shouldered by promoters AEG Live. The company is yet to issue a statement on the matter. It is thought only part of Jackson's 50-date London engagement was covered by insurers. One of those was Lloyds of London, whose spokesman Louise Shields told CNN ""any losses are not likely to be significant."" Mary Craig Calkins, partner at Howrey law firm in Los Angeles told CNN it was likely Jackson was covered by essential element insurance, a common form of cover in the entertainment industry to guard against losses associated with the main act. The policy would normally cover ticket sales and production-related expenses. ""He was hiring dancers for the production, there's pyrotechnics, there's the music, there's the equipment, there's the venue, "" Calkins told CNN. ""It's a bigger than life tour so you would expect the expenses to be huge... You would expect the insurance company to conduct a very thorough investigation. It's a lot of money at stake,"" she said. AEG Live's partner in Jackson's stage comeback, Tom Barrack, Chairman of Colony Capital, posted a statement on the company's Web site, saying they were ""deeply saddened"" by Jackson's death. A spokesman for Barrack declined to comment on the financial implications, saying ""they're not even focused on that, it's a personal loss."" Barrack was involved in a deal to save Jackson's Neverland Ranch when the singer's debts became overwhelming.  Watch a report about Jackson's lavish lifestyle » .

"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old man from Pakistan hopes to soon swim the English Channel with an American friend -- but first he's got to navigate the currents of bureaucracy. College teammates David Gatz (left) and Usman Javaid want to swim the English Channel for charity. Usman Javaid, an Ohio college student who has won national swimming titles in his native Pakistan, wants to swim the channel with his best friend, David Gatz, a fellow member of the swim team at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. They want to honor their international friendship by working together to accomplish a great feat: a relay across the English Channel. They also hope to raise money for charity. ""With teamwork and cooperation you can tackle even the toughest of challenges,"" Javaid told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday from Islamabad, Pakistan. Yet the British government has denied Javaid's request for the visa that would let him enter the country. British authorities say they can't grant a visa because they have questions about Javaid's student status, the young man said. ""They weren't satisfied I was going to Britain for the stated purpose,"" he said. Javaid said his passport contains a valid student visa for the United States and he sent documentation from the Channel Swimming Association with his visa application to prove he is scheduled to do the swim. The United Kingdom Border Agency told CNN in a written statement that ""all visa applications are considered on their individual merits, taking into account all the information provided."" ""Where an applicant fails to demonstrate they meet the relevant rules, their application will be refused,"" the statement said. The agency noted that anyone who is refused can reapply with additional information. Mark Cooper, the director of marketing and communication at Ohio Wesleyan University, said British authorities have not contacted the university to ask about Javaid's student status. ""We did send ... documentation to [British authorities] to follow up"" after Javaid's application was denied, he said. Javaid has since applied to the British high commissioner in Islamabad for an emergency visa. Meanwhile, Gatz and the university's head swim coach, Dick Hawes, are waiting in Dover, England, hoping things will work out so the men can try to accomplish their goal. The Channel Swimming Association has granted them permission to try their crossing between July 29 and August 6, Javaid said. The association determines such ""swim windows"" after considering the expected tides and the schedules of pilot boats, which accompany the swimmers. The association sent a letter Thursday to the British high commissioner in Pakistan to confirm Javaid's mission, said Joan Metcalfe, the association's chairwoman. As the clock ticks, Gatz remains in Dover, where he passes the time by training in the channel. ""There is some frustration,"" he said Thursday, ""but we're also optimistic."" Gatz is the captain of Ohio Wesleyan University's varsity swim team. He swam twice for the university at the NCAA national championship meet and holds numerous records. Javaid is a gold medalist on the Pakistani national swim team and represented his country at the South Asian Federation Games. Their coach said he's proud of the pair, no matter the outcome of their attempt. ""I think it's great. It shows so much maturity on their part -- first, to take on such a large endeavor, but it also speaks so much about their friendship,"" Hawes said. Their relationship reflects the unity of the entire swim team at the school, he said. ""This is an international family,"" the coach said of his swimmers. ""It's a phenomenal environment. This has just been such a great experience."" As they work to accomplish their goal, Gatz and Javaid also are accepting donations for Doctors Without Borders, an international medical humanitarian organization also known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres. Gatz, who is double-majoring in biochemistry and pre-med, said the idea came as they followed news reports of Pakistan's campaign against the Taliban this year, which displaced thousands of civilians in the country's northwest. ""We wanted to donate to an organization that was helping people there,"" he explained. Javaid added Thursday, ""That was a big reason we chose Doctors Without Borders, because there are a lot of people suffering in that area and they are assisting them."" Some of the donations will cover costs associated with their anticipated channel swim, he added. But even if they don't get to do their relay, Javaid said, their effort is still worthwhile. ""Even if my visa doesn't go through, we'll continue with Channeling Peace,"" he vowed, referring to the organization they set up for their effort. ""Even if I have to swim in a lake in Pakistan while David swims in the English Channel, it's still a powerful symbol,"" Javaid said. ""Symbols gather power not from the act itself but from the people who are supporting them,"" he said. ""A lot of people around the world are supporting us and our message. As long as they support it in their hearts and minds, we have been successful.""","College teammates want to swim English Channel for charity, international harmony .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A disabled punk band has launched a campaign to fight for the rights of disabled people to be able to party late. Heavy Load are a UK-based punk band with three out of five members who are disabled. ""Heavy Load,"" describe themselves as an ""anarcho-garage-punk"" band and are  made up of five musicians, one of whom has Downs Syndrome and two who have unspecified learning disabilities. Their campaign, ""Stay Up Late,"" encourages carers to support disabled people who want to stay out past 10pm. Heavy Load's manager and bass guitarist, Paul Richards, 39, told CNN: ""The Stay Up Late"" campaign is to raise awareness, and tackle the issue where disabled gig-goers end up going home at 9pm, therefore missing most of the evening, because their support workers finish their shifts at 10pm. ""We started the campaign because we'd be playing a gig and something strange happens at 9pm when people would start to go home. We were also frustrated with asking to go on earlier in the evening so that our fans would still be there. It's not very punk to go on at 8.30pm,"" he added. ""Stay up Late"" has received widespread support from disabled people and the UK government, Richards said. Even carers who may be required to work later if the campaign is successful have offered their support. ""So far, we've only had one or two support workers say that they don't think they should be required to work unsociable hours,"" Richards said. The group has also partnered with the UK's leading learning disabilities charity Mencap, who they say have really helped to relay their message to a wider audience. Mencap and Heavy Load teamed up last week where the band headlined a concert in London for people with learning disabilities, giving them an opportunity to be involved in running a club night.  See images from the concert » . They concert was held in conjunction with London venue Proud Camden, and around 400 people attended the event which finished at 1am. Everyone at the event, from the door girl, to bar staff and cloakroom attendants, were people with learning disabilities, venue owner Alex Proud told CNN. ""It's the first event of its kind for people with a learning disability and there was a real buzz about how people with learning disability are an untapped source in the entertainment industry."" He said: ""At these nights there is a lack of inhibitions. They tend to let their hair down and really know how to party; it's a hell of a lot of fun for all involved. Proud is eager to put on events that include people with a learning disability and to make the public more aware of this often overlooked group. ""Young people with learning disabilities want to go out, but they are not catered for in the entertainment industry,"" he added. Heavy Load have been together for 13 years since meeting at the Southdown housing in England, a non-profit assisted-living community for people with learning disabilities. Vocalist Jimmy Nicholls, 62, posted an advert and a week later the band including Michael White, 47 (drums) Simon barker, 37 (lead vocals) and Mick Williams, 47 (guitar and vocals) was formed. Since then the band has gained many disabled and non-disabled fans and a successful documentary, ""Heavy Load,"" has been made about their lives. Now they are looking forward to setting up the ""Stay Up Late"" campaign around the world. Richards said: ""When we visited New York last year we were surprised to find that it's an issue for people with learning disabilities to get out much at all -- so there is definitely a need there. ""We've also been asked to go to Russia, Serbia, other parts of the U.S., Scotland and Czech Republic to play and promote the campaign -- which we'd love to do, but money's tight, "" he added. However, Richards insists the campaign is not about partying late every night. ""We don't insist on people staying up late against their will -- just having the choice to do what they want to do!""","Disabled punk bank Heavy Load have launched the ""Stay Up Late"" campaign .

"(CNN)  -- A new standoff was brewing in Honduras as the country's recently deposed president vowed to return, while the new provisional government said it would arrest him if he set foot back in the country. Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly. Political turmoil has swept this Central American nation of 8 million people following a military-led coup Sunday that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Troops entered the president's residence and sent him out of the country in exile. A veteran legislator, Roberto Micheletti, was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress. Roberto Micheletti, the veteran legislator who was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress, was adamant that Zelaya would not return to power. ""He already committed crimes against the constitution and the laws; he can't return to be president of the republic,"" Micheletti told reporters Tuesday. ""He can no longer return to the presidency unless a president from another Latin American country comes and imposes him with arms."" Micheletti added, ""If there is an invasion against our country, we have seven-and-a-half million Hondurans ready to defend our territory and our laws and our homeland and our government."" However, Zelaya still vows to defy the provisional government. ""I am going to return on Thursday because they expelled me by force, and I am going to return as always: as a citizen and as president,"" Zelaya said at a U.N. news conference shortly after the world body unanimously adopted a resolution that he should be restored to power. Zelaya, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, called the resolution historic. ""Your servant has several accusations against him in Honduras,"" Zelaya said. ""But nobody has given me a trial. Nobody has convened a tribunal."" Meanwhile, Micheletti's provisional government said Zelaya would be arrested if he returned. ""As soon as he arrives he will be captured, as we already have the arrest warrants ready,"" new Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres told CNN en Español. Zelaya would face charges of violating the constitution, corruption and drug trafficking, among others, Ortez said. The deposed president said he would travel to Washington to attend a meeting of the Organization of American States. He also is expected to meet Tuesday evening with Tom Shannon, the top U.S. official on Latin America. Even as Zelaya spoke at the United Nations, his opponents held a large and noisy rally in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Crowd members waved blue and white Honduran flags and signs denouncing Zelaya. Roberto Micheletti, the new provisional president, briefly addressed the crowd Tuesday afternoon. He vowed that the next national elections, slated for November, will be held as planned, and that a new president will be sworn in as usual in January. Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, the top Honduran military commander who had butted heads with Zelaya, also spoke at the rally. By removing Zelaya, the armed forces were only complying with their constitutional duties, he said. Before he spoke, the crowd chanted in support, ""Armed forces! Armed forces!"" Zelaya supporters also were active Tuesday, with three major public-sector labor unions launching a general strike, a union official told CNN. About 100,000 workers joined the strike, said Oscar Garcia, vice president of the Honduran water workers union SANAA. That number could not be independently verified. ""It will be an indefinite strike,"" Garcia said. ""We don't recognize this new government imposed by the oligarchy, and we will mount our campaign of resistance until President Manuel Zelaya is restored to power."" Also on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it was reviewing its aid to Honduras as it works with regional partners on a deal to restore Zelaya to power and quell political unrest in the country. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.S. was reviewing whether Zelaya's ouster met the legal definition of a ""coup"" before any decision was made. ""Because of the situation and the very dramatic nature of the events there and our profound concern about what's going on there, I think we're looking at a number of aspects of our cooperation,"" Kelly said. The State Department has also issued a travel alert due ""to the current unstable political and security situation in Honduras."" The alert ""recommends that American citizens defer all nonessential travel to Honduras until further notice."" In another development, two U.S. military officials in Washington confirmed to CNN that U.S. helicopters will fly over southern Honduras on a humanitarian relief mission Tuesday. The officials said there is great sensitivity to any public appearance by the U.S. military in the country. The U.S. military also postponed some planned exercises with the Honduran military until the situation in the country settles down, according to the U.S. Southern Command. ""We have postponed certain activities,"" Maj. D.L. Wright, Southern Command spokesman, told CNN. Wright said this decision would be in effect for at least two to three weeks, or ""until the political situation settles."" Zelaya was overthrown early Sunday when the Honduran military arrested him and flew him to Costa Rica. Micheletti, president of the Congress, was sworn in as provisional president later Sunday. The United Nations, OAS and most nations in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, have condemned the ouster and demanded that Zelaya be restored to power. The World Bank said Tuesday it would freeze funds to Honduras until the crisis is resolved, and the United States said it is reviewing its aid to the Central American nation. The U.S. joined many other nations in co-sponsoring Tuesday's U.N. resolution. Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday. The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled that the referendum was illegal, and Congress had voted not to hold it. The high court also had overturned Zelaya's dismissal of Honduras' top general, who said the military would not participate in the referendum. The court ordered that the general be reinstated immediately. Zelaya disregarded those actions and vowed to hold the vote anyway.

Micheletti also told Honduras' representatives at the United Nations and OAS to quit speaking against the new government or they immediately will be removed from their posts. They are not authorized, he said, to speak for the Honduran government. In another development, two U.S. military officials in Washington confirmed to CNN that American helicopters will fly over southern Honduras on a humanitarian relief mission Tuesday. The officials said there is great sensitivity to any public appearance by the U.S. military in the country. Three Black Hawk helicopters are scheduled to leave an air base at Soto Cano in Honduras and fly south to Nicaragua. They will be used to support the USNS Comfort, which is conducting a medical relief mission.

"(CNN) -- NASA's Kepler space telescope has already made a discovery, and its science operations aren't even officially under way yet. The planet used in the test is a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter that orbits a star called HAT P-7. NASA scientists who put the telescope through a 10-day test after its March 6 launch said this week that Kepler is working well. Its ability to detect minute changes in light has enabled scientists to determine that a planet orbiting a distant star has an atmosphere, shows only one side to its sun and is so hot it glows. Kepler's ability to take measurements that precise at such a great distance ""proves we can find Earth-size planets,"" William Borucki, Kepler's principal science investigator told reporters at a recent briefing. The powerful scope is looking at thousands of stars in its vision field in the Milky Way on a 3½-year mission to find planets the size of Earth and to determine how common these planets are. The planet used in the test, a giant gas planet about the size of Jupiter, orbits a star called HAT P-7 in just 2.2 days and is 26 times closer than Earth is to the sun, according to NASA. It is called an exoplanet because it orbits a star outside the solar system. Kepler detected the planet's atmosphere, demonstrating the telescope's capabilities and giving astronomers what NASA says is ""only a taste of things to come."" ""It learned that this planet is like 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is so hot. And it's 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit just on one side only. The other side would be closer to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, "" said Sara Seager, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Kepler science team member. ""This particular planet showed an unusual change in brightness,"" she said. ""As the planet is orbiting the star, it goes through phases just as the moon goes through phases as seen from Earth."" ""Kepler learned something new about an old planet,"" she said. ""The new discovery was that planet is extremely hot, very, very hot. And it's very, very hot on one side, compared to the other."" Borucki compared it to ""an element in your toaster or stove.""","Kepler orbiting observatory beginning mission to find planets the size of Earth .

"(CNN) -- The Sri Lankan government should immediately release more than 280,000 displaced Tamil civilians living in detention camps, a leading human rights group said Wednesday. Tamil civilians are at Menik Farm refugee camp on the outskirts of the northern town of Vavuniya, Sri Lanka. Human Rights Watch said the displaced Sri Lankans were already victims of a protracted and bloody civil war. Now they are victims again, confined against their will, like criminals, the global watchdog group said. ""Keeping several hundred thousand civilians who had been caught in the middle of a war penned in these camps is outrageous,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Right Watch. ""Haven't they been through enough?"" But a Sri Lankan Defense Ministry spokesman said the Human Rights Watch report is overstated, and he defended the government's handling of the displaced. ""Those are not detention camps,"" said the spokesman, Lakshman Hulugalle. ""They are relief villages. All the basic facilities are being given to the people."" Sri Lanka declared victory in May in its 25-year battle with the Tamil Tiger rebels, but concerns remain about how the island nation can heal visceral war wounds. The rebels -- formally known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- waged war for an independent state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka since July 1983. As many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict. With the cease-fire, the question of how to resettle Tamil refugees, many of whom were living among the rebels, has wrought intense criticism of the government from international humanitarian agencies. The United Nations reported that as of July 19, Sri Lanka was detaining 281,621 people in 30 military guarded camps in the four northern districts of Vavuniya, Mannar, Jaffna and Trincomalee. Human Rights Watch said humanitarian workers are prohibited from discussing abuses or the final months of the ethnic conflict and that camp residents are allowed to leave only for emergency medical care, often only with military escort. In some camps, people have to register with the military twice a day, the rights group said. If they fail, they are subject to punitive measures such as being forced to stand still under the sun for extended periods of time. The group reported health problems created by inconsistent water supply and a shortage of bathroom facilities. But Hulugalle, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said barbed wire around the compounds is a common way to define barriers in Sri Lanka and that military guards were being utilized out of security concerns. The government fears that rebels are hiding in the camps and screening people living in them. ""These are people who were kept for months in LTTE clutches,"" Hulugalle said, referring to the displaced civilians. He said the government has a 180-day plan to resettle most people but that a lot of work was needed in the northern districts as far as rebuilding infrastructure and basic services destroyed in the fighting. The human rights activists say, however, that the government is not working fast enough. Human Right Watch said Sri Lanka's goal now is only to resettle 60 percent of the refugees by the end of the year. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Eric Schwartz visited a camp this week in Vavuniya, after which he announced an additional $8 million in humanitarian aid for the northern districts. But even in handing out dollars, Schwartz was critical of Sri Lanka's handling of the displaced. In a statement, he acknowledged that providing food, shelter and medical care for the displaced people was a ""formidable task."" But Schwartz said the United States remains ""deeply concerned"" about the confinement of people to camps and the hardships they endure within those camps. He also criticized the restrictions placed on humanitarian workers visiting the camps. ""The government of the United States believes the focus now must be on the prompt return of the displaced in safety and dignity, and we want to accelerate this process,"" Schwartz said. In addition to global humanitarian aid, the International Monetary Fund has approved a $2.6 billion loan to Sri Lanka to mend the country. Adams of Human Rights Watch said Sri Lanka, in need of global sympathy in its efforts to rebuild, could very well go the opposite way if the Tamil people, once subjugated by the rebels, keep waking up as prisoners of their own state.","Group: More than 280,000 displaced Tamil civilians living in detention camps .

"(CNN) -- A man shot his estranged wife to death, along with their son and grandson, before turning the gun on himself as police closed in, authorities in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, said Sunday. Police say Dennis Carter Sr. shot four family members, three fatally, before turning the gun on himself. Dennis Carter Sr., 50, also shot and critically injured his pregnant daughter-in-law, the parish sheriff's office said in a statement.  The shootings occurred Saturday night in the town of Holden, Louisiana. Authorities were dispatched to a report of shots fired at a home about 10:40 p.m. Upon arrival, they found three people dead and the fourth -- Amber Carter, 25 -- in critical condition, the statement said. Those killed were Dennis Carter Jr., 26, Amber Carter's husband; their son Mason Carter, 2; and 49-year-old Donna Carter, mother of Dennis Carter Jr. and estranged wife of Dennis Carter Sr., police said. All had been shot to death. A 16-month-old child at the home was unharmed, authorities said. Deputies believe Amber Carter attempted to escape from the gunman by jumping from a second-story window, holding Mason in her arms, the statement said, but the boy did not survive his gunshot wounds. Amber Carter had several bullet wounds, said Perry Rushing, chief of operations for the sheriff's office, and authorities believe the gunman shot her in the back as she was attempting to get out the window while holding the child. She also may have been shot again after she got outside the home, Rushing told CNN. Amber Carter was flown to a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, hospital, and later transferred to New Orleans, Rushing said. She was in critical condition as of Sunday morning. A neighbor in the area told deputies that he heard a gunshot and saw Carter Sr. walking to a car, a red El Camino, with a gun in his hand, the sheriff's statement said. At 11:30 p.m., a police officer in the adjacent town of Livingston saw the vehicle entering Interstate 12 heading eastbound, the statement said. A Livingston Parish sheriff's deputy followed the car and attempted to stop it. ""However, the suspect shot himself with a handgun, in plain view of the officers, as the vehicle veered off the shoulder of the interstate near the Holden exit,"" police said. Records from the Livingston Parish Detention Center show that Dennis Carter Sr., of Hammond, Louisiana, had been jailed ""on three separate occasions in 2009 alone, on three separate charges of violation of a protective order and one charge of aggravated assault (domestic),"" the sheriff's office said. ""At this time, there do not appear to be any other suspects or victims in this ongoing investigation,"" police said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Forty seven-year-old Australian ""adrenaline junkie"" Sean Langman will attempt to break the 50-knot sailing speed barrier with his half sailboat, half plane, after a serious crash last summer. The half sailboat, half plane uses technology known as supercavitation -- sailing just above the water's edge. Langman, a shipyard owner and yachtsman, is intent on beating the French-set record within the next few weeks, with the ""Wot Rocket,"" a canoe-style pod with a nine meter-long  rigid sail. The Wot Rocket is waiting for confirmation from the World Sailing Speed Record Council to attempt, once again, an unprecedented technology known as ""supercavitation"" -- sailing just above the water in a gas bubble created by the deflection of water. This is to to reduce the drag which is around 1,000 times greater in the water than in the air. ""Wot Rocket is so exciting as we push to sail up to three times the speed of the wind,"" Langman told CNN. In October last year Langman and his co-pilot crashed when they lost control of the vessel at 42 knots -- over 60 miles per hour. But after re-building and perfecting the vessel at a cost of half a million dollars, Langman is ready to try again. ""The exhilaration of sailing/flying is so big, you don't think about danger,"" he told CNN. Langman is certain that this time around he will beat the record. ""My only concern is we won't be able to keep control of the craft."" In case the pilots crash again, Langman says the most thing is to remain calm.  ""Last time I felt a mild panic as we were underwater. I just hoped the paramedics would get there in time. ""But really I feel very safe doing anything on water as that what I've done my whole life. I feel most 'in tune' when I'm on water,"" he added. The idea for Wot Rocket was conceived four years ago by Langman after he was inspired by the story of Burt Munro, the New Zealander who set a world land speed record on his modified Indian Scout motorcycle in 1967 -- played by Antony Hopkins in the 2005 Hollywood movie ""The World's Fastest Indian."" Do you think the wotrocket can beat the record? ""I came up with the idea in the shower. So I presented it to a group of engineers and said 'this is what I believe.'  Most said I'm a lunatic but one said 'I want to work with you'."" Langman joined forces with leading Australian designer Andy Dovell and sought input from Boeing 747 pilots for their aeronautical knowledge. He then had the ""Wot Rocket"" built using the staff and facilities at his various Shipyards. Finally, he teamed up with Wotif.com founder Graeme Wood who invested in the project because, as he explained,  he ""likes leftfield ideas."" ""My family think I'm crazy, but every time I've had an idea it's taken me somewhere. It's really about ideas versus science and trying to make it work,"" Langman explained. ""And no one remembers the second man to walk on the moon.""","Half sailboat, half plane will attempt to break the 50-knot sailing speed barrier .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Off a desert highway, about 15 miles from her home in the southern tip of Nevada, the mystery of Maureen Fields' disappearance began with the discovery of her abandoned car. The body of Maureen Fields, seen here in June 2005, hasn't been found since she went missing in 2006. Investigators found the 41-year-old woman's 2004 green Hyundai just across the California border on February 16, 2006. It was one day after her husband, Paul Fields, said he last saw her. Investigators say they discovered Fields' purse and wallet, the keys in the ignition and a fully reclined driver's seat. There were slippers and eyeglasses beneath the gas pedal, religious pamphlets, a knotted pair of pantyhose as well as three bottles of prescription tranquilizers and pain killers.  Watch an update on the case » . A small spot of her blood and vomit stained a blanket strewn across the ground beside the car. But Fields, who'd been working as a Wells Fargo bank teller in the small town of Pahrump, Nevada, has never been found. ""Just looking at the circumstances, it could appear staged"" by whoever was responsible for her disappearance, said Detective Dave Boruchowitz, an investigator with the Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff's Office. Reported inconsistencies in her 60-year-old husband's story, police said, paired with the fact that the couple was described as having a stormy relationship, made Paul Fields the initial suspect. A lack of physical evidence, however, has made the case unprosecutable, said Detective Joe Close, also with the Nye County Sheriff's Office. Paul Fields, who runs an auto business out of the double-wide trailer he and his wife shared, maintains his innocence. He's speculated that she faked her death before running off with another man. A message left at his home was not returned. But his attorney, Harold Kuehn, said, ""His contention is and my belief is that if she's truly dead, and the court says she is for civil purposes, then he didn't do it. ... What he told police is what he told me. Basically she left one day, never to be seen again."" In a new twist, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett says an unknown male's DNA was found on key items at the scene of the abandoned car. ""What we have to explore is the possibility of another suspect,"" Beckett said. ""We have to find out who this male was and whose DNA was found at the scene. It's a lot more complicated than one may think it is."" The prosecutor said he's sure a jury would have reasonable doubt if presented a case with this question mark looming. ""We have a duty to make sure we're doing the right thing,"" he said. ""There are too many unanswered questions at this time."" Maureen Fields has been declared dead, and the search for her body, and her killer, continues. Her father, Jim Fitzgerald, has been doing some investigating of his own. The former detective with the Newark, New Jersey, Police Department -- and now a national director with the conservative John Birch Society -- has made repeated trips from his Randolph Township, New Jersey, home to speak with his daughter's former friends and co-workers. He's also consulted with a psychic in his search for clues. No matter when her body is found, a serial numbered metal jaw implant -- which served to combat Fields' teeth grinding habit -- will stand as proof of her identity, Fitzgerald said. Since murder carries no statute of limitations, time is on the law's side. ""The case isn't dead to us,"" said Boruchowitz, one of the detectives still on the investigation. ""We're going to continue to work it until we prove who did it."" Anyone with information about this case should call the Nye County Sheriff's Office at 775-751-7000.","Maureen Fields of southern Nevada was 41 when she went missing in 2006 .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi has kept its U.S. heavyweight title for a fifth straight year, among both adults and children. Adult obesity rates went up in 23 states in the past year, a survey shows. The percentage of adults classified as obese went up in 23 states, but Mississippi, with 32.5 percent, stayed atop the latest annual rankings by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Trust for America's Health. The same survey put the state's adult obesity rate at 31.7 percent in 2008. In addition, 44.4 percent of Mississippi children ages 10 to 17 are classified as overweight or obese, the study found. Doctors have linked obesity to increased risks of a variety of conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and heart disease. Wednesday's study found the current U.S. economic slump could worsen the problem by putting more nutritious food out of the reach of struggling families.  See a map of obesity in the U.S. » . ""At the same time, safety-net programs and services are becoming increasingly overextended as the numbers of unemployed, uninsured and underinsured Americans continue to grow,"" the report states. ""For many people, too, worries over the recession are triggering increased depression, anxiety and stress, which often can be linked to obesity."" Dr. Ed Thompson, Mississippi's state health officer, called the report -- which was drawn from state figures -- ""old data rehashed."" But he said the state is taking steps to address what he called ""a multifaceted problem,"" targeting schoolchildren in particular. Thompson said teachers not only are trying to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and exercise, they are changing schedules to increase the amount of physical activity students experience in a day. In addition, lower-calorie, lower-fat foods are replacing some high-calorie, high starch lunchroom staples, he said. ""We can't tell our children to eat wise dietary choices and then provide them with little except for poor dietary choices in their school cafeterias,"" Thompson said. Rounding out the top five states among adults were West Virginia, with 31.2 percent of its population considered obese; Alabama, 31.1 percent; Tennessee, 30.2 percent; and South Carolina 29.7 percent. At the bottom of the rankings, Colorado had the lowest percentage of obese adults, with 18.9 percent. It was followed by Massachusetts, at 21.2 percent; Connecticut, 21.3; Rhode Island, 21.7; and Hawaii, 21.8. Even in those states, the obesity rate grew by fractions of a percent since 2008, according to the study. Thompson said most adults know they should eat less and exercise. ""The hard part is getting people to actually practice these things,"" he said. ""Our work lives require less physical exertion than they used to,"" he said. ""With less physical activity, we should have adjusted our dietary consumption downward."" While deep-fried Southern cooking is legendary, Mississippi also ranks high in poverty statistics and low in education -- two factors commonly related to obesity. But Thompson said education appears to be more closely related to obesity than poverty. ""We do see obesity among people who are in lower socioeconomic levels, but we see it in higher socioeconomic levels as well,"" he said. ""Being poor does not not make you obese, and being rich does not make you thin."" The survey used the Body Mass Index standards set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC defines someone as obese if they have a BMI -- a figure based on a ratio of height to weight -- of 30 or more, while anyone with a BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.  Calculate your Body Mass Index » . Adult obesity rates went up in 23 states in the past year, with 31 states now reporting rates over 25 percent.

"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN) -- If you listen to inventor Dean Kamen, the biggest health problem facing the world today is not AIDS, obesity or malnutrition. It's a shortage of water. Dean Kamen hopes to tackle the world's fresh water shortage with the Slingshot, a water purifying device. Water is the most abundant resource on the planet, yet less than one percent of the Earth's freshwater supply is readily available to drink, according to the World Health Organization. Lack of accessible or clean drinking water, exacerbated by drought, is crippling communities in many developing countries. ""In your lifetime, my lifetime, we will see water be a really scarce, valuable commodity,"" Kamen says. Those are scary words from the man whose creations include the Segway personal motorized scooter and the Luke (as in Skywalker) prosthetic arm. But the forward-thinking inventor and his team at DEKA Research in Manchester, New Hampshire, aren't sitting around waiting for the world's wells to dry up. They've been working on an invention they say can tap into 97 percent of the world's undrinkable water. It's called the Slingshot, and it's a portable, low energy machine that is designed to purify water in remote villages where there's not a Wal-Mart in sight. The device takes its name from a well-known story. ""We believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its Goliath of a problem in water,"" Kamen says. ""So we decided to build a small machine and give it to the little Davids."" Perhaps you've heard about the Slingshot, which Kamen has been working on for more than 10 years. Over that time it has turned dirty river water, ocean water and even raw sewage into pure drinking water. Kamen says it can turn anything that looks wet, or has water in it, into the ""stuff of life."" The magic behind the Slingshot is a ""vapor compression distiller"" that stands between what looks like two empty fish tanks connected by a couple of hoses. One tank contains the contaminated liquid, the other is for the newly clean water.  Watch Kamen demonstrate the Slingshot » . The Slingshot boils, distills and vaporizes the polluted source, in turn delivering nothing but clean water to the other side. And it does it all on less electricity than it takes to run a hair dryer. In summer 2006, Kamen delivered two Slingshots to the small community of Lerida in Honduras. They were used for a month and Kamen says everything ran as planned. ""The machine worked very well down there, taking virtually any water that the people from that village brought to us,"" he says. ""All the water that we got from the machine was absolutely pure water."" But there's a problem. Kamen says each Slingshot costs his company several hundred thousand dollars to build. He's looking to partner with companies and organizations to distribute Slingshots around the world, but says a little more engineering work needs to be done in order to lower the production costs. Kamen says the company would like to get the price down to about $2,000 per machine. ""The biggest challenge right now between this being a dream and a reality is getting committed people that really care about the state of the world's health to get involved,"" Kamen says. The world's population is quickly approaching 7 billion, making access to clean water that much more important. According to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, more than 3.5 million people die every year from water-related diseases and almost 900 million don't have access to a safe water supply. Kamen says people in developing regions of the world need the Slingshot as soon as possible. He also thinks the problem with polluted water will spread beyond small villages. He says one Slingshot machine can supply about 250 gallons of water a day, which is enough for 100 people. That's a lot of Davids. ""It is literally like turning lead into gold,"" he says. ""But I believe it's more important, because you can't drink lead or gold.""","Segway inventor Dean Kamen wants to tackle the world's fresh water shortage .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Italian authorities Tuesday arrested two suspects believed to be responsible for the September 18 killing of six African immigrants in Castelvolturno, a small town of 20,000 residents north of Naples. The army has been deployed in major cities aross Italy since the early summer. Police also arrested a third man wanted by authorities for belonging to the same clan, but not directly linked to the killings. The victims were gunned down in a hail of bullets as they stood outside a store selling ethnic goods. The attack sparked a riot by immigrants who complained about ""racism"" but officials suspect a dispute over drug trafficking. Those arrested, Alessandro Cirillo, Oreste Spagnuolo and Giovanni Letizia, were on the list of the 100 most dangerous men and wanted criminals in Italy. The arrests were part of a large police operation aimed at cracking down on organized crime in the Campania region and in particular the powerful Casalesi clan belonging to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. The Casalesi clan and the area where the arrests took place prominently featured in the best seller ""Gomorrah,"" a book written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection. ""This is a great day for the Italian state,"" said Carmelo Casabona, head of the police in Caserta. ""The operation was an immediate, concrete and strong answer to organized crime in this region."" Two weeks ago, the Italian interior minister announced the deployment of 400 additional police officers in the area. And the Italian military will deploy 500 troops by Saturday as part of a large operation Italian officials say is aimed at ""reclaiming the control of the territory."" ""Our objective is to take the water away from the sharks,"" said Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni. He explained that the additional police officers are already working, while the army's role will be defined at a key meeting Friday in Caserta. In the suspects' home, police found weapons including two AK-47s that investigators say were used to carry out the killings in Castelvolturno, as well as police overalls, one gun and one pump rifle. Authorities also arrested dozens of other people, including the wife of Francesco Schiavone, aka ""Sandokan,"" the head of the Casalesi clan who was arrested a decade ago and is serving a life-time prison sentence. As part of the same operation, Italian financial police confiscated 43 companies and 134 apartments spread throughout central and southern Italy belonging to the Casalesi clan, worth more than 100 million euros ($144 million).

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Al Franken wrote a satirical book detailing his fictitious race for the White House. In ""'Why Not Me?"" Franken trounces former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to win the election, but after countless scandals, a mental breakdown and a cloning incident, President Franken is forced to resign. Comedian, author and radio host Al Franken can now add ""senator"" to his resume. Asked how he came up with the idea for the book, Franken said at the time that a number of people had been encouraging him to run for office. ""They thought it would be a good idea because I obviously know a lot about politics; I'm comfortable on camera, as you can tell; I've been married once, have two children; very, very good looking. And I told them that I'd be a terrible office-holder, so that was sort of the genesis of this idea,"" he said. As far-fetched as the plot was, Franken's political aspirations weren't fantasy, and eight months after Election Day, the Democrat will be sworn in as an office-holder, representing Minnesota in the Senate. Soon after, the outspoken comedian and former radio host will take over the desk once occupied by election rival Norm Coleman. For months, Coleman appealed the election results, in which a recount gave Franken a 312-vote lead. But Coleman's case was put to rest last week when Minnesota's Supreme Court ruled in Franken's favor.  Franken on the issues » . When Franken is sworn in Tuesday, the title ""senator"" will become just the next line on a lengthy and varied résumé that reflects a man who has built up an illustrious yet controversial name for himself. Franken, born in New York in 1951, moved to Minnesota when he was 4 years old. He grew up in a middle-class family and did well in school. Franken attended Harvard University, where he majored in political science. After graduation, Franken teamed up with his home-state pal Tom Davis, and the two started writing for what became known as ""Saturday Night Live."" Franken was also a performer -- playing self-help guru Stuart Smalley and impersonating public figures like Henry Kissinger and the Rev. Pat Robertson -- and over the course of two decades, he took home five Emmys for his work on the show. Post-""SNL,"" Franken dabbled in film and had a successful career as an author, penning several best-sellers, including ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.""  Watch CNN's Brianna Keiler report on Franken's plans » . In 2004, Franken made a name for himself as someone well-versed in politics through ""The Al Franken Show,"" carried by Air America Radio. During his final show on February 14, 2007, Franken announced his intentions to run for the Senate. But the man who once played Liam the Loose-Boweled Leprechaun wasn't the first unlikely politician to come from Minnesota. Voters there elected former wrestler Jesse Ventura as their governor in 1998. David Schultz, a professor of law at Hamline University in St. Paul, says Franken's win was probably not an affirmation of support for the Democratic candidate but was, for many, a ""lesser of two evils vote."" Third-party candidate Dean Barkley was chipping into Coleman's support, and ""in addition, Coleman threw all his dirt against Franken early, and by the general election, it was old news."" ""Coleman had little new to campaign on during the general election, and Franken became a better candidate in terms of campaigning during the last two months,"" he said. In a video posted on his campaign Web site, explaining that he wanted to run, Franken said Minnesotans had ""a right to be skeptical"" about whether he was ready to take on such a challenge.  Watch more on the Franken factor » . Franken cited late Minnesota Sen. Paul Wellstone as his political hero. Wellstone, who first won election to the Senate in 1990, died in a plane crash shortly before the 2002 election. Going into the race, Coleman was considered one of the more vulnerable Republicans seeking re-election. Although he'd started distancing himself from President Bush, he had been long seen as one of the president's allies. Franken's campaign took off, and he raked in contributions, but his foes were not going to let Coleman go down without a fight. The former comedian's past came back to attack him as anti-Franken ads focused on some of his more controversial lines. The National Republican Senatorial Committee launched a 60-second spot highlighting clips from Franken's SNL days, with an announcer saying, ""Rape jokes, poor and foul-mouthed anger do not make for good training for the United States Senate."" The Minnesota State Republican Party also blasted their challenger for a 2000 Playboy column he wrote called ""Porn-O-Rama!"" When the votes were tallied on Election Day, Coleman held a slight edge on Franken, leading with just 206 votes. Under Minnesota law, a recount was in order because the margin of victory was less than .5 percent. The controversial recount, and subsequent court challenges, evoked comparisons to the 2000 Bush-Gore saga. But Franken came out on top in one of the most drawn-out Senate races in Senate history. A day after the Minnesota Supreme Court handed down its unanimous decision in favor of Franken -- and 239 days after the election -- the newly dubbed senator-elect thanked his supporters in an at-times emotional speech on the steps of the state Capitol. ""It is, of course, technically true that this was Paul's U.S. Senate seat. But I don't think Paul saw it that way,"" Franken said Wednesday, again paying respects to Wellstone. ""This seat belongs to the people of Minnesota, and so did Sen. Wellstone, and so will I,"" he said as he thanked his wife, Franni, supporters, volunteers, campaign staff members and the people of the state he will represent. Now, Franken takes on what could be the most influential role of his life as he joins the Senate, giving Democrats their potentially filibuster-proof 60th vote. Senate Democrats are welcoming their newest with open arms, and although the months-long contest has reached a resolution, it's likely the division over Franken will follow him to Capitol Hill. ""The arrival of the man from Minnesota will make the Democrats move even more to the left. He will not only be one more vote for the left, but one more loud voice for liberal policies,"" John Feehery wrote in a commentary for CNN.com. Feehery is a former staffer for former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and other Republicans in Congress. ""When Franken first started in politics, he did so as the liberal answer to Rush Limbaugh. Imagine if Rush were the 60th vote for Republicans, with George Bush as president. Now, think how Franken will act as the 60th vote for President Obama,"" he wrote.","Al Franken defeated Norm Coleman in one of the longest Senate races in history .

"(CNN) -- Blair MacIntyre imagines a world where tiny clouds of information -- Facebook statuses, business cards, Twitter posts -- float above all of our heads. ""Augmented reality"" can combine live video with data and information from the Internet. In some ways, it's not that far from reality. Advancements in mobile phone technology have cleared the way for a coming wave of ""augmented reality"" applications that merge the physical world with information compiled about people and places on the Internet. ""When the technology gets there, this stuff could be amazingly useful and mildly terrifying in some ways,"" said MacIntyre, an associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has taught classes in augmented reality for a decade. The idea of pairing digital information with our real, 3-D environments is not especially new -- think robot-human vision in the ""Terminator"" movies. MacIntyre even plodded about college campuses in the 1990s wearing a 40-pound backpack and nerdy goggles, trying to make something similar happen. But as mobile phones become better equipped with GPS systems, which use satellites to locate the phones; compasses, which tell the direction the phone faces; and accelerometers, which relay the device's tilt; the once-lofty idea of augmented reality is being put into the hands of consumers. Last July in the Netherlands, a company called SPRXmobile released a mobile browser, Layar, that lets people see pieces of this new info-reality through their phone screens. A Layar user sets his or her phone to video mode, aims it around and sees all kinds of information pop up on the screen: blinking dots on apartments that are for sale, the values of those units, pull-down reviews of the bar up on the corner or details about sales at a nearby retail store. Watch a video demo of the app . This makes information easier to find and helps people make better sense of the physical world around them, said Maarten Lens-FitzGerald, co-founder of Layar. ""I think it will actually get you out more than you would stay at home,"" he said. ""You're not at your couch anymore, you're not at your desk"" when you need to find information. Layar, which bills itself as the first mobile browser that features augmented reality, is only available in the Netherlands and only on certain phones, including Google's Android, T-Mobile's G1 and the HTC Magic. But Lens-FitzGerald said the company plans to announce a global expansion plan on August 17 and will develop an app for the iPhone if Apple changes policies that obstruct developers from creating such applications on that device. A range of other ""AR"" apps are in development or are on the market. One, called Nearest Tube, highlights subway routes in New York and London. Wikitude is an app that aims to show people encyclopedic information about nearby landmarks. Like Wikipedia, users can add information to the service. The idea could usher in an era of cell-phone tour guides. Total Immersion, a French company, developed an app that makes 3-D baseball players spring to life from baseball cards. Users can turn the card to see their favorite players, through a phone screen, from all angles. And at Georgia Tech, researchers are working on video games that may one day make it look like virtual zombies are chasing players down real-world streets. Alex Michaelis, CEO of Tweetmondo, a site that pairs Twitter posts with geographical information, said he has developed an app that will let mobile phone users see their friends' tweets through the video camera on their phones. He expects it to be available within the month. ""It adds information to your world, and this is what it's all about,"" he said. To picture how that service would work, think about walking into your living room in the evening. If a roommate had posted to Twitter from the couch, his or her Tweet would hover in that space when viewed through a mobile phone's video camera. Michaelis admits the model is a bit clunky for now. But he sees a future when the app will let people stand on a street corner, hold their phone up to their face, and see the Twitter posts of crowd members as they mill about. Phones would have to be able to communicate with satellites and computer services constantly, instead of only when someone posts a message, to make that possible, he said. ""I see this being resolved in the near future,"" he said, ""because, really, it's just a matter of really experimenting with this technology and pushing it to the limit."" But there are doubts about augmented technology on phones. Lens-FitzGerald, of Layar, is concerned that augmented reality is being over-hyped and may create unrealistic expectations from consumers. ""It's a cool technology, but yeah, we need to see how much [funding and visibility] our companies will get,"" he said. ""It's getting a lot of press now without being proven, but do we make money, are we going to make people happy with it? We don't know. We're just starting."" He added: ""It's like the first TV. We need to build an audience."" MacIntyre, of Georgia Tech, said the technology behind today's augmented reality apps is crude. Mobile phone GPS isn't nearly accurate enough to make sure a Twitter post is tagged to a person, for instance, rather than the lamp post that's 50 feet away. Furthermore, the idea behind the information-reality mesh on mobile phones is off-base, he said. ""I don't see them answering a problem that needs to be solved,"" added MacIntyre, who believes two-dimensional maps can be used to display information much more easily with current technology. More functional problems exist as well. People don't necessarily want to walk around the world holding cell-phone screens in front of their faces. And the world's information has to be tagged geographically to make sense in an augmented-reality setting. But MacIntyre does see a bright future for augmented reality. Within a year, mobile phone applications will become much more functional, he said, and in the foreseeable future, augmented reality will move off of phone screens and onto futuristic sunglasses, whose wearers will see blips of information about everything around them, he said. If that happens, the ""Terminator"" vision will have truly arrived.","""Augmented reality,"" a merger of the digital and virtual worlds, is coming to phones .
""AR"" apps put info -- like Twitter posts -- on top of live video captured by phone .
Smartphone GPS and compass systems paved the way for the advance .
Some say AR is in its infancy; others question its usefulness ."
"Editor's note: Pedro A. Noguera is a professor at New York University and director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education. He is editor of ""Unfinished Business: Closing the Achievement Gap in Our Nation's Schools"" and author of ""The Trouble With Black Boys: And Other Reflections on Race, Equity and the Future of Public Education."" Pedro Noguera says Obama needs to be wary of alienating teachers who can be his allies on education reform. (CNN) -- President Obama has made it clear from the earliest days of his presidency that he intended to make education a high priority for his administration. He reaffirmed that commitment Tuesday when he addressed schoolchildren on the topic. In one of his first presidential addresses, he made a special appeal to students at risk of dropping out: ""... [D]ropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country, and this country needs and values the talents of every American."" The president's commitment to education is truly remarkable, considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration. From health care and the economic crisis, to global warming and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved. The fact that the president and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation. However, as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education, it would be wise for it to proceed with caution. The administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education. If these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the Race to the Top (RTT) program are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue. The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers. The current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers, led by school superintendents like Joel Klein of New York and Michelle Rhee of Washington, D.C., and the defenders of the status quo, most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment. While anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound, a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education. Instead of choosing sides, it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives. For example, instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers' unions, the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers, have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school-based formulas that reward increases in student achievement. This is similar, though not identical, to the approach taken in New York City, one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning. Similarly, rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education, the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies. This is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration's pronouncements about charter schools. Unlike the public schools, many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students, and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract. Moreover, many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools. These facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities. In fact, it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors. Finally, the president has championed the idea of ""promise neighborhoods"" as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities, using as a model the Harlem Childrens Zone. If this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children, it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children. With dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation's cities, the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with No Child Left Behind will not deliver the change we need. The president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics to the nation, an approach that focused on finding common ground among diverse constituencies to solve the pressing problems of our time. In areas like health care, energy, the economy and foreign policy, this new approach has not yet gained traction. However, it is not too late for the president to unite the nation around a common effort to improve public education. For this to happen, he will need to keep above the fray and stay focused on a strategy that sends a clear message to all constituencies that working together to improve public education is in our national interest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pedro A. Noguera.","Pedro Noguera: It's good that Obama is emphasizing education's importance .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A European Union delegation met Saturday with Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who said the parties had established a ""good rapport."" President Mugabe and his wife, Grace, arrive for a ZANU PF party youth conference on Friday. ""There was no animosity, it was quite friendly,"" Mugabe said. Gunilla Carlsson, the Swedish minister for International Development Cooperation, said the parties ""definitely made some progress."" ""Of course we didn't agree with everything Mr. Mugabe said, but it was a correct meeting and we exchanged views,"" Carlsson, who is heading the mission, told CNN's Rosemary Church. The delegation met with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai later on Saturday. Carlsson spokesman Peter Larsson had said earlier that ""there was no sense of any hostility from Mugabe."" Larsson was referring to remarks the Zimbabwean president made Friday, when he condemned ""bloody whites"" for meddling in his country's affairs. Carlsson is heading the mission to Zimbabwe. ""Sanctions or no sanctions, Zimbabwe remains ours,"" .Mugabe told his ZANU-PF party's youth conference in Harare on Friday. ""Who said the British and the Americans should rule over others? That's why we say, down with you. We have not invited these bloody whites. They want to poke their nose into our own affairs. Refuse that,"" he said. The European Union imposed travel bans on Mugabe and his representatives in 2002. The bans were imposed after accusations of human rights violations and election fraud. In addition to travel restrictions, the European Union has frozen the assets of more than 200 Zimbabweans for allegedly violating human rights, according to Sweden, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU this year. On Saturday, Mugabe again addressed ""sanctions,"" saying he was dismayed that they were not lifted after meeting with the EU delegation. ""I have always been disappointed with sanctions on Zimbabwe,"" he said, adding that the EU delegation ""thought things were not working, yet we did all the things we were asked to do"" under a power-sharing agreement signed in September last year. Larsson said there was no discussion about the restrictions at the meeting. Under the agreement, which was to end months of turmoil and violence that followed the country's March 2008 presidential elections, Mugabe retained his office, and opposition leader Tsvangirai became prime minister. The agreement -- the Global Political Agreement-- spelled out a number of fundamental democratic reforms, but so far there has been no progress toward them, Carlsson said in a statement ahead of the meetings with Mugabe and Tsvangirai. ""There have not yet been clear positive developments in all areas. I am still concerned at the lack of democratic development,"" she said then. After meeting with Tsvangirai, Carlsson told CNN that ""Tsvangirai's government is working hard towards the implementation of the political agreement."" She added, ""After such a long time of oppression, it is of course hard to move forward and change will take some time. But the EU is committed to follow up on this progress and encourage change.""

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ""Zeitoun"" by Dave Eggers, a nonfiction account of a Syrian-American immigrant and his extraordinary experience during Hurricane Katrina. Eggers is the author of five other books, including ""What Is the What,"" a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award. Eggers is the founder and editor of McSweeney's, an independent publishing house based in San Francisco. Dave Eggers writes that Abdulrahman Zeitoun dreamed of fishing on the Syrian coast as Katrina approached. (CNN) -- FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2005 . On moonless nights the men and boys of Jableh, a dusty fishing town on the coast of Syria, would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats. Five or six small craft, two or three fishermen in each. A mile out, they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea, drop their nets, and, holding their lanterns over the water, they would approximate the moon. The fish, sardines, would begin gathering soon after, a slow mass of silver rising from below. The fish were attracted to plankton, and the plankton were attracted to the light. They would begin to circle, a chain linked loosely, and over the next hour their numbers would grow. The black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see, below, a solid mass of silver spinning. Abdulrahman Zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way, a method called lampara, borrowed from the Italians. He had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats, and he'd spent those years asking questions. Why only on moonless nights? Because, his brother Ahmad said, on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere, spread out all over the sea, and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease. But without a moon the men could make their own, and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations. You have to see it, Ahmad told his little brother. You've never seen anything like this. And when Abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight, the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light. He said nothing, and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet, too, paddling without motors, lest they scare away the catch. They would whisper over the sea, telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them. A few hours later, once the sardines were ready, tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light, the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in. They would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn. He would pay the men and boys, and would then sell the fish all over western Syria -- Lattakia, Baniyas, Damascus. The fishermen would split the money, with Abdulrahman and Ahmad bringing their share home. Their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind, so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings. Abdulrahman and Ahmad didn't care much about the money, though. They would have done it for free. Thirty-four years later and thousands of miles west, Abdulrahman Zeitoun was in bed on a Friday morning, slowly leaving the moonless Jableh night, a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream. He was in his home in New Orleans and beside him he could hear his wife Kathy breathing, her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat. Otherwise the house was silent. He knew it was near six o'clock, and the peace would not last. The morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows. One of the four would open his or her eyes, and from there the movements were brisk, the house quickly growing loud. With one child awake, it was impossible to keep the other three in bed. Kathy woke to a thump upstairs, coming from one of the kids' rooms. She listened closely, praying silently for rest. Each morning there was a delicate period, between six and six-thirty, when there was a chance, however remote, that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. But now there was another thump, and the dog barked, and another thump followed. What was happening in this house? Kathy looked to her husband. He was staring at the ceiling. The day had roared to life. The phone began ringing, today as always, before their feet hit the floor. Kathy and Zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because they couldn't pronounce his first -- ran a company, Zeitoun A. Painting Contractor LLC, and every day their crews, their clients, everyone with a phone and their number, seemed to think that once the clock struck six-thirty, it was appropriate to call. And they called. Usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six-thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail. Kathy took the first one, from a client across town, while Zeitoun shuffled into the shower. Fridays were always busy, but this one promised madness, given the rough weather on the way. There had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the Florida Keys, a chance it might head north. Though this kind of possibility presented itself every August and didn't raise eyebrows for most, Kathy and Zeitoun's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations. Throughout the morning the callers would want to know if Zeitoun could board up their windows and doors, if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came. Workers would want to know if they'd be expected to come in that day or the next. ""Zeitoun Painting Contractors,"" Kathy said, trying to sound alert. It was an elderly client, a woman living alone in a Garden District mansion, asking if Zeitoun's crew could come over and board up her windows. ""Sure, of course,"" Kathy said, letting her feet drop heavily to the floor. She was up. Kathy was the business's secretary, bookkeeper, credit department, public-relations manager -- she did everything in the office, while her husband handled the building and painting. The two of them balanced each other well: Zeitoun's English had its limits, so when bills had to be negotiated, hearing Kathy's Louisiana drawl put clients at ease. This was part of the job, helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds. Kathy hadn't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about. It took a lot more than a few downed trees in south Florida to get her attention. ""We'll have a crew over this afternoon,"" Kathy told the woman. Kathy and Zeitoun had been married for eleven years. Zeitoun had come to New Orleans in 1994, by way of Houston and Baton Rouge and a half-dozen other American cities he'd explored as a young man. Kathy had grown up in Baton Rouge and was used to the hurricane routine: the litany of preparations, the waiting and watching, the power outages, the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain. There seemed to be a half-dozen named storms every August, and they were rarely worth the trouble. This one, named Katrina, would be no different.","Dave Eggers: Abdulrahman Zeitoun grew up in a Syrian fishing town .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  --   More than 33,000 items of old denim -- jeans, hats and jackets -- were sent to Washington in a recycling effort that will benefit disaster-struck homes, officials said. Erek Hansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans to the cause and collected almost 1,700 pairs. National Geographic Kids magazine encouraged readers to donate their old denim instead of throwing it away. The resulting 33,088 pieces of denim clothing set a world record, verified Wednesday by a representative from Guinness World Records, according to the magazine's blog. The thousands of pairs of jeans, which are on display at Union Station for two weeks, will be turned into housing insulation for homes affected by natural disasters. According to the magazine, there will be enough material to provide insulation for 60 houses. The jeans will be turned over to Cotton Inc., which collects used denim for natural fiber insulation made without carcinogens or chemical irritants. Paula Rosario, vice president of consumer marketing for the company, said that the new record ""certainly attests to the civic-mindedness of today's children."" The ceremony unveiling the denim display also honored 9-year-old Erek Hansen, who collected nearly 1,700 jeans. The elementary school student from Curtice, Ohio, said that his friends and classmates ""were happy to help the environment."" Hansen donated five pairs of his own outgrown jeans.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Los Angeles firefighters and city crews worked for several hours Tuesday to rescue one of their own: a 22-ton firetruck that was nearly swallowed by a water-logged sinkhole. Two firefighters crawled out of the truck's windows after it sank Tuesday morning. No one was injured. The incident happened after four firefighters took the truck to the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Valley Village, where flooding had been reported after a water main break, just before 6 a.m. PT. After seeing running water in the road, a fire captain instructed the rig's driver to back up and had two firefighters get out of the truck to direct it. That's when the ground gave way and the front of the truck began quickly sinking. The driver and captain crawled out of the truck's windows to escape. The four firefighters were not injured. Workers had to simultaneously pull and lift the truck to get it out of the sinkhole. Watch workers pull truck from sinkhole .

"(MENTAL FLOSS) -- College admissions are competitive, and not just from the student's side. Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants. Davidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service. While some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services. While the cost of these ""free"" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of: . 1. Free laundry . Nothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them. Since 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them. The laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms. As if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges . 2. Free skiing . Michigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime. 3. Free computers . At my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate. While there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly. Mental Floss: 12 college classes we wish our schools offered . 4. Free theater tickets . Nothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds. Ticket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as little as $12 and into Mets games for just $3. Of course, the way those teams have played in the last year or so, that offer might scare off more prospective students than it entices. 5. Personalized birthday cakes . College birthdays are often all sorts of debauched fun, but at least in my experience, they were often sorely lacking in quality cake. Sure, sometimes you'd get a pan full of Betty Crocker-ed good intentions cooked in a dorm oven, which are precisely calibrated to burn cakes' edges while leaving the center liquid, but it was rare to see a real birthday cake. Ohio University's dining services can fix that, though, by allowing students' parents to join the Birthday Club. For $18, parents can make sure their kid gets a personalize birthday cake and all of the plates, napkins, and forks they'll need to share it with their friends. 6. Cheap golf . College students who want to golf on a tight budget often have to resign themselves to finding the rattiest municipal course they can find and hoping they survive the ordeal. Students at Stanford, though, have access to the Stanford Golf Course, a legendary course that's hosted such greats as Tom Watson and Tiger Woods since it opened in 1930. Only students, alumni, faculty, and their guests can enjoy the course's picturesque views of San Francisco, and for guests the price is pretty steep, up to $110 a round. Students, though, get a great deal on greens fees; they can get in a full round for just $25. Mental Floss: 12 star-powered college roommate pairs .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A high court in northern India on Friday acquitted a wealthy businessman facing the death sentence for the killing of a teen in a case dubbed ""the house of horrors."" Moninder Singh Pandher was sentenced to death by a lower court in February. The teen was one of 19 victims -- children and young women -- in one of the most gruesome serial killings in India in recent years. The Allahabad high court has acquitted Moninder Singh Pandher, his lawyer Sikandar B. Kochar told CNN. Pandher and his domestic employee Surinder Koli were sentenced to death in February by a lower court for the rape and murder of the 14-year-old. The high court upheld Koli's death sentence, Kochar said. The two were arrested two years ago after body parts packed in plastic bags were found near their home in Noida, a New Delhi suburb. Their home was later dubbed a ""house of horrors"" by the Indian media. Pandher was not named a main suspect by investigators initially, but was summoned as co-accused during the trial, Kochar said. Kochar said his client was in Australia when the teen was raped and killed. Pandher faces trial in the remaining 18 killings and could remain in custody, the attorney said.","Court acquitted Moninder Singh Pandher for the killing of a teen .

"(CNN) -- A man authorities believe has robbed at least 10 banks in at least four states was arrested in Missouri after a retired state trooper saw him and learned he was wanted, authorities said Sunday. Schaffner is seen in a police mug shot after his arrest Saturday in Kingdom City, Missouri. Chad Schaffner, 37, was arrested in Kingdom City, Missouri, about 2:45 p.m. Saturday, said Missouri State Highway Patrol radio operator Paula Price. Sam Lakey, a retired Missouri State Highway Patrol officer said he alerted authorities to Schaffner's whereabouts after seeing him at a motel in Kingdom City, about 100 miles west of St. Louis, Missouri. Lakey didn't know who Schaffner was at first, but said he felt something wasn't right after seeing Schaffner and his car, partly because Schaffner didn't make eye contact with him.  Watch how ex-cop's hunch brought arrest » . Lakey, who was staying at the motel, said he remembered seeing news reports about a man sought in a string of bank robberies, so he looked on the Web site of the television show ""America's Most Wanted"" to check a vehicle description in the case. A license plate number on the site matched that of the car outside the motel, he said. ""I felt my goosebumps raising,"" he said. Lakey told CNN that after calling his old colleagues at the Missouri State Highway Patrol, he packed up his family from their room at the motel and watched the arrest from across the street. Schaffner faces charges including bank robbery in Tennessee; burglary in Indiana; armed robbery in Illinois; and receiving stolen property in Ohio, Price said. He also faces drug charges in Missouri, she said. Schaffner is suspected of robbing banks in states including Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the FBI. Schaffner is suspected in 14 robberies of various types in six states, FBI Special Agent Brian Truchon told CNN on Sunday. A spokeswoman for the Callaway County Jail, in Fulton, Missouri, said Schaffner was booked into the facility about 8 p.m. Saturday. No bond has been set, she said. Schaffner will appear in court Monday in Jefferson City, Missouri, according to Bridget Patton, spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City, Missouri, office. Schaffner was identified as a suspect last month after investigators posted surveillance photos from the robberies on electronic billboards throughout the South. In the photos, a man was seen sneering and holding a pistol sideways. The robberies began in May. While no one was harmed, the FBI said they considered the suspect dangerous. ""This guy has made no effort to hide the gun,"" said FBI agent Kevin Keithley last month. ""He has threatened the use of it in every bank robbery he has committed. He has put the gun in the faces of the tellers, threatened to use the gun against them. So we want to get this guy in custody before he harms anyone."" A woman in Morristown, Tennessee, also told authorities Schaffner hid in her apartment in August and threatened to kill her children if she revealed his whereabouts, according to documents filed in federal court. When Schaffner was identified, the FBI said he was released from an Indiana prison last year following an armed robbery conviction. He also has several other convictions in Indiana, for crimes including burglary, resisting law enforcement, and purchase of a handgun without a license, according to the Indiana Department of Correction. The last bank robbery Schaffner is suspected of committing occurred in Caseyville, Illinois, on Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. Two bank robberies occurred in Morristown and Jefferson City, Tennessee, on August 18, authorities said. The billboards began showing images from the robberies on August 24, and the next day, a man told the FBI that Schaffner was in the Morristown area at the time of the August 18 holdups. The man said he'd known Schaffner for about two months, according to a federal criminal complaint. FBI agents also interviewed a Morristown woman after hearing she'd had a brief relationship with Schaffner, the complaint says. During the first interview, she spoke to agents outside her apartment and denied knowing him, the complaint said. But the next day she told authorities she knew Schaffner and that he had been in her apartment with her children while she talked to police outside. He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said. CNN's Marylynn Ryan, Chuck Johnston and Justin Lear contributed to this report.","NEW: Ex-trooper checked ""America's Most Wanted"" site after becoming suspicious .

"WASHINGTON -- For the second time since resigning the Alaska governorship more than a month ago, Sarah Palin is adding her voice to the fiery debate over health care. Sarah Palin says in a new op-ed that big government is not the solution to health care reform. This time, Palin is hitting the pages of the Wall Street Journal to counter President Obama's latest efforts to reform the nation's health care system. ""The answers offered by Democrats in Washington all rest on one principle: that increased government involvement can solve the problem. I fundamentally disagree,"" Palin writes in the 1,110-word opinion piece in Wednesday's edition of the paper. ""Common sense tells us that the government's attempts to solve large problems more often create new ones,"" the former Republican vice presidential candidate continues. ""Common sense also tells us that a top-down, one-size-fits-all plan will not improve the workings of a nationwide health-care system that accounts for one-sixth of our economy."" Palin, whose initial Facebook posting on ""death panels"" last month is credited with spurring heated opposition to the House Democratic health care proposal, again raises the claim -- now widely debunked -- that a government panel could determine which senior citizens receive vital treatments. ""Is it any wonder that many of the sick and elderly are concerned that the Democrats' proposals will ultimately lead to rationing of their health care by -- dare I say it -- death panels?"" she writes. ""Establishment voices dismissed that phrase, but it rang true for many Americans.""  Watch more on the health care debate » . Ultimately, Palin says, ""Congress will likely reject a wrong-headed proposal to authorize end-of-life counseling in this cost-cutting context"" because Americans made their voices heard in the contentious town halls last August. ""But the fact remains that the Democrats' proposals would still empower unelected bureaucrats to make decisions affecting life or death health-care matters. Such government overreaching is what we've come to expect from this administration,"" she says. Palin also takes issue with the president's assertion that Democrats' heath care proposals will rein in costs and eliminate waste and inefficiency in the system. Citing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Palin says currently proposed health care legislation will do little to bring down costs, but will instead cause the federal deficit to skyrocket by more than $200 billion over the next decade. ""Only in Washington could a plan that adds hundreds of billions to the deficit be hailed as a cost-cutting measure,"" writes Palin. Instead, Palin argues the true solution to health care lies in ""market oriented, patient-centered, and result driven"" measures such as providing tax benefits for those who get health care coverage from their jobs, providing seniors on Medicare vouchers to buy their own coverage, and allowing people to buy health insurance across state lines.","Sarah Palin blasts Democrats' health care reform proposals in newspaper op-ed .

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- At least four people have been killed in two days of rioting in Uganda's capital after radio broadcasts encouraged listeners to violently take to the streets against the government, officials said Friday. Residents of the Kasubi suburb, west of Kampala, try to flee from violence as a soldier takes photos. The rioters heard ""sectarian"" broadcasts on Thursday that ""systematically incited the listeners to cause chaos and destruction wherever they could,"" said a statement issued by Minister of Information and National Guidance Kabakumba Masiko. It described those who took part in the rioting in Kampala and its suburbs as ""marauding thugs."" The broadcasts aired in the Buganda Kingdom, said police spokeswoman Judith Nabakooba. Ethnic and political tension between the kingdom and the central government had been escalating over the past few weeks. Police and army officers were injured and police-owned property also was damaged along with other vehicles and shops, said the nation's police chief, Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura. In Natete-Ndeba, a southwest suburb, a police station was looted of its ammunition and prisoners set free before rioters burned the prison, Nabakooba said. A curfew has been declared in the suburb, and in Kampala the army is providing support to police, said Kayihura. A doctor at a Kampala hospital said more than 50 people had sought care there, most with broken bones, but others had cuts and gunshot wounds. About 60 people were arrested in Kampala, but arrest totals in the surrounding areas were not available, Nabakooba said. Four radio stations were ordered shut down, Masiko said. Many of the rioters were Baganda between the ages of 18 and 35, Nabakooba said. The Baganda are Uganda's dominant ethnic group, making up about 16.9 percent of the population, according to The CIA World Factbook. The kingdom is one of the oldest monarchies in Africa. The people live mostly in central Uganda and along the shoreline of Lake Victoria. Tension between the Buganda Kingdom, headed by King Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, and Uganda President Yoweri Museveni had been increasing recently over land laws, sovereignty and political power, issues over which the two sides have been in talks for years. The Uganda government sees Mutebi as a traditional leader only and does not allow him to participate in politics. Further estranging the two is a breakaway faction of the Buganda Kingdom, the Banyala. Some interpreted police forces' breaking up a group of Baganda amid preparations for festivities as support for the Banyala, especially after a Banyala demonstration opposing the Buganda Kingdom prompted no police action. It is unclear why the police broke up the Baganda group earlier in the week. Riots broke out after the incident, and again when radio announcers pushed Baganda to take to the streets again. Museveni said in a broadcast statement that he tried to contact Mutebi to discuss the issue as ""mature people"" but he could not reach him on the phone. The president also said that he had intelligence reports showing that the Buganda Kingdom has received foreign funding to carry out a hate campaign against the government. Asians, mostly of Indian origin, suffered severe losses when their business were attacked and looted, Nabakooba said. Although officials said the broadcasts encouraged listeners to put into action their contempt for the government, during such outbreaks of violence Asians are often targeted. Some view Asians as being most protected by the government because of special holidays or tax benefits they may get. In addition, reports of Asians mistreating natives have fueled tension between the groups. None of the four people killed were Asian or of Asian descent, Nabakooba said, but in the northern suburb of Kawembi about 30 Asians had fled to a police station for protection on Thursday and remained there Friday. Samson Ntale contributed to this report for CNN.","Radio broadcasts encouraged violent street action against the government .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Mary J. Blige has sung her way to nine Grammy Awards and sold 40 million albums worldwide. ""I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting,"" Mary J. Blige said. With music credentials like that, the ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" needed a new challenge. So Blige decided to stretch her range to the big screen. The singer stars in the new Tyler Perry film ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson, Perry and Gladys Knight. Being in the film allows Blige to test her acting chops and sing as well. Her character, Tanya, is a club owner who takes the mic at least twice in the film. And whether she's in character or not, Blige's ability to communicate a song can take your breath away. CNN spoke with Blige about Tyler Perry, her acting angst and music. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What does the title of the film ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" mean? Mary J. Blige: Well, the title ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" is basically saying ""I don't need anyone to help me do worse or feel worse than what I already feel."" So if you're coming with negative energy, please keep it moving, you know? If you're coming with negative deposits, you've gotta go. That's basically what it's saying. CNN: Were you nervous about acting in this film? Blige: I was definitely nervous, because acting is not my first profession, so I had to go and get an acting coach and really figure this thing out. It helped a lot. It relaxed me to have a little more information about it. And I find that actors are highly underrated; they don't get all the credit they deserve, because this is a hard job. That's a hard job. CNN: Were you bitten by the acting bug? Blige: Well, I'm gonna be open to scripts, and I'm ready to receive more scripts from anywhere. I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting. I was definitely bitten by the acting bug. CNN: Did you feel any pressure to write songs for this film, as opposed to writing for one of your albums? Blige: There's not any pressure in writing songs. Writing a song for the movie versus writing songs for my album because ... you get it all from inspiration from somewhere, you know? I got all the lyrics from the actual movie, and I got all the lyrics for my songs from my life so, and other people's lives. CNN: Do you want to hear poetry in your lyrics? Blige: I would love to hear poetry in my lyrics. CNN: Tell me about Tyler Perry. Blige: Wow, working with Tyler Perry was -- it's always a treat. He's the most kind, generous, you know, supportive professional man. He's a really good person to have in such a tough business. It's like a pillow for your head. ... You just get to lay on it after laying on rocks for so long. CNN: What is the link between spirituality and music in the film and in life? Blige: Well, I think the link with the spirituality and the music is that we all have a place where we need to go to heal, and most of the time people go to music to heal. Whether it be gospel or secular, but it all comes from some song that pulled you through your life or helped you through college or something like that. CNN: Do you think this film is about redemption? Do you think people can really change? Blige: I definitely feel this film is a lot about redemption. You saving yourself first of all, and believing you can be saved and wanting the help. I think it takes time for people to heal from whatever wounds they're healing from. But in order to get free, what I learned is that you have to release it, because you'll stay stuck for the rest of your life. What if this person is enjoying their lives and you hate them? So it's just best to release. Easier said than done, please believe it. CNN: What do you think about the music industry these days? Blige: Well, I mean, the music industry has moved with the times. You know, I mean we are in the age where technology has taken over and  music is technology now, so it's not hands-on. It's a little sad that there isn't any more record stores.","Singer Mary J.

Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian speaks to reporters on December 12 in Taipei. Chen had been free on bail, but prosecutors sought his return to state custody. After 12 hours of deliberation, a panel of three district court judges approved the request at 3 a.m. Taiwan time. Chen was immediately taken to jail. The island's first former president to ever face prosecution, Chen was freed earlier in December after spending a month in jail while prosecutors prepared his indictment on several corruption charges, including embezzlement and accepting bribes. Judges ordered Chen released after the indictment was formally presented, saying they did not believe he was a flight risk. However, Taiwan's high court was not satisfied with the decision and assigned a new judge to the case. Chen's attorney, Jen Wen Long, told reporters after the court order: ""We question the work of the Taipei district court. Changing the judge is an interference with the justice system."" Chen, whose term ended in May, is accused of embezzling about $18 million. A trial date has not been set in the case. Prosecutors allege he also took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen, 58, has denied any wrongdoing and insists the charges are politically motivated. His party favors independence for Taiwan, while the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou favors closer ties with mainland China -- from which the island split amid civil war in 1949. If convicted, Chen faces 25 years or more in prison, although prosecutors did not seek any specific jail time in their indictment. Thirteen others, including Chen's wife, son, daughter-in-law and brother-in-law, also were indicted. Prosecutors have alleged that Chen's son has a Swiss bank account containing $22 million in what they believe is illegal proceeds. Journalist Andrew Lee contributed to this report.","Chen, facing trial on corruption charges, had been free on bail .

"(WIRED) -- For the past three years some of the world's most resourceful software engineers and mathematicians have worked feverishly in the spirit of friendly, Darwinian competition -- and in pursuit of a $1 million prize -- to improve the Netflix movie recommendation system by 10 percent. Netflix says it will announce the winner of its $1 million Netflix Prize at an event September 21. It's been a long journey, but it's almost over. Netflix said Tuesday it would announce the winner at an event in New York on Sept. 21 -- where details about the Netflix Prize 2 sequel would also be unveiled. As things stand now, nobody outside of Netflix knows which team will win the million-dollar prize, but the winning entry will power Netflix's upcoming movie recommendation engine. Because nothing about the contest barred entrants from licensing their technology to companies other than Netflix, both qualifying teams could find plenty of licensees -- even if they come in second. And not much separates the two top teams. Teams Bellkor (AT&T Research), Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory combined to form Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos, the first team to qualify for the prize on June 26 with a 10.05 percent improvement over Netflix's existing algorithm. This triggered a 30-day window in which other teams were allowed to try to catch up -- and indeed, a team called The Ensemble, made up of lower-ranked contestants, submitted a higher score of 10.10 percent as time ran out -- a hair better than Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos' final score of 10.09 percent. Before Sept. 21, Netflix must decide (assuming they haven't done so already) which of the two qualifying teams has the best algorithm based on how they score on various undisclosed tests. The company must also determine whether the winning team's results are reproducible, meaning that its algorithm handles new data as well as it did the test data. When we wrote about this last month, after the window for qualifying closed, Netflix declined to say whether it will reveal details about its methodology for picking the winner (whichever team loses, they're going to want to know how, exactly, that happened -- as will curious onlookers around the world). A Netflix spokeswoman told us, ""We are definitely going to touch on the methodology in the press conference,"" and offered to let us interview Netflix executives to find out more about how they picked the winner. Netflix vice president of communications Steve Swasey told us last month that the company is pleased with the results of the contest, and apparently, it hopes there's more where that came from. At the same New York event where it will announce the Netflix Prize winner, the company plans to unveil details about Netflix Prize 2. Writing on Netflix message boards, chief product officer Neil Hunt already offered some hints: ""The next contest will be a shorter, time-limited race, with grand prizes for the best results at 6 and 18 months. While the first contest has been remarkable, we think Netflix Prize 2 will be more challenging, more fun, and even more useful to the field."" More than 40,000 teams from 186 countries competed for the first Netflix Prize. Some contestants doubted that any team would be capable of surmounting the 10-percent-improvement barrier, but two teams managed to do so. Clearly, Netflix has stumbled onto a winning formula here, and will walk away from the contest with a measurably improved movie recommendation engine -- and recommendations are a linchpin of its business. As the field of ""prize economics"" evolves, offering organizations increasingly efficient ways to solve their problems, we expect results like this to become more commonplace.

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Melissa and Jackson Brandts knew right away that the photo from their recent trip to Canada was a good one. Melissa and Jackson Brandts were taking a photo of themselves when the squirrel popped up. However, it wasn't until the world -- and National Geographic -- took notice that they realized exactly how good. Now, after submitting it to the magazine's online ""Your Shot"" contest, the Minnesota couple's photo is set to grace the pages of the magazine's November issue. It's appeared on the Web sites of news outlets around the world, and the squirrel -- now dubbed ""Crasher Squirrel"" -- even has its own Wikipedia entry of the same moniker. Melissa Brandts and her husband Jackson were hiking in Banff National Park the last week in May when they decided to set up their camera and use their wireless remote shutter for a few shots of the two of them. They were getting situated on the rocky shore near Lake Minnewanka when the now-iconic critter stopped by for a visit. ""The little squirrel had been running around while we were getting the shot set up,"" Melissa Brandts said in a phone interview Tuesday. ""I was joking with my husband that I hoped he was friendly because he was getting awful close and kind of scampering around our feet and stuff."" Friendly? You might say so. It was also a bit timid and perhaps even indecisive because it soon scurried away and then, just as quickly, rushed back again. ""Photogenic"" might also be a good word to describe it. ""All of a sudden he popped back up because he heard the shutter releasing, the clicking of the camera. The only thing we can figure is that he thought it was going to give him food or something,"" Brandts said. ""He popped right up and looked right into the camera, and we were laughing so hard because we were like 'get it, get it!' and we were trying to get the remote to fire. So we got a couple of pictures -- took a couple of pictures with him there, and then he ducked down and proceeded to run away."" The resulting image exceeded all expectations. ""We didn't realize how good it was until we got back to the hotel that night and downloaded it to my husband's computer, and when we could see it on the full screen we were like, 'Whoa, are you serious?'"" ""We had no idea it was going to turn out exactly like it did with him being in perfect focus, us being out of focus, and then us just laughing in the background. We weren't sure if he'd be standing like in front of one of us or something like that."" An international phenomenon . Brandts said she and her husband showed the photo to their friends and family and were subsequently incessantly prodded to ""do something"" with it. For months the two weren't sure what that something could be. That changed, however, when the latest issue of National Geographic arrived in the mail. ""I saw the 'Your Shot' contest, which of course I knew existed, but I had never thought of entering one of my own pictures into it,"" Brandts said. ""I thought, 'This is what I'm going to do!'"" Brandts said she submitted it on August 5 and by August 13 it was NationalGeographic.com's photo of the day. ""Things just kind of spun out of control from there."" The photo was soon published in the pages of two national Canadian newspapers, and Brandts received calls from a friend in South Korea who'd seen it on a local South Korean news Web site. The couple has since appeared on NBC's ""Today"" show as well as the Twin Cities' local affiliate KARE. And now that it's been selected for publication in the November issue of National Geographic, the attention hasn't subsided. As of this writing, Brandts has received Facebook messages from random fans in 29 different countries. The Facebook group ""Nuts the Squirrel is a Legend"" comes complete with 5,300 fans and counting. The squirrel is also being used by Banff National Park in advertising on its Web site, and it has created a Banff squirrel Twitter account. There's even a Web site dubbed ""The Squirrelizer,"" which has apparently been created for people who feel their photos lack a certain ""squirrel charm."" The site's tool will paste the squirrel cutout onto any picture uploaded. Other sites have pasted the squirrel onto various scenes from history, from the D-Day invasion at Normandy to the Apollo moon landing. And it hasn't stopped there. ""It keeps popping up everywhere, like at my husband's job,"" Brandts added. ""If people are giving him a presentation, all of the sudden they'll have a squirrel pop up."" Authenticity assured . It was during their appearance on ""Today"" that host Matt Lauer raised questions about the possibility the photo could have been doctored. Brandts assured him, as she did once more for CNN, that the photo is ""completely authentic"" but said she understood the skepticism because people had originally thought the photo was taken simply with a timer -- as opposed to the remote shutter she used in actuality -- which, if it were the case, would have kept the couple in focus and blurred the squirrel. ""National Geographic looked at the full high-resolution [image, and] realized it was authentic,"" Brandts said, adding, ""You can't make this stuff up.""","Couple had set up camera to take their photo with mountains as backdrop .

"(CNN) -- Authorities investigating the case of a boy who disappeared in Kansas almost a decade ago plan to search an undisclosed residence Wednesday, the Butler County sheriff said. An age-progression photo shows what Adam Herrman would like today, as a 21-year-old man. Sheriff Craig Murphy would not disclose details about the residence or why authorities want to search it. He said his department will also search on an area of the Whitewater River, in southern Kansas, on Saturday near where Adam Herrman was last seen. Adam was 11 when he went missing in 1999. He was living in a mobile home park in Towanda, a town about 25 miles northeast of Wichita, with his adoptive parents, Doug and Valerie Herrman, authorities said. Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple believed Adam had run away and didn't report him missing. They ""really rue the fact that they didn't"" report him missing, he said Monday. A few weeks ago, an undisclosed person contacted the Wichita-Sedgwick County Exploited and Missing Child Unit, expressing concern about Adam, the sheriff said. The Herrmans told Eisenbise that Adam ran away frequently, the attorney said, and they believed he was either with his biological parents or homeless. Although the Herrmans did not report him missing, ""they were very worried about him,"" Eisenbise said. In an interview published Tuesday in The Wichita Eagle, Valerie Herrman said Adam ran away in May 1999 after she spanked him with a belt. She said she was upset but doesn't remember why, The Eagle reported. The couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking. The couple adopted his two younger siblings as well, according to The Eagle. ""We love him, and we made a terrible mistake"" by not reporting him missing, Doug Herrman told The Eagle. The couple said they searched the mobile home park and other areas for two days after Adam left. ""Then we came to the conclusion that the police probably have him, and they're coming to us, probably to get us in trouble,"" Doug Herrman told the newspaper, but the ""police never came."" Authorities have searched an empty lot in the Pine Ridge Mobile Home Park where the family lived. There, police found an ""answer"" to one of their questions, Murphy said Monday without elaborating. Eisenbise said that on December 15, authorities also searched the Herrmans' homes in Derby, outside of Wichita, and took the couple's computer, he said. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has released an age-progression picture that depicts Adam as he might appear now: a young man with blue eyes and light-colored hair. Adam had been placed in the Herrmans' care when he was about 2, Murphy said Monday. He had been named Irvin Groeninger III when he was born June 8, 1987, Murphy said, and it was not clear when his name was changed. His biological parents relinquished their rights as parents about two decades ago, and Adam and his siblings were put in foster homes, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. ""I thought what I was doing for them was in the best interest of the children, and evidently it wasn't,"" Irvin Groeninger, Adam's biological father,  told KWCH. ""If he was still in my custody, this would have never happened."" Adam's sister, Tiffany Broadfoot, 22, said she had last seen her brother about 14 years ago at a birthday party. ""He had the cutest little round face, little-bitty freckles right up here on the tip of his cheek,"" she told the station. CNN's Taylor Gandossy contributed to this report.","Sheriff says his officers will search area near Whitewater River on Saturday .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The number of stray and abandoned dogs in the United Kingdom jumped by 11 percent in the past year -- the biggest surge in a decade -- possibly because of the financial crisis, a British dog charity said Wednesday. A dog looks through the door of its kennel at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in London. Dogs Trust said local authorities picked up 107,228 stray and abandoned dogs from British streets in the past year. It called on the government to make microchipping compulsory for all dogs to help reunite owners with pets, whether lost or abandoned. ""The latest stray dog survey is very disappointing,"" said Clarissa Baldwin, chief executive of Dogs Trust. ""Even more tragically is the number of dogs that are being put down, which has gone up from 7,000 to just below 10,000, a very worrying trend."" Has recession hit your pet? Send us your thoughts . The 11 percent rise is the highest yearly increase since recordkeeping began in 1997, Dogs Trust said. The rise may be due to the financial crisis, Dogs Trust said. Some households tighten their belts by giving up the dog. Another possible reason for the jump: England and Wales last year changed the law to make local councils, not police, responsible for taking in stray dogs, Dogs Trust said. Cash-strapped councils might lack resources to pick up or temporarily shelter dogs. ""You've got a lot of latchkey dogs that are just left to wander the streets,"" said Natalie Dexter, who works at the education center at Dogs Trust. ""Their homes aren't secure, gardens aren't secure, and so they're just left to wander around."" Local authorities handle an average of 12 dogs each hour, Dogs Trust said. Only five are reunited with their owners -- a number that could increase if more dogs were microchipped, Dogs Trust said. A microchip is an electronic device, coated in plastic, that is the size of a grain of rice. It is implanted just under a dog's skin, beneath its shoulder blades, which causes no harm to the animal and cannot be felt, veterinarians and campaigners say. The microchip carries the owner's information, which can be updated. The information can be read by a scanner that works through a radio frequency.","Number of stray and abandoned dogs in UK jumps by 11 percent in past year .

"ACCRA, Ghana (CNN)  -- President Obama reached out to Africa on Saturday with a wide-ranging address praising the continent's steady achievements, but he called its persistent violent conflicts ""a millstone around Africa's neck."" President Obama speaks before Ghana's Parliament on Saturday. ""Despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled,"" Obama said in a speech to the parliament of Ghana, a western African nation seen as a model of democracy and growth for the rest of the continent. Ghana was the first sub-Saharan nation to gain independence, in 1957, and Obama continually cited the nation during his speech for its stability, political strides and painstaking economic progress. Its stability stands in contrast to other hot spots on the continent, such as Zimbabwe, where the society is in economic and political turmoil; Sudan, where fighting rages in the Darfur region; and Somalia, where a shaky transitional government is now battling an Islamic insurgency. Ghana, with a population of 24 million, was once a major slave trading center. Obama visited the Cape Coast Castle, a British outpost where slaves were held until shipped overseas, along with his daughters.  Watch Obama's remark after touring Cape Coast Castle » . ""I think it was particularly important for Malia and Sasha, who are being raised in a very blessed way, that history can take some cruel turns,"" he said. ""And hopefully, one of the things that was imparted to them during this trip is their sense of obligation to fight oppression and cruelty wherever it appears."" Obama, whose father was Kenyan, compared the history to that of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany's efforts to exterminate the Jews of Europe during World War II. ""It's one of those things that you don't forget about,"" he told CNN in an interview scheduled to air Monday on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""I think it's important that the way we think about it, the way it's taught, is not one in which there's simply a victim and a victimizer, and that's the end of the story,"" he said. ""I think the way it has to be thought about, the reason it's relevant, is whether it's what's happening in Darfur or what's happening in the Congo or what's happening in too many places around the world, the capacity for cruelty still exists.""  Watch how Ghana is celebrating the Obamas' visit » . But he told lawmakers that Ghana now shows ""a face of Africa that is too often overlooked by a world that sees only tragedy or the need for charity."" While the nation-building the country exemplifies may lack ""drama of the 20th century's liberation struggles,"" he said ""it will ultimately be more significant."" As he has in past remarks, including his Cairo address last month about U.S.-Muslim relations, Obama stressed the superiority of governments that ""respect the will of their own people,"" saying they foster more prosperity and stability than governments that don't.  Watch Obama deliver speech to Ghanaian lawmakers » . ""No business wants to invest in a place where the government skims 20 percent off the top, or the head of the Port Authority is corrupt,"" he said. ""No person wants to live in a society where the rule of law gives way to the rule of brutality and bribery. That is not democracy, that is tyranny, even if occasionally you sprinkle an election in there."" Even Kenya, his father's homeland, continues to struggle with tribalism and corruption, he said. That eastern African nation ""had a per-capita economy larger than South Korea's when I was born"" and now, he says, it has been ""badly outpaced."" But he said Kenya has restored stability after the violence that followed the disputed 2007 election. South Africa has had high voter turnout in recent elections, and Zimbabwe's Election Support Network has defended the right to vote.  Watch report on Ghanaians' reaction to Obama's remarks » . ""Make no mistake: history is on the side of these brave Africans, and not with those who use coups or change constitutions to stay in power. Africa doesn't need strongmen, it needs strong institutions,"" he said. He said his administration will work ""to support those who act responsibly and to isolate those who don't, and that is exactly what America will do."" As for the economy and opportunity, he said African nations need to stop focusing on one particular commodity, such as oil or cocoa, and ""promote multiple export industries, develop a skilled work force, and create space for small and medium-sized businesses that create jobs."" He cited ""our $3.5 billion food security initiative"" and said ""new methods and technologies for farmers -- not simply sending American producers or goods to Africa"" is what is needed.  See where Ghana is located » . Obama also made reference to climate and energy challenges, saying the developed world should work with Africa to confront such problems. He said Africa has much potential to exploit its wind and solar power and geothermal energy and biofuels. As for disease, Obama said strides are being made in dealing with HIV/AIDS and malaria, but ""too many still die from diseases that shouldn't kill them."" He also indicated that there need to be ways to keep African doctors and nurses from going overseas and creating gaps in primary care. ""When children are being killed because of a mosquito bite, and mothers are dying in childbirth, then we know that more progress must be made."" He said his administration has committed $63 billion to fight disease, praising the ""strong efforts"" of his predecessor, George W. Bush.  Watch Ed Henry's report Obama's emotional visit to Africa » . Obama welcomed efforts by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States to help resolve conflict. He said the United States ""will stand behind efforts to hold war criminals accountable"" and that the Pentagon's Africa Command will fight ""common challenges to advance the security of America, Africa and the world.""  Watch Obama's remarks as his visit to Ghana concludes » . ""We all have many identities -- of tribe and ethnicity; of religion and nationality. But defining oneself in opposition to someone who belongs to a different tribe, or who worships a different prophet, has no place in the 21st century,"" he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Mary J. Blige has sung her way to nine Grammy Awards and sold 40 million albums worldwide. ""I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting,"" Mary J. Blige said. With music credentials like that, the ""Queen of Hip-Hop Soul"" needed a new challenge. So Blige decided to stretch her range to the big screen. The singer stars in the new Tyler Perry film ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" alongside Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson, Perry and Gladys Knight. Being in the film allows Blige to test her acting chops and sing as well. Her character, Tanya, is a club owner who takes the mic at least twice in the film. And whether she's in character or not, Blige's ability to communicate a song can take your breath away. CNN spoke with Blige about Tyler Perry, her acting angst and music. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: What does the title of the film ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" mean? Mary J. Blige: Well, the title ""I Can Do Bad All By Myself"" is basically saying ""I don't need anyone to help me do worse or feel worse than what I already feel."" So if you're coming with negative energy, please keep it moving, you know? If you're coming with negative deposits, you've gotta go. That's basically what it's saying. CNN: Were you nervous about acting in this film? Blige: I was definitely nervous, because acting is not my first profession, so I had to go and get an acting coach and really figure this thing out. It helped a lot. It relaxed me to have a little more information about it. And I find that actors are highly underrated; they don't get all the credit they deserve, because this is a hard job. That's a hard job. CNN: Were you bitten by the acting bug? Blige: Well, I'm gonna be open to scripts, and I'm ready to receive more scripts from anywhere. I know I'm definitely gonna pursue this as a profession, acting. I was definitely bitten by the acting bug. CNN: Did you feel any pressure to write songs for this film, as opposed to writing for one of your albums? Blige: There's not any pressure in writing songs. Writing a song for the movie versus writing songs for my album because ... you get it all from inspiration from somewhere, you know? I got all the lyrics from the actual movie, and I got all the lyrics for my songs from my life so, and other people's lives. CNN: Do you want to hear poetry in your lyrics? Blige: I would love to hear poetry in my lyrics. CNN: Tell me about Tyler Perry. Blige: Wow, working with Tyler Perry was -- it's always a treat. He's the most kind, generous, you know, supportive professional man. He's a really good person to have in such a tough business. It's like a pillow for your head. ... You just get to lay on it after laying on rocks for so long. CNN: What is the link between spirituality and music in the film and in life? Blige: Well, I think the link with the spirituality and the music is that we all have a place where we need to go to heal, and most of the time people go to music to heal. Whether it be gospel or secular, but it all comes from some song that pulled you through your life or helped you through college or something like that. CNN: Do you think this film is about redemption? Do you think people can really change? Blige: I definitely feel this film is a lot about redemption. You saving yourself first of all, and believing you can be saved and wanting the help. I think it takes time for people to heal from whatever wounds they're healing from. But in order to get free, what I learned is that you have to release it, because you'll stay stuck for the rest of your life. What if this person is enjoying their lives and you hate them? So it's just best to release. Easier said than done, please believe it. CNN: What do you think about the music industry these days? Blige: Well, I mean, the music industry has moved with the times. You know, I mean we are in the age where technology has taken over and  music is technology now, so it's not hands-on. It's a little sad that there isn't any more record stores.","Singer Mary J.

"(CNN) -- Facing the world after an isolating and traumatic experience is often stressful, especially for those who have been away for a long time. Jaycee Dugard, here at the 1991 Rose Bowl parade, was abducted later that year. Jaycee Dugard is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years, after having been found on August 27. Dugard was 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from a bus stop in South Lake Tahoe, California. She allegedly was kept in a series of backyard sheds by a convicted sex offender and gave birth to two children in captivity. A bail review hearing is scheduled for Monday in El Dorado County Superior Court in Placerville, California, for Phillip and Nancy Garrido, who face charges related to Dugard's kidnapping. In Illinois, Shannon Wilfong is charged with child abduction, allegedly having forced 6-year-old Richard K. Wilfong Chekevdia to live in seclusion and be hidden, at times in crawl spaces and the attic, for nearly two years, according to court documents. In concealing the boy, Wilfong violated the terms of a court order that granted joint custody of the child to Michael Chekevdia, the documents said. The boy is staying with his father's family under child welfare supervision, according to CNN affiliate WSIL. The situations of Dugard and Chekevdia are extreme cases of people emerging from isolation and returning to the real world. The people who have been away often feel conflicted about leaving the situation they've acclimated to in order to rejoin the loved ones they've left behind, experts not connected to the cases tell CNN. Sometimes children involved in custody disputes are taught to hate their father or mother, and ""extreme tactics"" may be used, although usually not to the extent of hiding a child in crawl spaces, said Jay Lebow, psychologist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University. ""While this case is obviously the rarest of things, other children are certainly exposed to many traumas that have meaning connected to this,"" Lebow said. The case of Dugard . Dugard is spending time in ""a secluded place, reconnecting"" with her mother and younger sister, said her aunt, Tina Dugard, in a statement on behalf of her family. ""This is a joyful time for my family,"" she said. ""Jaycee remembers all of us.""  Watch for more on Dugard » . But a person in Dugard's situation would most likely have both positive and negative feelings about leaving the only environment she's known for 18 years and coming back to her family, psychologists say. ""She's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she's spent almost two decades with a different family,"" said Margo Napoletano, a child and family psychologist in San Diego, California. After allegedly being confined for 18 years, Dugard probably would find the outside world frightening, Lebow said. ""You get to know this world you live in -- it may be a terrible world, but it's the world you know,"" he said. Experts say Dugard may have developed what is known as Stockholm syndrome, in which kidnapping victims identify with their captors. Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family.  Learn about other cases of missing children » . ""It's a concept that explains why a kidnapped victim would stay with a perpetrator even though they had an opportunity to leave,"" she said. ""They opt to stay because it's their comfort zone."" But Johanna Tabin, a psychologist in Glencoe, Illinois, said Dugard's readjustment will depend on how she was treated in captivity. Police said Phillip Garrido, one of her alleged abductors, is believed to be the father of her two daughters, and his relationship to Dugard -- whether he framed their alleged sexual encounters as violent or seductive -- will influence her feelings about leaving that situation, Tabin said. It is also important to know how Dugard felt about her family before she was taken away, Tabin said. ""Did she secretly mourn them?"" Tabin asked. ""Did she feel she stepped on a different planet where she was all of a sudden a grown-up 11-year-old and wasn't being treated anymore like a child?"" Her family members may have constantly wondered what they could have done differently to prevent the kidnapping, Tabin said. At the same time, someone in Dugard's situation may have asked herself at the outset, ""Why did they let me get kidnapped?"" Lebow said. There is an infinite range of responses, but more information about Dugard's feelings growing up and in captivity would inform how she adjusts to her new life, Tabin said. The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said. ""It's basically like a wild child who may have had some contact with civilization, but basically is having to start life all over again, and that may be overwhelming to them at first,"" she said. Napoletano said she would suggest to a family like Dugard's to be accepting and supportive, and not ask a lot of questions. ""Go about your daily life as usual for the most part, and take the lead from the therapist, one small step at a time,"" she said. Lebow advises them against looking for some sudden moment of reconnection, but rather to be loving and patient. Coming back from combat . Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a ""hellacious war,"" Lebow said. A recent survey of military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children found that the return from deployment is the most stressful, according to three-quarters of respondents. Reunification brings excitement and relief, which is sometimes accompanied by emotional conflict, the surveyors said. Read more about the study . In the military, bonds of brotherhood form as people face dangers together, Tabin said. When service members come home, they may find life ""shallower,"" and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said. In a case where a husband has been away at war and returns to his wife, the desire to understand one another's feelings is fundamental, she said. ""She wants to be understanding, he wants to be able to shove it aside, then he has nightmares, and she says, 'you're not setting it aside,' "" Tabin said. ""Well, consciously he is -- he's not awake when he dreams."" Don't force the person who has been away to talk about their experiences, Napoletano said. She also stressed that a family should try to normalize the life of the service member who has returned from war. Waking up in the morning, going grocery shopping, washing clothes and doing other day-to-day activities help create a stable, comforting environment, she said.","Jaycee Dugard, found August 27, is reuniting with her family after 18 years .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- He is iconic, there's no doubt. George Hamilton gets his life story on screen in ""My One and Only."" With the elegant suit and tie, the impeccable grooming, the tan (Did I mention the tan?), George Hamilton is still a charmer, and he comes across like a born bon vivant. Sure, his acting may have taken a backseat to his bronzed visage years ago, but what did happen to him years ago? Well, there's a story there, one now coming to the big screen. Hamilton's formative years are loosely depicted in the film ""My One and Only,"" opening in wide release September 4. ""My One and Only"" has the style of a film produced during Hollywood's golden age, but the tale is easily relatable to today. In the film, Hamilton's mother, Anne, played by Academy Award winner Renee Zellweger, walks in on her bandleader husband and another woman. She hits the road in a brand new Cadillac Coupe de Ville with her two sons, George and Robbie, en route to find a new husband and a new life.  Watch a preview of 'My One and Only' » . Hamilton, 70, spoke with CNN about the film, old Hollywood and his mother. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: There is a lot of heartache in this story. Why did you want to share it? George Hamilton: I don't know that I really did want to share it. It's a fictional story based on a real story loosely about me. And I went to the movie to hate it. And I looked at the movie and I thought, my God, [Zellweger] looks nothing like my mother, but she was able to portray the emotions just the way it was then. I couldn't speak. I was completely overwhelmed by what Renee did. That's a great actress. CNN: Do you think that your mother shaped your life more than your father? Hamilton: I think they're kind of like sand and a rock, kind of -- you keep rubbing up against them and they form you. I knew that I was the man of the family from the time I was 10, 12 -- you know, I had to be. But I knew I had to get away from it. So I signed onto military school. Then my mother said, if you're bad I'm sending you to your father, and I said, send me. I ... lived a whole year with my father -- I got to know him, I got to understand the two sides to the story. My mother didn't say bad things about him. I presumed that he was this foreign person who left and abandoned us. He didn't at all. And when I made it in Hollywood and I didn't want to be an actor, there they arrived. It was their triumph, not mine. I wanted to be a doctor. CNN: Now in hindsight, do you understand what your mom was doing? Hamilton: That's a very good question. No, I didn't, I didn't get her. What I knew was I would work -- I was ... with people who had millions of dollars, and they just accepted me, and I would go out and buy a tuxedo in the thrift shop, and go to the coming-out party of a very wealthy socialite, and they would say oh, now chic. You wore your grandfather's or your father's tuxedo. And I had bought it for $5. And I realized there was a whole reverse way of acting, and people just presumed you were old money, and I played that. That was my game. But when I looked at my mother I realized that she was born almost like a child, with the theory that we would be divinely supported. Always trust that, don't be afraid. Poverty, or [being] poor, is a mentality, it's like fog, it's all around you. My mother was broke, but that's just a temporary deal -- that's a bad hand in the poker game, if you're gonna sit through two more you can win. And that's how I looked at it. CNN: What was old Hollywood like? Hamilton: Well, it was mythological. It was a place [that] the first day, I saw Robert Mitchum sitting at a table and he looked at me and said, ""I know they say I don't know my lines. It's not true. I'm just too drunk to say them."" And I thought, oh, that's an interesting man. Next Fred Astaire walks by, ""Hello,"" and I stopped: ""Hello, Mr. Astaire"" -- God I love that guy -- and I see Cary Grant sitting down. And he said, ""You've got a nice suntan. Do you like the sun?"" I said ""Well, yeah, I love the sun."" ... He was so incredible. And I saw Gary Cooper, Ty Power, Clark Gable, and then they disappeared. You talk about ""Gone With the Wind,"" Hollywood disappeared! And I had envisioned this because I was the last of the contract players, and I wanted to be like them, but they were gone! And all the sudden I'm seeing Marlon Brandos, and Monty Clifts, and then a whole generation of soft young men, the Beat Generation or whatever. I couldn't relate to them then. Because I had related to what my mother and brother had seen years before. And that's all I ever wanted to be. CNN: There can never be another old Hollywood. Hamilton: No, but there can be older people in Hollywood, and that's where I am now. Just before death they turn you into an icon. And the other day I got a star on Hollywood Boulevard and I thought, God this is pretty good, and then it scared me because I thought, they give these things to you before it's all over. CNN: And did you learn to love acting? Hamilton: Acting has always been something for me that's been a romp. I just show up and I have a good time, and I hope that I get through the day and I can have lunch in the sun. I used to take the script and if it was heavy I'd give it to George Peppard and if it was nice and light, if it was a western, a few words, I'd take it. That's the way I looked at it. I wasn't a great actor, it wasn't my style. I just loved being an actor.","George Hamilton's formative years subject of ""My One and Only""

"(CNN) -- The space shuttle Discovery was waved off from its first chance to land Friday afternoon because of unstable weather near Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA said. The space shuttle's landing in Florida was delayed Thursday, shown. A first attempt Friday was called off, too. The shuttle will make another orbit of Earth, while NASA mission managers watch to see if extreme moisture and lightning threaten a safe landing. The next opportunity to land in Florida would come at 7:23 p.m. ET; however, Mission Control told the shuttle crew the forecast for that time ""looks about the same."" Crews have been activated at Edwards Air Force Base in California's Mojave Desert in case NASA decides to land the shuttle there, where the weather is not considered an issue. There are two chances to land Friday evening in California. The space agency, however, usually exhausts all landing windows in Florida before sending the spacecraft to California. A landing on the West Coast adds a week to the turnaround time before the shuttle can be ready for another mission and it costs several million dollars. The landing could be delayed until Saturday when there are two more chances to land in Florida or California. Discovery initially was scheduled to return to Earth on Thursday, but poor weather in central Florida also forced a delay. The seven astronauts are wrapping up a 13-day mission to the international space station, where the crew made repairs and delivered supplies. The crew executed three spacewalks and dropped off a Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill, or Colbert treadmill. It was named after comedian Stephen Colbert. Weather and technical problems delayed Discovery's launch three times before blastoff.","Landing attempt for space shuttle called off because of bad weather .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN) -- Juan Almeida, a Cuban revolutionary who fought alongside former Communist leader Fidel Castro, died of a heart attack Friday evening, according to state media. Almeida, left, sits with President Raul Castro on January 1, the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. Almeida, 82, was among only a handful of surviving Cuban leaders who still bore the title ""Commander of the Revolution."" A vice president and member of the Communist government Central Committee, Almeida was among only a few black leaders in top government posts. He died of cardiac arrest late Friday evening, according Juventud Rebelde, Cuba's state-run youth newspaper. Widely admired among Cuban nationals, Almeida fought with Fidel and Raul Castro at the start of their campesino-led revolution, participating in the failed attacks on the Moncada army barracks in 1953 and later aboard the famed yacht, ""Granma,"" that carried the small group of Cuban rebels who would later topple U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. Almeida's death highlights the mortality of an aging cast of Cuba's revolutionary leaders. Widespread speculation surrounding the health of Fidel Castro grew in 2006 after the former Communist leader underwent abdominal surgery and later ceded the presidency to his younger brother, Raul. The elder Castro has recently appeared in a series of photos and video looking healthier, though he has not appeared in public since 2006. Cuban state media reported that Sunday will be a day of national mourning and that flags will be flown at half-staff.","Cuban revolutionary Juan Almeida died of a heart attack Friday evening .

"Below is an excerpt from HLN ""Morning Express"" anchor Robin Meade's new book, Morning Sunshine!: How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too published by Hachette Book Group.  The following  takes place when Robin was working as a weekend anchor in Chicago, Illinois. Robin Meade's book ""Morning Sunshine!: How to Radiate Confidence and Feel It Too"" hits shelves September 10. I looked down at the copy of the news story. My stomach clenched. My heart started palpitating. I think I held my breath without realizing it. The floor director gave me the cue, pointing at me as the camera came up on my face. I felt sweaty. Just as I opened my mouth to speak, the set seemed to fade into a gauzy haze. My breathing was jagged. The words came, but my voice was quivering so much it sounded like a kid singing into a big box fan on a humid summer day: ""Bray-ay-ay-ay-king new-ew-ew-ews tonigh-igh-ight."" My hands shook uncontrollably, and I was huffing and puffing as if I were running mile twenty five of the Chicago Marathon. These were not the controlled, measured tones of someone who had been doing this for a living for years. My heart pounded in my ears, and my face flushed. I was losing it, right there with who knows how many thousands of people watching. What the hell is happening? As I delivered the facts of the story, I didn't hear a thing that came out of my mouth. All I heard were my own thoughts. Oh, no, you're screwing up! Oh, no, your bosses are probably watching! You're going to get fired! How will you pay your mortgage? What will people think of you? And then, of course, Holy crapola, where is that sound bite? Can you see how the cause-and-effect relationship of my thoughts just engulfed me in doom and gloom? I couldn't keep my mind on the story. I totally slipped into imagining the future and the horrible repercussions of my screwup.  CNN's Virginia Cha talks to Robin about her on-air anxiety and her upcoming book » . Because I'm writing this today, you can tell that somehow I lived to see the sound bite that evening. The whole looking-like-I-was-hopped-up-on-six-energy-drinks episode lasted only seconds. But it seemed like an eternity. Now Josh, the I'm-going-to-be-a-reporter-someday crew member, and Michael, the I-really-want-to-be-a-rock-star prompter operator, were around me, wearing the same expression you'd have after witnessing a car wreck. ""Robin, are you okay? Do you need a glass of water?"" Josh's eyes were wide open, as if he really wanted to shout, ""Dude!"" He didn't know what to make of this. ""Yeah, please,"" I croaked. My mouth was cotton. I wished I had a trough to douse my head in instead of a tiny Dixie cup of water. ""Everything okay out there?"" the producer chimed in on my IFB, the earpiece through which the producer and director talk to anchors during the show without the folks at home hearing it. What to say, what to say? ""Oh, sorry about that. Wow, that was weird! I lost my breath or something."" I faked a half-laugh at the end of that statement for their benefit. When Josh handed me the glass of water, I was surprised to see my hands were still trembling. I noticed how incredibly weak I felt, and I noisily gulped down the water the way my dog does at his water bowl after he's been chasing squirrels for an hour. Get it together, Robin! Miraculously, by the time we came out of the video and I had to speak again, it was as if nothing had happened. Except for feeling wiped out, I was back to sounding authoritative and in control, even tilting my head and smirking sheepishly as if to say, You'll forgive me for that little freak-out I just had. The truth was, I was morbidly embarrassed -- the kind of embarrassed where you'd rather crawl under a rock than face people. It wasn't the kind of embarrassment you can laugh off, as I could so easily when I was in high school show choir. As the student body filed in for the Christmas assembly, I started jumping rope with a holiday garland. I was standing out on the gymnasium floor, and with each leap over the garland I felt a swish! After a few times, I realized the garland was catching my knee-length choir dress in the back and flicking the skirt hem waist-high, exposing my bum for the entire eighth grade seated behind me. And laugh I did! Wouldn't you know it? The school photographer caught the moment: there I am in the 1987 yearbook laughing with my mouth wide open, my eyes as big as saucers, and my hands behind me, having just pushed my skirt back down. I have no problem laughing at myself in situations like that. My point in telling you this embarrassing story is that you can see I don't have trouble laughing off most situations. But my job? That was another matter. No, I was not going to be able to shrug off the ""breathing problem,"" as I had called it, trying to minimize its impact, even though it had completely bamboozled me on the air. It was all I thought about after the show, driving down the darkened streets of Chicago's Streeterville to our condo, still gripped with humiliation. I felt as though every tourist lugging her shopping bags from the Magnificent Mile back to her hotel, every vagrant panhandling for handouts, and every pedestrian who called the city home knew I had just made a complete fool of myself. My brain should have been full of concussions, I was beating myself up so much. How badly was I cursing myself? I didn't care to stop for my usual Cheesecake Factory late-night treat, let's put it that way. My stomach was still in knots. I didn't turn my eyes to gawk at the car pumping the thump-thitty-thump-thump bass at the stoplight, and I barely noticed anything around me on the drive home. I couldn't even feign a smile for the friendly doorman as I entered our high-rise building. The ride to the thirty-seventh floor seemed to take forever. Every time the elevator halted and the door opened I held my breath, afraid the person joining me on the ride had seen the screwup and would ply me with questions. Tim met me at the door. He had seen the ""breathing problem"" on TV for himself. I learned later it bolted him upright from his viewing perch on the couch. ""Did you watch me?"" I asked, hoping he'd say, ""Oh, I sensed a little glitch on your part."" Instead he just nodded, and I saw the worried look on his face. He didn't say much. He was waiting for me to go first. I hesitated. Finally, in the kind of voice you'd use to soothe a colicky baby, he asked, ""Honey, what happened? Are you okay?"" I didn't know the answer.

"(CNN) -- Six men, including a police officer, are facing homicide charges in last week's killing of French filmmaker and photographer Christian Poveda in El Salvador, the attorney general's office said. Filmmaker Christian Poveda poses for a picture at a workshop in Mexico on August 29. The suspect accused of ordering the slaying, Nelson Lazo Rivera, was already in prison, according to a statement Wednesday from the agency. Officials gave no motive for the slaying and did not say why Lazo Rivera is incarcerated. El Diario de Hoy newspaper said he is in prison for several murders, including three slayings in 2003 known as the massacre of Samcap. Poveda, 53, had recently finished a documentary about a violent street gang, part of the Mara 18 criminal group in El Salvador. He was found shot to death September 2 in the town of Tonacatepeque, about 10 miles northeast of the capital, San Salvador, authorities said. Four of the suspects are members of the same Mara 18 gang that was the subject of Poveda's film, the attorney general's office said. Authorities identified them as Calixto Rigoberto Escobar (known as Toro), Jose Alejandro Melara (El Puma), Roberto Luis Romero (Tiger), and Miguel Angel Rosa (El Cholo). National Civil Police Officer Juan Napoleon Espinoza also was arrested, the attorney general's office said. Officials did not say what his involvement in the crime may have been. But El Mundo, Diario Co Latino, El Faro and El Diario de Hoy newspapers said authorities believe the officer told gang members Poveda was giving information on the group to police. According to El Diario de Hoy, police deputy director Mauricio Ramirez Landaverde said Espinoza was a Mara 18 member, who would drink with other members in his free time and also was involved in giving them weapons, ammunition and information. Authorities said the suspects will be charged with aggravated homicide, proposition and conspiracy in the homicide and illicit associations. Poveda's documentary, ""La Vida Loca,"" follows the lives of members of the Mara 18 gang. The documentary has been screened at a handful of film festivals and is slated for wider release later this month. His body was found in an area controlled by that same gang, officials said. The suspects had set up a meeting with Poveda on August 30, at which time they were supposed to kill him and bury his body, El Mundo and El Diario de Hoy reported. But Poveda did not show, heightening gang members' suspicions that he was an informant. He met with the suspects three days later and was shot by Romero, El Mundo said, but in their haste to get away the gang members forgot to bury his body. A funeral for Poveda was held Wednesday in San Salvador before his body was shipped to France. A photograph of a younger Poveda, with shoulder-length hair, and a 35 mm digital camera were placed on the altar, next to a communion chalice. ""This is a painful and brutal act. Unacceptable,"" said Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary bishop of San Salvador. ""God moved Christian with his work, awoke noble ideals. He tried to film with his camera in order to open the eyes of those whose eyes needed opening.""","French filmmaker Christian Poveda was shot to death in El Salvador last week .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Some $700 million in economic stimulus money intended to upgrade baggage screening systems at airports will go further than originally expected, Department of Homeland Security officials said Wednesday. The new systems can process up to 500 bags an hour, compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour on the older machines, the TSA said. The DHS said the money will now upgrade systems at 10 additional airports. Earlier this year the DHS announced funding for baggage screening at airports in 15 cities. The money will be used to speed up construction of in-line baggage screening systems, which take advantage of the airline's existing conveyor belt systems to check bags, eliminating the need for minivan-size bomb detection systems now found in many airport lobbies. Government auditors have long complained about existing systems, which the Transportation Security Administration rushed into place to meet congressional deadlines after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. At airports with in-line systems, airline workers at the ticketing counters place the bags on conveyor belts, which pass through explosive detectors on their way to the aircraft. That is more efficient than stand-alone systems, which the TSA employees must staff. In addition, in-line systems can process up to 500 bags an hour, compared to the 150 to 160 bags per hour processed by stand-alone machines, the TSA said. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement that DHS was able to ""stretch our resources"" by managing the recovery money and by negotiating with airports. In addition to the $700 million intended for checked baggage systems, $300 million is being allocated for checkpoint technology, such as new X-ray machines, ""whole body imaging"" technology and bottled liquid scanners. The new airports expected to get stimulus money for in-line explosive detection systems are: . • Washington Dulles International Airport (Chantilly, Virginia) • Lambert-St. Louis International Airport (St. Louis, Missouri) • Yellowstone Regional Airport (Cody, Wyoming) • William P. Hobby Airport (Houston, Texas) • St. Petersburg/Clearwater International Airport (St. Petersburg, Florida) • Gallatin Field Airport (Bozeman, Montana) • Little Rock National Airport (Little Rock, Arkansas) • Tulsa International Airport (Tulsa, Oklahoma) • Charlotte Douglas International Airport (Charlotte, North Carolina) • Colorado Springs Airport (Colorado Springs, Colorado) Earlier this year, DHS announced funding for airports in the following cities: Atlanta, Georgia; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Honolulu, Hawaii; Huntsville, Alabama; Jackson, Wyoming; Maui, Hawaii; New Orleans, Louisiana; Orange County, California; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, Maine; and Sacramento, San Francisco and San Jose, California.
