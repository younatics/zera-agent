"After stunning the locals with a giant Tasmanian Tiger  maze last year, a farmer has taken to the fields again to create a shape of a poppy on the sorghum crop. More than 2000 visitors explored and unravelled the mystery of the five hectare plantation of the thylacine maze in a Hagley farm paddock in Northern Tasmania. Back by popular demand, owners of the Rupertswood Farm  Anna and Rowan Clark wanted something special for everyone to commemorate ahead of ANZAC Day this year. Back by popular demand, owners Rowan and Anna Clark have created a poppy-shaped maze for ANZAC Day . 'The last service inspired me to do something that would mark a big year for Gallipoli and to reflect on all the people who fought in the First World War,' Mrs Clarke told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This is our second year for the maze so we thought it would be a good fit. 'We had a lot of positive response last year and because the Tassie tiger has been extinct for a very long time, we wanted to add that Tasmanian seam and put a good tune to it.' Using the latest GPS technology and a ride-on mower to design the giant poppy, Mrs Clarke said it took her husband seven hours to outline the design through the crop. 'Once the design is done, my husband goes back and forth with the mower and we trim it every week because it grows really quickly. We try to keep it at a length so you don't see each other over the crops.' With the help from UK crop maze designer Mazescapes, the field of sorghum is carved through using a special intricate pattern on the GPS. The  couple started the Tasmanian maze last year and received a significant amount of positive feedback . For a second year in a row, Rowan and Anna Clark wanted to create something special to reflect on WW1 . Mr Clarke driving the mower around the crops to carve the shape of the poppy-shaped maze . Adding a touch of games to bring the maze to life, Mrs Clarke said it’s an entertaining event for the whole family as well as attracting everyone who are living outside of Tasmania. ‘We are trying it out as an agricultural tourism opportunity and we have a great location so it generates people to come to Tassie. ‘We haven’t done anything like this before but last year, it was so much fun and we loved it – it went down really well. We’re pretty excited about our next maze and we've had a lot of interests.’ The idea came to light one morning around the kitchen table after her husband 'accidentally' cropped on their family's farm paddock. Adding a touch of games to bring the maze to life, Mrs Clarke said it’s an entertaining event for the family . Mr Clarke uses the latest GPS technology and a ride-on mower to design the giant poppy . The Poppy Crop Maze will be open on weekends from February 21 and booking available for groups/schools . 'We just happened to have an English girl stay with us at the time and she told us how she used to spend her childhood visiting crop mazes with her family when they go away on holidays,' Mrs Clarke said. ‘So we started doing some research and we found how popular the mazes are in Europe and America so we thought we should give it a go.' With the opening expected to go public next month, Mrs Clarke said there is still a lot of work to do. ‘It’s still a work in progress and we have a few ideas up our sleeves but we can't reveal it just yet,' she said. ‘Last year, our visitors had to find  tiger footprints inside the maze and unlock the codes and unscramble jumbled words – it was an educational aspect but entertaining for the whole family. ‘It was something that people didn’t expect but we've had a lot of people asking us to do it again.' The Poppy Crop Maze will be open on weekends from February 21. Mr Clarke is seen preparing some tractor work around the crops to carve the shape of the Tassie tiger .

"Dappy appeared before a judge at St Albans Crown Court after breaching his probation order . A judge has ordered N-Dubz rapper Dappy to behave but said he will not go back to jail - despite breaching his sentence for punching a nightclubber. The 27-year-old, whose real name is Costadinos Contostavlos, arrived at St Albans Crown Court after he reportedly missed a probation appointment and showed up late for a 'self-control' workshop. He was serving a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty in September of assaulting a football coach on the dancefloor of Evissa nightclub in Reading, Berkshire. Dappy was also subject to a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation. The attack happened after the rapper began chatting to a man's girlfriend and female friend and got into a brawl with coach Devonn Reid, leaving him with a bleeding nose. Mr Reid was out celebrating his 21st birthday at the club when he asked the rapper to stop talking to the women. Dappy denied the attack, claiming he had felt threatened by a 'group of six or seven big boys' at the bar and said he'd been pulled away by a bouncer before a punch was thrown. He was also serving another suspended sentence at the time for spitting in the face of two teenage girls at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey, in February 2012, while on a night out. The former Celebrity Big Brother star and cousin of singer Tulisa Contostavlos, was also fined £800 last year for slapping a man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex. Arriving at court on Wednesday, the rapper carried a packed black bag in preparation for a custodial sentence. Wearing a white shirt done up to the collar with no tie and black pullover, he stood in the dock to admit two charges of breaching the conditions of his probation that was imposed as part of a suspended sentence at Guilford crown court on November 6 last year. The court heard that on December 2, he failed to attend an appointment with a probation officer and on December 17 he arrived late for a 'Thinking Skills Programme' group workshop, which aimed to get him to improve his self-control and curb negative behaviour. At the start the hearing Helen Flavell, for Hertfordshire probation service, told Judge John Plumstead: 'There were two breaches of the order. He appears to have prioritised other things over his attendance on the programme.' Dappy leaving court after he assaulted a man in a nightclub in Reading (left) and Judge John Plumstead (right) who told the rap star to 'shape up and behave' She said that there had also been 10 breaches of his curfew 10pm to 6am when he had arrived home late, which amounted to two hours and 15 minutes. Jon Harrison, defending, said Dappy had 'outstanding commitments' to HMRC and his mortgage provider, but had recently received a 'block of money' to reduce what he owes. He said the December 17 offence was caused by lateness and was not a 'flagrant breach'. He said he had not caused the group session to be stopped. Judge Plumstead said: 'He will have to shape up and behave. Probation officers are not just there waiting to see him. They have a full diary and public money is being wasted. If he breaches the conditions again he will be locked up. It is in his hands.' The singer put his hands together in prayer as the judge told him: 'What you did is a form of rudeness. Probation officers work extremely hard. 'They are over-stretched, under-funded and short in numbers. If they make time for you it is important for you to turn up. I hope you have learned your lesson and will co-operate.' The rapper was fined £800 last year for slapping a man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex (CCTV, pictured) Dappy, of North Mymms, Hertfordshire, admitted breaching his probation order and was fined £1,000 - £500 for each offence. He was also ordered to pay £200 prosecution costs, which he has three months to pay. The court heard he must stand before a judge in three months time for a review. As he left the eight-minute long hearing and told friends: 'Let's get out of here'. 'I have got to take it seriously,' he told reporters outside court. 'When I missed the appointment my phone had smashed and and I did not see a text. So unfortunately I did not know I had to go that day. It was a silly mistake and the second time I was late.' He said he had got his tax problems sorted out and had an album coming out in February. At the original hearing for the 2013 nightclub assault, his defence lawyer told the court the rapper was struggling financially, having put his house up for sale to pay large tax debts he had run up. Jon Harrison added Dappy had 'underlying issues' and wanted to 'address the root cause of his bad reactions to other people'. The singer has been seeing a psychiatrist, the court heard, who said the death of Dappy's father had had a big impact on him. In December 2008, Dappy pleaded guilty to two accounts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex, after spitting in a girl's face while drunk on a night out.  He was given a suspended sentence for 12 months, 100 hours community service, £50 compensation to the girl and her friend and £300 costs. In January 2009 he was arrested and bailed after he was accused of making death threats with a gun, but denied the allegation. Three days later he was removed from an Edinburgh to London flight by police after appearing to be acting disorderly. A year later, Dappy appeared on The Chris Moyles Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 1 with N-Dubz bandmates Fazer and Tulisa. A woman in Boston, Lincolnshire, sent a text to the show complaining Dappy was 'vile' and 'a little boy with a silly hat'. He secretly copied her phone number and the following day sent threatening messages. His management apologised and offered her free concert tickets but the band was subsequently dropped from the Government's anti-bullying 'R U Cyber Safe?' campaign. In April 2010 CCTV pictures surfaced of Dappy taking the illegal drug Mephedrone in a nightclub and he appeared on GMTV to apologise. Shortly after the incident he was asked to leave Alton Towers theme park hotel in Staffordshire for allegedly smoking cannabis. In October 2011, Dappy was arrested on suspicion of assaulting the mother of his two children, Kaye Vassell, and was later released without charge. Four months later in February 2012 he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of affray, along with another man, after he was alleged to have spat at two women at a petrol station in Guildford, Surrey. He had been celebrating the release of his single Rockstar at the Casino nightclub and was on the way to the recording studios in Godalming when they stopped at a Shell garage where a brawl broke out and was found guilty of affray one assault offence in January 2013. He was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months. In February 2014 he was convicted of common assault and fined £800 after he hit at man at a nightclub in Chelmsford, Essex. The incident, which was captured on CCTV, erupted at Chicago Rock Cafe after clubber George Chittock called him 'a mug'. On 6 October 2013, Dappy hit a man on his nose at a nightclub in Reading, Berkshire and was convicted of assault at Reading Magistrates' Court. A judge handed him a two-month jail term, suspended for 12 months, a four-month curfew with an electronic tag keeping him at home between the hours of 10pm and 5am and ordered him to pay a fine and compensation. His most recent appearance at court on Wednesday was for breaching his suspended sentence after he reportedly failed to turn up to a probation appointment and arrived late for a workshop aimed at improving his self-control. He admitted the breach and was fined £1,000.","Dappy was ordered before a court after he missed a probation appointment .

"The heart-warming moment the world's most courageous Cowardly Lion got down on one knee was captured on film by bride-to-be Pamela's daughter. Louise Cobby began filming the stage after her mother was asked to go up from the crowd - but neither woman had any idea that Pamela's boyfriend Dave, from Hailsham, West Sussex, was going to propose. 'What a complete fluke catching this on camera,' Louise said. 'I got my camera out for the jokes and to laugh back as mum got pulled up on stage but did not expect this to happen.' Scroll down for video . Louise Cobby captured the moment her mum Pamela was asked to go onstage at a panto, and her boyfriend Dave - dressed as the Cowardly Lion - surprised her with a proposal . Speaking today, 46-year-old Dave, who works as a care unit manager, revealed he had no idea he was going to propose to Pamela until the day before . Louise added in a personal tribute to her step-father to be: 'I'm so happy for you both I keep wanting to cry. 'Such a surprise - thank you Dave for making my mum smile and for making her so happy. It's all I've wanted for so long.' Dave met and fell in love with Pamela, 43, a mental health nurse, at work. In the video taken by Pamela, Dave's fellow cast-members are seen smiling and cheering as he pops the question to his love. Speaking today, the delighted 46-year-old, who works as a care unit manager, revealed he had no idea he was going to propose to Pamela until the day before. Dave admitted that once he got his girlfriend on stage (pictured), he forgot the big speech he had prepared an just improvised instead . But when he got her on stage, true to his character, Dave got too nervous and forgot the big speech he had prepared. 'I couldn't have been playing a better character really,' he said of proposing while in Cowardly Lion costume. 'I've wanted to propose for a while, and I think Pam knew it was coming too, but she had no idea I was going to do it on stage. My bottle went and I couldn't remember the speech I'd written, so I just blurted it out.' 'I blushed when she said ""yes,"" but you couldn't tell because I was in my costume' 'I'm so over the moon with it all, and absolutely delighted,' Pamela said of her husband-to-be. 'I'll definitely never forget how courageous my Cowardly Lion is' He added: 'I blushed when she said ""yes,"" but you couldn't tell because I was in my costume.' Luckily for Dave, Pamela is a lifelong fan of panto. 'I thought it was a joke at first, I had to ask him if it was real,' she said. 'It was such a surprise - I'm so over the moon with it all, and absolutely delighted. I'll definitely never forget how courageous my Cowardly Lion is.'","Louise Cobby captured on film the moment her future step-dad Dave proposed to her mum Pamela in the middle of a panto performance .

"Online shoppers have hit out after it emerged British users of Amazon Prime pay up to £60 more a year for the service compared to those in other European countries. Customers using the website are encouraged to take a 30-day trial of the service - which entitles them to free one-day delivery and free movies and ebooks - before they pay £79-a-year to continue. But subscription service costs just £7.50-a-year in Italy, £11-a-year in Spain, £36 in Germany and France and £41 in Canada. In the US, the service costs £65 annually. Amazon's Prime service - which offers three delivery and other benefits - is much cheaper in other countries . Amazon has defended itself, saying that not all customers are offered the same premium services as UK subscribers. For example, customers in Spain and Italy, where the service is cheapest, are only offered free delivery within 2-3 working days. In France subscribers get free one-day shipping and the ability to store photos in the Amazon cloud, and in Germany customers get photo storage, movie streaming, free one day delivery, and the ability to borrow Kindle books. But it will still come as bad news for UK customers looking to save on their monthly subscription, as the cheaper reduced services are not available in this country. The disparity between countries emerged on the day the company announced quarterly profits of £393million . The disparity - which came to light on the same day the firm announced fourth quarter profits of £393million - has angered shoppers. Marc Gander, of Consumer Action Group, told MailOnline: 'This is not the first time British consumers have faced higher prices than those elsewhere. 1. Britain - £79-a-year . Unlimited One-Day Delivery on millions of items, unlimited digital photo storage, unlimited streaming of more than 15,000 movies and TV episodes, and 650,000 Kindle titles to borrow for free. 2.

Free Shipping with guaranteed delivery within 2-3 working days . 'I don't know if companies think that because we've got a bit of an economic recovery going they want some of it too, but I still think British consumers are feeling the pinch. 'These companies seem to pay very little tax in the UK, whilst plundering the pockets of British people.' The number of people using the Amazon Prime service rose by more than 50% last year, with three million Britons now signed up. The premium service offers unlimited free one-day delivery on more than seven million items and access to 500,000 Kindle books to borrow. Last year, the cost of Prime jumped by £30 a year when the internet giant added its video streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, to the package. Amazon's UK subsidiary paid just £2.4million in corporate taxes in the year up to April 2013, despite making sales of £4.3billion. It emerged earlier this month that the firm could be forced to hand over billions in unpaid taxes after the deal it struck with Luxembourg in 2003 was deemed illegal. Defending the price disparity between countries, a spokesman for Amazon said: 'Amazon Prime is a unique service, and whilst different countries are subject to different operating costs, it represents great value for our customers in every country in which it’s available.' The Italian service only offers two to three day delivery and fewer advantages and the French service also does not offer free movies.","Free delivery and movies service costs £79-a-year in the UK .

"As massive pipes snake through chambers filled with abandoned machinery, it could almost be the set of Ridley Scott's horror classic Alien. But this is, in fact, The National Gas Turbine Establishment, known simply as Pyestock - once an iconic site of British engineering. Since its closure in 2000, it has fallen into a state of neglect and is now scheduled for demolition. In its place will stand a vast retail distribution depot. Pyestock, in Fleet, Hampshire, was opened after the Second World War and for more than 50 years was at the forefront of gas turbine and jet engine research, development and testing.

In the once state-of-the art site is Cell 4, the largest engine test cell of its kind in the world, which was used to test Concorde's engines at a staggering 2,000mph and at an atmospheric pressure of 60,000ft. The Royal Navy used gas turbine engines that were all tested at Pyestock, and during the Cold War captured Soviet engines were scrutinised.

Mr Emmett has visited the site ten times, spending over 75 hours capturing the incredible abandoned site. He said: 'Standing in these empty and broken places rouses strong emotional responses for me. It sounds very clichéd but the past becomes a very tangible thing when surrounded by the ruins of an old industrial plant or a school classroom that hasn't seen a taught lesson in years.' 'With just a small amount of imagination, you can hear the roar of the turbine hall or picture the rows of eager hands hoping to catch the teacher's attention.' 'In taking pictures in locations such as these, I want to try to capture those emotions within the frame - it's a very retrospective and indulgent use for photography but one I enjoy immensely.' After its closure in 2000, the facility was left in almost the same condition as it was when operational - huge pieces of industrial equipment and even full jet engines remain gathering dust, rusting into history.

Many of the site's original fixtures such as dials, knobs, buttons and electrical boards are still in place, harking back to the age of British ingenuity. Mr Emmett feels that the loss of Pyestock marks a significant loss for British industry. He said: 'Pyestock played such a important world-leading role in engine development that it's hard not to feel a sense of loss when standing inside one of the testing cells there and realising that it's something that we willingly let go of.' 'Our industries are disappearing as we become more and more reliant on other nations to lead the way. It signals us stepping back on the world stage. 'As such, exploring Pyestock is like stepping back into a golden era of British engineering and industrial prowess.' Engine test cell 3 played its role in the golden era of British engineering . Today, Pyestock is the frequent target for urban explorers and is set to be demolished and replaced by a vast retail distribution depot . Mr Emmett said: 'Pyestock played such a important world-leading role in engine development that it's hard not to feel a sense of loss when standing inside one of the testing cells there and realising that it's something that we willingly let go of' 'I find it amazing the way in which the various site buildings worked in unison like a town-sized machine - each had a purpose or service they provided to another building, all working together towards the end goal of creating supersonic air flow and atmospheric pressure within the four engine testing cells. 'It is very sad that such an important part of our country's industrial heritage is simply going to be broken up and sold off as scrap, but to keep it would be simply be too expensive, particularly in these days of austerity when everything needs to be financially justified.' Recalling how he had read of the site when it was operational, he added: 'I have read an online account by the child of a staff member that said ""when Cell 4 came online at night, you could hear a distant low rumble even from several miles away"".

Today, Pyestock is the frequent target for urban explorers - at least it will be until the base is destroyed. Demolition work is set to start on the site, renamed Hartland Park, soon, according to the Get Hampshire website. More than 12,000 people objected to the scheme, arguing that it would destroy the green ‘lung’ between Fleet and Farnborough and lead to a glut of lorries on the area’s already over-stretched roads. However, the site's developers said the new depot would create up to 1,600 jobs.","National Gas Turbine Establishment - known as Pyestock - closed in 2000 .

"The drone of two Russian nuclear bombers passing along Britain’s South Coast and endangering our civilian airliners should be a deafening wake-up call to our leaders about the threat we face from Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Two Typhoon fighters — which can travel at twice the speed of sound — scrambled on Wednesday from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, screeching through British skies to intercept the Russian Bear Tu-95s, unexpected and unwelcome guests off our shores. Detected first by our Norwegian allies, the Russian planes were then ‘spotted’ by RAF radar stations in Staxton Wold in Yorkshire and Neatishead in Norfolk. In the ultra-secure bunker of RAF Boulmer in Northumberland, home of our Aerospace Surveillance and Control Systems Force Command, RAF officers flashed signals to Whitehall, and Britain’s military HQ in Northwood outside London. Within seconds, the decision was made to scramble the battle-ready Typhoons. Although the Bear bombers came with no fighter escorts, and could have been shot down before they had a chance to launch any nuclear warheads, the episode was still a deeply unsettling reminder of Russia’s ceaseless belligerence. Test: A Russian Bear is escorted by an RAF jet during an alert in September last year (file picture). This week's episode was a deeply unsettling reminder of Russia’s ceaseless belligerence . For this is not the first time the Kremlin has recently tested our reactions and resolve: in November, our fighters were scrambled twice in a week when Bear bombers were identified over the North Sea, and there have been scores of other similar incidents in recent years. For too long, our defence chiefs have for political reasons played down the Russian activity, loath to worsen relations with the Kremlin. Incredibly, back in 2008, for example, a Russian supersonic bomber carried out a dummy nuclear attack on northern England. It came within 90 seconds of our airspace before turning away, and had been approaching with a velocity and angle of attack known as ‘unfriendly posture’. In other words, exactly what it would do if it was on a real bombing run. The Ministry of Defence press office flatly denied this had taken place — until disgruntled RAF officers leaked the story to the newspapers. After this week’s close encounter — which forced the authorities to reroute civil aircraft over the Channel — Britain’s response has been tougher. The pin-striped smoothies at the Foreign Office — normally a blob of timidity and caution when it comes to relations with Russia — scrambled, too, hauling in the Russian ambassador to Britain for a dressing down. We should have done this years ago, for make no mistake, Russia’s aim in all this is to intimidate and humiliate. Not strong enough to mount a full-scale attack, it can still be hugely menacing. On orders from Putin, the Russian warplanes fly with their transponders — devices which emit an identifying signal — switched off, making them invisible to civilian air traffic. It is the aviation equivalent of driving a black HGV with its lights switched off at high speed through city streets at night. This is insanely risky behaviour. In airspace off Denmark last year, it nearly led to a mid-air catastrophe, when a Russian plane came within a whisker of colliding with a civilian airliner that had just taken off from Copenhagen airport. Hundreds of people would have been killed. The prospect of a military miscalculation is ever more frightening. What happens if one of these Russian warplanes is accidentally shot down by an RAF pilot, or one from a nervous Nato ally? We would be on the brink of World War III. So why does Putin do it? Defiant: Russian President Vladimir Putin believes the West . One reason is that these stunts also bring valuable military information. Russian electronic snooping devices monitor our reaction times. They see how well our pilots are trained, and what our warplanes can do. They want to know how they communicate with their bases, and how our chain of command works. Such electronic intelligence-gathering is supplemented by the work of Russia’s human intelligence assets — spies, in plain language — who recruit and run sources in the defence establishments of Nato countries. Knowing how your adversary reacts in an emergency gives crucial insights into how he will behave in war. And it is not just in the air that Russia is constantly testing us. Last year, a Russian flotilla of warships — bristling with electronic listening equipment — brazenly sailed up the Channel, ostensibly on the way to an exercise in the Mediterranean. The only available vessel in our shrunken Navy had to sail at full speed halfway around Britain to intercept them. And, under the ocean, Putin’s submarines lurk off our naval bases in Scotland on an even more sensitive mission. Their task is to listen for the distinctive ‘acoustic signatures’ of our nuclear submarines. These vessels are the most important in Britain’s arsenal. They carry cruise missiles — and four of them are the launching pad for our ultimate deterrent: Trident. But if the acoustic signature is detected, they no longer become invisible, silent killers. They are far easier to track — and to destroy. The bitter irony is that we ourselves no longer have the capability to identify these Russian submarines when they are lurking off our waters. Five years ago, in one of the most extraordinary fiascos in the history of British defence procurement, we sacrificed our Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft, which had the capability to locate the Russian subs from the air. As a result, when Russian submarines again shadowed our naval vessels last year, we were forced to call on other countries for help. In international airspace and on the high seas, these brushes may seem like a macho game. But it could have deadly consequences. If Russia’s forces subvert or attack any of the Baltic states — perhaps in the guise of ‘peacekeepers’ dealing with a civil war — then Britain, as the Nato ally of the staunchly Anglophile Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, is solemnly bound to defend them. In the event of such a crisis, the knowledge acquired by Russia from provocations such as this week’s could be crucial in dealing with anything our Armed Forces would try to do to fulfil Britain’s Nato obligations. Those, then, are the military reasons behind Russia’s menacing of our borders. But there are other motivations for Putin to send a nuclear bomber close to Bournemouth. First, there is the West’s response to Russia’s invasion of Crimea and violent incursions into Ukraine. The sanctions we have imposed are causing Putin’s economy great harm, especially in tandem with the tumbling oil price. But I believe this week’s close call was also in response to the startling events in London, where a public inquiry has opened into the murder of the Russian exile Alexander Litvinenko in November 2006. On its first day, the hearing heard Putin accused of being a ‘common criminal’ who had ordered the murder. As you can imagine, this did not go down well in Moscow. Litvinenko’s death by polonium poisoning should have convinced our leaders that Russia is a criminal state, run by thugs, prepared to silence its critics with reckless acts of nuclear terrorism. Closely watched: An RAF Typhoon jets shadows this Russian Bear H bomber over the North Atlantic Ocean in September 2007. On orders from Putin, the Russian warplanes fly with their transponders — devices which emit an identifying signal — switched off, making them invisible to civilian air traffic. But for years our rulers put the preservation of diplomatic relations with Russia ahead of exposing the truth about one of the most infamous murders in our country’s history — just as they failed for too long to protest to Russia about the misbehaviour of its warplanes. It is hard to overstate the threat the West now faces from Russia, both in terms of espionage and naked military threats. An alleged spy ring was arrested in New York this week, and, yesterday, Putin’s armed forces chief declared that a strong nuclear arsenal will ensure military superiority over the West. He promised that the Russian military would receive more than 50 new intercontinental nuclear missiles this year. Putin believes the West is finished: overstretched, decadent and discredited. The truth is we are not losing this spate of arm-wrestles because we are weak, but because our willpower is weak. The mighty Roman Empire could easily have withstood the assault it faced in its last years. But it bickered, fiddled, dithered — and perished.

Luis Nobre, 48, is alleged to have duped major pipe lay company Allseas Group Ltd into handing him the vast sum of money in November 2011. He is accused of conning the firm using bogus bank guarantees worth more than $5billion and laundering some of the proceeds through a bank account in Singapore. Nobre, the sole director of Larn Ltd, registered to exclusive addresses in Harley Street and Marylebone, central London, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court this morning. Wearing a blue pinstriped suit and a dark fedora hat, he pleaded not guilty to nine money laundering and fraud charges.

Nobre is said to have fraudulently got 100million euros transferred to Larn Ltd on November 1, 2011, from Allseas Group. It is then claimed that he made a series of transactions totalling 16million euros during the rest of the month. Nobre is accused of laundering 269,141 Swiss Francs on January 4, 2012, and transferring another 651,691 Swiss Francs to an HSBC account in Singapore belonging to Kadurugamuwa in January and February the same year. Nobre is also said to have obtained bank cards preloaded with funds from the Allseas Group between December 2011 and November 2012, and used a bank card belonging to the Federal Bank of the Middle East. He is accused of having bogus papers showing he had a one billion euro guarantee and two further guarantees worth $2.37billion and $2.03billion. High-flyer: Nobre's Larn Ltd was registered at this address on Harley Street, in central London . Luis Nobre, 48, is alleged to have duped major pipe lay company Allseas Group Ltd (heaquarters in Switzerland pictured) into handing him the vast sum of money . Prosecutor Dominic Lewis said: 'There is potential evidence from Malta where the fraud was allegedly committed.' Judge Martin Beddoe freed all three defendants on bail until their trial, which is due to begin on September 7. They will all return to court for a pre-trial hearing on July 24. Nobre, from Wembley, denies two counts of acquiring criminal property, four counts of transferring criminal property, and three counts of possessing an article for use in fraud.

"Canadian climber Will Gadd has become the first man to ever climb the frozen ice of Niagara Falls. As the popular tourist area experiences such heavy ice in winter, it is closed to the public.

Scroll down for video . Inch by inch: Gadd, 47, already world-renowned for his feats, used the opportunity to take on the ice of the 180-foot high gorge working his way up just feet away from the Horseshoe Falls . Once a year the falls on the Canadian and US border freezes. As the popular tourist area experiences such heavy ice in winter, it is closed to the public. The climb was captured by media and events company owner Bob Koshinski, CBS reports. 'I grew up in Niagara Falls and I've seen Wallenda and I've seen some of the great stunts and I have been down here for many functions,' Koshinski told reporters. 'I have never seen anybody, certainly in the wintertime, scaling the gorge so close to the cascades of the Horseshoe Falls that he could have reached out and touched it,' he said. 'It was pretty dramatic footage.' Victory: There is estimated to be about 150,000 tons of water pouring out over the park's crest with speeds reaching as high as 70 miles per hour . Mere feet away from danger on the ice face: The climb was captured by media and events company owner Bob Koshinski and Red Bull . Red Bull also filmed the climb. 'I've traveled the world in search of the most challenging climbs, but Niagara Falls, one of my home country's most iconic landmarks, has been a lifelong mission that I previously never thought possible,' Gadd said, The Daily News reports. There is estimated to be about 150,000 tons of water pouring out over the park's crest with speeds reaching as high as 70 miles per hour. There was some confusion around Gadd's climb, as the New York State Parks Office approved it but the Niagra Falls Review reported it as 'U .S. law enforcement conducted training exercises' A State Parks spokeswoman said 'no park staff was told to lie' but that the information about the stunt was not widely spread to keep filming quiet' 'It was very real on that wall. There's a lot going on,' Gadd said. 'The ice thickness varies from one inch to 10 feet, so every swing and grab is different. There's a lot to account for, all this with the world's most powerful waterfall flowing over my shoulder.'

"The NFL will keep Super Bowl balls under 'added security' ahead of the game as the Deflategate investigation continues. There will be 108 balls used in Arizona between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots on Sunday - five times more than any other game. Both teams will practice with the designated set, but the NFL will take them into their custody on Friday before they are inspected by officials three hours before kick off. For two days they will be guarded by an independently-chosen equipment manager, the Chicago Bears' Tony Medlin, while ball attendants will handle pregame preparation. Scroll down for video . Precautions: Vice president of NFL officiating Dean Blandino said the balls will be under 'added security' before the Super Bowl on Sunday. They will be looked after by an independent kit manager from Friday . During a press conference on Thursday, vice president of officiating Dean Blandino insisted that the heightened security wasn't a result of Deflategate but was normal protocol for the Super Bowl. He said: 'There will be some added security just because of the environment we're in for this game. 'The thing with the Super Bowl is during the first half, we rotate footballs in as much as possible, because then those balls are used for charity and NFL auction.' Referring back to the Patriots' AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts - where the scandal began - he said the inspection of the footballs by referee Walt Anderson was handled properly. 'My major concern is did we follow proper protocol?' Blandino said. 'Everything was properly tested and marked before the game. Walt gauged the footballs himself; it is something he has done throughout his career. 'Officiating is not part of the investigation.' Responsibility: The Chicago Bears' Tony Medlin was chosen to take custody of the balls when the teams hand them over on Friday before they are inspected by officials three hours before kick off . Investigation: The senior official hinted that there could be a league-wide review of how balls are prepared for games during the off season . As the scandal continues, Blandino also hinted at the possibility of a league-wide review into pregame football preparations during the off season. 'They're not logged and that's certainly something that could be a thought,' he added. 'They're tested, they make sure that they're in that acceptable range and then they basically mark the football to say this is an acceptable football in that proper specification.' Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL, is expected to address the Deflategate issue for the first time during a press conference on Saturday. For over a week the Patriots have been hammered by questions about how 11 of 12 footballs used in the AFC Championship game did not meet NFL standards. Response: Tom Brady (pictured at a press conference on Thursday) has denied having any involvement in the Deflategate scandal . The NFL has hired attorney Ted Wells to look into the matter and the investigation is expected to last several weeks. Both Tom Brady, a three-time Super Bowl winner, and coach Bill Belichick have denied any knowledge or involvement in what has become known in the American media as 'Deflategate'. 'I believe now 100 percent I have personally and we as an organization have followed every rule to the letter,' Belichick said. 'At no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or to gain an advantage.' 'I want to make it clear that I believe unconditionally that the New England Patriots have done nothing inappropriate in this process or in violation of NFL rules,' Owner Robert Kraft told a packed conference hall. 'Tom, Bill and I have been together for 15 years, they are my guys, they are part of my family ... and I have never known them to lie to me. 'It bothers me greatly that their reputations and integrity and by association that of our team has been called into question this past week.'","108 balls will be used between the Seahawks and Patriots on Sunday .

"A couple have married 35 years after they first met - despite living on opposite sides of the world. Childhood sweethearts Carolyn Walker, 51, and Ian Cook, 50, met as teenagers in 1979 in Frome, Somerset, and fell madly in love. They dated for two years and has dreams of tying the knot but they lost touch when Ian emigrated to Australia with his family. Long lost love: Childhood sweethearts Carolyn Walker, 51, and Ian Cook, 50, met as teenagers in Somerset and fell in love. After losing touch for decades, they reunited in 2011 and married in December 2013 . Good old days: The pair (pictured in 1979) were each other's first loves and dated for two years before their parents banned them from getting engaged. Soon after, Ian's family moved to Australia and they lost touch . Decades later, Ian found Carolyn on the website Friends Reunited. Their online conversations led to Carolyn making a huge leap of faith and leaving her life in England behind to be reunited with her lost love. She bought a one way ticket to Australia and finally fulfilled her dream to marry Ian in December 2013. She said of her  marriage: 'I feel very lucky; it feels like I've won the lottery. I've never been happier. I never used to believe in fate - now I do. We were meant to be together.' The pair first met at school where Ian, 14, was in 15-year-old Carolyn's younger sister Joanne's year. The pair picturd as teenagers met at school in Frome, Somerset, and dated for two years . Perfect match: 'We were inseparable from the moment we met,' Carolyn (pictured with Ian in 1979) said of her former beau. 'It was proper first love. We wanted to get engaged, but our parents said no' Flashback: In 2011, Carolyn (pictured with Ian at his mum's house in 1978) received a message from her former flame on dating site Friends Reunited . 'We were inseparable from the moment we met,' she said. 'It was proper first love. We wanted to get engaged, but our parents said no.' Carolyn was 'devastated' when Ian moved away. Although they got on with their separate lives, Carolyn never married, and while Ian had a marriage that ended, neither of them had children. 'I think he must have always been in the back of my mind. I never ever wanted to marry or start a family with anybody,' Carolyn said. They could have met again in 1990 when Carolyn visited Adelaide with her younger sister for a six-month holiday, but in the end she got cold feet. Leap of faith: The pair (pictured in 1979) exchanged a flurry of messages and phone calls, and five months after the first message Carolyn booked a one-way flight to Australia to be reunited with Ian . We both knew that something was still there,' said Carolyn (pictured in 1978 with Ian). 'Before I even left England we knew that we were going to be together' She said: 'We were going to knock on Ian's door but the morning we were going to do it, I chickened out. 'I regretted that big time when I got home. But obviously the time wasn't right for us.' Twenty years later, in May 2010, a shocked Carolyn received a message out of the blue from Ian on the website Friends Reunited. 'I was on a girls' night out with my sister and I saw this message from Ian Cook and I thought ""THE Ian Cook?! It can't be!""' she said. The message read: 'Hi, I'm not sure if you're the right person I'm looking for, but have you got a sister called Jo?' At last: The couple finally married on 29 December 2013 - 35 years after they first fell in love . Carolyn said of her new marriage: 'I've never been happier. I never used to believe in fate - now I do' Tied the knot: Carolyn and Ian strike a pose on their wedding day . They exchanged a flurry of messages and two days later, they heard each other's voices for the first time in more than 30 years. Carolyn admits she was unsettled by his Australian accent, but she was also surprised by how natural it felt to speak to Ian on the phone, even after so many years. 'It was so weird, it was like we had spoken last week. We chatted for about three hours that first time,' she said. Just five months later, Carolyn took a gamble by booking a one-way ticket to Australia for a reunion with Ian - and she hasn't returned since. 'We both knew that something was still there; before I even left England we knew that we were going to be together,' she explained. Matching tattoos: Within a month of their October reunion, Carolyn and Ian got each other's names tattooed on their wrists to show just how committed they were to each other . Still the same: 'We've got a lot older but I could see it was him, he hadn't changed that much,' Carolyn said of their reunion after three decades . 'I was determined this was going to be my life. I was nervous on the flight but Ian met me at the airport and we just ran into each other's arms. 'We've got a lot older but I could see it was him, he hadn't changed that much.' Within a month of their October reunion, Carolyn and Ian got each other's names tattooed on their wrists to show just how committed they were to each other. And on Christmas that year, Ian, an operations supervisor in the oil and gas industry, got down on one knee and proposed to his former childhood sweetheart. The couple finally married on 29 December 2013 - 35 years after they first fell in love. They had to wait for a permanent visa for Carolyn, who works in retail, and wanted all of her family to be able to come to Adelaide for their special day. In the family: The newlyweds pose for a photo with Carolyn's younger sister Jo, left . Family and friends joined the couple to celebrate their wedding in Australia . 'The weirdest thing is not being called Carolyn Walker any more! I was that name for 50 years, and now I'm a Mrs. I never felt I wanted to get married before, but this just felt right,' Carolyn said. 'Sometimes I have to pinch myself now, I think I might be dreaming all. It is unbelievable.' Carolyn’s parents Alan and Vera Walker, of Frome, Somerset, celebrated the couple's tale of true love. Alan, 78, said: 'It might sound silly but it was just meant to be. 'We obviously knew Ian when they were courting. He was a tearaway like they all are at that age but he was a good lad. He had to go with his parents to Australia, and we thought that was the end of it.' 'Sometimes I have to pinch myself now, I think I might be dreaming all. It is unbelievable,' said Carolyn . Happily ever after: The couple plan to live in Adelaide, where Ian works as an operations supervisor . The father was worried for Carolyn's gamble but realised they were adults and could take their own risks. 'I warned Carolyn that he might be a little, fat, bald man by now, because it was 35 years ago. But they recognised each other and that was it. 'It was almost as if it was all meant to happen. I suppose it was fate.' Her sister Joanne, 49, who works in retail, said: 'She is the most lucky woman alive!'","Carolyn Walker, 51, and Ian Cook, 50, met as teenagers at school in 1979 .

"A South Australian woman was guilt-ridden about carrying out sexual acts on her young son and a dog, a court has been told. The woman had never been in trouble with the law, came from a very stable and loving home, had no school behavioural problems and had worked for the same employer for 20 years. Nothing emerged from her background which would have indicated she would ever commit such offences, he said in the District Court on Friday. The South Australian woman was guilt-ridden about carrying out sexual acts on her young son and a dog . The 36-year-old woman and the boy's 34-year-old father, from regional South Australia, have pleaded guilty to persistent sexual exploitation of a child and aggravated counts of producing and possessing child pornography between March 2011 and January 2012. The woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, also has admitted one count of bestiality. Prosecutor Stephanie Borek said that in January 2012 police received information about an account in the woman's name which was used to access child exploitation material. Police seized a computer from the couple's house, noting their four-year-old son was present. But the parents were not arrested until April 2014, after the material was discovered on the computer. The woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, also has admitted one count of bestiality after committing a sexual act on a small Jack Russell terrier . Ms Borek said two separate incidents were depicted of the mother performing sexual acts on her son and another on a small Jack Russell terrior. The images were stored on the computer in a file titled the woman's name followed by the word 'incest'. In November 2011, the boy had disclosed to a deputy-principal that he had seen his mother perform oral sex on his father who had taken him into their bedroom. This demonstrated that the offences had occurred in the context of the victim being exposed to sexualised behaviour, Ms Borek said. In November 2011, the boy had disclosed to a deputy-principal that he had seen his mother perform oral sex on his father . Judge Julie McIntyre agreed 'regrettably' to Ms Borek's application that she view the images to grasp the full extent of the offending. Ms Borek said the parents had tried to play down their actions in their interviews with psychologists. Both defence lawyers said the images, which were 'fairly disturbing in nature', were well described in written material. The sentence hearing is continuing.","36-year-old mother pleaded guilty to persistent sexual exploitation of a child .

"She's been dubbed a child prodigy, a genius and 'the binary wunderkind'. But Akiane Kramarik says everyone  is blessed with a gift - she simply found hers at the very tender age of three. Art has become a way of life for the 20-year-old, who grew up in a small town of Illinois in what she described as a 'dirty shack' with no television, no radio, no friends or relatives. Coming from a background of financial hardship, it was a surreal experience for the young artist when she was first discovered by Oprah Winfrey and featured on her show at just eight years of age. Since then, she's gone on to publish best-selling books and paintings which are valued at millions of dollars. Having lived and explored more than 30 countries with her family, they've finally decided to settle down in Australia with hopes of opening up a gallery and and an international arts academy for aspiring artists. Scroll down for video . Akiane Kramarik began drawing at the age of three as she grew up in a small town of Illinois, US, with no television, no radio, no friends or relatives . When she started having vivid dreams at a very young age, the artist felt the urge to express them through art . Coming from a background of financial hardship, it was a surreal experience for the young artist when she was first discovered by Oprah Winfrey and featured on her show at just eight years of age . For more than 10 years, Ms Kramarik has woken up at 3am every morning to gather her thoughts and to begin creating another one of her masterpieces. It's this kind of discipline that's driven the US artist from virtually nothing to renowned success. But none of her values and goals have changed as she's remains humble and grateful for the support she's had over the years, especially from her parents and four brothers. 'I grew up in a very nurturing family,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were financially extremely poor. We literally lived day by day and had no TV or radio. 'I remember my mother actually going from door to door, introducing herself and wanting to make friends with people but no one was welcoming of us. 'So we led our lives in nature and spent a lot of time together as a family. That's how we picked things up and learned about life.' Then began her vivid dreams. 'I was so young but started having these visions and impressions of the world,' Ms Kramarik said. 'I was just so surprised at the impeccable images I had in my head that I just had to express them in some sort of physical matter. 'So I began sketching on anything and I remember these drawings scattered around the dirty shack we used to live in.'

When the drawings were noticed by Ms Kramarik's parents, they saved up to buy her a sketch book and pencil to help her explore her new-found talent .

When these drawings were noticed by Ms Kramarik's parents, they saved up to buy her a sketch book and pencil to help her explore her new-found talent. 'That's when I started to take my art very seriously,' Ms Kramarik said. 'Then as I turned seven, I gradually moved onto pastels and started painting on large canvases that were much bigger than me.' It was from this moment that she began her early morning 3am rituals. 'It's the most peaceful time for me as I can slowly get lost in the world I'm painting,' she said. 'It really is the best thing I do every day and I don't plan on changing my routine any time soon.' At the age of eight, she completed her first five-foot long oil painting and made her first TV appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. 'I was so young then plus I didn't grow up with TV, so had no idea about what kind of person Oprah was,' Ms Kramarik said. 'It was only after I came off her show that I understood how influential she was as it really opened up a path for me.' Since then, she's also met the likes of TV host Craig Ferguson and former anchor of Good Morning America Diane Sawyer. Ms Kramarik - who many in the art community refer as 'the binary wunderkind' - deeply struggled with the labels she's been given as a child . Looking back, Ms Kramarik believes all the emotional and financial hardship she's endured over the years have been worth every little bit . Having lived and explored more than 30 countries with her family, they've finally decided to settle down in Australia with hopes of opening up a gallery and and an international arts academy for aspiring artists . But Ms Kramarik - who many in the art community refer as 'the binary wunderkind' - deeply struggled with the labels she's been given as a child. 'Before I went on Oprah there was a lot of judgement from people around me because they didn't believe the paintings and drawings were by me,' she said. 'People wanted to burn all my works when we tried to display them in public. That made me doubt myself and my talents. 'But then once I was discovered and people started labelling me - it was also hard to live up to those expectations.' Despite all this, the gifted artist has gone on to publish two best-selling books of poems as well as paintings which are worth $10,000 up to $3 million. Looking back, Ms Kramarik believes all the emotional and financial hardship she's endured over the years have been worth every little bit. And this year, she's keen to start working on some of her lifelong goals here in Australia. 'Me and my family moved to the Gold Coast (southeastern Queensland) about six months ago and it's just perfect,' Ms Kramarik said. 'This is our second home and we've completely fallen in love with its charm.' The 20-year-old hopes to open up an art gallery and an international arts academy in Australia for aspiring artists. 'It's still in the planning process but I'm really excited about giving back to the community, inspiring people and helping others find their talents,' she said.

Known as the 'mother of tornadoes', a mesocyclone can be up to six miles wide and can produce as many as 60 tornadoes. These severe thunderstorms form where cold dry air meets warm moist tropical air. The wind coming into the storm starts to swirl and forms a funnel. The air in the funnel spins faster and faster and creates a very low pressure area which sucks more air - and objects - into it. If the cyclone runs out of wet, warm surface air, it dies out. If it does not run out of this fuel, however, the rotating cloud stretches toward the ground and may become a giant tornado. In one example, the anatomy of a classic supercell storm is shown. Towards the bottom of the storm, large hail and heavy precipitation can be seen pouring down from the clouds onto the ground. An updraft in the cloud is also identified, while a  cloud with an imminent tornado is shown forming near to the ground. Another shows how giant bolts of lightning move from high in the clouds to Earth. It highlights the positive charge at the start of the bolt, and a negative charge at the bottom. Elsewhere, the team reveal the anatomy of a monsoon thunderstorm. At its base there is a warm inflow of air, while mammatus clouds form higher up. A terrifying tornadic supercell is also seen with a mesocyclone, while a dangerous cone tornado begins to form at the bottom. The book also contains a special section called Franklinstein, which details their lightning research project, in which they fire probe-containing rockets into electrically charged storms in an attempt to initiate lightning. To collect images for the book, the team plans to begin storm chasing in the spring of this year to ‘collect just the right images and have all the components in place.’ According to the team, the book ‘will also include detailed explanations of how and why severe weather occurs, historical references to past milestone weather events and storm chasing stories behind the scenes to give you an idea of how to capture these images’ The book also contains a special section called Franklinstein (shown), which details the team's lightning research project, in which they fire probe-containing rockets into electrically charged storms in an attempt to initiate lightning .

"Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused in a separate incident of eluding an officer and resisting arrest, it was revealed today. State troopers cited Hernandez January 1 for speeding down a highway north of Denver in her mother's car after the girl's driver's license had been revoked. The citation shows Hernandez was driving 80mph in a 55mph zone, and the trooper noted that she was resisting arrest in a way that risked serious injury to him or others. It does not provide other details of the case. Scroll down for video . Earlier incident: Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused of speeding and resisting arrest . Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg . Colorado State Patrol Trooper Josh Lewis would not comment on the case.  Hernandez's uncle, Alberto Hernandez, referred questions to an attorney who did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Court records show the Adams County district attorney's office had the citation dismissed after Hernandez died. Police say Hernandez was shot dead Monday after she drove a stolen car toward an officer in a residential alley in Denver. The Denver shooting also brought protests and a demand for a special prosecutor. On Friday, Hernandez's family called for a federal civil rights investigation into her death. In a statement released in English and Spanish, Hernandez's parents said they want the US Department of Justice to investigate her death, and for US Attorney John Walsh in Colorado to oversee the criminal investigation of the officers involved. The family said it doesn't trust Denver police to conduct a fair and timely investigation, and that the department has a history of exonerating its officers. The statement came after the parents retained lawyer Qusair Mohamedbhai, who has been involved in a number of other high-profile civil rights cases against Denver police and sheriff's deputies. Mohamedbhai represented a former Denver jail inmate to whom the city paid $3.3million in July to settle a jail abuse lawsuit. The allegations in the lawsuit filed by Jamal Hunter were so egregious they prompted a federal judge to request a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the city's police and the sheriff's departments. In the shooting of Hernandez, Police Chief Robert White has said the two officers repeatedly told her and four other teens to get out of the stolen car. Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez (right) is asking for a second autopsy to be conducted on her daughter (left) White said Thursday an officer might have been injured trying to get out of the way of the vehicle. He initially said the two officers opened fire after one was struck by the car. The incident remained under investigation. A passenger in the car, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, has disputed that account, saying the officers did not yell commands before they shot Hernandez through the driver's side window. The passenger also claimed that Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. White said it's too soon to judge whether Officers Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, acted appropriately in shooting Hernandez. Jordan suffered a fractured leg. No one has been charged with the theft of the car, a 2000 Honda Civic that was reported missing Sunday night in Federal Heights. Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandz, Jessica's mother, on Wednesday called for an independent autopsy on her daughter because she does not trust the official investigation. The request came as the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles. A shrine in remembrance of Jessica's life was set up at her family's home. She leaves behind five siblings . A passenger in the car said Jessica (pictured left and right) lost control of the vehicle  after being shot . Mrs Hernandez, a mother of six, said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.' 'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by 'grabbing' a car that did not belong to her but didn't deserve to pay with her life. She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?' 'It's all done. They did it. They killed her. All I want is justice. The grieving mother also criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot. She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,' The shooting was the fourth time in seven months that Denver police have fired at a moving vehicle after perceiving it as a threat. Protester Bruce Young waves a sign before a meeting with officials from the Denver District Attorney's office . Department policy encourages officers to move out of the way of a moving car rather than use their firearm. But it also allows them to shoot if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. The incidents have prompted the department and the city's independent monitor to review policies and training related to such shootings. Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras. Prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week. A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held. Candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast Denver . Flowers were put out, candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of Jessica at her home . The US Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy. The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire. It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.' Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control.","State troopers cited Jessica Hernandez January 1 for doing 80mph in 55mph zone .

"Scientists have recreated ancient brain surgery to understand the remarkable medical techniques that existed almost 2,500 years ago. A team of experts in Russia has spent the past year examining skulls found with intricate surgical holes in a bid to fathom out how early nomadic doctors carried out their work. Evidence had suggested they were among the earliest ever examples of trepanation - the oldest form of known neurosurgery - with the procedures clearly skilfully carried out. Scientists have recreated ancient brain surgery on a modern skull (shown) to understand the remarkable medical techniques that existed almost 2,500 years ago. A team of experts in Russia has spent the past year examining skulls found with intricate surgical holes in a bid to fathom out how early nomadic doctors worked . Now The Siberian Times has reported that leading Russian doctor Aleksei Krivoshapkin carried out pioneering 'surgery' on a modern skull using only the equipment available to ancient doctors working before Jesus was born. The procedure was undertaken according to ancient methods used in the Altai Mountains on the skull of a woman who had died of natural causes shortly before. Among the remarkable findings made by the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography in Novosibirsk was the revelation that surgeons almost 2,500 years ago were highly skilled - perhaps even more so than many Western doctors up until the 19th century. Trepanation involves the removal of a piece of bone from the skull, and it has been performed since prehistoric times. Cave paintings indicate that people believed the practice would cure epileptic seizures, headaches and mental disorders. The oldest samples of skulls with bore holes drilled into them were found in a burial site in France dating back to 6500 BC. But it was also used by the Ancient Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Romans, Greeks and the early Mesoamerican civilizations. Even the 'father of medicine' Hippocrates advocated the process in his 400 BC tome 'On Injuries of the Head'. Modern exponents say it increases blood flow in the brain, increasing lucidity and heightening brain function. Professor Krivoshapkin, a prominent Siberian neurosurgeon, who examined the ancient skulls and conducted the trepanation technique, said: 'Honestly, I am amazed. 'We suspect now that in the time of Hippocrates, the Altai people could do a very fine diagnosis and carry out skilful trepanations and fantastic brain surgery.' The most exciting part of the research was recreating the surgical procedure itself, including trying to use similar instruments to those from the time. Analysis of the skulls of ancient patients found that the operations were carried out with only one tool, a bronze knife, with the surgeons carefully scraping at the skull, yet leaving behind only minimal traces of their work. A replica was made using modern elements by archaeologist Andrei Borodovsky, a doctor of historical sciences at the Institute. He said: 'I chose a brass alloy of copper, tin, and zinc. Our modern copy of brass alloy performed very well. 'I think it is important to remember that Altai was a big centre for bone cutting production in the 5th century BC. 'People here were very skilful in making different objects from animal bone. 'Working with the animal bones, they understood the main principles of working with such material and later it helped them to make such complicated surgeries.' Evidence from the ancient skulls (one shown) had suggested they were among the earliest ever examples of trepanation - the oldest form of known neurosurgery - with the procedures clearly skilfully carried out . The Siberian Times has reported that leading Russian doctor Aleksei Krivoshapkin (left) carried out pioneering 'surgery' on a modern skull using only the equipment available to ancient doctors (right) working before Jesus was born - which mostly consisted of knives and a saw . The procedure was undertaken according to ancient methods used in the Altai Mountains on the skull of a woman who had died of natural causes short . Analysis of the skulls of ancient patients found that the operations were carried out with only one tool, a bronze knife, with the surgeons carefully scraping at the skull, yet leaving behind only minimal traces of their work . Professor Krivoshapkin took exactly 28 minutes to recreate the surgical procedure on the modern skull. He said it 'required considerable effort', but in the end the hole in the skull was found to mirror those found in three ancient skulls examined by researchers. Some ancient patients, who came from the Altai Mountains region, survived the procedures and went on to live long lives, archeologists have established. In addition, it was clear the ancient doctors somehow adhered to the strict Hippocratic Corpus, the landmark declaration of medical ethics set down in Greece in 500BC. Ancient skulls belonging to two men and a woman and dating back between 2,500 and 2,300 years, were found in the Altai Mountains with signs of having had brain surgery carried out. One of the males, aged between 40 and 45, had suffered a head trauma and developed a blood clot that likely left him suffering headaches, nausea, and movement problems, experts believe. Trepanation would have been carried out to remove the haematoma, with evidence of later bone growth indicating the man survived the surgery and lived for years afterwards. The second man had no visible traces of trauma but instead was suspected of having a congenital skull deformation that the ancient surgeon wanted to fix. In both cases, a relatively small hole was made in the skull allowing surgeons to access the brain at an area where damage to joints and the membrane would have been minimised. And while the actual technique and the implements used may have varied from those recommended in Ancient Greece, it was clear the care for the patient and the location of the hole showed a similar ethnical consideration. Holes were cut in modern skulls according to the ancient method. Professor Krivoshapkin took exactly 28 minutes to recreate the surgical procedure on the modern skull . He said it 'required considerable effort' using a knife to make the holes, but in the end the hole in the skull was found to mirror those found in three ancient skulls examined by researchers . In order to study the procedure in detail, the remains were first analysed under a microscope at the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography to find any markings that indicated the way the surgeons operated. No trace of the way the doctors removed the skin was found, and given the good preservation of the skull surface it is assumed this was carried out with high precision. The trepanation was conducted in two stages. First, a sharp cutting tool removed the surface layer of bone carefully without perforating the skull itself. Then, with short and frequent movements a hole was cut. Professor Krivoshapkin said: 'All three trepanations were performed by scraping. 'From the traces on the surface of the studied skulls, you can see the sequence of actions of the surgeons during the operations. 'It is clearly seen that the ancient surgeons were very exact and confident in their moves, with no traces of unintentionally chips, which are quite natural when cutting bone.' Where the nomadic surgeons learned their skill is still unknown. There are theories that they picked up the techniques from the medical centres of the ancient world, but others say they simply discovered them at the same time as prominent doctors in Ancient Greece and the Middle East. There is also no answer to how the doctors anaesthetised their patients before carrying out the procedures in the first place.","A Russian doctor has carried out ancient 'brain surgery' on a modern skull .

"Vice President Joe Biden suggested Friday morning that the Obama years have not been a time of prosperity and ease, but 'really, really hard for this country.' But he still insisted that his boss, Presdient Barack Obama, has made the right economic decisions. And hours later the White House blamed problems Obama inherited from his predecessor for an incomplete economic recovery. Biden's odd juxtaposition – half blame, half credit – will lead to questions about whether he can create effective separation between himself and the president as he's trying to build momentum for his own run at the top job. 'To state the obvious, the past six years have been really, really hard for this country,' Biden told House Democrats at their ennual retreat in Philadelphia. 'And they've been really tough for our party.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . TOUGH SPOT: VP Joe Biden has to run for president by claiming credit for the best of the Obama economy while disowning the rest . BLAME BUSH: White House press secretary Josh Earnest said fretting House Democrats don't reflect President Obama's enthusiasm, even though he 'inherited' an economic quagmire from his predecessor . Pointing to New York Rep. Steve Israel, the former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he said, 'Just ask Steve. They've been really tough for our party.' 'Together we made some really, really tough decisions,' Biden said Friday, reflecting on his party's legislative agenda in recent years, including the increasingly unpopular Affordable Care Act. Those decisions 'weren't at all popular,' Biden said, and were 'hard to explain – hard to communicate why it was so important they had to be made.' 'And the decisions had real political cost. A lot of my friends and your friends in this caucus aren't here today because they had the nerve to stand up and do what they thought was right, knowing – knowing – in the face of unrelenting political criticism, and with Republicans and the tea party trying to stop us at every step of the way, they knew they were going to be in trouble.' Still, he tried to buck up Democrats through their spotty applause. 'The decisions you made, the decisions the administration fostered, were the right decisions,' Biden said. 'They were the right ones. They worked for America.' Republicans have steadily eroded Democrats' representation in Congress since Obama took office in 2009, finally taking over control of the U.S. Senate this month and diluting Democratic House membership by 11 seats. Katie Martin Prill, communications director at the National Republcian Congressional Committee, said Friday that Biden sounded like 'he now works for Republicans.' 'Democrats learned the hard way this past November that President Obama’s policies are toxic and yet they want to double down on their support,' Prill said. 'It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this idea is worse than the GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial.' Republicans have steadily eroded Democrats' representation in Congress since Obama took office in 2009, finally taking over control of the U.S. Senate this month and diluting Democratic House membership by 11 seats. House Democrats, blindsided by the November trouncing, titled one of their Friday meeting sessions: 'Where do we go from here?' Earnest said on Friday that the president isn't feeling similarly adrift. 'I don't speak for all Democrats, he told Daily Mail Online in his daily briefing. 'I speak for just the most powerful Democrat in the world.' Over laughter in the press briefing room, he insisted, 'I can tell you he's very clear about where he wants to take the country.' 'WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?': House Democrats are adrift after an electoral shellacking drive by defending Obama's policies, but the president is distancing himself to keep some luster on his legacy . A disconnect between Congressional Democrats and Obama is evident, however. At their retreat, Democrats turned House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to lead their session on the future of the party. Pelosi and her allies have split with Obama on several issues, including compromise spending legislation backed by the White House that included a carve-out for Wall Street and a proposal to tax so-called '529' college saving accounts. The president was forced to abandon that tax policy shift this week after Pelosi, Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, and Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, lobbied against the measure. Biden's candid admission put the White House in a tough spot, too – back to blaming America's economic woes on what Obama 'inherited' from George W. Bush, even in the seventh year of his presidency. Obama deserves credit for 'digging out of that financial crisis,' Earnest told Daily Mail Online on Friday. 'Because of the policies that this administration has put in place, our economy has bounced back stronger than ever, and we've laid a new foundation that we need to capitalize on.' America's economy is growing more slowly than economists have expected, with fourth quarter 2014 numbers showing the impact of slowing government spending and diminishing business investments. Gross domestic product expanded at just 2.6 per cent from October to Decemberm slowing from a 5 per cent pace in the previous three months. During all of 2014, the economy grew at a rate of just 2.4 per cent . 'Let’s resolve to double down,' Biden told Democrats in Philadelphia. 'Let's resolve to double down right now.'","The VP spoke to members of Congress on Friday, claming Republicans are trying to claim credit for what little good economic news there is .
He acknowledged that many of the Democrats' priorities are deeply unpopular and said their numbers in Congress have shrunk as a result .
Biden's hopes for the top job are slim as he trails Hillary Clinton by a dramatic margin among Democratic voters .
White House press secretary insists that even if House Democrats are adrift, the president is not .
But Biden's admission put him back to blaming economic conditions on George W. Bush, even in the seventh year of Obama's presidency ."

"She's famous for her love of high-end labels and expensive handbags but Denmark's Crown Princess Mary proved that budget fashion can be just as stylish during a visit to Copenhagen Fashion Week. The Australian-born royal was resplendent in a cut-price £50 patterned silk dress as she met designers at The Jewellery Room, a showcase for Danish jewellers. Speaking to Danish tabloid Billed Bladet as she arrived, the 42-year-old revealed that she was 'looking forward to seeing it all'. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Crown Princess Mary made her second appearance at Copenhagen Fashion Week today . The Jewellery Room brings together 16 up-and-coming and established jewellers, most of whom are Danish, among them Pandora and Ole Lynggaard. Mary herself was wearing some impressive jewels, although they cost considerably more than her Edith and Ella dress, which is currently on sale with 70 per cent off. Among them was a gold-plated Ole Lynggaard necklace, which, according to Royalista.com, sells for a majestic 41,000 Danish Krone (£4,145). She also wore a £2,670 'leaves' ring by the same designer in 18k yellow gold which also comes in rose gold and cut-price silver versions, with the latter costing a relatively inexpensive £320. Afterwards, she continued on to the Designers' Nest showcase, where she met young designers, among them the Royal Academy's School of Design in Copenhagen.

Today's appearance at The Jewellery Room was her second visit to Copenhagen Fashion Week this month, although the first, at the Mark Kenly Domino Tan show on Wednesday, took the Danish press by surprise. Unusually, the Kongehuset, or Danish Royal Court, did not announce the visit in advance, leading to speculation that the appearance had been a last minute decision. Once there, Mary, who was glamorous in a  coat by Baum und Pferdgarten that is yet to hit the shops, appeared to enjoy the show, looking especially interested in a plum coloured jumpsuit. The mother-of-four has made a habit of attending Copenhagen Fashion Week and was, until recently, patron of the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair. She does, however, remain patron of another Copenhagen Fashion Week initiative called Designers' Nest which gives a platform to fledgling fashion designers.

"We've had up-scaled burgers, hot dogs and fish and chips but up to now, the poor beleaguered kebab has been left well alone. Well, not anymore. The much-maligned Turkish staple is now getting a makeover thanks to Nick Green and Matthew Kershaw, who have opened 'premium kebab destination' Chifafa that has 24-hour marinated veal shoulder kebab on the menu costing £8.40. Luxed-up kebab: Slow cooked lamb shoulder with feta, mango pickle and fresh dill tahini yoghurt . The 'premium kebab destination' Chifafa is on Clerkenwell Road, London . 'Everyone knows that you can go down to Green Lanes or Edgware Road and have a great sit down kebab at a Turkish or Lebanese restaurant,' said co-founder Nick Green. 'But unfortunately there are also lots of kebab restaurants around the UK that treat the food with less reverence, and accordingly the kebab's reputation isn't great over here. 'People associate them with the drunken walk home from the pub, and we want to dispel that stereotype once and for all and create something really tasty and healthy that people can eat quickly at lunchtime as well as in the evening.' A world away from the usual kebab shops: Chifafa's pared down menu has five options . 'I have a hunch that the average doner kebab is going to get a makeover. Think house made wraps and decent meat cooked on wood grills and in smokers and you get the idea,' James Ferguson, head chef of the Hoxton's The Beagle said to FEMAIL. And he may be right. Kebabs, which have long been associated with a quick way to soak up the alcohol after a drunken binge are the latest food to be luxed up in London. They appear on the menu at Dishoom (minced lamb marinated with lime, coriander and cumin). Alan Yau, founder of Busuba Eathai, Hakkasan, Wagamama and Yauatcha has opened Turkish restaurant Babaji on Shaftesbury Avenue serving kebabs, and there are rumours that Yotam Ottolenghi’s business partner Noam Baris is planning to launch a fast-food business that revolves around kebabs. The restaurant seats 25 people but almost 70 per cent of its custom comes from takeaway orders, Mr Green said. 'It's a fast casual restaurant, the type of place like Leon or Itsu or Chipotle,' he explained to FEMAIL. 'We have seating for 25 people but 70 per cent of people take away. 'The key is to change the perception of the kebab away from something fit only for the stagger home from the pub into something fresh, healthy and an acceptable lunch meal. 'When most women hear the word kebab they shudder as they think of the greasy doner on a spot. We like to think our kebabs will be as popular with women as they will with men,' he said. A world away from their downmarket cousins, the pared down menu at the Clekernwell road eaterie has five kebabs on offer. They include slow cooked lamb shoulder with feta, mango pickle and fresh dill tahini yoghurt, British veal in lemon, oregano and garlic, tomatoes and fresh mine and dill tzatziki and za'atar dusted halloumi, pickled turnip, hummus and fresh mint tahini yoghurt. Za'atar dusted halloumi, pickled turnip, hummus and fresh mint tahini yoghurt (left) and chicken thigh with crumbled feta, fresh mint tahini yoghurt, chilli sauce and a salad of tomato, lettuce and red onion (right) Prices start at £5.90 for a chicken kebab and go up to £8.40 for veal and there are plans to add a lamb meatball special to the menu in the next two weeks. Diners can personalise their kebab by adding various condiments such as smoked garlic yoghurt, chilli sauces, and freshly prepared salads. Mr Green and Mr Kershaw are also working with Action Against Hunger organiser Ben Maschler and Gillian Thomson, ex head of operations at Gordon Ramsey. 'We're hoping to cater for working people who are time-poor who want really good quality food served quickly,' says Matthew Kershaw. 'And hopefully in the process we can make the kebab synonymous with eating well.'","'Premium kebab destination' Chifafa is on Clerkenwell Road, London .

"Judge Robert Dodds' (pictured) decision was severely criticised in today's appeal ruling . A mother and her 11-year-old son were separated on the orders of a judge who refused to listen to their pleas to live together, an appeal ruling found today. Three Appeal judges said the mother was wrongly denied the hope of getting her son back by the behaviour of Judge Robert Dodds in the family court in Liverpool. Judge Dodds took the decision to break up the family forever on the basis of an out-of-date report by social workers. He refused to listen to crucial facts of the case - dismissing them as ‘Victorian detail’. Instead he decided to make a final judgement about the mother and son’s future on the spot, at a court hearing that was only supposed to plot the future conduct of the case, the Appeal judges found. Judge Dodds decided to break up the family ‘within a matter of minutes’, dismissing the 11-year-old’s hopes of living with his mother. He wished the boy ‘every good luck in the world but the Children Act and the court has nothing to do with it.’ The Appeal ruling published today contained severe condemnation of Judge Dodds’ conduct of the case by three Appeal judges: Lady Justice King, Lord Justice Lewison and the most senior family judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby. Sir James said: ‘It is unhappily all too apparent that no dispassionate observer of the proceedings could think that justice was done, let alone that it was seen to be done. It was not.’ He added that ‘such a ruthlessly truncated process as the judge adopted here was fundamentally unprincipled and unfair.’ Lady Justice King said that Judge Dodds’ behaviour ‘was not only unfair to the mother but contrary to the interests of the children with whom he was concerned.’ Lord Justice Lewison added that justice could not be done ‘when a judge has apparently made up his mind before hearing argument or evidence. ‘A closed mind is incompatible with the administration of justice,’ Lord Justice Lewison said. The family that came before Judge Dodds in the brief hearing in Liverpool last August were the mother and her three children who had been taken into state care at the end of 2012. Lawyers, social workers and grandparents had agreed that two of the children, aged 14 and 10, would go to live with their grandparents. But the 11-year-old wanted desperately to live with his mother. The Appeal judgement said that the boy was academically capable and ‘overachieving’ at school. But in less than two years he had gone through 14 different placements with foster parents and his life was one of ‘continued instability, distress and fervent desire to go home.’ At one stage social workers had sent him to live with his father, a drug dealer, where the boy complained of ill treatment. He was sent back to the father, who was later charged with assaulting the boy and was in prison awaiting trial at the time of the Appeal hearing last month. Social workers had told the mother they would allow new drug tests to check her claims that she had turned her life around, and lawyers agreed the court should consider sending the boy back to her. Three appeal judges said the mother was wrongly denied the hope of getting her son back by the behaviour of Judge Robert Dodds in the family court in Liverpool (pictured) But Judge Dodds took a different view. The Appeal judges said that at the August case management hearing intended to plan future hearings, ‘within a matter of minutes the judge had made abundantly clear, in trenchant terms, his determination to conclude the case there and then by making final care orders. ‘All the parties crumbled under the judge’s caustically expressed views, and as a consequence were unable to explain to the judge that the situation was more complicated.’ They added that at one stage Judge Dodds said the mother looked ‘upset and bewildered’. The Appeal judges observed: ‘It is hard to see how she could have looked otherwise.’ Judge Dodds made care orders placing all three children under the care of Liverpool social workers despite the detailed and different plans that had been made for them. The Appeal judges set the decision aside and ordered the case should be taken over by a different judge. Sir James Munby said: ‘A parent facing the removal of their child must be allowed to put their case to the court, however seemingly forlorn. It is one of the oldest principles of our law – it goes back over 400 years – that no-one is to be condemned unheard.’ He added that the mother had a right to question social workers in court. Sir James said that while requirements that family cases involving the fate of children should take no more than 26 weeks in court were important, ‘robustness cannot trump fairness.’","Judge Robert Dodds wrongly denied mother chance of getting son back .

"Men are all sex-driven, sports fans who rarely share their feelings, while women are neurotic, gossipers who love to shop. Or at least, that what the prevailing gender stereotypes would have you believe. But a new US study suggests that in reality, men and women are more alike than most people realise. A new US study suggests that in reality, men and women are more alike than most people realise. The presumed divide, claim scientists, is caused by a tendency to focus on a few extreme differences rather than the many small similarities . The presumed divide, claim scientists, is caused by a tendency to focus on a few extreme differences rather than the many small similarities. Iowa State University came to this conclusion after analysing 100 personality characteristics reported in different studies that, in total, involved 12 million people. Their study found an almost 80 per cent overlap between men and women for more than 75 per cent of the reported psychological characteristics analysed including risk taking, stress and morality. 'This is important because it suggests that when it comes to most psychological attributes, we are relatively similar to one another as men and women,' said Zlatan Krizan, an associate professor of psychology at ISU. Iowa State University found an almost 80 per cent overlap between men and women for more than 75 per cent of the reported psychological characteristics analysed including risk taking, stress and morality . 'This was true regardless of whether we looked at cognitive domains, such as intelligence; social personality domains, such as personality traits; or at well-being, such as satisfaction with life.' The similarities were also consistent regardless of age and over time. It's a scenario that has played out between men and women for centuries. A man thinks a woman wants sex after she smiles at him. She, meanwhile, interprets his advances as acts of friendship. Now scientists say they have finally got to the bottom of why this happens - and it's all to do with how male brains have evolved to pick up on the wrong signals. A man's ability to reproduce is all about seizing every opportunity. He has to spend both money and time on attracting women, which still may not lead to sex. But it costs even more to not try, because then he won't be able to reproduce at all. 'But that's not how it works for women,' explained researcher Mons Bendixen from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). A woman can have sex with multiple men over a short period of time without producing any more children. So for men, it is a low-risk, potentially high-reward situation to have sex with women whenever the opportunity presents itself. On the other hand, the cost is potentially great for a woman if she thinks that a man is more sexually interested than she is. Professor Bendixon said that across thousands of generations, women's psychology has evolved to set the bar higher, which means they need much clearer signals than men before they consider sex. The researchers did, however, find some attributes in which there was a significant gap between men and women. For example, men were more aggressive and masculine, while women had a closer attachment to peers and were more sensitive to pain. Overall results, they say, contradict what many people think. One reason, says Professor Krizan, is the difference in extremes. The evidence researchers aggregated focuses on a typical range of characteristics, but on the far end of the spectrum the differences are often exaggerated. 'People tend to overestimate the differences because they notice the extremes,' Professor Krizan said. He used aggression as one example. 'If you look at incarceration rates to compare the aggressiveness of men and women, the fact that men constitute the vast majority of the prison population supports the idea that men are extremely more aggressive. 'However, it's a misleading estimate of how much typical men and women differ on aggressiveness, if that's the only thing you look at for comparison,' he said. People also notice multiple differences at the same, which can give the impression of a larger effect. 'The difference on any one trait is pretty small,' Professor Krizan said. 'When there are several smaller differences, people might think there's a big difference because the whole configuration has a different flavour.' Professor Krizan says some behavioural differences may be learned through social roles. Although men may be said to come from Mars and women from Venus, these findings remind us that we all come from Earth after all, he added.","Divide is caused by a tendency to focus on a few extreme differences .

"A 60-mile wide 'no drone zone' will be set up around the Super Bowl on Sunday as part of the stringent security operation. The Federal Aviation Authority is setting up flight restrictions in several circles around Phoenix, Arizona, for the big game and have threatened to prosecute those who ignore the ban. It follows a video campaign from the government agency to make sure no drones hover anywhere near the action at the University of Phoenix stadium. The Department of Homeland Security has also announced it will be scanning social media in a bid to uncover any potential threats which may arise. Scroll down for video . 'No drone zone':  The Federal Aviation Authority is believed to be setting up flight restrictions in several circles in Phoenix, Arizona, for the big game on Sunday. It includes a strict ban on unmanned aircraft . Within 10 miles of the stadium no aircraft - including media banners and blimps - will be allowed. According to the FAA a second outer ring will encompass the airspace between 10 and 30 miles from the stadium. General aviation aircraft will be able to operate there provided they have filed flight plans, are using transponders that broadcast specific information about their aircraft. No unmanned aircraft will be allowed in either ring, but Gizmodo reports that any spotted within a 60 mile radius could be in violation. Pilots have also been warned 'deadly force' could be used against them if they pose and imminent security threat. The FAA expects an additional 1,200 to 1,400 general aviation flights into the Phoenix area for Super Bowl XLIX, and has been planning for the event for more than a year. According to Nextgov Homeland Security will be using social-media tracking technology to filter bogus and real threats made online. It comes after a number of flights were grounded this week because of messages . Message: The government agency launched a video campaign  to make sure no drones hover anywhere near the action during game time . U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson met top local law enforcement officials in Phoenix on Wednesday and will visit the University of Phoenix stadium in nearby Glendale, where the Seattle Seahawks will play the New England Patriots for the National Football League championship. Ticket-holders are being told to get there early for a rigorous security screening procedure that will involve metal detectors and a pat-down search. Deadly shootings in Paris and the recent arrest of suspects in Belgium, Greece and Germany have heightened fears of more attacks around the world, and social media accounts linked to Middle East militant groups have carried a number of threats to attack high-profile U.S. events. Federal security officials have said U.S. agencies are unaware of any specific or credible terrorist threat against the Super Bowl. Johnson echoed that on Wednesday. At a news conference, NFL Chief Security Officer Jeffrey Miller said: 'Most items cannot be carried into the stadium.' Only clear plastic, vinyl or PVC bags measuring 12 inches by 6 inches by 12 inches, or 1-gallon freezer bags, will be permitted, as well as small clutch bags 'approximately the size of a hand,' he said. Coolers, backpacks, computer and camera bags, and all other kinds of luggage are prohibited, as are bottles and beverages including alcohol, camcorders, food, fireworks, Frisbees and umbrellas, according to an NFL list. Exceptions will made for medically necessary items, after an inspection at a specially designated stadium gate. 'While the level of security is high, there should only be a moderate inconvenience for our fans: a very small price to pay,' Miller said. Debora Black, chief of the Glendale Police Department, said that while most people viewed the Super Bowl as an exciting finale to the football season, others saw the event as a target. 'We are confident that we are prepared to identify and protect against any threat,' Black said. 'While the world is focused on the (Phoenix-area) Valley for this week, we have been focused on this week for over a year.' Super Bowl security officials acknowledge the NFL championship game represents a high profile target on a world stage but are unaware of any specific credible threats against Sunday's showcase. Over 4,000 private security personnel will be deployed and the almost 3,000 member Phoenix police force will be on Super Bowl duty . 'There is no specific credible threat,' said Johnson, who has appointed a 'federal coordination team' to work with local, state and federal agencies to ensure safety of fans, players and other workers associated with the Super Bowl. 'I'm confident we will have a safe and secure and successful event.' Sunday's game has been given a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) 1 rating, the same as in previous years, except for the year after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when a higher level was declared. But security will be tight and visible around Super Bowl-related events as well as during the game itself. All fans will pass through metal detectors and pat downs. Over 4,000 private security personnel will be deployed and the almost 3,000 member Phoenix police force will be on Super Bowl duty. Nuclear device sniffing teams will be deployed and a network of Bio-Watch detectors will be set up to provide a warning in the event of a biological attack. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a press release it had held special cyber-security and anti-sniper training sessions.","FAA to set up circles of flight restrictions in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sunday .

"Ask Alex Song who the best player in the world is and his answer is emphatic: 'Lionel Messi. Oh my God.' On Wednesday night, the East End welcomes the Barcelona superstar with open arms as the Boleyn Ground plays host to a mouth-watering international between Argentina and Croatia. Of course, the likelihood is that Messi won't play the full 90 minutes. But who cares? Even a brief glimpse of the great man on the green grass of Upton Park will be an unforgettable treat for the 17,000 fans expected to be in attendance. Alex Song (left) says Lionel Messi is the best player in the world, and has the hunger to win more and more . Messi practices his shooting as Argentina train at West Ham's Rush Green Stadium . Last week, Messi created history by equalling Raul's all-time European goalscoring record with a brace at Ajax. By doing so, he instantly poured scorn over bizarre comments made by Argentina's national boss Tata Martino. Martino, who lasted just one year in charge at Barcelona, voiced concern that the 27-year-old 'may never capture his best form again'. 'I don't know if we'll have the chance to see it happen,' Martino told Spanish sports daily, Marca. 'It's like when people compare Barcelona now to what they were like under Guardiola.' Admittedly, there have been doubts over Messi’s fitness. He’s played every possible minute for Barca in La Liga so far this season. Argentina's players warmed up for their behind-closed-doors game against West Ham's U21 side . And naturally, his form took a dip as he strived to get over the agony of Argentina's World Cup final defeat by Germany. But with his match-winning double in Amsterdam, he proved he is still the menacing Messi of old. He now sits proudly at the top of the queue to eclipse the Champions League feat of Real Madrid legend Raul - and one ahead of his arch-nemesis, Cristiano Ronaldo. The two will again go head-to-head at the beginning of December in their battle to land the coveted Ballon d'Or award. Victory for Messi, who was named the best player at the World Cup last summer despite Argentina's Rio heartache, would surely coronate him as the game's best ever. The Barcelona superstar listens to Argentina coach Gerardo Martino during the training session . But for Song, West Ham's on-loan midfielder from Barcelona, there is no doubt that title already belongs to his mercurial friend. 'Lionel Messi. Oh… I think this guy is fantastic. He’s the best player I have ever seen in my life,' says Song, who spent the past two seasons playing alongside the diminutive genius at the Nou Camp. 'Honestly, I’ve played with a lot of great players in my career. I was very lucky to play with players like Thierry Henry, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp... it was a privilege for me. 'And then I went to Barcelona to play with Andres Iniesta, Xavi… and, of course, Leo Messi. It’s fantastic.' West Ham’s Under 21 side saw first-hand how brilliant the great man is when Argentina played a practice game against them on Tuesday evening at the club’s Rush Green Academy base. Song contests with Messi during Arsenal's 2-1 win over Barcelona in 2011 at the Emirates . So what separates Messi from the rest? His incredible hunger and desire, according to Song. 'For me, Leo is one of the players who is just unbelievable,’ he adds. 'I see young players like Neymar who is the future best player in the world like this guy. 'But the level Messi is at is just unbelievable. Messi is up here [Song stretches his arms far and wide]… and everyone else is below. Let’s just say, it’s a very big gap. A big gap. 'The thing I like about Leo is he is so hungry. He wants to win everything. He’s won everything but still wants to win more. 'He’s a great guy. He’s a winner. The way he manages himself to try and improve himself is a great example to other players and young boys.' Song has been in good form since joining West Ham in the summer from Barcelona on loan . Song's own future is uncertain. He could return to Barcelona next summer but he is happy at West Ham, where he has shone so far this season in Sam Allardyce's side. Perhaps Song could tempt Messi to prolong his short-stay in the East End and join him in January? 'Ha... why not! It would be good.' Indeed it would. Hopefully Wednesday won't mark the last time we ever see the masterful Messi grace English soil.","Alex Song has no doubt who the best player in the world is right now .

Our daughter Abigail picked him because she thought he looked the most fun as he was running over his brothers and sisters - we should have seen the warnings. 'The worst incident for us has to be when we accidentally left his gate open and when we went upstairs he was bouncing on Abigail's bed while she was asleep and had knocked out one of her front teeth.

"In March last year, scientists believed they had glimpsed - for the first time - the rapid expansion of the universe just after the Big Bang, a theory called cosmic inflation. But since then, the Bicep2 findings have been repeatedly called in to question, with many saying they did not show what they appeared to. And now it seems the final nail has been put in the coffin, as new data is set to reveal that the initial finding was due to the effects of dust in our galaxy - and not cosmic inflation. Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang. The results have now been called into question . The latest revelations, made using data from Esa’s Planck satellite, are set to be unveiled in a paper early next week. However, according to the BBC, a summary of the paper was briefly posted on the French Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) website, before being pulled. ‘Once the ""galactic emission"" [dust] is correctly subtracted, there still remains an excess [signal] but it is at present too weak to be considered a detection and could be the result of [experimental error],’ the summary has been quoted as saying. A telescope at the south pole, called Bicep2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. The instrument examines what is called the cosmic microwave background, the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe. The background radiation is not precisely uniform. Like light, the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space. Computer models predicted a curl pattern in the radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe's inflation. It did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This is radiation that was created in the Big Bang and originally discovered in 1964. Bicep2 measured the large-scale polarisation of this microwave radiation. Only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern, and only if they have been amplified by inflation. The latest findings are not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that Bicep2 was correct. The initial results were made using an extremely sensitive detector on an Antarctic telescope. The team thought they had found a polarisation of light that would have proved the theory of cosmic inflation. To make sure the signal they were detecting was correct, the team subtracted the lensing effect of massive galaxies. But at the time, some scientists said the team had not correctly accounted for interstellar dust in our galaxy. And now, using data from the Planck satellite, which characterised dust in the galaxy, it seems this fear has been confirmed. For their initial research, the Bicep2 astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the South Pole, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the observations. Their research centered on a theory by Albert Einstein when something very explosive happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. The very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave background radiation - the afterglow of the Big Bang - as they pass through space. The latest findings are not entirely a surprise - but will still be a disappointment for anyone holding out hope that Bicep2 was correct. For their research, astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the South Pole, shown, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the observations . The incredible find was soon dismissed by other research groups who thought the Harvard Bicep team in may have underestimated the effects of dust in the galaxy. Now, that explanation has been given more credit following a recent study by Esa's Planck satellite (shown) The theory suggests that this initial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble. Earlier this year experts believed they had seen these gravitational waves and hailed the experiment as a massive step forward - but admitted the theory needed more work. 'It's just unbelievable quite honestly,' Professor Peter Ade, who helped build the instrument that detected the waves, told MailOnline at the time. 'This is confirming what is, to me, a wacky idea.' These observations have eluded scientists for decades because it’s difficult to separate the characteristic swirl of light created by gravitational waves, and the dust generated today by the Milky Way. The Bicep team hoped to overcome this by looking at cleanest part of the sky, over Antarctica. But they didn't use dust data compiled by Europe's Planck satellite, which had mapped the sky at many more frequencies than other satellites.","European scientists are to reveal the Bicep2 results were wrong .
In March 2014 scientists said Bicep2 had proved cosmic inflation .

"Sir Jay Tidmarsh (right) and Taunton School Chair of Governors Jane Barrie with the 65 years overdue library book . A former pupil has managed to duck out of paying a £2,837 fine owed after returning a school book 65 years overdue - but has given the school a generous £1,500 donation for their troubles. Sir Jay Tidmarsh came across the long-forgotten copy of 'Ashenden' by W. Somerset Maughan as he was clearing out his shelves. The 82 year-old former businessman opened the cover and spotted the stamp of his old school inside. He had taken it out in 1950 when he was a pupil at Taunton School in Somerset and forgotten to return it. Sir Jay, who was the Lord Lieutenant of Bristol between 1996 and 2007, decided to send it back - together with a £1,500 donation to the school library. But, despite his generous donation, Sir Jay may have short changed the school - with the fine totalling around £2,847 for the 65 years. Sir Jay, from Bristol, said: 'I don't know why but I just happened to open the front cover and was shocked to see ""Property of Taunton School"" printed inside. 'I thought I should do the decent thing and return the book - paying my dues at the same time.' Sir Jay and his wife Lady Virginia made a special trip back to the £33,000-a-year school with the book where they were given a lunch in their honour hosted by Chair of Governors Jane Barrie.

"It could be the ultimate ocean going retreat - with a 'party deck' hull specially designed to keep your martini safe at all times. Rather than a sleek yacht, Lockheed Martin is hoping someone will instead prefer an experimental navy vessel built to endure travel through rough seas at high speed. The experimental boat can remain stable and travel at high speeds in waves upto twelve feet high - although its triple deck bunk beds do leave it in need of a little interior design.

But he quickly decides it's not something he wants to be close to. YouTube user ponygirl5100 says after she filmed Bandit in action she put her trumpet away and reassured him that it was okay.

"Bill Montag, the father of reality star Heidi Montag, was arrested in Colorado Thursday night and charged with sexual abuse. Montag, 67, was picked up in Aspen on a a failure to appear charge, those charges being three counts of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust, and one charge of aggravated incest, with records claiming the abuse lasted four years. The victim says the abuse began in 1993 and lasted until 1998. Montag has 'denied it all,' authorities, who say they have been investigating the case since June, revealed. Scroll down for video . Bill Montag (above), the father of reality star Heidi Montag, was arrested in Colorado Thursday night and charged with sexual abuse and incest . Father and daughter were shown walking down the aisle together at Heidi's wedding to Spencer Pratt on the Hills . According to NBC 9, 'Due to the statute of limitations, Montag is only eligible to be charged with crimes that occurred after July 1st, 1996, when the victim would have been 16 years old.' The victim said she is coming forward after all these years to protect other possible victims and young girls. Sources close to Heidi however claim that the woman 'is determined to destroy the family,' and had previously stalked her and husband Spencer Pratt. TMZ reports Heidi is also certain her father will be exonerated. If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of four to 12 years and a fine of up to $750,000. The victim claims the abuse ended when the she rebuffed Montag one night after he crawled into bed with her and pulled down her underwear to have sexual intercourse with her. 'Get the hell out of my room,' said the victim, to which Montag responded; 'I thought that's what you wanted. I thought you loved me the way I love you.' The victim who, given the time frame, could not have been Heidi or her sister Holly, says that Montag also performed oral sex on her and would insert a vibrator into her vagina. The victim says the abuse happened approximately 50 times. A source claims that Heidi does not believe the charges brought against her father are true . Bill married Terri O'Hara (above) after splitting from Heidi and Holly's mother Darlene . Holly and Heidi were together in September for Holly's wedding . Montag divorce Heidi's mother, Darlene Egelhoff, in 1990, and both went on to remarry, Bill to Terri O’Hara. He appeared on The Hills when Heidi married Spencer Pratt, and even walked his daughter down the aisle. The family also suffered some tragedy in 2008 when Eric O'Hara, Terri's son, diedafter falling from an icy roof. Montag was also at Holly's wedding this past September in Colorado, sharing the first dance with his daughter as she married Richie Wilson. Holly is also pregnant with her first child she recently announced. Montag works as a ski instructor in Aspen these days according to his Facebook . Heidi made sure her father gave his blessing to Spencer when he asked for her hand in marriage . The strained relationship between Heidi and her father was a big part of the show around the wedding, and in 2010 Montag gave an interview to Radar Online about his daughter, calling her out for not visiting him or reaching out as he was being treated for a bacterial infection. There was also tension on The Hills when Heidi told Spencer he would need to ask her father if he wanted to marry her, with Spencer very much intimidated by Montag. The two seem to be on better terms these days however. Montag currently works as a ski instructor and coach at Aspen Valley Ski and Snowboard Club according to his Facebook page - a job that does involve him teaching youth skiing. The organization’s executive director Mark Cole told The Aspen Times, 'I was not aware of this until the police department showed up at my office in the late afternoon.' Cole also told parents of children in the program; 'The alleged incident does not involve anyone under his care at AVSC or the Aspen area. The investigation is ongoing and we are cooperating with authorities every step of the way. We will keep you informed as the situation unfolds.'","Bill Montag was arrested Thursday night in Aspen, Colorado on charges of sexual abuse and incest .

"Britain is expected to be named the fastest-growing major economy in the developed world last year after outpacing the United States. Gross domestic product – the total size of the economy – increased by 2.6 per cent in 2014, the UK's best performance since 2007. Figures published yesterday in Washington showed the US economy grew by 2.4 per cent. The other G7 nations – Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy – have yet to announce their figures for last year, but are also expected to lag behind the UK. The figures, as well as a separate report by the market research group GfK that showed a sharp rise in consumer confidence, are a boost for the Government with less than 100 days to go to the general election in May. Prosperous: The news that Britain has outperformed all other G7 countries economically will be great news to Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Danny Alexander (right), chief secretary to the Treasury . The International Monetary Fund expects Canada's economy to have grown by 2.4 per cent last year, Germany's by 1.5 per cent, France's by 0.4 per cent and Japan's by 0.1 per cent. Output in Italy is estimated to have fallen by 0.4 per cent. Danny Alexander, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Britain was in 'pole position'. However, both the US and UK economies slowed at the end of last year and America is expected to overtake Britain this year. The US economy grew by 0.65 per cent between October and December, compared with expansion of 1.25 per cent in the previous three months. Growth in the UK slowed from 0.7 per cent to 0.5 per cent. The IMF expects the US economy to grow by 3.6 per cent this year – much faster than the 2.7 per cent pencilled in for Britain. But experts predicted that cheaper petrol and low interest rates will stimulate the economy this year. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank, said: 'The underlying story is one of the UK gradually consigning the financial crisis to history. 'Growth should accelerate again as the boost from oil and cheaper credit keeps retailers' tills ringing while the manufacturing cycle turns up again. We look for UK growth to accelerate to 3.2 per cent in 2015.' He added: 'There are many possible pitfalls ahead, but then there always are. Whatever ones remain are less serious than those the UK has already overcome. The Government still needs to cut borrowing but that will be easier now the economy is healthier. 'Political uncertainty provides big risks, but we expect a Conservative-led stable government to emerge from May's general election.' Leading the way: Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (pictured) said Britain is in 'pole position' after it was announced the country's GDP grew by 2.6 per cent in 2014 . The buoyant outlook in Britain is in sharp contrast to the crisis-torn eurozone, which is feared to be heading for prolonged deflation. The official statistics agency Eurostat said yesterday that inflation across the region fell from -0.2 per cent in December to a joint record low of -0.6 per cent in January. The slump in living costs was driven by an 8.9 per cent slide in energy prices on the back of falls in the oil market. Crude has dropped below $49 a barrel, compared with $115 last summer, cutting the price of essentials from petrol to heating. Although falling prices ease pressure on household finances, and can in turn boost spending, deflation can cripple economies by making debts harder to pay. It can also lead to businesses and households putting off spending as they wait for prices to fall further, hitting investment, profits, wages and jobs. A second report from Eurostat yesterday showed the jobless rate in the single currency bloc dipped from 11.5 per cent in November to 11.4 per cent in December. This is the lowest rate since August 2012, but still well above 5.8 per cent unemployment in the UK. Risky business: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' (pictured) government voted last Sunday to cancel  scaleing down planned budget surpluses required to pay down Greece's massive national debt . Germany and Greece drew battle lines last night in a spiralling row over the repayment of massive bailout loans. Berlin said the demands of Alexis Tsipras's new far-Left Greek government for some of its debts to be written off were 'divorced from reality'. But Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis replied that the government would no longer engage with officials representing the country's despised 'troika' of lenders – the European Commission, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. Instead, the new government – which swept to power last weekend on a promise of ending years of austerity – would talk directly to other EU leaders to try to write off more than half of Greece's £179 billion in rescue loans.","The total size of Britain's economy (GDP) increased by 2.6 per cent last year .

Chase Loney, 3, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, was with his parents last August when he was attacked in his neighbors' living room.

"A woman is charged with suffocating her fiance's daughter to death after he found racy texts on her phone and ended the relationship, a court heard. Melinda Muniz, now 26, is charged with killing three-year-old Grace Ford on January 9, 2014 - hours after Grace's father, an Iraq War veteran, told her to move out of their Plano, Texas, apartment. Grace, who also suffered severe injuries to her genitalia, died when she was taken off life support three days later in hospital. This week a jury heard Muniz told police she was raped and knocked unconscious by an intruder who taped Grace's mouth shut. However, after tests refuted her story, Muniz claimed she had amnesia and could not remember the past two years, Star Local Media reported. Murder trial: Melinda Muniz, 26, (left) is charged with killing her fiancé's three-year-old daughter Grace (right) In a third interview, prosecutors say, Muniz said Grace put duct tape over her mouth so Muniz panicked and knocked herself unconscious with a pan. She then said that she noticed Grace had tape over her mouth, pulled it off, saw she was unconscious, put it back on, and knocked herself out. She said she 'didn't know' if it was an accident or intentional, the court heard. An investigation has since revealed Muniz was allegedly seen purchasing duct tape and zip wires hours before Grace was found lifeless on her bed with tape over her mouth and wires around the room, though Muniz claimed these were arts and crafts materials. Searches for 'duct tape' and 'kill' were also found on a MacBook recovered from the property Muniz shared with Grace and then-fiance Mitch Ford, the jury heard. Muniz, who acted as caretaker for Grace since father Mitch Ford won full custody in 2013, faces life in prison without parole if found guilty. The couple met in September 2012, a year and a half after Grace was born. He gained full custody from his ex-wife Emily Reeves Ward, who became addicted to alcohol and prescription pills after he returned from his second Iraq war and their relationship broke down. Ford said he proposed to Muniz in December 2013 but ended the relationship on January 9, the morning after he saw she had texted pictures of her in underwear to her personal trainer. Horrific: Grace was found face-down on the bed, lifeless, with duct tape over her mouth . Babysat: Grace, pictured with her mother Emily Ward, was being babysat by Muniz when she died . He told the court: 'As I was getting ready for work, I let her know I found that stuff on her phone,' he testified. 'It wasn't a big argument or anything. I said it wasn't going to work and called off the engagement. She was kind of unemotional, like it wasn't really a big deal. 'There wasn't a fight. I provided everything for her. I told her she had a week [to move out]. She could keep the engagement ring and sell it and keep the car to drive around and look for jobs. She didn't cry, didn't appear angry.' The murder trial, which opened on Tuesday, has also heard evidence from the first emergency officers to reach the scene of the crime - who testified that Muniz appeared to be pretending to be unconscious. 'She took a big breath and kind of gently fell to the floor as if she had fainted,' Officer Camille Bowie said. 'Her eyes were kind of fluttering, like she was trying to keep them shut forcefully. There's no movement in the eyes and body when someone faints – if you really faint, you're not going to gently place yourself. I felt like it wasn't genuine.' Ford told the court he contacted police after his phone call with Muniz was cut short. He said he was at work, Muniz phoned to say she had just got home with Grace, and the phone seemingly fell to the floor. He arrived at the apartment at the same time as the officers. Muniz was lying on her front with her underwear around her ankles. Grace was in a bedroom on her front and remained unresponsive as she was taken to ER at The Medical Center of Plano. She was given a dose of epinephrine which started her heart, then doctors noticed bruising and blood around her vaginal area. 'I believed Grace had been sexually assaulted,' Dr Richard Honaker testified. Stories: Muniz gave three different accounts of what happened before saying she doesn't know if Grace's death was an accident or intentional . Deborah Davis, the health practitioner who examined Muniz for evidence of sexual assault, said: 'Other than her verbalizing, I saw nothing to indicate any sexual assault. The defendant didn't seem emotional, was pretty quiet and very cooperative.' Muniz said she had purchased duct tape, scissors, zip ties and cotton swabs from Dollar Tree for an arts and crafts project. As she began cleaning, she said Grace must have gotten scared, thinking Muniz was about to vacuum, so she ran to her bedroom and taped her mouth. Muniz explained that she donned gloves and partially removed the duct tape from Grace's mouth to see if she was OK. When it was clear Grace wasn't breathing, she panicked and put the tape back on. Then, as Grace lay unconscious, she gathered the scissors, zip ties and duct tape and disposed of it in a Dumpster across the parking lot, she said. In a recorded interview with Muniz, played to the jury, Detective Chris Jones said: 'I'm going to be straight-up honest with you: There are issues with your story. You brought up that Grace had duct tape on her when that was never mentioned. How did you know if you were unconscious?' He added that the time frame was unrealistic, saying the six minutes between the 911 call and authorities' arrival was 'not realistic' for an intruder to physically and sexually assault two people. Muniz is due to testify on Monday.","Melinda Muniz, charged with killing fiancé's daughter Grace Ford, 3 .

"A person claiming to be accused Tinder murderer Gable Tostee has taken to a bodybuilding forum to give dating tips.

Under the username 'G T', they responded to the forum post created by another user who was seeking advice on how to get an older women. The man asks for help to come up with a response after  the women's last message to him was: 'You are a cutie but what can you offer me at your age?' through the online dating site Plenty of Fish. 'I have been trying to come up with a response, but her ""cutie"" remark has me feeling negged [sic],' the man wrote on the forum. 'For 39 years old (Probably 2-3 years older). I think she is a solid 7-7.5 [out of 10].' In response to the post,  'G T' suggests the man should say to the women: 'I can do things to you that will make you feel 21.' Scroll down for video . Under the username of 'G T', a person on a bodybuilding forum has posted a dating tip in response to a thread . Gable Tostee was charged with the murder of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright who fell 14 storeys . This isn't the first time ' G T' has reached out on the bodybuilding forum. Tostee was released under strict bail conditions  to live with his parents in Carrara, keep off Tinder and Facebook, not allowed to drink alcohol and adhere to a nightly curfew. It comes just over a month after a person who claimed they were Tostee took to the bodybuilding forum to defend the 28-year-old over the death of Wright after they met on online dating app Tinder. Under the username of 'G T', the person defended Tostee, saying there have been many 'misconceptions and untruths' that have been circulating in the media and the public about his involvement. They also posted several pictures claiming to be from inside Tostee's apartment. One of the photographs show a tanning machine he owns on the Avalon Apartments balcony on Orchid Avenue, which has spectacular views over Surfers Paradise. GT added he had been left distraught after Ms Wright's death and believed his silence on the topic had done more harm than good. Tostee is accused of throwing Warriena Wright off his apartment balcony on the Gold Coast in August . Ms Wright was a bank clerk and had travelled to Australia for a friend's wedding when she died . 'Knowing I was the last person to be with her, it has left me permanently scarred and not a day passes that I don't wish I could go back in time and prevent it,' GT wrote. 'For at least a week after it happened I was so overwhelmed I was unable to laugh or even crack a smile. 'I broke down in tears several times a day, or whenever I saw her picture in the news. 'Even though I had only known her for a night I was horrified that this had happened to her. I would never wish for it to happen to anybody.' GT said he sympathised with Ms Wright's family and it pained him to think of them. 'While I have not had the chance to meet or speak to Warriena's family, it pains me to think of the loss and suffering they must be experiencing,' he wrote. Along with the posts, GT posted photos of what is believed to be Tostee's balcony overlooking Surfers Paradise . Tostee's case is set to be mentioned in January after he was released on strict bail conditions in November . The Avalon Apartments is where Ms Wright fell to her death in August from the 14th floor . GT also slammed news outlets for the coverage of the case, describing it as 'disgraceful'. 'They have no respect for the dignity of the people involved,' he said. 'A young woman had died and they needed a villain. My silence only fuelled peoples' imagination, and the media did everything they could to exploit that, including lying and misleading. 'They did everything they could to establish me as an evil monster, a portrayal which could not be further from the truth.' Tostee has always maintained his innocence in Wright's death and was released from custody in November . Queensland police have told news.com.au they knew of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was in fact Tostee. But Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said: 'It does not appear to be a breach of any bail condition.' If GT is in fact Tostee, this would not be the first time he has reached out on social media. During his time in custody, the 28-year-old posted a message to family and friends on Facebook - including an address for them to post letters to him. 'To all my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all,' he wrote from jail. 'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone. 'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' Queensland police say this post would not breach his bail conditions imposed by the court . If GT is in fact Tostee, it is not the first time he has used social media to maintain his innocence . Tostee appeared in court on the Gold Coast on January 12 and applied for a committal mention to be adjourned to March 13. On the night of August 8, Tostee allegedly made an audio recording during the time he spent with Wright leading up to her death. Police alleged the three-hour file allegedly revealed the pair partook in drunk and violent sexual acts before he locked her on the balcony outside. It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered a pizza within an hour of her death. The recording also includes audio from a phone conversation between Tostee and his father, believed to have been made just after Wright fell 14 storeys to her death. Tostee was arrested after police obtained the recordings on August 15. Tostee's murder trial is unlikely to proceed before late 2016 to early 2017.

During a talk with Dr Phil (right) on his show, Romina said that a boyfriend risking jail time over domestic abuse charges was a sign of love and that 'not anyone is just going to go to jail for you' Romina, of Las Vegas, Nevada, added: 'I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you, like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does, stay with him. '[He] loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police. 'He's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be. 'He's risking all of that for you.' During her appearance on the show, Romina told Dr Phil she suffered a backlash after posting the video and that she is misunderstood. She mentioned she received messages of support and understanding as well and feels she is a role model for her 153,000 fans and followers. Dr Phil questioned her belief that a boyfriend risking jail time over abuse charges was a positive. He said: 'Your theory is that because they're willing to put themselves at risk of going to jail, paying fines, whatever, that you must mean an awful lot to them, or they wouldn't put themselves in harm's way for you and therefore, you must really be loved?' She replied: 'Exactly. Not anyone is just going to go to jail for you. 'You know, they're investing time and money, and it's just a lot. So, like, he must really care. 'I really do believe that.' The video was met with  criticism online (pictured) and Romina told Dr Phil that she felt misunderstood . After he let Romina have her say and defend her reasoning, Dr Phil told the teen: 'Your logic is flawed at so many levels.' He continued: 'I am very concerned that the idiotic message that you're putting out there could cause an innocent young girl to put herself in harm's way following that logic and get herself hurt. 'I think what you're saying is irresponsible. I think it is ridiculous. Somebody needs to tell you straight up what's wrong with what you're saying.' Dr Phil isn't the only one who is critical of Romina's message. The 'Unfollow And Destroy Romina Garcia' page was created on Facebook for the purpose of exposing Romina and 'her awful posts and statuses'. Following Romina's appearance on the show, the page creator wrote: 'Not only is what she's saying dangerous, but it's completely disgusting that she thinks domestic violence is a joke and a way to get attention. 'Let's stop her and the violence against young women all together.' Another user wrote that Romina was more affected by appearing on the show than she let on: . 'Romina honey without sounding rude you need to understand that someone hitting you doesn't mean they love you. 'Your eyes showed u know this is wrong by the tears u were holding in. 'I truly hope u see a different side now u have heard how wrong this is from millions of people.' The full transcript of the shocking video uploaded by Romina Garcia on her Facebook page. Okay you guys, I wanted to address something, mainly with you girls, about your boyfriend or the guy you're talking to and I just wanted to say that if your boyfriend or the guy that you're with puts his hands on you like he hits you or beats you up or whatever he does. Stay with him. That n***** f****** loves you because he's risking for you to press charges on him, he is risking for you know, you calling the police or you know, he - he's gonna do time or he's gonna have to pay money to get out of jail or whatever the case may be, he's risking all of that for you. So that n***** f****** loves you! And you need to get on your f****** knees and just pray and hope that he doesn't give you another black-eye or he doesn't kill you. Because honestly, like, a guy that's willing to do that for a girl, it's - I mean, it's amazing, like, not many guys you have out there care enough for the girls to do that. But the guys that do that they're the real like the real ass n***** and you - you girls need to appreciate it. And you know the other day my boyfriend gave me a black-eye, it was my fault, like, he didn't mean - I mean he, he - he was going to hit me but like I moved, so he got my eye. 'Like, he hit me in my eye whatever, he gave me a black-eye. But I'm wearing make-up right now so you can't tell but it's on this eye. I was going to go out somewhere today so he took me to get my make-up done because he didn't want people seeing me with him, you know, because I had a black-eye, they were gonna be like 'what f***', you know. 'Or whatever, he just didn't like that or whatever. So I went to go get my makeup done but the fact that he put his hands on me means a lot to me because that shows me how he cares. 'And as you asked like he hit me, like, after I realized how stupid I was, how I could have avoided everything, I got on my knees and I begged him like please 'do not leave me', like, I am so sorry for what I, you know, for what I did. 'Like, you gave me an order and I didn't follow it and now I know not to disrespect you, not to talk back, if he gives me an order to follow it and I know you b*****s are gonna be like, well where's your proof, well you know well my proof of like my black-eye, I took a picture of it, it's on my Instagram and my Instagram is romina-kdashian so you can always follow me on there.

"A remarkable video has emerged purporting to show Islamic State militants chatting casually with a group of Turkish border guards near the besieged Syrian city of Kobane. The amateur footage, understood to have been filmed close to Zarova Hill in the outskirts of Kobane, raises serious questions about the apparently relaxed relationship between the terror group and officials from the Nato member state. It appears to show two heavily armed militants wandering nonchalantly up to the Turkish border fence - displaying shocking bravado as they smile and wave at the camera. They are met by what appears to be a military vehicle full of  security officials who, despite carrying weapons themselves, do little more than break into conversation with the jihadis, who eventually wander off back into Syria while shouting 'Allahu Akbar'. Scroll down for video . Militants: The two heavily armed Islamic State jihadis wander nonchalantly up to the Turkish border fence - displaying shocking bravado as they smile and wave at the camera . Conversation: The video shows Islamic State militants chatting casually with a group of Turkish border guards near the besieged Syrian city of Kobane . The video was uploaded to YouTube yesterday but is understood to have been filmed on October 22. The footage has not been independently verified. The clip begins with the two apparent jihadists lighting fires near a group of cars, which are believed to have been abandoned by desperate Kurdish families who fled Kobane in recent weeks when ISIS militants stepped up their attacks on the city. After appearing to realise they are being filmed from inside Turkey, the pair start walking towards the border fence, stopping only to mockingly wave at the amateur filmmaker. As they reach the border fence, an armoured military vehicle belonging to Turkish border guards speeds up to meet them. Heavily armed officials jump out the back of the car and - after briefly talking on their radios, simply engage the men in conversation. At one point the situation appears tense and a border guard scampers towards the militants with his gun briefly raised, but he stops seconds later and also begins talking to the men. After several minutes chatting, the militants wander off, defiantly raising their index finger to the sky to represent jihadism while  chanting 'Allahu Akbar' - a phrase that translates as 'God is the greatest'.

Bravado: After several minutes chatting, the militants wander off, defiantly raising their index finger to the sky to represent jihadism while chanting 'Allahu Akbar' - a phrase that translates as 'God is the greatest' The shocking video raises yet more questions of Ankara's commitment to defeating the terror group. Just over a week ago militants shot and wounded a senior Syrian rebel commander Abu Issa in a bungled kidnapping in the southeastern Turkish town of Urfa. Previously Ankara drew a great deal of international criticism for refusing to intervene to help Kurdish fighters battling militants just 200 yards over the border in Kobane. There are also serious questions over why Turkey has allowed thousands of Western jihadists - who enter the country on budget airlines in tourist resorts - to easily pass over the border into Syria to join ISIS fighters there. Turkey has long argued that ISIS does not have a presence in the country. Others claim small cells are able to operate in southern Turkish towns, easily popping over the border to fight in Syria before returning home to Turkey. There are even claims from those on the ground that wounded ISIS militants are routinely smuggled from the frontline to receive treatment in Turkish hospitals, which are better equipped and less-stretched than those in northern Syria. Turkey has also been accused of allowing up to 3,000 detained Western jihadists to rejoin the Islamic State in Syria in return for the release 49 diplomats who had been held prisoner by the terrorists.

The photograph was taken from over the border in Turkey, with a Turkish farmer continuing to go about his business in the foreground . Experts believe Turkey's reluctance to fully commit to the fight against ISIS is two-fold. Firstly the brave Kurdish fighters battling ISIS in northern Syria have links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party - a group long-banned in Turkey amid accusations of terrorism. Secondly, due to Turkey sharing borders with both Syria and Iraq, Ankara is understood to be worried that any move against ISIS could trigger a wave a car and suicide bombings there - something that would be devastating for the country's hugely important tourism industry. The video emerged as dozens of Kurdish peshmerga fighters left northern Iraq on their way to Turkey, from where they will continue their journey to help Syrian Kurds battling ISIS in Kobane. According to spokesman Halgurd Hekmat, a total of 150 peshmerga fighters left from the city of Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. He gave no further details. Last week, the local Iraqi Kurdish government authorised the peshmerga forces to go to neighbouring Syria and help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in Kobane. Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane said last week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria.

Kurdish peshmerga leave Iraq this morning on their way to fight ISIS in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane . A Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighter flashes the V-for-victory sign as he joins dozens of comrades leaving a base in northern Iraq on their way the battleground Syrian city Kobane . The unprecedented deployment will provide much-needed boots on the ground in Kobane, although it is not clear whether the fighters will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact. This afternoon, a large peshmerga convoy with heavy weapons was seen in Irbil, driving toward the Iraqi Kurdish area of Dohuk. The fighters themselves left separately, travelling by plane. Idriss Nassan, a Kurdish official from Kobane, said they have no confirmation that peshmerga fighters are to arrive today. 'We have no information other than what we are reading on social media or hearing on the news.' He added that the peshmerga command might have direct contact with the Syrian Kurdish force known as the Peoples' Protection Units, or YPG, and for that reason Kurdish politicians in Syria are not aware of the movement. The Islamic State group launched its offensive on Kobane and nearby villages in mid-September in battles that have killed more than 800 people, according to activists. The extremists captured dozens of Kurdish villages around Kobane and now also control parts of the town. The battles also made more than 200,000 people flee for safety across the border into Turkey.","Amateur footage shows militants casually wandering up to Turkish border .

"Every frontline police officer should be offered a Taser to help fight the threat from lone-wolf terrorists, a police leader declared yesterday. Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made the move necessary. ‘The terrorist ideal to get attention no longer relies on an attack being in a place of note,’ he said. ‘It could be in Cheam high street, in any town, in any part of the UK. We know there are more dangerous people out there, preparing to attack police officers and we need to be able to respond to that threat.’ Steve White, who chairs the Police Federation, said evidence of plans to murder officers made it necessary for every frontline officer to be offered a taser . Leaders of the Police Federation are set to vote next month about whether every uniformed officer should be offered training in the use of a Taser . The terrorist threat level for police was raised to severe two weeks ago in the wake of the Paris atrocity and a foiled assault on officers in Belgium. Since then, police chiefs and junior officers have been considering how to counter the extra dangers. Last December, a threat was made to kidnap and kill a policeman in the West Midlands. Officers were given extra security briefings and urged not to travel to work in uniform. Leaders of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, will vote next month on a proposal that every uniformed frontline officer should be offered training in the use of Tasers, though some may choose not to carry them. The weapons, which carry an electric current of up to 50,000 volts to incapacitate dangerous suspects, have been linked to at least ten deaths in England and Wales over the past decade. Some senior officers are believed to support the idea in theory, but one police leader said chief constables would be mostly opposed. The police chief, speaking anonymously, told the Guardian: ‘The idea of arming every police officer with a Taser is alien to 200 years of police culture. It is a stepping stone to arming the police – something strapped to your hip that looks like a firearm is a huge shift in what we stand for.’","Calls for every police officer to be offered a Taser to fight terrorist threat .

"Consumers are mistakenly buying cheese made from imported milk because of confusing labelling, the Environment Secretary is warning. Elizabeth Truss said current rules meant shoppers could be misled into believing they are supporting farmers in this country by choosing dairy products made from British milk. In fact, cheap milk is often brought in from other countries and simply processed here. EU rules are allowing cheap-skate manufacturers to import cut price foreign milk before processing it into cheese in this country, then labelling it with a Union Jack giving the impression it is a British product . Miss Truss said she was demanding a change to EU rules which allow Union Jacks and other branding suggesting products are homegrown to be displayed on such products. ‘People place a premium on buying British food, but at the moment you can’t always be sure the cheddar you’re buying is made from British milk – even if it looks like it was,’ the Cabinet minister said. ‘That’s why I want to introduce better country of origin labelling for dairy products so people can be reassured that when they buy British cheese it’s made from British milk. ‘I want to see more British dairy products on our shelves. We currently import two-thirds of our cheese, much of it Cheddar that could be produced here.’ Farmers have complained about Lidl’s Valley Spire cheese – saying both British and imported cheeses are packaged with the same branding and sold at the same price. Another widely-sold product, with the British-sounding name Pilgrim’s Choice, is made from milk produced in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said the rules were confusing consumers and is calling for a change in the law . Britain has had a voluntary industry scheme for labelling since 2010. But at the moment there are no mandatory country of origin rules, and only around two thirds of milk, cream, butter and cheese products are produced in compliance with the voluntary code. The Environment Secretary has had meetings with EU Commissioners to press for a change to labelling rules. A Brussels report is due to be produced within months on a change in the law. The Government is also encouraging firms to volunteer the origin of the liquid milk used in dairy products so consumers are being given clear information about where a product originates. Britain’s dairy industry is in desperate need of consumer support, with dozens of farmers quitting the industry each month. Milk prices around the world have fallen by more than 50 per cent over the past 12 months, as producers in the US and New Zealand have been ramping up production. In the UK, the big supermarkets have launched a price war, which has led to the price of a four-pint carton of milk tumbling from around £1.39 to £1 in Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Stores insist that recent price cuts do not affect the price they pay farmers. The National Farmers Union says the number of dairy farmers had dipped below 10,000 for the first time, a 50 per cent fall since 2002. It forecasts that fewer than 5,000 dairy farmers could be left in the UK by 2025, if current rates of decline continue. The union said: ‘It should be easy for the consumer to identify and buy British cheese made with assured British milk.’ The National Farmers Union says the number of dairy farmers had dipped below 10,000 for the first time, a 50 per cent fall since 2002.

Last August, Ms Wolfe revealed on the Today Show that she and her partner, NBC News foreign correspondent Stephanie Gosk,41, are expecting a second child - a baby girl. The couple's first child, Harper Estelle Wolfeld Gosk, was born on August 21, 2013. Earlier this week, Ms Wolfe and NBC News journalist Jeff Rossen posed for a picture to celebrate the end of their fitness challenge, in which she helped her colleague get over his hatred of working out. Ms Wolfe, who is also a NBC News national correspondent, has remained active throughout her entire pregnancy.

"The French government has been ridiculed for producing a poster that is supposed to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign. They claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by Islamist fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports, rejecting members of their family and changing eating habits. The poster was launched as part of a new £320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in early January, when 17 innocent people were killed over three days. But the attempt to inform the public backfired, with many ridiculing it for some of the suggestions made in the Stop Jihadism poster. Scroll down for video . Warning: the French government infographic offers nine telltale signs to worried parents . On Twitter, one user wrote: 'The government invites you to be wary of those who do not eat baguettes.' And another added: 'French parents: if your kids stop eating baguette they're basically halfway to jihad.' The ad is titled: 'Jihadist radicalisation - the first warning signs.' The poster has a total of nine pictograms, with the crossed-out baguette featuring the caption: 'They're changing their eating habits'. A figure of a swimmer with a cross is superimposed with the phrase: 'They're stopping sports.' The ad provides a hotline to call to identify people suspected of radicalisation to the authorities. Other advice offered is more obvious, with people being told to be aware if their friends or family are visiting extremist websites or social media accounts, becoming removed from old friends as they now consider them 'impure' and stopping listening to popular music. A change in wardrobe towards more traditional Islamic garments, quitting school or work and stopping watching television are other warning signs that are flagged up. Part of the campaign reads: 'To recruit teens and young adults, boys and girls, terrorist groups are also using real technical mental manipulation. It is this strategy that can resemble recruitment to a form of sectarian indoctrination. 'These manipulation techniques aim to get these young people to gradually reject their environment to isolate them, put them under the authority of the radical discourse and convince them.'

"A UFO that resembled a flying horse has been spotted close to one of Mexico's most active volcanoes. The dark object appeared to have two legs and was seen hovering into view out of nowhere as volcano Colima, 300 miles west of Mexico City, spewed out smoke. Captured on webcam after Colima erupted this week, the enigmatic 'equine' vanished moments later. Scroll down for video . Mexican authorities are investigating after a UFO was spotted close to erupting volcano Colima - situated between the western Mexican states of Colima and Jalisco . Witness Loyola Quintanilla Rosas, 24, said: 'When I first saw it, I thought it looked like a horse. 'It had a very large body and seemed to be an animal. It had a thin top, a bulging middle and two extremities at the bottom. 'But the legs weren't moving so it clearly wasn't a modern-day Pegasus.' 'And it sure as hell wasn't a bird,' Loyola added. UFO hunters have said they think it could be an alien vessel and made reference to previous sightings at volcanic eruptions in Mexico. In 2012, a 'cigar-shaped' object was filmed flying inside Popocatepetl volcano in central Mexico by a television camera crew. And last November, a 'blurry, white object' was caught on camera flying around the same volcano. The dark horse-shaped object appeared to have two legs and was seen coming into view out of nowhere before quickly disappearing . The unidentified object was captured on webcam and posted on Twitter . A witness, Loyola Quintanilla Rosas, said the object at first looked like a horse with a big body- adding, 'It sure as hell wasn't a bird' Alien enthusiast Eufrasio Gonzales Carrasco, 35, said: 'There has been a fair bit of activity around these volcanoes and this latest sighting just adds to the mystery. 'There must be something about volcanoes that draws extra-terrestrials to them. Perhaps they are collecting samples from our planet to take back home.'

"Caught: 33-year-old Walter Ruck was found by Oregon police in the middle of assaulting a woman . Workers at a Nevada telemarketing call center ended up saving a woman's life after hearing screams as she was being attacked on the other end of the phone. Tina Garcia of Americare Health and Nutrition in Las Vegas was making a call as part of her job, but when the phone was answered she heard the most shocking noises down the line. She called one of her co-workers over to listen across the call to hear the woman screaming for her life and yelling 'please don't kill me.' 'She said, 'I don't think this is a joke. Something's happening. I think this lady is getting hit,' Garcia said. 'The young lady on the other end of the phone never said hello. There was just a horrible whimper.' The call center company kept the line open so that the call to a woman in Lebanon, Oregon would be recorded for evidence. Investigators said the woman's phone was in her back pocket during the attack and of course had no idea whatsoever that the phone had picked up and that someone had called the police. Deputies say the quick-thinking actions of the call center workers likely  saved the woman's life. Long distance call: Walter Ruck was caught by police in Oregon after the screams from a woman he was assaulting were heard by telemarketer Tina Garcia in Las Vegas, Nevada . 'We were not going to hang up the phone. As far as I was concerned, and as far as the people in that room were concerned, we were the only lifeline she had,' said Garcia told News 8. Instead of called the local Las Vegas police, they instead decided to look up police in Oregon. The company called the Linn County Sheriff's Office in Oregon and they went along to check things out. Their suspicions proved correct. When police arrived on the scene they heard a woman calling for help and heard a man telling her to be quiet. Scroll down for video...

She says that she heard  a woman screaming for her life and yelling 'please don't kill me' Quick-thinking: Workers at the call center were about to call Las Vegas police, but decided to look up local Oregon officials. Linn County Sheriff's office sent police to the woman's home and likely saved her life . Deputies forced their way into the home to find 33-year-old Walter Ruck holding the woman from behind. Police say that the woman was attempting to flee, crying and gasping for air. When the door was opened she ran past the cops and out and out of the door. She told police that in the moments prior to their arrival she had been held down, physically assaulted and smothered with pillows and blankets during the attack. At one point Ruck allegedly threatened the woman with a rifle holding the barrel near his face and telling her to 'pull the trigger'. Ruck was booked into the Linn County Jail on charges of fourth degree assault, menacing and strangulation. Officials are not releasing the name of the victim.","Call center workers in Las Vegas alerted authorities to a possible assault in Oregon .

"A new monster species of snake measuring up to 20ft-long is slithering into Florida, wildlife experts say. More than 30 Northern African pythons, also known as rock pythons, have been found in a suburban area west of Miami. It's feared they could they could invade the area quickly if swift action isn't taken. In a bid to solve the problem, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has hired an animal control expert to patrol the affected area. Scroll down for video . New inhabitant: Jenny Ketterlin Eckles, left, and Edward Mercer, right, nonnative wildlife technicians with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, hold a Northern African python in Miami . Biologists worry that the northern African pythons could interact with their Burmese cousins who already thrive in large numbers in the Florida Everglades. Last year, 141 Burmese pythons were removed from the National Park. Both snake populations, which are non-venomous, likely originated from pets that either escaped or were illegally dumped by their owners. Close encounters: Biologists worry that the northern African pythons could interact with their Burmese cousins who already thrive in large numbers in the Florida Everglades . On the lookout: Tessie Offner, a nonnative wildlife biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, walks through brush while doing a survey of the Northern African python . Wildlife officials say the rock pythons captured so far have averaged 10ft in length. Their range is currently limited to the suburbs where marshlands are divided by a highway, canals, strip malls and housing developments crowded with new homes. They've been captured in canals and in open areas next to homes; some end up as road kill. One fatal dog attack by a rock python was confirmed in 2013.

"A rare megamouth shark washed up on a beach dead in the Philippines this week, wildlife officials have said. The 15-foot shark, a Megachasma pelagios (giant mouth of the deep), was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province. It is only the 60th megamouth shark seen in the world, according to marine biologist Christopher Bird. Scroll down for video . Fishermen use a stretcher with steels bars to carry a rare megamouth shark, which was found dead on a beach in the Phillipines . The Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines said the shark is being stored in an ice plant until a necropsy can be performed. The shark, nicknamed 'Toothless', was already dead when it washed ashore and the cause of death is unknown. It was carried inside by fishermen in a net and preserved in ice by local villagers. The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Albay province will investigate to determine the cause of the shark's death. In July last year, an 18-foot megamouth was caught by Filipino fishermen. The 15-foot shark was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province . This megamouth shark is displayed after being discovered in Tokyo Bay near Ichihara City in 2004 . Most have been found in Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan, but the first confirmed megamouth shark sighting came in 1976, when a deep-sea anchor accidentally caught one near Hawaii. A megamouth shark can reach to a maximum length of 17 feet and have a life span of up to 100 years, according to Reuters. The species lives in deep waters but rises towards the surface at night to feed or eat plankton.

"Seattle Seahawks player Richard Sherman is expecting his first son 'any day now'. And prays to God the little boy waits until after the Super Bowl. The 26-year-old cornerback said he and his girlfriend Ashley Moss 'have things in place in case that happens' - but added 'hopefully and God willing we won't have to cross that bridge.' Nonetheless, Moss is ready for a possible Super Bowl Baby, having traveled to Arizona from Seattle to watch Sherman play the New England Patriots - at their second Super Bowl in a row. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Any day now: Seattle Seahawks' Richard Sherman and his girlfriend Ashley Moss are soon to be parents . Plans in place: The couple are well aware their first son could arrive during the Super Bowl on Sunday . 'I pretty much told him, 'I'm coming, either you pack a bag or I pack a bag,'' she told USA Today. 'If you see Richard heading for the locker room right after it hits zero in the fourth quarter, don't be surprised.' She added that they have already picked the name but will keep it a secret until the birth. In next week's issue of Sport's Illustrated, Sherman opens up about the example he plans to set for his son. He explained: 'I've realized in the last year that I can evoke change by being a great role model: a man who respects women and police officers, who graduated from college and does everything in his power to be successful within the rules. 'I pretty much told him, 'I'm coming, either you pack a bag or I pack a bag,'' Moss revealed . Moss said the team has been very supportive and Sherman is ready to run from the field if the baby comes . This will be Sherman's second Super Bowl in a row, after playing the New England Patriots last year . 'Circumstances dictate where you start — a single mother raised Kam Chancellor to become the man he is today — but each individual determines his course. 'Where I came from, in Compton, kids were brainwashed into thinking that if they weren't athletes or rappers or drug dealers they were nothing. 'My son will understand that he's in control of his own destiny and that education, work ethic and discipline will guide him to an even better life than I've enjoyed. Excited: Sherman and Moss have already selected a name for their son but will keep it a secret . 'He'll be the man who makes this world a better place through positive actions and influence.' This weekend, however, Sherman is focused on football. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, he said: 'I did not know it was a topic of national debate, honestly. 'I'm focused on the game right now. He's not supposed to come on Sunday. But I think he's a disciplined man and will wait. 'I would not like to miss the birth of my first son, my first kid.'","Richard Sherman, 26, revealed he may face a difficult decision .

"A California appeals court today upheld a jury's decision that the promoter of Michael Jackson's ill-fated comeback concerts was not responsible for his death. The 2nd District Court of Appeal issued a 39-page ruling a week after attorneys for the late singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, argued for a new trial. The court found the verdict in favor of concert promoter AEG Live LLC was legal. The three-judge panel ruled that Jackson's mother and children did not have standing for a new trial after their attorneys argued last week that AEG Live was liable for Jackson's treatment, and that jury instructions were confusing and not wide enough in scope. Losing side: The 2nd District Court of Appeal has rejected Katherine Jackson's (left) bid for a new wrongful death trial of her late son Michael's concert promoter AEG Live . The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that cardiologist Dr Conrad Murray (left) was sufficiently qualified for the job he was hired to do as general practitioner by AEG Live overseeing Jackson's care . The court also upheld rulings by a trial court judge that narrowed the case to a single claim that AEG negligently hired, retained and supervised cardiologist Conrad Murray later convicted of causing Jackson's death. The self-proclaimed King of Pop died in June 2009 on his Neverland Ranch in California from an overdose of a powerful anesthetic while preparing for his much-anticipated 'This Is It' shows. He was 50 years old. His mother and three children sued AEG, claiming executives exercised undue control over the doctor and failed to properly investigate before he was hired. The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that Murray was sufficiently qualified for the job he was hired to do as general practitioner. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 for Jackson's death and served half of his 4-year sentence in a Los Angeles prison. A jury listened to five months of testimony during the 2013 trial before siding with AEG. The sensational  trial offered a glimpse into Jackson's private life and final days in which Murray administered the surgical anesthetic propofol to the 'Thriller' singer as a sleep aid. Lawyers for the 84-year-old Jackson family matriarch (left) had been hoping to restore some claims against the promoter behind her son's ill-fated This Is It shows . Katherine Jackson (second from right) and the singer's three children, (L-R) Prince Michael Jackson, Blanket Jackson, Paris Jackson, sued AEG, claiming executives exercised undue control over the doctor . The justices noted that jurors seemed to understand the case and did not appear confused by jury instructions or the verdict form, as Katherine Jackson's attorneys have contended. Lawyers for the 84-year-old Jackson family matriarch had been hoping to restore some claims against the promoter that Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos dismissed early in the case, but the court found no basis to do so. It determined that Dr Murray, the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, was an independent contractor of AEG and not an agent of the company. 'Today in a strongly worded opinion, the court of appeal found what took a jury two days to see through and that is that AEG was in no way responsible for the tragic death of Michael Jackson,"" AEG attorney Marvin S. Putnam said. Kevin Boyle, an attorney for Katherine Jackson, said his office was still reading the ruling and did not have an immediate comment.","Katherine Jackson argued that AEG is responsible for hiring an unfit doctor who gave Michael Jackson a fatal overdose of propofol in 2009 .

"The sun and moon have been gracing our skies for 4.5 billion years. It can be hard to imagine what another star would look in place of the sun, or how the night sky would appear with a planet instead of our satellite. Now, the Russian Federal Space Agency has released an incredible animation of how it believes the planet’s horizons will appear – and the results are stunning. Scroll down for videos . Arcturus, a red giant, looks orange to the eye. It is the fourth brightest star in the sky, and is currently in the later stages of life. this is how it would appear on our horizon, filling up large parts of the sky . The first animation reveals Earth in various lights by placing a different stars at the heart of our solar system. The opening star, Alpha Centauri, is the nearest visible sun to our own, and one of the brightest in the southern night sky. In reality, it is about 4.3 light-years away, nearly 300,000 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. If it replaced our sun, a double-star system would appear in our skies. Along with its companion, Alpha Centauri B, it orbits a common centre of gravity every 80 years. Sirius, the brightest star in Earth night sky is almost twice as big as the sun. It would be bathing us in a bright whitish-blue light . The opening star, Alpha Centauri, is the nearest visible sun to our own, and one of the brightest in the southern night sky. Along with its companion, Alpha Centauri B, it orbits a common centre of gravity every 80 years . The average distance between them is about 11 astronomical units (AU) — about the same distance as the sun to Uranus. Sirius meanwhile is the brightest star in the sky, and closes to Earth at 8.6 light years, with a mass double that of our sun. Sirius in the constellation Canis Major the Greater Dog and on planet’s horizon would appear under a blue haze. The animation also reveals Arcturus filling Earth’s skies. Arcturus, a red giant, looks orange to the eye. It is the fourth brightest star in the sky, and is currently in the later stages of life. Vega, meanwhile, is about the same size as our sun but brighter and hotter. The final star to be shown is Polaris, also known as the North Star. It is located on the handle tip of the Little Dipper. The Russian Federal Space Agency has also created a video of what Earth’s skies would look like if the moon was replaced by Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Earth. It shows just how large some of the planets are, with Jupiter and Saturn filling up most of the sky. This is how a sunset on Earth would look like if the sun were replaced with Arcturus, one of the brightest stars in our 'neigbourhood' On the left is an image of what Mars would look like in our sky if it replaced the moon. The right image shows how Earth would appear . The final star to be shown is Polaris. It is famous for holding nearly still in our sky while the entire northern sky moves around it because it’s located  at the north celestial pole .

Mars, for instance, is about twice the size, with a radius of 1,080 miles (3,397km). Uranus is about 25 times larger at 15,882 miles (25,559km) in radius, while Jupiter completely outclasses it with a radius of 44,422 miles 71,490km). Interestingly, some of the moons of the planets would also be in a collision course with Earth. Dione, for example, which orbits Saturn at a distance of 235,000 miles (377,000km), would likely impact Earth if Saturn were in place of the moon. Another interesting effect would be the gravitational influence on Earth if the planets were placed that close. They could strip away our atmosphere and cause huge tides and volcanoes. If Jupiter were the planet in the moon's position, it’s likely Earth would not even survive intact, being close enough to possibly be ripped apart and form a ring around the gas giant.

"Police were yesterday accused of a catastrophic series of blunders over their handling of a dossier containing more than 2,000 suspected paedophiles. Extraordinary details have emerged of how some forces and a top anti-child abuse unit failed to act after being given a ‘customer list’ of perverts who used a child porn website. Despite being handed the information on a plate by Canadian police who traced the Toronto-based website’s international network of clients, British suspects were left free to continue offending for up to two years and hundreds may now escape justice. Extraordinary details have emerged of how some forces and a top anti-child abuse unit failed to act after being given a ‘customer list’ of perverts who used a child porn website. File image used . Investigators in Toronto yesterday admitted their surprise at the inaction of UK police – who in some cases refused to even answer calls or return messages. The true scale of how officers failed to act on the results of the huge Canadian undercover operation can now be laid bare for the first time, including how: . At the centre of scandal is Azov Films, a multi-million-pound website based in Toronto that sold child porn films to customers worldwide. Following a raid in 2011, investigators uncovered a huge client database and found that UK visitors were among the most frequent. The customer list was quietly shared with police forces around the world who rounded up and jailed suspects. A file containing the names of up to 2,345 suspects had been sent to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop) in 2012, but was shelved after a superficial review found some of the material was ‘low grade’. It was not until November the following year when the huge success of the operation was made public in Canada that UK police realised they had made a mistake. Ceop’s successor, the National Crime Agency (NCA), ordered the details to be rushed out to forces across England and Wales. But even then, some forces inexplicably failed to take action for many more months, leading to a total delay of about two years. It later became clear that many suspects were working in positions of responsibility and were actively abusing children. Among them was teacher Martin Goldberg and cancer specialist Dr Myles Bradbury, who manipulated the treatment of young patients to give him more chances to abuse them. The latest suspect to emerge is Father Charles Richardson, 60, a clergyman in East Dulwich, South London, who was not arrested until May last year when officers found indecent films on the computer at his Victorian vicarage. He fell from cliffs in a suspected suicide near Dover shortly before he was due to answer bail in November. One of the names on the list of men suspected of buying child porn films from a Toronto-based website was Church of England vicar Charles Richardson (pictured) One of the names on the list of men suspected of buying child porn films from a Toronto-based website was a Church of England vicar. But after being tipped off by colleagues in Canada, it was almost two years before police and other officials raided the home of Father Charles Richardson, 60. When officers finally searched his Victorian vicarage in East Dulwich, South London, they found 31 indecent films on his computer. But days before he was due to answer police bail he appears to have killed himself by jumping off a cliff in St Margaret’s Bay near Dover. Allegations about the vicar were passed to a British child abuse unit in 2012 following an operation by Canadian investigators. But his name, along more than 2,000 others, was left in an in-tray until 2013, when it was belatedly passed on to the Metropolitan police. It was not until May last year that they raided his home by St John’s church. Asked whether police should have acted faster to arrest Richardson, in light of the access he had to hundreds of children, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘The films and images were examined and we are content that they had not been produced by the suspect. ‘We will make arrests where we have gathered sufficient evidence to do so.’ Parishioners this week said they had been kept in the dark about Richardson’s arrest – and many attended a packed ‘service of thanksgiving’ on Sunday unaware that he was facing child porn charges. It was only over the last fortnight that churchgoers and parents at the CofE primary school next door to the church were told ‘safeguarding’ issues had been raised about the vicar. Churchgoers were also told that Richardson had ‘taken a step back’ for ‘personal reasons’. The vicar, who had been promoted to canon, was a regular visitor to the popular Church of England primary school next door to the church, and was also involved with his own choir and Sunday school. However, churchgoers and parents have been told that his offending did not relate his activities at the school. A spokesman for the Church of England’s Southwark diocese, said: ‘The church and school were told he had stood back from ministry for personal reasons. They have now been told the reason for this. ‘The Diocese has been assured that the reasons for Charles Richardson’s arrest are not related to the church or the school. ‘We are all flawed human beings and it is helpful, no matter what the circumstances of a person’s life or death, for those who knew them to be able to pray for them.’ An inquest is to be held in April. Yesterday Toronto police told of their frustration at the lack of communication with the UK. Detective Sgt Kim Gross said: ‘We were trying to connect but we weren’t getting any feedback.’ She said Spain and the US were ‘fast to act’ and officers spoke directly to colleagues in South Africa, Hong Kong and Australia. But there was no ‘open line of communication’ in the UK. ‘Britain had to go through their channels. It is unfortunate,’ she added. On a visit to London this week, Toronto police chief Bill Blair added: ‘Close international co-operation is something required for tackling this particular type of crime.’ The independent police watchdog is investigating three forces – Essex, North Yorkshire and North Wales – and the NCA.","Extraordinary details emerge of how anti-child abuse unit failed to act .

"Tony Abbott's leadership deepened overnight when Queensland voters delivered the conservative government a massive blow in the state election. While counting in the election is still underway, the double digit swing to Labor shocked political observers and many members of the government. Federal government MP's reportedly described the loss as 'catastrophic' and 'unimaginable', with some insisting that Tony Abbott cannot recover from the events of the day. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott's leadership deepened overnight when Queensland voters delivered the conservative government a massive blow in the state election . 'All we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution,' one Queensland MP told The ABC. During the live broadcast for Queensland's election panel, Liberal MP Jane Prentice declared that the NLP was in significant trouble. Ms Prentice said that the party 'can't continue as we are', and pointed to the failing of the Prime Minister to 'take the people' along with the movements of the party. 'Tony has said he has listened and learned. He is making a keynote speech on Monday at the Press Club, but we can't continue as we are,' she said. 'I think that's the lesson from today.' Ms Prentice told The ABC that 'there's a lot of strong messages for the Federal Government out of today's results.' At one point during the election, a swing against the LNP of 16.8% was reported by the Galaxy exit poll of 17 electorates. In another blow for Tony Abbott, a Galaxy poll on Saturday revealed that if an election was to be held immediately, Mr Abbott would lead the Liberal Party to a resounding loss. The poll indicated that the Liberal party would win just 36% of the primary vote and that in the two-party preferred vote the Abbott Government has plunged to 57:43, reported The Courier Mail. Queensland opposition leader Annastacia Palaszczuk waves to supporters at an election night function . The final opinion polls suggest there will be a swing to Labor of 8-12 per cent (led by Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk) on Saturday, meaning the opposition could pick up between 15-30 seats . Australian Labor Party banners are pictured outside a polling station set up at Inala State School in Brisbane on Saturday . In the wake of the Queensland vote, which saw Premier Campbell Newman conceede his seat of Ashgrove to Labor candidate Kate Jones after two years, the leadership of the Liberal National Party is in question, with Treasurer Tim Nicholls a potential. 'Mr Newman's loss means that there's going to be a lot of work to be done between now and the time of that decision being made by me or anyone,' Mr Nicholls said. Mr Nicholls also said that the campaign against Mr Newman was heavily tied to Mr Abbott and the Federal Government. Following leadership troubles for Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister steered clear of the Queensland campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign. Nine's political commentator Laurie Oakes said that the change in government could mean that the Prime Minister was 'dead meat'. 'The bottom line is even though Tony Abbott wasn't here, he was here in presence,' said Mr Oakes.

Premier Campbell Newman and his wife Lisa vote in the state election at Newmarket State School in Brisbane on Saturday . Queensland opposition leader, Annastacia Palaszczuk, from the Australian Labor Party, is greeted by a voter at a polling station set up in Brisbane . The Prime Minister's leadership has been the subject of increasing speculation following a series of unpopular decisions capped by the controversy over his decision to knight  Prince Phillip. Amid backbencher disquiet Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and former Howard government cabinet minister Mal Brough have emerged as potential candidates to take over as leader of the Liberal party. The latest sign of pressure on Mr Abbott is an expected announcement on Monday watering down his signature policy, the controversial Paid Parental Leave scheme, which has received significant criticism for being to expensive. Reports have emerged that Mal Brough has been approached to pave the way for Liberal party leadership contenders, rumours which Mr Brough did not deny. A challenge by Mr Brough is seen by some within the Liberal Party as an effective way to highlight dissatisfaction with Mr Abbott and push leadership change to the front of business. 'Clearly people are talking to each other because we are all interested in doing what's best for the nation,' Mr Brough told Fairfax Media. In Queensland the final election result was not expected to be confirmed until later Sunday, but the result in Mr Newman's seat of Ashgrove was clear. The polls have opened across Queensland with the Liberal National Party set to cop a battering, but hold onto power . Mr Newman said that while the election was too close to call, the verdict had spelled an end for him. 'My political career is over,' Mr Newman said. He reflected on his time in office, saying that the 'times we’re living in are uncertain'. 'Over the last three years we’ve had to make some difficult decisions for the state, and I do believe they have put Queensland in a far better place,' reported Nine News. Treasurer Tim Nicholls told The ABC that Mr Newman had called Ms Jones to concede his seat. 'I think he does accept the will of the people of Ashgrove and I think that is a sign of great maturity,' said Mr Nicholls. Mr Newman won the seat from Labor's Ms Jones at the 2012 election. Ms Jones said that she had been prompted to run for the seat by her electorate, as she was living in a Queensland that she 'did not want to live in'. Experts tipped that the polls would be a tight contest that would hand the Liberal National Party a second term. A Labor victory at this election was considered unthinkable in 2012, when Labor was reduced to just seven seats in the 89-seat parliament. The LNP's Education Minister John-Paul Langbroek expressed deep concern about the exit poll and the prospect of his government being a one-term wonder. 'I'm not going to gild the lily,' he told Nine, just under an hour before voting booths closed. 'You'd be a fool to ignore it with 50 minutes to go.' Former Labor premier Peter Beattie told the Nine election panel if the exit polls translated across the state, it would be a ""boilover result"" for Labor led by Annastacia Palaszczuk. ""These figures are extraordinary but I want to see the real thing,"" Mr Beattie said. Labor needs a swing of just over 12 per cent to reclaim power, something the ABC's political analyst Antony Green has said would be a stunning result. 'It would be by far the biggest turnaround ever in Australian political history if the Labor party won this election,' Mr Green said this week. Even in a worst-case scenario, the LNP will likely hold on to around 47 seats and have the right to form government. Pictured is Queensland Premier Campbell Newman (left) and opposition leader Annastacia Palaszczuk (right) If that were the final outcome it would spark a mad scramble after both major parties ruled out deals with minor rivals. There will be a particular focus on Premier Campbell Newman's seat of Ashgrove, where he's been trailing Labor's Kate Jones. Both parties say that the seat is too close to call, but if Mr Newman loses Queensland will soon have a new premier. The latest ReachTel poll, released on Friday, highlighted the growing discontent with Mr Newman with 35.7 per cent of respondents labelling his performance as very poor and 16.7 per cent as poor. The other bellwether seats to watch will be are Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Gladstone, which have been visited numerous times by both Mr Newman and Opposition Leader Annastacia Palaszczuk. Mr Newman and Ms Palaszczuk take part in a Leaders debate in Brisbane just before the state elections on Friday . The latest Newspoll also shows the Liberal National Party is set to return to government in Queensland with a much-reduced majority after a likely 11-point swing to Labor. The poll, published by News Corp just before Saturday's state election, shows the LNP on 52 per cent to Labor's 48 per cent on a two-party preferred basis. The poll, taken in the final week of the campaign, gives the LNP a primary vote of 41 per cent, ahead of Labor on 37 per cent. The poll shows only 35 per cent of voters are satisfied with Campbell Newman's performance as premier, with 58 per cent dissatisfied. Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk's satisfaction levels have remained steady at 38 per cent, with 40 per cent of voters dissatisfied with her performance. But on the question of preferred premier, Mr Newman leads his rival 43 per cent to 42 per cent. About 2.5 million Queenslanders are expected to lodge their vote in Saturday's state election. The Electoral Commission of Queensland says 328,601 people have already voted in pre-polling. Voting is compulsory and polling booths close at 6pm.","Leadership issues for the PM have worsened in the light of QLD election .

"A grand jury has refused to indict five students at New Jersey's William Paterson University who were accused of kidnapped and gang-raped a female freshman in a dorm, officials have said. Jahmel Latimer, Darius Singleton, Garret Collick, Noah Williams and Tremaine Scott, all aged 18, allegedly restrained the victim at the campus's Overlook South residence hall on November 25. They forced her to perform multiple sex acts on them, before preventing her from leaving the room, it was claimed. They were all expelled after the unidentified student reported the alleged attack. The five were also arrested and charged with crimes including conspiracy, criminal restraint and aggravated sexual assault. They denied the charges during a December court appearance.

They were all later expelled from the Wayne-based university (pictured) But now, the defendants have seen all the charges against them dismissed after the Passaic County grand  jury  decided not to indict them over the alleged attack in Wayne, officials said on Thursday. Latimer's attorney, Ron Ricci, said attorneys for each of the men had provided evidence 'that this was not a sexual assault'. He added that the case had been presented to the grand jury on Monday. 'The facts demonstrated that this was not a sexual assault, and the actions of those young men were not in violation of the law. It clearly wasn't a crime,' Mr Ricci told The Record. In reference to the publicity surrounding the 'gang-rape' case, he added: 'It was outrageous that these young men had to go through the publicity that they had to go through.'

'The case was investigated and then presented to the grand jury, but the grand jurors declined to indict and entered a no bill,' Ms Squitieri said. During the alleged attack, Latimer, of Hoboken, Singleton, of Jersey City, Collick, of Paterson, Williams, of Camden, and Scott, of Vineland, reportedly blocked the girl's entrance at the dorm. They then allegedly turned out the lights and used 'physical force or coercion' to attack the victim. They forced her to perform sex acts on them, before imprisoning her in the room, it was claimed. According to the Record, which obtained the freshman's complaint to police, Latimer was accused of pulling the woman by the hair and forcing her to perform sex acts. The other four men were alleged to have conspired to commit sexual assault, restrained another person unlawfully and exposed them to risk of serious bodily injury. The defendants, who all studied at the university, were each handed $200,000 bail. However, this was later lowered to $50,000 bail by the Passaic County prosecutor's office, .

"Labour is to introduce a 'graduate tax' on the earnings of those who go to university. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said yesterday the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power. The National Union of Students proposed an extra tax of between 0.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent of their income above £15,000, for a period of 20 years, with the highest earners paying higher rates. Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000. Scroll down for video . Big change: Chuka Umunna (pictured) said the system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees and would be introduced 'in the medium term' if Labour returns to power . Cost cutting: Labour is struggling to work out how to pay for a pledge it has already made to slash university tuition fees from the current maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000 . In 2011, it announced the policy as it sought to win over disaffected former Liberal Democrat voters angered by Nick Clegg reneging on a pledge to scrap fees and signing up to Coalition plans to allow institutions to charge up to £9,000 a year – triple the amount students paid previously. The £6,000 cap is expected to be included in Labour's general election manifesto, but it is not clear how the party intends to meet such an expensive commitment. Previously, Labour has suggested that it might pay for the cut with a corporation tax increase on banks or with higher rates of interest for better-off students. The party may also be forced to restrict the cut in fees to certain types of courses such as technical degrees, leaving other students to keep on paying the current cost. Mr Umunna, who is responsible for higher education policy, said introducing a full-scale graduate tax 'as soon as possible is my priority'. 'In the medium term, a graduate tax is the way to go. It's fairer, it's more progressive and it's the way you clear up the unsustainable financial mess that has been created by the current Government under their system,' the shadow business secretary said. 'They are going to have to make huge write-offs on the student loans that they have been giving to people to pay these trebled tuition fees and a graduate tax ultimately getting to that place as fast as possible is key.' Mr Umunna insisted it was 'unacceptable' that students were being saddled with 'a huge heap of debt'. 'The reason it has taken us some time to finalise our policy is because the ground has moved from us on this issue,' he said. 'The estimate on what students would be able to repay keeps falling in terms of what they expect to get back. That changes the figures. North of the border: Ed Miliband (pictured) has been rocked by a series of polls suggesting Labour could lose almost all of its 40 seats to the SNP in Scotland . 'We will be announcing the policy on this before the election campaign. We are not going to erect a road-block to people's aspirations, as this Government has.' Labour first introduced tuition fees in September 1998, with students expected to pay up to £1,000 a year. The fees were then increased to £3,000 a year during Labour's second term in January 2004. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, students now graduate with an average of £44,035 of debt. Repayments only begin when their earnings rise above £21,000 a year.Business Secretary Vince Cable said the damage suffered by his party after its U-turn on tuition fees was a 'price worth paying', as the latest figures showed a record number of teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are applying to university. The Lib Dem minister hailed a further narrowing of the gap between the number of rich and poor students wanting to go on to higher education. Mr Cable said the controversial move to treble tuition fees to a maximum of £9,000 has not deterred poorer students from applying. He added: 'The opposite has occurred; numbers have grown, in particular those from disadvantaged backgrounds.' Mr Cable described the new system as 'better, affordable and fair'. He said: 'We have paid a price for this policy more than any other party. But the success of these reforms, with more students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to university than ever before, shows it was a price worth paying. 'Regardless of family circumstances, all students can now obtain university level education as long as they meet academic requirements. This is a good legacy.' The figures, from university admissions service Ucas, show 21 per cent of 18-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds in England applied this year. Overall, the richest 18-year-olds in the UK are 2.4 times more likely to want to go to university than the poorest. But in 2006, when Labour was in power, the wealthiest were 3.7 times more likely to want to apply. Gordon Brown will play a major role in Labour's general election campaign in a bid to prevent wipeout in Scotland, party sources said. Ed Miliband has been rocked by a series of polls suggesting Labour could lose almost all of its 40 seats to the SNP. Mr Brown, who is stepping down as an MP, is widely credited with reinvigorating the Better Together campaign ahead of last year's Scottish independence referendum. A Scottish Labour source said of the former prime minister: 'Gordon is our ace card.' He has often been the butt of a few jokes, so Ed Miliband probably enjoyed being the comedian himself for once. But whether his audience of political journalists did this week wasn't clear. Here are some of the jokes he delivered in his speech on Thursday at the event inspired by the White House Correspondents' Dinner – famous for its light-hearted speech by the President.","Shadow business secretary said system would be 'fairer' than tuition fees .

"Pension packet:  MoD accounts reveal that Sir David Richards has stashed away a retirement fund of £4million, the largest ever for a civil servant . When General Sir David Richards retired as Armed Forces chief two years ago, he confessed to a modest ambition to indulge his passion for sailing if he could earn enough. However, I can disclose that the canny old soldier has a pension pot so huge that he could buy an oligarch’s yacht. Buried deep in the Ministry of Defence’s latest accounts is the startling fact that Richards has amassed a retirement hoard worth £4 million. It is thought to be the largest sum ever racked up by a public servant and is likely to raise eyebrows at a time when the Army has been forced to sell off its crown jewels such as the Old War Office in an effort to raise money. The pot, which stood at £3.99 million last March, includes a lump sum payout of up to £445,000. The accounts state that he receives a gold-plated annual pension as high as £150,000 before tax. However, a source says that due to Coalition tax changes, his pension will now be £117,107. Before he retired, Richards earned a salary as high as £240,000 as Chief of the Defence Staff and lived with his wife Caroline in a grace-and-favour apartment at Kensington Palace, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Richards, 62, also received perks worth almost £100,000 relating to the cost of his official residence and travel. As part of this, the Goverment paid the estimated £28,572 tax bill on the benefits. Elevated to the House of Lords last year, he can now take advantage of a £300 tax-free allowance each day he attends Parliament, as well as enjoying the income from any company directorships he chooses to take on. Since his retirement, he has worked as an adviser to the International Institute for Strategic Studies and has made a number of corporate appearances with a company called Military Speakers. Sold off: The huge payout comes at a sore time for the Armed Forces, which are faced with massive cuts and have been forced to sell off the Old War Office (pictured) to raise funds . The disclosure comes after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned that the MoD may have to ‘sweat its assets’, selling off yet more land and barracks. But could the lavish deal given to Richards be the last of its kind? Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker has announced that he plans a root-and-branch review of MoD perks if the Labour Party wins May’s General Election.

"Plans to protect seahorses in Dorset and around the Isle of Wight have been shelved so yachtsman can moor their boats . Plans to protect seahorses and other sea life were shelved yesterday so yachtsmen can moor their boats. Officials said establishing marine conservation zones in Dorset’s Studland Bay and around the Isle of Wight would have had major implications for sailors, including restrictions on where they could anchor. The decision – by environment ministry Defra – was condemned by campaigners. Joan Edwards, of The Wildlife Trusts, said anchors break fragile eelgrass, which is the habitat of many underwater species. There will now be a consultation exercise on the establishment of 23 conservation zones – 14 fewer than first planned. Studland Bay is two miles from Sandbanks, Britain’s most expensive strip of coastal real estate. It is also the only place in the UK where both native seahorse species – the spiny seahorse and the short-snouted seahorse – are known to breed. Close to Poole Harbour, the bay is the only place in the UK where both native seahorse species - the spiny seahorse and the short-snouted seahorse - are known to breed. Numbers have fallen dramatically in recent years. In 2009 a survey recorded 40 spiny and two short-snouted seahorses in the bay, but last year researchers could only find a single juvenile male swimming there. The eelgrass which grows in the bay is also home to endangered undulate rays, native British oysters and a huge variety of vulnerable fish and molluscs. Joan Edwards, head of living seas at The Wildlife Trusts, told the Daily Mail: ‘People sail their yachts out of Poole Harbour and come to Studland for a gin and tonic. ‘The damage is done when they chuck their anchors over the side. It breaks the fragile eelgrass, which is the habitat for many, many species.’ In a report on the decision, Defra officials said locals had complained their businesses would be hit by restrictions to watersports. They wrote: ‘The designation of the site is expected to impact on commercial fishing, local port and harbour activity and recreational boating activities, with high costs associated with the port and harbour sector and recreational boating.’ They said imposing such a zone on the area would cost the local economy £80,000. But Mrs Edwards dismissed the costs, saying: ‘£80,000 would not buy a shed in that part of the country.’ A yachting ban would not needed, she said. Boats could instead tie up to floating buoys rather than dropping anchors which damage the sea bed. Three more planned conservation zones were also shelved around the Isle of Wight because of similar impacts to yachting and recreation, which Defra estimated would cost the economy a combined £290,000. Yachting associations have long denied they are part of the problem. Close to Poole Harbour, Studland Bay, near the Sandbanks, pictured, is the only place in the UK where both native seahorse species - the spiny seahorse and the short-snouted seahorse - are known to breed . Jon Reid, spokesman for the Boat Owners’ Response Group, said in September: ‘Studland Bay has been used by generations of boat owners, going back the last 70 years and eelgrass has always been there. ‘Why is there suddenly an issue now? There is a huge body of evidence that states this type of eelgrass is very resilient and if damaged it puts on a growth spurt to recover.’ The 14 proposed conservation zones dropped by Defra also including four in the Irish Sea, where officials are concerned about the impact on commercial fishing, four off the Welsh coast which will be deferred to the regional authority, and two others for which they need more information. Each will be reconsidered in the next round of licences in 2016/17. Just 27 marine conservation zones currently exist in English waters. Experts say 127 experts are needed. Defra said the proposed 23 new sites would cover more than 3,800 square miles, protecting important seabed habitats and species.","There had been plans to establish marine conservation zones in Dorset .

"Roman Catholic leaders yesterday joined the Church of England in criticising a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born - citing concerns about ethics and the safety of the procedure. The move means the two biggest and most influential churches are now putting pressure on MPs to vote against allowing the controversial ‘mitochondrial donation’ technique to be legalised. The Commons votes on Tuesday on Government amendments to embryo law, which would allow the technique in the cause of preventing devastating diseases in children and giving mothers with mitochondrial diseases the chance of a healthy child. Roman Catholic leaders have criticised a law that would allow babies with three parents to be born . The technique involves swapping a mother’s diseased mitochondria – tiny parts of a cell which give energy to the cells in healthy bodies – for new mitochondria taken from an egg donated by another woman. A vote in favour would mean Britain would become the first country in the world to permit the creation of test tube children who would effectively have two mothers and a father – three parents. The Church of England said earlier this week that there had been too little study of the technique and its implications and it was too soon to change the law. Roman Catholic Bishop John Sherrington said yesterday on behalf of the church: ‘Many people are rightly concerned about the profound implications of Parliament passing regulations under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to licence the creation of human embryos using the DNA of three people. ‘These are regulations for the transfer of “nuclear DNA” into an egg or an embryo to modify its genetic identity. A vote in favour would mean Britain would become the first country in the world to permit the creation of test tube children who would effectively have two mothers and a father – three parents . ‘No other country has allowed this procedure and the international scientific community is not convinced that the procedure is safe and effective. It seems extraordinary that a licence should be sought for a radical new technique affecting future generations without first conducting a clinical trial.’ Bishop Sherrington added: ‘There are also serious ethical objections to this procedure which involves the destruction of human embryos as part of the process. The human embryo is a new human life, and it should be respected and protected from the moment of conception. ‘This is a very serious step which Parliament should not rush into taking.’ Women who have damaged mitochondria can miscarry repeatedly and often have to take a decision on whether they should abandon any ambition to have a family and instead choose to remain childless. Those backing the law change include five Nobel prize winners, who said the decision should be put in the hands of parents. In a letter to The Times, they said: ‘We believe those who know what it is like to care for, and sometimes to lose, an extremely sick child are the best-placed to decide whether this technology is right for them.’ But a recent safety report by the fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority said that babies with three parents should not be created in British labs until further searching tests have been carried out. In America, a government inquiry into the technique is continuing. If the Commons and Lords vote in favour of the amendments next week, creating children by mitochondrial donation will be lawful in October.","Roman Catholic leaders attack law that would allow three-parent babies .

"Most penguins take to the water quite naturally - and with great elegance. But three-month-old Chudi was terrified of taking the plunge, even as his family joyfully dove into the pool at a Russian zoo. The zookeepers in Krasnoyarsk were so worried about the baby penguin they isolated him from the rest of the birds. Now, a heart-warming video has emerged of Chudi being taught how to stay afloat for the first time. Terrified: Chudi the penguin (pictured) was so scared of the water he needed two personal swimming coaches . Missing out: Chudi (pictured) refused to dive into the pool at the Royev Ruchey Zoo in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk . Swimming lessons: His private swimming instructors introduced the adorable penguin to the pool's deep end . Brave penguin: Not only did Chudi (pictured swimming) stay afloat, he did not immediately try to find his way back to dry land . First swim: The three-month old chick (pictured) eventually tired from splashing around and returned to the safety of the rocks . Triumphant: A delighted looking Chudi emerges soaked after his first ever swim . Proud: Chudi's family watch on as the adorable chick takes his first plunge in the zoo's pool . Two zookeepers had to be designated as Chudi's personal swimming instructors. They coached him as many fathers would their young children - by throwing him into the deep end. His technique needs a lot of improvement but Chudi conquered his fears and he even seemed to enjoy himself in the water. He opted to splash happily in the pool before eventually tiring and making his way back to dry land. The penguin chick was hatched in an incubator at Royev Ruchey Zoo in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. Chudi is from the only penguin species that lives in Africa and is therefore more suited to hot, southern hemisphere weather. For that reason, he and his relatives spend the winter in a specially heated room. His birth was seen as somewhat of a sensation as he was the first endangered African penguin to be born inside a Russian zoo. Sensational: Chudi (pictured at birth) was the first endangered African penguin born inside a Rusian zoo . Warmer climate: Chudi (pictured at birth) is from the only penguin species that lives in Africa and is therefore more suited to hot weather .

A zoo spokesman said: 'At first he couldn't do anything for himself, not even lift his head and his eyes were shut. 'We had to keep him in a special heated chamber so he could build up his strength and growth while feeding him on minced fish.' African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) are monogamous birds that mate for life . In the summer, Chudi's parents Marfa and Lenya started building a nest in the outdoor enclosure and laying a single egg  in an incubator.","Chudi the three-month-old African penguin was so scared of swimming he needed his own personal instructors .

"Boris Johnson is a bit of a tw**, I can't decide between David Cameron and George Osborne, and I don't know the exact size of UK national debt. These were just a few facts revealed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as he was grilled on Channel 4 comedy show The Last Leg tonight. According to Mr Clegg he has also though about slapping David Cameron 'more than 20 times' during this parliament, and wants to avoid Nigel Farage 'at all costs'. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg was subjected to an awkward grilling on Channel 4 comedy show The Last Leg tonight. When asked 'Boris Johnson, statesman or twat?' he responded, 'bit more of the latter' Mr Clegg agreed to appear to convince host Alex Brooke (left) to vote, but was instead asked a host of personal questions. When given a choice between David Cameron and George Osborne he refused to answer . Mr Clegg was asked to appear on the comedy show under the pretense of convincing one of the panelists, Alex Brooker, to vote at the next election. But instead he was subjected to a master-mind style grilling on everything from his relationship with the opposition to the debt crisis in Greece. Asked to give the size of the UK debt to the nearest hundred, Mr Clegg was left floundering, instead saying it was 'around five per cent'. When guessing the size of the Greek national debt he did little better, under-estimating the number by some £100billion. When asked whether he liked David Cameron or George Osborne best he refused to answer, saying 'David Osborne' and 'George Cameron' before waiting until host Alex Brooker moved on to the next question. And to the question 'Boris Johnson, statesman or tw**?' he replied: 'More of the latter.' When Mr Clegg was given 30 seconds to speak about voting, the Lib Dem leader used one of Mr Brooker's favourite restaurants - Nando's - as an example. Asked about the size of UK debt  he was left floundering before answering 'about five per cent'. He also showed remorse over his decision to hike tuition fees which saw his party slump in the polls . Response to Mr Clegg's appearance on Twitter was mixed, with some branding him a 'comedy' figure, while others said the performance had been 'brave' In remarks that helped win over his audience he said: 'If you go into Nando's and you don't order, then you can't complain about what you're given. 'If you don't vote then you won't get the kind of government you want, so you should vote.' Mr Clegg also revealed he is kept up at night over his decision to increase student debt, another remark which impressed those watching. However he also continued to defend the decision, adding: 'I'm not Prime Minister so I can't do what I want.' The Lib Dems poll ratings have never recovered from the decision to increase fees months after the coalition was formed in 2010. With just 100 days to go until the election the party is facing losing almost half of its seats in the next parliament, according to pollsters. Mr Clegg's election strategists will be hoping that his appearance in front of 1.6million viewers will help to claw back some ground. On Twitter reaction to his appearance was mixed, with some slating him as a 'comedy figure', while others said he came across as brave. The Deputy Prime Minister also took part in a gag at the end where he threw a melon at Mr Brooker who attempted to kick it with a blade attached to his foot . One user calling himself 'Craig' wrote: 'It's ironic that Nick Clegg is on The Last Leg tonight - as he's pretty much on his last leg in the government!' While another man going by the handle 'East Londoner' added: 'Nick Clegg has got some balls going on The Last Leg tonight. Shame he couldn't show this bravery in, you know, Parliament...' However some people also praised the Deputy Prime Minister. Neil Burnett ‏said: 'Fair play to Clegg going on The Last Leg, good sport.  Should happen more often.' Lee Allen commented: 'People give Nick Clegg grief, but fair play to him that was a good interview & Nando's bit made sense.' Mr Clegg also managed to have a dig at David Cameron over the upcoming televisied debates. At the end of the interview he was asked who he would like to nominate to come on the programme next, replying instantly 'David Cameron'. But he added: 'He won't come alone, though. He'll bring the Green Party, the Monster Raving Loony, Larry the Cat, everybody.'","Nick Clegg appeared on comedy show to convince host to vote at election .

"Britain and its Nato allies have been warned to beef up their defence spending after a ‘black year’ of aggression from Russia and Islamic terrorism. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the security environment for the Western allies had ‘fundamentally changed’ and required the alliance to ‘change our defence posture’. He said the biggest challenge comes from Russia, which has annexed Crimea and is trying to destabilise eastern Ukraine, but is also planning a vast programme of rearmament over the next five years. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu declared yesterday that despite the country’s economic woes, he would go ahead with a £190billion programme to fully modernise the armed forces by 2020. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg (pictured) said the security environment for the Western allies had 'fundamentally changed' in the past year . He ominously warned that this would prevent any other country having ‘military superiority over Russia’. They plan for 70 to 100pc of Russia’s weapons and equipment to be modernised by 2020. Tensions between Russia and the West have risen over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the United States and Europe say Moscow is fuelling an insurgency by sending in troops and weapons. Mr Stoltenberg said in Brussels yesterday: ‘2014 was not a good year for European security. In fact it was a black year. Our security environment has fundamentally changed’. He also highlighted the threat posed by Islamic State terrorists and other groups such as those who killed 17 people in attacks on the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish grocery store in Paris this month. ‘To the south, violent extremism is at our borders. Spreading turmoil across North Africa and the Middle East and fuelling terrorism on our own streets’, he said. But he warned Russia’s increased defence capabilities including the ability to launch snap military exercises on a huge scale were ‘part of the reason we have decided to change our defence posture’. The secretary-general, a former prime minister of Norway, said: ‘We have seen that Russia is ready to use force’, citing their intimidation of people in Ukraine, and Georgia and Moldova. The chief of Russia’s General Staff said yesterday that the military would receive 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles this year, with strategic nuclear forces a top priority as they can penetrate NATO’s U.S.-led missile defence system. Mr Shoigu said yesterday: ‘We plan to fulfil the government armament programme and reach by 2020 the intended quantities of modern weapons systems.’ He claimed this was in response to ‘western countries actively using new forms of aggression, combining military as well as non-military means.’ Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the biggest challenge comes from Russia, which has annexed Crimea and is trying to destabilise eastern Ukraine. Pictured is the wife of a civilian killed in shelling in Donetsk . Mr Stoltenberg warned that as Russia has continued to build up its military, Nato countries in Europe were cutting their budgets, when they should be increasing. ‘It is not possible to get more out of less indefinitely’, he said. ‘That is the reason why we have to stop the cuts and gradually start to increase defence spending as our economies grow. ‘Despite the economic crisis, despite the financial problems they are facing, Russia now is still giving priority to defence spending.’ David Cameron has failed to guarantee defence spending would remain at 2 per cent of GDP if he wins a second term and there is pressure to make further cuts to public spending. But defence secretary Michael Fallon has said Britain is currently spending at this level and will continue to do until the end of this Parliament. Mr Stoltenberg warned that as Russia has continued to build up its military, Nato countries in Europe were cutting their budgets, when they should be increasing. Pictured are reservists called up to participate in the fighting in Ukraine . Nato’s rapid reaction force, made up of land, sea, air and special operations units, is already on 7-day standby in case of an imminent threat from Russia. But Mr Stoltenberg said the 28-member organisation would also deploy a ‘spearhead force’ of smaller units in six Eastern European nations for the first time. The make-up of the force numbering several dozen, to be stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, will be discussed by Nato defence ministers when they meet next week. Last year amid rising tension, Nato forces conducted about 200 military exercises, and Stoltenberg said this would continue as the alliance adapts to the increased presence of Russian warplanes in European skies. NATO intercepted more than 400 Russian aircraft last year. RAF jets were scrambled more than 100 times last year to escort Russian bombers away from British airspace. And in most audacious incursion yet, two long-range bombers flew over Bournemouth this week and caused disruption to civilian flights, causing Moscow’s ambassador had to be summoned to the Foreign Office to account for the incident, which Russia claims was a routine patrol.","Britain and Nato allies warned they need to beef up their defence spending .

"Tesco shopper Ceri Morgan, 40, was arrested after he uploaded a porn image onto one of the stores display iPads . A Tesco shopper uploaded hardcore porn onto the stores display iPad as a joke, a court heard. Ceri Morgan, 40, uploaded the porn image onto the tablet computer and set it as the 'wallpaper'. The father-of-one then tried to remove the picture showing a 'sex act,' but was unable to delete it. The 40-year-old was confronted by security staff who told him the picture  'was not a laugh' because children often use it. Police were called to the Tesco Extra store in Swansea, South Wales, and arrested Morgan who was with his own son at the time. The mechanic admitted causing the display of indecent matter after being hauled before Swansea Magistrates Court. Prosecutor Anwen Evans said: 'A security guard followed him on CCTV system and could see him pay particular attention to one of the display ipads. 'He zoomed in and could see that he had uploaded an indecent image.He then saw him make it larger, and leave it clearly on display in store.' Morgan had gone to the store to buy a charger - but he ended up transferring the offensive image from his own mobile phone onto the iPad. When police arrived at the store in October last year he told officers: 'I realise it was wrong. I tried to remove it but I could not.' Magistrates  heard how the picture was only seen by Tesco workers and not any members of the public. Alex Scott, defending, said: 'He did not intend to cause any alarm or distress. 'He was looking at the iPad section and on the spur of the moment made a somewhat foolish and immature decision to take pornographic pictures from his phone and upload it as background. 'It was intended as a joke, but unfortunately it back-fired spectacularly. He had some difficulty in removing it from the background and there was an element of panic. Staff at Tesco Extra in Swansea, South Wales, called police after telling Morgan 'it was not a laugh' 'It was intended as a joke, it was not sexually motivated, it was an isolated and foolish decision. 'Yes, it was misguided and immature, but it was not intended to cause distress to anyone else.' Morgan was made the subject to a 12-month community order, with 100 hours unpaid work, and ordered to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £60.","Ceri Morgan, 40, uploaded a porn image onto a Tesco display iPad .

"Two people have been charged with murder in the killings of a husband and wife who were shot dead as they answered the door at their South Carolina home in October. Malcolm Hartley, 22, and his 18-year-old girlfriend Brianna Johnson, both from North Carolina, were arrested Friday with help from Charlotte, North Carolina, police and the FBI. The pair are facing murder charges in connection to the double-homicide of 63-year-old Doug London and his 61-year-old wife, Debbie. Caught: Malcolm Hartley (left), 22, and his 18-year-old girlfriend Brianna Johnson (right), both from North Carolina, were arrested Friday in connection to the October double homicide of Doug and Debbie London . Gunned down: Doug London, 63, and his 61-year-old wife, Debbie, were shot dead as they answered the door at their home in Lake Wylie, South Carolina . On Friday, police acknowledged for the first time a connection between the deaths and an armed robbery five months earlier at the Londons' Charlotte mattress store where one of the suspects was shot in the stomach. However, they would not say if the trio of robbers in the May break-in were in any way linked to Hartley and Johnson. The suspects are being held without bail. Under South Carolina law, the two could face the death penalty if convicted of the murders, reported Herald Online. According to reports, Doug and Debbie London were shot dead at around 8.30pm on October 23 inside their home in the 5000 block of Tioga Road in Lake Wylie. The couple’s grown son, Daniel, was home at the time of his parents' murders. He was not hurt in the shooting and was the one who called 911 after being awakened by gunfire sounds. On Friday, Daniel London released a statement on his Facebook page thanking law enforcement for the arrests. Earlier attack: In May, three armed suspects broke into the Londons' Wholesale Mattress Warehouse on South Boulevard . Suspects: (L to R) Nana Adoma, 19, his brother Jamell Cureton, 22, and an accomplice believed to be a high-ranking member of the Bloods gang, David Fudge, 21, have been indicted in the robbery . Blood feud: Doug London, pictured with his wife of nearly 30 years, shot Jamell Cureton in the stomach after the 22-year-old fired on him but missed . 'It is with great relief that I announce that the people that murdered my parents have been arrested,' Daniel London wrote. 'I would like to thank law enforcement for all of their hard work and dedication. 'Thank you for being the heroes that protect our communities. To all my family and friends, enjoy this day. 'To the media, thank you for your coverage of what happened to my parents. Please continue your efforts until these evil people are sentenced to justice.' Five months before the slayings, on May 24, three armed men broke into the Londons' Wholesale Mattress Warehouse on South Boulevard, but the robbery was thwarted by Doug London and the perpetrators landed in jail. Just days after the killings in October, brothers Jamell Cureton, 22, and 19-year-old Nana Adoma, were indicted in connection to the armed robbery, along with their alleged getaway driver, 21-year-old David Lee Fudge. Duo: Malcolm Hartley’s criminal history includes a conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery and possession of drug paraphernalia. Johnson (right) had no criminal record . In the course of the robbery, Doug London shot Cureton in the stomach after the 22-year-old fired on him but missed. Cureton was in jail at the time of the October slayings. Court documents indicate that the siblings' alleged accomplice, David Fudge, has admitted to being a high-ranking member of the Bloods street gang, but investigators would not say if the Londons’ murders were gang-related. Malcolm Hartley’s criminal history includes a conviction for conspiracy to commit armed robbery in 2013. He was arrested again last November on a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia. His 18-year-old girlfriend does not have a criminal record. ‘It was not a random act of violence…it was connected to another crime,’ 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett said. Married for nearly three decades, Doug and Debbie were remembered by their relatives and friends as a loving couple who were active in their community. Doug London was an avid golfer and a one-time member of the PGA. Debbie was known for her work in a local women’s shelter. They are survived by their son and multiple siblings.

He pulled it out of his mouth and when he did, it pulled away the batter - you could see the blue roll inside. 'If you bite into something that awful you are just taken back.' Ms Henderon bought the meal from the Killingworth branch of KFC on Tyne and Wear as a takeaway to eat at home. But as Oliver went to tuck into one of the four boneless pieces of chicken - bought for £1.99 - he noticed something was amiss. After realising what it was inside, Ms Henderson returned to the restaurant but was simply told to call customer support. 'I was traumatised by it - I was really upset,' she said. 'I went back into the store crying and they said I had to call customer service. 'I had to keep ringing them and keep following it up. It felt like I had to do all the work when it was their mistake. 'I work full time and I'm a mother. I just don't have the time to keep chasing them up and ringing around. The KFC branch in Killingworth, Newcastle where the KFC was purchased by Krystal Henderson .

'He wasn't unwell or grumpy, just lost his appetite.' Following an investigation, KFC apologised and offered her a free meal. A letter to Ms Henderson read: 'The blue tissue has most likely originated from a tissue roll used for KFC hygiene purposes. 'The store assume it must have fallen unseen into the breading lug that is under the sieve and was not noticed by the cook.' A spokesperson for the franchise that operates KFC in Killingworth said: 'We're very sorry for Ms Henderson's experience and apologised to her immediately, as well as giving her a refund at the time of the incident. 'We take food quality and hygiene very seriously and unfortunately, on this extremely rare occasion, our restaurant failed to meet the high standards that both we and our customers expect. 'We have retrained staff on our stringent food preparation procedures at this store to ensure this doesn't happen again.'","Krystal Henderson, 29, bought the chicken meal for her and her step-son .

"Jo Heywood said too many parents are failing to communicate with young children, instead filling their homes with digital devices to 'keep them quiet' Primary school children are now speaking like toddlers because their parents are 'pacifying' them with iPads instead of talking to them, a private school head mistress has warned. Jo Heywood said too many parents are failing to communicate with young children, instead filling their homes with digital devices to 'keep them quiet'. She said the problem, which happens 'across the social spectrum', was ultimately stunting children's speech development. And when they enter school aged five, some 'cannot even talk', with the communication skills of a two or three-year-old. Mrs Heywood said that while her pupils arrived well-prepared at Heathfield School, a boarding school for girls in Ascot, many other children across the country were suffering. She said: 'You only have to spend a few hours watching parents or carers in any high street in this land to see how addictive and time consuming mobile technology is for them. 'I frequently see parents with prams juggling their childcare duties with texting or browsing the internet and having virtually no communication with their baby or toddler. 'Bottles or dummies are shoved into their mouths to keep them quiet or mobile phones or iPads into their hands as soon as they can hold them and play with the bright lights. 'There is no social barrier to the parents I see doing this. This is a digital not a class issue. iPhones and iPads have become the new pacifiers.' Scroll down for video . The headmistress warned that when children enter school aged five, some 'cannot even talk', with the communication skills of a two or three-year-old (file picture) In a conference speech for Policy Knowledge in London last week, Mrs Heywood stressed the importance of instilling basic skills at an early age. She said that without that foundation, children will grow into adults unable to read a newspaper, a book, a recipe or simple instructions. She pointed out that there are currently 'thousands of men and women in this country who struggle with literacy levels barely above that of a five year old child.' And she added that there were many teenagers in today's secondary schools who lack the basic English and maths skills to enable them to study other subjects like science. The problems is being made worse by today's '24/7 media culture', which has caused the 'disengagement of some parents from rearing their children'. She added: 'Many parents are unconcerned because they do not see the value of reading a book themselves when information is so readily available on a smartphone. 'I am sure I am not the first to remark on the fact addiction to smartphones is doing the opposite of making children smart. 'Many are living in households where parents are hooked into their mobile phones or internets without speaking to them and they are given uncontrolled access to digital devices to keep them quiet.' The head teacher said that iPhones and iPads have become the new pacifiers to keep children quiet . She said it was a problem for children from both disadvantaged backgrounds and well-off homes, especially when parents work. 'So the end result is that thousands of children are entering a primary school system with the communication skills of a 2 or 3 year old instead of a 4 or 5 year old,' she said. 'Some of them cannot even talk let alone be in a position to learn to read via a phonics system, many teachers have reported. This puts even more pressure on a primary system which is geared towards helping children read and write in the early years.' Mrs Heywood's £30,000-a-year secondary school celebrated a record year in 2014 with over half of all the exams taken awarded the highest A*-A grades. She said that while pupils arriving at Heathfield had all been well-educated in basic literacy and numeracy skills, they were easily distracted by tablet devices. She said: 'The simple fact is that the brain does not go into a deep learning zone if it is switching between tasks.'","Jo Heywood said too many parents failing to communicate with children .

"High heels... they are the bane of most women's lives. No town centre on a Saturday evening is complete without scores of girls dressed up to the nines, tottering uncomfortably down the street on skyscraper wedges. But ankle-shatteringly high heels are nothing new - since the days of Ancient Greece, human beings have been lengthening their legs with the aid of a few extra inches on their shoes. Scroll down for video . High heels are hated and loved by women in equal measures and ladies often try to squeeze their feet into a beautiful pair, no matter how uncomfortable they are. But men and women have been wearing them from as early as 3000BC . In 3000 BC, men wore platform sandals called cothurnus in their tragic plays to indicate high social status. From then onwards, both sexes turned to the heels throughout the centuries, with some reaching as high as 30 inches in Venice in the 1400s. In the 17th century, King Louis XIV of France wore shoes with five inch heels and made a rule that nobody could wear higher heels than him. Shoe store Jones Bootmaker has written a detailed infographic, charting the history of the heel from ancient times right up to the current day.","High heels are hated and loved by women in equal measures .

"Popping to the pub for a pint is a characteristically British activity and partly why the nation’s favourite tipple has always been beer. But according to new research, this is no longer the case. We are in fact now a nation of wine-drinkers – with more people heading to the pub for a glass than ever before, a poll suggests. It found 60 per cent of UK adults - including the majority in each age group and across all regions of the UK – are choosing it over other alcoholic drinks. Wine has toppled the classic pint and is now the nations favourite drink, according to new research . Experts say the growth in popularity of wine in the UK – traditionally not a wine-drinking nation - is due in part to more education on the different types available. This is due to increasing international travel to southern Europe and other traditional wine-drinking countries, as well as more information on television and in the media. Despite often being associated with older generations and higher social classes – given in part to its costliness – the poll by Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) found this was no longer the case. In fact, wine is now the preferred drink for 57 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds. WSTA Chief Executive Miles Beale said last night: ‘Our polling shows that regardless of the stereotypes, wine is now the nation’s favourite drink and is enjoyed by a majority of adults across all ages, regions and social classes. ‘With alcohol consumption falling by around a fifth in the past decade, consumers now are drinking less but better wines. ‘This change is greatly due to the opening up of inexpensive, good quality wines. We have seen growth in new world wines, with produce from places such as Chile, New Zealand and Australia readily available for UK consumers. There has also been an encouraging growth in high quality English wines.’ Increased international travel to southern Europe and other traditional wine-drinking countries is believed to be behind the change . By comparison, according to figures released by the British Beer & Pub Association’s (BBPA) quarterly ‘Beer Barometer’, last year pubs sold 2million fewer pints of beer than ten years earlier. The UK wine industry, which includes a growing number of vineyards, is worth £17.3bn in economic activity to the British economy, supports nearly 270,000 jobs and contributes £8.6bn to the public finances annually. However, tax paid on the wine sold in the UK is currently at a record high. UK consumers currently pay nearly 60 per cent tax on an average priced bottle of wine. When asked about current levels of alcohol tax, 64 per cent of the 4,049 adults interviewed in the poll said they think that alcohol duty is too high. The move towards wine drinking by British consumers is reflected in the importance now placed on the UK wine market worldwide, with the UK now the sixth largest market globally. UK drinkers are also drinking more responsibly. HMRC data shows that total alcohol consumption per head of the UK population fell by 18.4 per cent between 2004 and 2013, from 9.5 litres of pure alcohol per person to 7.7. Leading wine expert Matthew Jukes said: ‘This polling finally dispels the myth that wine is elitist.’","60 per cent of UK adults are choosing wine over other alcoholic drinks .

"Experts said the rise could be down to David Cameron's proposed crackdown on migrant benefits. As UK citizens, they would be immune . Thousands of Polish immigrants are deciding to take British citizenship, with approved applications up 1,200 per cent in only five years. For the first time, Poles are in the top ten nationalities of foreign-born people who are being granted UK passports. In 2013, a record 6,066 applications were rubber-stamped by the Home Office – up from just 458 in 2009. The phenomenon is unusual because citizens of fellow EU countries do not usually bother to adopt British nationality, since they already have full rights to live and work here. The change was welcomed by migration campaigners, with MigrationWatch chairman Lord Green of Deddington saying: ‘This is an encouraging sign of the developing integration of the Polish community.’ Experts say one explanation for Poles – who have arrived in unprecedented numbers over the past decade – taking British citizenship is that they have become unnerved by the prospect of Britain cracking down on benefits or even leaving the EU altogether. By becoming UK citizens, they are insulated from any future changes planned by David Cameron. The Prime Minister has promised an in/out referendum on Britain’s EU membership in 2017. He also intends to make EU migrants wait four years to get lucrative in-work benefits, such as tax credits. By taking UK nationality, the Poles will also be entitled to vote in May’s general election. There are also many examples of Poles marrying British citizens and having children, which might make it more likely they will take British nationality. Normally, a migrant has to live in Britain for five years before they can apply for citizenship. Poles first began arriving in significant numbers in 2004, when the EU’s borders were expanded eastwards. In 2009, when the first of the new arrivals would have been entitled to apply for citizenship, 458 cases were approved. In 2013 the Home Office rubber stamped 6,066 citizenship requests from Poles, up from 458 in 2009, putting them ninth in national rankings - with India coming in first . This rose to 1,419 in 2010, 1,863 in 2011, 3,043 in 2012 and then 6,066 in 2013 – doubling in a single year. At that rate, as many as 12,000 Poles a year may now be receiving citizenship. Dr Michał Garapich, senior lecturer at the University of Roehampton’s Centre for Research on Migration – who is Polish – said: ‘People who have started to settle, started to look at their kids or having families, looked at staying in Britain long-term, this is a shift relating to the UK political discourse surrounding the presence of Britain in Europe. ‘They want to secure their political and social rights. The more the Tories bang on about the referendum, the potential exit from the EU, the more it makes Poles feel insecure. 'The more restrictive the language around migration, the more it predisposes migrants to seek naturalisation. ‘I would not be surprised to see a bigger increase once the date of the referendum is set or when David Cameron makes up his mind which way to jump, yes or no.’ In 2013, Poland ranked ninth on the list of countries whose citizens had been granted British nationality. Top was India with 36,351 approvals, followed by Pakistan (21,655), Philippines (10,374), Nigeria (9,275) and Bangladesh (8,902). Last night a source at the Polish Embassy in London said the number of Poles applying for British passports was still fewer than 1 per cent of the 800,000 Polish citizens in the UK. The source added: ‘Some Poles have been in the UK since 2004 so have already got settled, bought houses or apartments here and are simply planning their future in UK, so applying for a British passport is not such a bad idea.’ Immigrants to Britain are natural Conservatives who are finding the party more and more attractive, Grant Shapps has claimed. The Tory party chairman said the Conservative message of working hard and getting on appeals to voters who have come to settle in Britain and often ‘work every hour’ to provide for their family. Mr Shapps was responding to Manchester University research, reported in yesterday’s Daily Mail, showing two London seats – Brent North and East Ham – which will be contested at the general election contain a majority of voters born overseas. Many other constituencies contain large minorities. A record four million migrants born abroad will be entitled to vote in May, half a million more than at the last election. Cabinet Office minister Mr Shapps said he did not believe the trend posed a threat to his party’s chances in the election. Mr Shapps, whose father’s Jewish family emigrated from Poland in the late 19th century, said: ‘I see the Conservative party becoming more and more attractive to people from all different backgrounds, particularly because so many of the immigrant communities are people who work hard and get on in life... so I think they are naturally Conservative.’ The Manchester University research has led to speculation that the biggest losers could be the Tories, who have been accused of pursuing anti-immigrant rhetoric in response to the Ukip threat. Mr Shapps conceded that the election would be ‘incredibly close’, but insisted that David Cameron would not go into a coalition with Ukip if he fails to win a majority in May.","Total of 6,066 Poles applied for UK citizenship in 2012, up from 458 in 2009 .

"Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman last night accused a Daily Mail columnist of 'victim blaming' over rape. Miss Harman issued a lengthy statement after Sarah Vine wrote an article suggesting drunken women were not always without reproach where there are allegations of sexual assault. The column, published yesterday, argued that too many women cry rape after making a mistake by having 'non-violent sexual encounters in dodgy circumstances'. Miss Harman said: 'Can't we ever leave behind the blame culture which says to the victim that she brought it on herself and therefore the man is the victim because he is accused?' Sarah Vine wrote: 'You can blame someone else. You can make excuses. You can attempt to alleviate your own feelings of guilt and self-loathing by pinning responsibility on another' Miss Harman insisted: 'We're talking about a criminal offence. If I leave a window open an inch and someone breaks in, steals everything I own and ransacks my house no-one would say it wasn't a crime or that the offender had 'made a mistake'. 'Can't we ever leave behind the blame culture which says to the victim that she brought it on herself and therefore the man is the victim because he is accused?' Her comments come after Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine wrote: . 'It used to be that women who made stupid mistakes with men, who had non-violent sexual encounters in dodgy circumstances — while drunk or otherwise intoxicated, in the heat of the moment or for a million other reasons — did not wake up the next morning and decide they had been raped. 'They took a shower, gave themselves a stern talking to, maybe told a friend about it, had a bit of a cry — and then moved on as best they could, vowing along the way never to end up in that kind of damn stupid situation again.

"Forget the idea of an old-fashioned ski lodge, the newest Club Med hotel in the French Alps oozes Scandinavian style, chic design and some rather unusual accessories. But with bars and beer taps on each floor, an outdoor Jacuzzi for relaxation and a location just steps from the slopes, it seems this new resort has it all. Val Thorens Sensations is a hotel with a distinctive, quirky design, luxurious touches and even  a climbing wall in the foyer. Scroll down for video . What greets guests when they walk into the reception at Club Med: Val Thorens Sensations . The sleek, Scandinavian-style bedrooms boast gigantic beds and a luxurious seating area . Bedrooms feature a wall mounted television that has access to English channels and a vast library of movies . Every balcony faces the slopes to give guests excellent views and as much sunshine as possible . The new resort is the first of its kind to be completely crowd-sourced. Through Facebook, locals and Club Med fans were invited to vote for what they wanted from the huge 384-room hotel. In response, the look and feel of the resort were tailored based on feedback, from the carpet colours to the new sports facilities. Stepping foot inside the hotel you can't help but be in awe at the scale of the complex. It takes 15 minutes to walk from one block of rooms to another. The bedrooms are all designed so they face the sun, ensuring guests get the most sunshine on offer flooding into the rooms that come complete with a behemoth sized bed and luxurious seating area. One of the many quirky areas in the main dining room is an indoor Yurt . The Epicurious restaurant offers guests a more specialist menu and more luxurious areas they can unwind in . Guests will have access to a spectacular array of wines in the Epicurious restaurant . Staff are trained to give  guests the best advice and recommendations when they are choosing their wine . Epicurious has a balcony with sunbeds and seating areas as well as an outdoor jacuzzi . The hotel has a main restaurant that serves buffet food with a handful of chefs cooking fresh meals to order as well as Epicurious, a separate dining area that offers picnic style food, a wine cellar and even a deli and grocery section. For the boozy members of your party, there is a bar or beer tap on every floor and during the night the fourth floor Prism bar turns into a nightclub, complete with a bizarre-but-must-see French take on Butlins style entertainment. Interestingly, Club Med recently published a report that revealed that families are 'gramping' or going on ski holidays with the grandparents. This new trend also revealed that grandparents are more inclined to pay for the whole holiday as a treat for the family.

Visit clubmed.co.uk . Grandparents were repeatedly cited as an important part of the modern ski holiday with a fifth of holidaymakers having skied with extended family and grandparents in the last two years, probably because they provide excellent free childcare. However, here is where one of the best parts of the Club Med all inclusive concept comes into play. Private ski lessons with the top ESF ski instructors are actually included in your price. What does that mean for you? Well it means that you can either ski as a whole family or split off into three groups without having to worry that anyone is at risk of hurting themselves. Club Med: Val Thorens Sensations boasts a high-tech gym, aerobics studio and steam room . Guests are also given the chance to practice their climbing skills with this indoor climbing wall . To be honest, even if you don't need the lessons, it's worth getting an instructor, just because you can save so much time jumping queues at gondolas and chairlifts. And they're sure to  offer local knowledge and some helpful pointers about technique along the way. One thing you should be aware of is that ski, board and boot rental aren't included in the price and will set you back another £150 depending on how much rental gear you need. I preferred to hit the slopes on my snowboard. And after a day of trying (and failing) to beat a five-time Winter Olympian (Graham Bell is a resort ambassador) there was nothing better than heading back to the resort, soaking up the spa and heading for a drink.

"Victorino Chua (pictured) is accused of murdering three patients by tampering with their saline drips . The first victim of a hospital poisoning campaign allegedly launched by a nurse told a court: ‘I thought I was going to pop my clogs.’ Pensioner Josephine Walsh was waiting to be discharged when she suffered a sudden hypoglycaemic attack. She told the jury that she was sitting in a chair waiting to leave ward A3 at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport in June 2011 when she passed out. In a video interview played to the jury, she said: ‘I told the nurse I did not feel well at all. ‘The perspiration was dripping off me. I was absolutely soaking my pyjamas. ‘The next thing I knew, I woke up and I was looking at the ceiling. I thought I was on the way out, I thought I was going to pop my clogs. ‘Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. I had never passed out or gone dizzy. ‘It was just scary. I thought I was going to die. I know that sounds silly but I did. It was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. I had never felt dizzy in my life.’ Victorino Chua, 49, a Filipino-born nurse and father-of-two, is accused of murdering three patients by tampering with their saline drips. Manchester Crown Court heard Mrs Walsh, now 72, was treated with dextrose after a nurse raised the alarm and doctors referred her to a diabetes specialist. The specialist carried out tests and confirmed the pensioner did not suffer from the condition and there was no medical reason for the hypoglycaemic attack. Chua denies more than 30 charges including the murder of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83, who never recovered after allegedly being poisoned with insulin. The prosecution alleges that Chua became the prime suspect after maliciously altering patients’ prescription charts six months later in January 2012. It was an attempt to trick colleagues into giving them potentially fatal doses, it claims. Mrs Walsh was the first of 21 victims to suffer hypoglycaemic attacks after Chua laced saline drips and ampoules with insulin, causing falling blood sugar levels, the prosecution said. The court previously heard Chua also left another patient brain damaged by secretly injecting insulin into drips, turning them into ‘ticking timebombs’ to be used by unwitting colleagues. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said 18 patients who were affected managed to recover after prompt medical intervention by staff. Mr Wright said Chua’s motive was hard to determine, adding that ‘only the person responsible could ever know why they would embark on such conduct’. He said the nurse had ‘turned from a man who had dedicated his life to caring for others, to harming them’. The defence claims Chua has been ‘made the scapegoat who has had to carry the can’ for the contaminated drips and ampoules. It says the evidence is circumstantial. The trial, which is expected to last up to four months, continues.

"After Allison Dore had an unhappy experience during a trip to the dentist, she did what thousands do as a matter of routine: she posted a negative review on a consumer website. But that decision could cost her dearly because the dental practice has taken the unusual step of suing her for £125,000 damages plus legal costs, saying that her online claims were wrong. The firm’s action has been condemned by the business listings and reviews site Yelp, which says it could have a chilling effect on free speech. The row began when Allison, 46, was referred by her NHS dentist to B Dental in Islington, London, for £10,000 worth of tooth implants. The row began when Allison Dore (pictured) posted a negative review of the dental practice. After some back and forth correspondence, the firm then said it was taking her to court . ‘Initially I saw a lovely dentist there,’ she says, ‘but I endured a three week wait before they could begin treatment, received treatment plans with the wrong prices and then, when I got toothache on the other side of my jaw, they said they did not do general dentistry.’ Disappointed with the service, she posted a review on Yelp, headed ‘Terrible Service – Avoid at all costs’ and gave them just one star. ‘Everything I wrote was factual and true. I am a nervous patient who was looking for a long-term private dentist. And I was shocked at how uncaring B Dental were.’ To her astonishment, she received an email from Yelp in November saying it had received a complaint about her review. She then received an email from the dental firm saying it disputed her version of events. The surgery, which has a series of excellent five-star reviews on Yelp claiming it is professional, clean and friendly, said her review was defamatory. Allison posted the one star review on Yelp, which has led to accusations that it was defamatory . Surgery: The B Dental practice in Islington, north London, which was the subject of the review . Some of the reviews of the dental practice posted on the Yelp website recalled positive experiences . The firm said it had offered her a number of appointments which she had cancelled, and denied they had left her in pain, adding that her review must be removed. ‘The review has had, and continues to have, a significant financial impact on our business. We cannot allow that damage to our business to continue,’ wrote B Dental. The dental firm's lawyers wrote to Allison Dore to tell her they were taking her to court. File image used . Scared of being sued, Allison removed the review. However, she put a note on Yelp saying she did so due to the threat of legal action. She then received another letter demanding this note be removed too. ‘In return they offered to refund £185 of the initial £384 fee I paid as long as I agree never to mention B Dental again. But I felt bullied and couldn’t agree never to speak about them again.’ So B Dental’s lawyers wrote again to say they are taking her to court. Allison has now taken legal advice and been told the review she wrote was not defamatory. ‘When I discovered they plan to sue me for £125,000 I felt sick. It has put me off ever putting a review on a website again.’ Last night Allison, a television producer, said: ‘When I left that review I did so honestly. But this has turned into an utter nightmare. There is no way I could pay these damages and the worry of it all has been so huge I am barely sleeping.’ Her story is a cautionary tale to anyone putting a review on a website that there might be a high price to pay for their freedom of speech. B Dental told Allison her review did not match their records, adding: ‘A review such as yours puts our practice and our employees at genuine risk. It affects the livelihoods of dentists, nurses and supporting staff. Nurses and staff with families, young children and mortgages.’ Elliot Adams, spokesman at Yelp, said: ‘Businesses that choose to sue customers to silence them rather than address their comments often bring additional unwanted attention to the original criticism. Litigation isn’t a very good substitute for customer service. ‘While Yelp continues to fight to protect the users of its platform, the law in the UK makes it surprisingly easy for businesses to intimidate consumers into removing honest reports of their experiences.’ B dental did not respond when approached for comment.","Dental customer Allison Dore posted a negative review of dental practice .

"From Russian oligarchs to Middle Eastern royalty to Hollywood producers, it takes a certain type of person to own a superyacht - crucially, they must be super rich. The official term for this fortunate minority is a Ultra High Net Worth Individual, someone with more than US$30million (£20m) in net assets, and there are just 200,000 of them in the world. But even for the likes of Roman Abramovich and UAE president Khalifa Al Nahyan, owners of two of the costliest private vessels in the world, the costs associated with keeping such a big boat on the water would have them double-checking their direct debits. Insurance company Towergate has compiled a study to find out the real cost of owning a superyacht and the figures are, for us mere mortals, almost inconceivable. Scroll down for video . Roman Abramovich's Eclipse has a missile defence system and cost the Russian   $500milion (£332m) Chelsea owner Abramovich's boat also has two swimming pools and can be boarded via a mini submarine . Hollywood filmmaker Steven Spielberg's 85.95m superyacht Seven Seas cost him $200m (£133m) In the simplest terms, their infographic states that 10 per cent of the initial value of a superyacht goes on operating costs. For Chelsea Football Club owner Abramovich's Eclipse, a 162.5m vessel with a missile defence system that cost the billionaire an astronomical $500milion (£332), that means $50m (£33m) a year. The standard fuel usage for a 71m yacht is 500 litres an hour, meaning an average of $400,000 (£265m) is spent on petrol every year per vessel. American businessman David Geffen's 138.4m The Rising Sun has a relatively small crew of 45 . Dilbar, the super efficient 110m behemoth owned by Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov . The Value Added Tax (V.A.T) works out at 15-25 per cent of the vessel's value while docking costs are an average  $350,000 (£232,000) and $240,000 (£159,000) the standard for insurance sees the costs soar. Add to that the expected $1million (£664,000) per year for maintenance and repairs and the wages for an average $1.4m (£930,000) for an on-board crew - which can range from less than 20 to 154 staff on the Sultan of Oman's mysterious Al Said superyacht - and it's a significant outlay.

"While the world was watching horrified as the baby Gammy scandal unfolded, two men in Australia were terrified the news would mean they may never get to see the faces of their unborn triplets. Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were just three months away from meeting their beautiful triplet girls, via a Thai surrogate mother,  when a Perth couple reportedly abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand. As the news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The couple, from Kinglake West in Victoria, were worried sick that this could mean the end of their dream of having a family. Scroll down for video . Shannon Sanderson, 38, and Peter Trigg, 44, were just three months away from meeting their beautiful triplet girls, via a Thai surrogate mother, when a Perth couple abandoned their disabled son Gammy in Thailand . After spending two years trying to father a child in Australia, the couple  decided Thailand was their best option of ever having a baby. 'We tried all other avenues like adoption, fostering, co-parenting but we weren't getting anywhere,' Peter told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then I stumbled actors an article about another gay couple In NSW who had done it through Thailand,' he said. The couple travelled to Thailand twice to check out the surrogacy process, talking to agents about the legalities of the contracts. They were then asked for a sperm donation and waited with bathed breath to hear the news they desperately craved. After three failed IVF attempts, they were ready to throw in the towel. They were emotionally and financially exhausted but miraculously their fourth attempt worked and they were finally pregnant. 'It was getting really hard,' Shannon told Daily Mail Australia. After spending two years trying to father a child in Australia, the couple decided Thailand was their best option of ever having a baby . Chloe, Maddison and Dior were born three-months ago via a surrogate mother . 'We went to work one day and said to each other: ""have a think about it and when we came home if we both have the same answer we’ll do it again"". We came home and we both had the same answer so we gave it one more shot and it worked,' he said. The couple had never planned on having triplets. Initially they were told they were having one baby, then two and then an email came into Shannon's work address stating 'triplets at nine weeks'. 'I said to my boss ""hold on a minute, I need to read what I just saw"" and then I came home with the email and showed Peter', Shannon said. 'My jaw just dropped and then I laughed. I was happy I just thought wow, going from one to three’ Peter said. However, things took an unprecedented turn when their surrogate was six months pregnant. A Perth couple who had travelled to Thailand to bring home twins born via surrogate left the world reeling after they left their disabled son Gammy in Thailand. Desperately searching for answers, Shannon and Peter spent three weeks trying in vain to contact their surrogate agency. After two years of trying to conceive, the men were adamant they would not lose their girls. However, things took an unprecedented turn when their surrogate was six months pregnant. A Perth couple who had travelled to Thailand to bring home twins born via surrogate left the world reeling after they left their disabled son Gammy in Thailand . Internet whiz Shannon stumbled across a forum online for prospective surrogate parents. With over 500 members on the site it was a reassuring presence for the men, who would speak to people about what contact they had managed to make with Thai agencies. Their nerves grew as reports surfaced on the forum that some surrogate mothers were resorting to aborting their babies as they had not heard from the parents in weeks. As the weeks rolled on, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop stepped in. Posting on the forum, her government told the couples that she would speak to the Thai military. Shannon said the Minister helped them with the exhausting process, ensuring they were allowed access into the country and negotiated with the Thai government. 'She really helped us negotiate with the government and helped Australians in general' he said. 'When they said we could go through, that was the best thing ever because it was just getting so messy', he said. There were talks that the Thai government would bring in court orders where couples would have to wait six months before they would be allowed to bring their children back to Australia. As the weeks rolled on, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop stepped in. Posting on the forum, her government told the couples that she would speak to the Thai military . Finally, Shannon and Peter got their hands on the number for their surrogate mother. She was equally as pleased to talk to the couple, having sent out a prayer over Facebook, hoping the men would find her. With the help of their Thai friend, the couple managed to speak with her and she reassured them that their babies were still healthy and ready to meet their daddies. Three months later, their adorable baby girls Chloe, Maddison and Dior were born. After spending two months filling out streams of paperwork, Shannon and Peter were finally able to bring their babies home to Australia. Life at home would never be the same for Shannon and Peter. Jet-lagged and exhausted, the first-time parents didn't sleep for 24 hours. Their friends and family had told them that triplets would be challenging but the men didn't realise how demanding it would be. 'We had no idea. People were warning us but we just thought it won’t be any different because we’ll just go straight into a triplet situation without stressing because we won’t know any better,' Shannon said. Now at 12-weeks-old the couple admit that being the parents to triplets is demanding but rewarding. As the Gammy news broke around the world, Thai surrogate agencies went into lockdown, disconnecting their phones and shutting off email connections. The couple, from Kinglake West in Victoria, were worried sick that this could mean the end of their dream of having a family . Peter works eight hour days while Shannon stays at home with the triplets for 16 hours while on maternity leave for six months. The pattern has been tough on the parents and they are hoping a volunteer can provide them with some relief . ‘When they got home from Thailand we went 24 hours without sleep and we were just like zombies, nausea because of no sleep, no eating  and we were just looking at each,' Peter said. 'Its still hard because they're changing and when you want to sleep you just can’t get it,' he said. The parents admit that cooking a meal is out of the question when the girls are awake and they survive on just four hours sleep a night to get them through. 'With mum being here I could do a bit of house work and feed the two little puppies, but in general it takes it’s toll.' Peter returned to work a week after the triplets came home. His company offered him part-time work but he was unable to take them up on the offer, as the family would not be able to survive on a part-time wage financially. Now he works eight hour days while Shannon stays at home with the triplets for 16 hours while on maternity leave for six months. The pattern has been tough on the parents and they are hoping a volunteer can provide them with some relief. The world watched on in horror as baby Gammy was left abandoned by his Australian parents . It was reported that Wendy (left) and David (right) Farnell returned to Australia from Thailand with his healthy twin sister Pipah (centre) but left Gammy behind . The Multiple Birth Volunteer Support Foundation has put the call out for volunteers to help the couple. 'People are telling us that Shannon will never go back to work because the three girls are going to need him, so financially we've got to look at can we survive on one wage so if we can get help Shannon might be able to get back part-time,' Peter said. The pair are looking for an experienced child minder, who will not be expected to take care of the triplets on their own. The girls need to be fed every three hours and feeding, changing and baby-related chores will be involved in the role. 'We're pretty much looking for someone who's experienced. If we had a volunteer that comes in and works with mum, then we could sleep', Peter said. When asked if they have plans to expand their family, both Shannon and Peter laugh, content with their three little ladies for the moment.

Many amateur films are produced on iPhones every day, but this is said to be the first shown at a high profile event. Baker told The Verge: 'It was surprisingly easy. We never lost any footage.'

"She shocked audiences worldwide with her astonishing four-letter outburst this week - and now even her father has joking condemned Kim Sears' tirade, calling it 'disgraceful behaviour'. Nigel Sears, a coach and pundit, was asked about his daughter's expletive-filled howl as she watched tennis playing fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday. The 57-year-old joked 'she's always had a potty mouth - gets it from her mother of course' before expressing his surprise that Miss Sears' 'feisty' support had created such a furore. Scroll down for video . Expletives: Kim Sears appeared to unleash a foul-mouthed tirade while watching tennis playing fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday . Joked: Kim's father Nigel Sears said his daughter must have learnt her bad language from her mother . Speaking to EuroSport, he said: 'Quite amazing how much has been made of this - but it's pretty emotional in that box when you're close to someone... and it was a feisty match. 'They've been together a long time, and it just goes with the territory. Andy's a huge figure in the game, so naturally her association with him means there's always going to be a certain spotlight on Kim. 'I think by and large she deals with it extremely well.I think people are reading a lot into this.' Miss Sears sent Twitter into meltdown after the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych in one of several heated moments during the clash. Miss Sears sent Twitter into meltdown after the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych . As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k'. The clip, which was recorded after the camera zoomed in on Ms Sears, sparked an online frenzy, with hundreds both amused and shocked by the outburst from Murray's usually-demure other half. The tennis star quickly jumped to the defence of his fiancée and said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match. He told reporters: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal. 'The whole first set, everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable. 'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' Murray, pictured during Thursday's game, will now compete in the final at Melbourne Park for the fourth time . Defence: Murray quickly jumped to the defence of his fiancée and said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match . The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7. Luckily, there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident Ms Sears was deeply invested in the match. The highly-charged fixture was the first time Murray and Berdych had come head-to-head since the latter hired Murray's former trainer Dani Vallverdu. Mr Vallverdu helped Murray win his two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold before they stopped working together in November. The dynamic dominated the pre-match build-up, despite both players trying to quietly play down tensions between the two camps. But there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match, with Murray admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around Melbourne Park. Murray eventually beat the Czech in four sets, earning himself a spot in the coveted final this weekend. Speaking on court, he said: 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary. (L-R) Judy Murray, Kim Sears are her father Nigel watch Andy Murray play at Queen's Club back in in 2006 . Influential figure: Nigel Sears is not just the father of the future Mrs Andy Murray, but also a hugely well-respected coach in the women's game . 'This is sport, there is more to life and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension. 'It was there definitely at the beginning but I think everyone calmed down after the start of the match.' But the Scot also used his victory to heap praise on his coach, Amelie Mauresmo. He said: 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well. 'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it. 'I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.' Meanwhile, on the sidelines, Ms Sears was facing a tennis WAG-off against Berdych's tanned model partner Ester Satorova for the second day running. Much has been made of the rivalry between the two women, both of whom have recently got engaged to their tennis pros. The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7 . Murray eventually beat the Czech Thomas Berdych, pictured, in four sets, earning himself a spot in the coveted final this weekend . Murray and Berdych both proposed to their respective girlfriends  recently before presenting them with expensive diamond rings. The British No 1 proposed to Sears, his girlfriend of nine years last year with a 3.5 carat platinum diamond ring, which he is said to have selected himself. Murray's engagement ring to Sears has been valued at around £250,000 while Berdych's love token is estimated to be worth around £225,000 . U.S television coverage further built up the so-called 'battle of the bling', with ESPN displaying another split screen of Sears and Satorova, with added captions at the bottom showing the estimated worth of their rings. A 50-50 split screen was shown of Sears and Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova, after which Ms Sears appeared to mouth: 'Oh for f**k sake.' Due to marry: The pair, both 27, had been together for nine years when Murray proposed in November last year . Back on court, after coming out on top in a long exchange in the first set, Murray turned in the direction of Vallverdu, who sitting in his opponent's box, and let out a wild roar in celebration. Berdych was clearly incensed, giving the Scot a long stare as both players walked back to their courtside chair. Then, as Murray sat down, he pumped his fist towards his own box, to which Sears responded with a fist pump of her own. Moments later, Berdych complained to umpire Pascal Maria about the quality of the tennis balls, to which Murray responded: 'He always does this.' As Murray let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play, the big screens in Rod Laver Arena further added to the drama.

But Murray quickly hit back on the court, putting on a convincing display as he clinched the remaining sets 6-0, 6-3, 7-5. Afterwards,the handshake between the pair at the net was surprisingly civil.

"The businessman who forced Liam Fox to resign from the Cabinet by revealing he was travelling the world with a bogus 'adviser' is the secret paymaster behind a campaign to oust him as an MP. In 2011, it was revealed Dr Fox, the then Defence Secretary, had taken close friend Adam Werritty with him on 18 overseas trips as part of his official party, funded by private donors and business interests, and given him frequent access to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Dubai-based Harvey Boulter was first to disclose Dr Fox and Mr Werritty's unorthodox relationship and now The Mail on Sunday has learnt he has donated £30,000 to Ukip candidate Ian Kealey – Dr Fox's main opponent in his North Somerset constituency. Mr Boulter's intervention may prove decisive. North Somerset is high on Ukip's list of target seats, and it came top there in last year's European Parliament elections . As well as the donation, Mr Boulter is paying for a billboard poster to be displayed in the area. It shows Dr Fox and Mr Werritty together at the former's wedding accompanied by the slogan 'Vote Him, Get Him' Dr Fox's relationship with Mr Werritty erupted into controversy when it emerged the MP had allowed his friend to create the 'misleading impression' he had an official Government position. It was also revealed Mr Werritty had been Dr Fox's best man at his 2005 wedding. An inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell found Dr Fox had breached the Ministerial Code. As well as the donation, a UK company Mr Boulter controls is paying for a billboard poster to be displayed in the area. It shows the MP and Mr Werritty together at Dr Fox's wedding accompanied by the slogan 'Vote Him, Get Him'. Mr Boulter's intervention may prove decisive. North Somerset is high on Ukip's list of target seats, and it came top there in last year's European Parliament elections. Mr Kealey, 56, a nuclear physicist-turned-farmer, said yesterday: 'Harvey's generous donation is making quite a big difference, enabling us to get the Ukip message across with a series of newsletters and other campaign activities.' Following the scandal, Dr Fox, 56, resigned, apologising for 'errors of judgment' and mixing up his professional and personal loyalties . Mr Boulter said he believed North Somerset 'deserved better' than Dr Fox. He added: 'I believe it is true that Ukip is best positioned to unseat him.' If that happens it will be sweet revenge for Mr Boulter. Although his main revelations were unchallenged, Dr Fox sued him for libel over comments he made in an unbroadcast portion of a TV interview published online. Last year he settled and paid damages. Mr Werritty, 36, lived rent-free in Dr Fox's flat. He had no security clearance, but attended meetings inside the MoD on numerous occasions, and carried a business card which falsely claimed he was an official 'advisor'. The scandal began when he presented this to Mr Boulter at a meeting in Dubai to discuss a business deal with the MoD. Following the scandal, Dr Fox, 56, resigned, apologising for 'errors of judgment' and mixing up his professional and personal loyalties. Last night he said: 'I look forward to fighting the election on the issues that affect my constituents in North Somerset.'","In 2011, revealed that Liam Fox had taken friend with him on overseas trips .

'If you're inspired by programmes like the Great British Bake-Off or the Big Allotment Challenge and think you could do it too – you could turn your cakes into cash. 'So far we've helped people set up more than 60,000 new businesses through the New Enterprise Allowance, and many of these started out as someone's hobby. 'Thanks to the expert business mentoring provided through the scheme, we've helped set up culinary businesses ranging from cake makers and a pastry business, to olive oil producers and bakers. 'And other hobbies have seen success too - whether it's renovating old carrousel horses or designing greetings cards, thousands of people have turned their passion into a successful business, securing a better future for themselves and their families.' The New Enterprise Allowance helps jobseekers, lone parents and people on sickness benefits with a good idea to set up their own business. The most recent figures show the scheme has helped budding entrepreneurs set up over 60,000 new businesses, with help from a mentor and financial support payable through a weekly allowance. Over 4,000 young people, over 11,000 disabled people, and more than 14,000 over-50s have been helped to turn their hobbies into businesses. Recent research from online print and design company MOO – shows that Almost a fifth – 19 per cent – of Brits with a creative pastime have pledged to make 2015 the year they begin making money from their talents outside of their main job.","One in 10 with a 'creative' hobby  want to turn their hobby into a new career .

"These rusted and decaying railway tracks may seem like any of the thousands of feet of disused track that snake under midtown Manhattan. But this discreet siding, Grand Central Terminal's 'Track 61' - was once a vital tool in the arsenal of wartime President Franklin D Roosevelt - and could yet spring into action again. Hidden underneath the opulent Waldorf Astoria hotel, the secluded platform was one of many ways Roosevelt, stricken by polio and paralyzed from the waist down since 1921, would hide his affliction. Scroll down for videos . Secret siding: Pictured is Track 61 - a hidden portion of Grand Central Station - which functioned as a private way into the opulent Waldorf Astoria hotel for President Franklin D Roosevelt . Secluded: The underground passageway helped FDR avoid the press and public in a position where his paralysis might have been obvious. The exact location is kept a secret by the MTA . Secret: Roosevelt, pictured above on Presidential trains, was rarely pictured in a way that made his disability evident. Above, he is shown standing, but is supporting himself by holding on to railings . When visiting New York City, often from his childhood home in Hyde Park, upstate New York, the siding would allow him to make it to the Waldorf's Presidential suite without attracting public attention. His private railway car - at that point still the luxury travel option of choice - was able to pull inside the station, at which point his limousine could drive straight off the carriage into an elevator connected directly to the hotel. From here he could make it into his room where nobody could see him - particularly journalists who may have tried to break the veil of silence around his condition by taking pictures. Though the media generally agreed to avoid mentioning Roosevelt's paralysis out of choice, the arrangement was not unbreachable. Unfavorable outlets would on occasion draw attention to his illness, or publish pictures, much to the frustration of White House officials. Escape route: According to a book about the legacy of Grand Central, the secret siding is still kept manned when the President visits the Astoria as it is a viable escape route . Secret: The MTA does not disclose exactly where the track runs. An official from the authority reportedly stumbled across the Secret Service in the tunnel during a 2003 visit by George W Bush . Armored: FDR's railway car, coated with thick steel and bullet-proof glass, continues to sit in the siding and is pictured above . In front of the crowds: In the above image, FDR addresses a crowd in the 1940s. Secret Service agents would smash cameras and ruin film which showed the President obviously incapable of walking . Photographers of the day told stories of Secret Service agents smashing their cameras or exposing film to sunlight . Indeed, FDR's heavily-armored carriage, with bullet-proof glass and solid steel walls, still remains there to this day. Judging from the photographs, it may seem like the functionality of the platform belongs to the distant past. But the secluded siding is still ready to spring into action to save the president's life, and was reportedly on alert as recently as the Bush administration. Furtive: This staircase leads to an unknown part of the siding - and even photographs given access to Track 61 were not allowed down there . Grandeur: The opulent Waldorf Astoria, above, helped build the secret track for its highest-profile guests . According to Sam Roberts, the author of a book on Grand Central, a visit in 2003 by the chairman of the Metropolitan Transport Authority ended with a confrontation with Secret Service agents, who were guarding the track as a potential escape route. In remarks from Grand Central: How a Train Station Transformed America, reported by Slate last year, chairman Peter Kalikow described the surprising encounter, which came as George W. Bush visited the Waldorf before addressing the United Nations. He said that while exploring the tracks, 'several well-dressed, polite, but persuasively armed men in suits emerged from the underground shadows and stopped him.' When an aide pointed out 'it's his railroad', the agent simply responded 'not today'. The book also reports that whenever a President stays in the Waldorf, a fully-manned diesel train also waits underneath in case he needs to escape an attack.","'Track 61' was built alongside Grand Central for VIP guests to the Astoria .

"Broadchurch star Eve Myles, who plays Claire Ripley, has defended the show . Broadchurch star Eve Myles has hit back at critics who have accused the courtroom drama of being 'unrealistic'. Ms Myles defended the ITV show, adding writer Chris Chibnall 'did his homework' and consulted legal experts. The first series received wide-spread praise, but a highly-anticipated second series has been panned by fans and critics after a series of legal blunders and ludicrous storylines. Over the last few weeks the second series of the show has come under fire for its inaccuracies and unrealistic scenes. The first episode frustrated viewers with its ‘mumbling’ dialogue and the second was littered with legal blunders. Episode three included unrealistic scenes in which a mother appeared in court shortly after giving birth – and her baby appeared to be much older than a newborn. And in what disgruntled fans complained was the most far-fetched scene to date, David Tennant's character DI Alec Hardy was seen ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table at fast food chain Nando's. At the popular Portugese restaurant, customers actually order and pay at the till at the same time. Scroll down for video . Fans complained that the scene with DI Alec Hardy (played by David Tennant) and his family in Nando's was not true to life because a waiter came to take their chicken order . Beth and Mark Latimer were seen in court during the trial of Joe Millier, but witnesses would not be able to do so in real life . Grumbling fans have also complained they were struggling to understand David Tennant this series, with some accusing of using a stronger accent. But the 36-year-old actress, who plays Claire Ripley, told The Mirror: 'It's not as if Chris would go into something like this and not do his homework. I can guarantee he knows it inside out. 'But it is drama. You can't say that it's right or wrong. It's not a documentary, it's entertainment.' The mother-of-two added, despite the inaccuracy, she enjoyed seeing the Latimers in court as it heightened the drama. In one episode, Beth and Mark Latimer were present in court while Joe Miller went on trial for the murder of their son Danny. Witnesses would never be able to do so in real life. 'If people get angry about it, that's their thing,' she said. Describing the situation as a 'Catch 22', Ms Myles added the complaints were 'inevitable' with a second series of a successful show. Character Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker) was seen giving birth just hours before giving evidence in court . Viewers took to Twitter to complain about an unrealistic scene involving table service at a Nando's restaurant . Digging up Danny's corpse . What happened: Danny Latimer's parents Beth and Mark with prosecuting barrister Jocelyn Knight were horrified after Joe Miller's defence team got Danny's body exhumed on the flimsiest of grounds and without the prior approval of his family. But retired detective Graham Walker told the Mail on Sunday: 'The body belongs to the coroner and in these circumstances no coroner would allow an exhumation. You would have to consult the family beforehand. The only reason not to is if the entire family were suspects in the case.' Use of spy cameras . What happened: Hardy installs a number of hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller - where a terrified Claire is finally persuaded to meet her former husband - in the hope of getting a confession from Lee. Hardy installs hidden cameras and tape recorders in the house of DS Miller, but any confession obtained through these would be inadmissible in court . But Graham Walker explains: 'I'm afraid that any confession that is obtained through these means would be totally inadmissible in court. Of course, if you suspect somebody of an offence, you must caution them and tell them they have a right to remain silent.' The wrong wig . What happened: Sonia Sharma (Meera Syal) is the judge in the case of Joe Miller but the wig she wears is quite different from the short bench wig worn by a judge presiding over a trial in a criminal case. Why Beth would never have been interrogated about her sex life . What happened: The judge allows the defence barrister to question Danny's mother about her sex life and the affair her husband Mark had with a woman called Becca Fisher, even though it has no obvious connection to the murder. But criminal barrister Maria Dineen explains: 'The sort of questions that were being asked would not have been allowed. There is no relevance whatsoever.' Could Beth and Mark really select their own criminal barrister? What happened: Danny's grieving parents choose retired local lawyer Jocelyn Knight as their prosecution barrister. But legal expert Baroness Kennedy says: 'The whole thing about prosecutions is that they are brought by the state in the name of Queen. Danny's grieving parents would never have been able to choose their own prosecution barrister in real life . 'They are brought on behalf of society at large and the victim's family does not get to choose the barrister.' Witnesses can't stay to watch trial . What happened: Danny's parents Beth and Mark, along with the local vicar are among the witnesses for both the prosecution and defence who are all allowed to sit in court and listen to each other as they give evidence. But Maria Dineen says: 'Witnesses cannot sit through any part of the proceedings, nor can they be told about what is occurring in court at any part. They should never have been in court.' How come the new suspect turns up everywhere? What happened: Lee Ashworth (James D'Arcy) – who is the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions – has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up on the horizon and throwing menacing glances at Hardy. But bemused viewers have wondered exactly how Ashworth has been able to track down Hardy everywhere he goes so easily. Lee Ashworth (James D'Arcy), the prime suspect in the Sandbrook abductions, has displayed an uncanny habit of popping up everywhere . The newborn baby that can hold its head up at 24 hours old . What happened: Those who watched last night's show criticised a storyline in which new mother Beth Latimer, played by Jodie Whittaker, returned to the courtroom just hours after a home water birth. Viewers have pointed out that the baby then looked much too big to be a newborn and could even hold its head up at just 24 hours old. A one in 7,000 occurrence . Fans of the show have pointed out that it would be highly unlikely to see such a diverse courtroom - with a female Asian judge, a black woman defence counsel and a white female prosecution counsel. In 2010, 35% of barristers were women, and 10% were from ethnic minorities. Meanwhile in 2011, 22% of judges were women and 5% were from ethnic minorities. That makes the diversity likelihood of the Broadchurch trial a one in 7,000 occurrence. Suddenly more Scottish . Fans of the hit television drama Broadchurch have complained they are finding it harder to understand David Tennant - because his accent has become 'more Scottish'. The actor, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, received wide-spread praise for his performance in the first series of the acclaimed ITV crime show. But now, some vented their frustration on Twitter suggesting the Scottish actor is now using a stronger accent. Table service in Nando's . Viewers accused scriptwriters of adding in an unrealistic scene - table service from Nando's. Disgruntled fans complained after David Tennant was seen in the latest episode of the show, set in Dorset,  ordering chicken from a waiter who appeared beside his table. At the Portuguese fast food chain, customers order their food at the till and pay at the same time.

"The CIA conducted a joint operation with Mossad to kill a Hezbollah leader in a car bomb attack, it has been revealed. Imad Mughniyah, the pro-Iranian group's international operations manager, was killed in Damascus in February 2008 after having dinner at a nearby restaurant. The terrorist, dubbed the 'Osama Bin Laden of the eighties', was responsible for the deaths of more Westerners than any other militant until 9/11. U.S. military is said to have built the bomb used in the attack, but did not execute it. Scroll down for video . Militant leader: Imad Mughniyah, the pro-Iranian group's international operations manager, was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in February 2008 after having dinner at a nearby restaurant. A former intelligence official told The Washington Post the device was tested more than 25 times in a North Carolina training facility before the covert operation took place. He had been involved in some of Hezbollah’s most spectacular terrorist attacks, including those against the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the Israeli Embassy in Argentina . He also orchestrated the kidnap in Beirut of Terry Waite and other British hostages in the Eighties. The nature of the attack suggest Mughniyah was a target of extremely high-importance. He was believed to have been directly involved in funding Shiite militias in Iraq that were targeting U.S. forces and had sat down with some of the Middle East's most powerful men - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. For many years he had a $20million U.S. bounty on his head and had plastic surgery to change his appearance - making it easier for him to get around. Explosion: A TV still shows the moment the vehicle the man  dubbed 'Osama Bin Laden' of the eighties was caught in the vehicle blast . However the method may have breached international law. Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of international law at the University of Notre Dame, told The Post: 'It is a killing method used by terrorists and gangsters. It violates one of the oldest battlefield rules.' One official said before they carried out the attack, they had to prove there was a 'continuous threat' to Americans' and a number of high-ranking officials - including President George W. Bush - would have had to sign off on it. At the time, a State Department spokesman said: 'The world is a better place without this man in it. He was a coldblooded killer, a mass-murderer and a terrorist responsible for countless innocent lives lost. 'One way or another he was brought to justice.' Dangerous: Mughniyah is said to have been behind a number of terrorist attacks, including a bomb blast at the AMIA headquarters in Buerno Ares, Argentina - killing 85 people .","Imad Mughniyah was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in February 2008 .

"A Swedish company has implanted microchips in its staff which allows them to use the photocopier, open security doors and even pay for their lunch. It is hoped that eventually around 700 employees from the Epicenter hi tech office block in Stockholm may eventually have the chips implanted into the back of their hands. The chips use radio-frequency identification (RFID) and are about the same size as a grain of rice. Scroll down for video .

They store personal security information which can be transmitted over short distances to special receivers. RFID chips can already be found in contactless cards - including the Oyster system which is used by more than 10 million people to pay for public transport in London. They are also similar to the chips implanted in pets. Hannes Sjoblad, the chief disruption officer at the Swedish bio-hacking group BioNyfiken, which implanted the chips into the Epicenter workers, told The Times: 'We already interact with with technology all the time. 'Today it's a bit messy - we need pin codes and passwords - wouldn't it be easy to just touch with your  hand? RFID chips can already be found in contactless cards including  the Oyster system - which is used by more than 10 million people in London . 'We want to be able to understand this technology before big corporates and big government come to us and say everyone should get chipped - the tax authority chip, the Google or Facebook chip.' He says we will then be able to question the way the technology is implemented from a position of much greater knowledge. He added that they believe they have only just started discovering all of the things having a microchip could allow us to do. In 1999 Professor Kevin Warwick, of Reading University, had a chip implanted into his nervous system and was able to control a robot arm - developed by his colleague Dr Peter Kyberd - using thought power. It was hoped the technology could radically change the lives of amputees and victims of paralysis. Last year MailOnline reported a Brisbane man, Ben Slater, had one of the chips being use din Stockholm injected into his left hand through a syringe  at a Melbourne tattoo parlour. It means Mr Slater can swing his front door open, switch on his lights and store personal information with the flick of his hand. 'The most obvious thing the chip allows me to do is store my contact information on it, so that I can just touch a phone with NFC and pass my information to their phone. That is a great party trick,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But it can also trigger an action on my phone to turn the house lights off, open a secure door which is set to recognise the chip or I could - and probably will - set up my car ignition to be linked to the chip for keyless entry and start up.' Mr Slater told Daily Mail Australia he made the decision to implant the microchip because he had always been interested in the future of technology. 'I wanted to get the chip implanted to generate discussion,' he said. 'It intrigues me that we live in an age where this type of activity is even possible.' Mr Slater said the procedure to implant the microchip was painful, but over quickly. 'I just needed to be really careful when it was healing over the course of two weeks so that I didn't move it - otherwise it could have travelled in my hand,' he said.

"He may be be considered one of the most dangerous men in the world...but Kim Jong-Un showed he is in touch with his feminine side as he took a shine to this pair of cream high heels. The Supreme Leader of North Korea was on a tour of one of the country's shoe factories when he took part in an inspection of the workplace. The 32-year-old - who assumed control of the secretive state in late 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jong-Il - studied several pairs of shoes during his visit to the Wonsan Shoe Factory, approximately 130 miles from the capital of Pyongyang.

"Serena Williams proved why she reigns as the number one female player in the world - with a mid-match vomit not even putting her off her game to take out the Australian Open. In fact, Williams thinks that the coughing fit causing her to be sick, which the star admits has never happened before, may have actually helped snare her sixth Australian Open victory against Maria Sharapova on Saturday night at the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne. 'I think in a way that just helped me – I felt better after that. My chest was really stuck at that point,' The Sydney Morning Herald reported Williams as saying after winning the match: 6-3 7-6 (7-5). VIDEO Scroll down to watch Serena Williams beats Maria Sharapova . Serena Williams vomited (left) during the Austrlaian Open final but still managed to beat Maria Sharapova . The world number one women's player had been battling a cold throughout the tournament in Melbourne . The American champion was given cough syrup and had a coughing fit which caused her to vomit . There was a break in play for the roof to be closed due to rain but the 33-year-old, who had been battling a cold throughout the tournament, took a few minutes longer to return to the court. The American champion was given a small amount of cough syrup by a doctor to suppress the coughing. 'I was coughing so much. It was just forcing things out of me. So I was just trying to pull myself together,' she said. Williams admitted to experiencing a lot of ups and downs throughout the tournament. 'So I just thought – you know, I was somehow still in the tournament and now I somehow have won. So I don't know. It's really exciting,' she said.

Williams has now beaten the Russian 16 times in a row, a record dating back to 2004. A wet and chilly night in Melbourne was warmed by the feverish intensity between Williams and her nearest challenger, who could not break the American's long running dominance over her. Rain caused a delay at 3-2 in the first set that was added to by Williams having to receive medical attention for a coughing fit caused by the cold that has been plaguing her for most of the fortnight.

"Abuse: Lisa Brown received an offensive letter from Comcast when her bill was sent . Dummy, whore Julia and b**** dog. These are just some of the offensive names Comcast customer services have put on top of letters and bills addressed to consumers. They have been revealed just days after Comcast were forced to apologize for calling a patron who phoned up to complain A**hole Brown. Lisa and Ricardo Brown said they wanted to cancel the cable on their Comcast account - which cost them $60 - after suffering financial difficulties. When the couple, from Spokane, Washington, received their next bill, Mr Brown's name had been changed from Ricardo Brown to 'A**hole Brown.' And shockingly, when Mrs Brown tried to get the profanity removed and name corrected, she faced difficulties. In 2005, one woman had a similar experience when a Comcast invoice addressed her as a 'b**** dog'. Other customers, who sent their relabeled bills to customer advocacy writer Christopher Elliot, said their names had been changed to 'dummy' and another to 'whore'. Julie Swano says her December Comcast bill was addressed to 'Whore' Julia Swano. She was surprised as she had not contacted the company for weeks. Carolina Heredia also got in touch with the blogger after Comcast changed the label on her online account so it read: 'Hello, dummy.' Lisa and Ricardo Brown were shocked to receive this bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they tried to cancel their cable from Comcast . Sako Bezdjian said the name on his parent's bill had been myseriously changed to 'Fakoe Bez' after they downgraded their service, . He believes it is meant to be an insult that sounds like 'the f-word' as it had no resemblance to their actual monikers . Mrs Brown, who has been a Comcast customer for two years, told him: 'I was never rude. It could have been that person was upset because I didn't take the offer.' On his blog, Mr Elliot wrote: 'It's no secret that employees sometimes feel their customers are jerks. 'But I've never seen one put it in writing — until now.' Steve Kipp, Comcast's vice president of communications for the Washington region, apologized for the 'completely unacceptable' incident after being contacted by Mr Elliot. In a statement, he said: 'We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change. Carolina Heredia complained after her account name was changed, resulting in her her online profile introducing her as 'Hello, dummy' Julie Swano says her December Comcast bill was addressed to 'Whore' Julia Swano. She was surprised as she had not contacted the company for weeks . 'We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. 'We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.' Mrs Brown was contacted by Rhonda Weaver, a Comcast senior director of government affairs, who promised to waive the $60 cancellation fee. Ms Weaver also said Comcast was investigating the name change and would terminate the employee who was responsible. But Mrs Brown felt this was insufficient, adding: 'This is unacceptable. I am requesting everything back I paid Comcast for doing this to me.' Sako Bezdjian said the name on his parent's bill had been changed to be closer to 'the f-word' as it had no resemblance to their actual monikers . Mr Elliot reported that Comcast has offered the Browns a full refund of the two years' worth of bills they have paid. Comcast says it's investigating these incidents. In a blog post, it also promised it would be investing in technology to prevent future name-changing incidents. It has already terminated the entire subcontracting company responsible for the 'a**hole' incident. Comcast's senior vice president of customer service, Tom Karinshak, told Mr Elliot the company is taking steps to prevent unauthorized name changes from taking place in the future. He said: 'We're retraining our teams on the importance of making name changes properly. 'We're looking for automated solutions to prevent this from happening in the future.' Comcast says it will follow up with each customer, offer an apology and 'do whatever it takes to make things right,' says Karinshak.","Customer advocacy Christopher Elliot has revealed the names .

"Manchester City star Fernandinho has been banned from driving for six months after he was caught speeding twice in three days. The £100,000-a-week midfielder was snapped in his Mercedes travelling at 50mph in a 30mph zone on Pottery Lane in Ardwick, Greater Manchester on May 7 last year. Two days later, on May 9, the Brazil International triggered another speed camera on Chester Road, close to Manchester United’s Old Trafford home, travelling at 40mph in a 30mph area. Manchester City's Fernandinho has been banned from driving for six months for speeding twice in two days . The £100,000-a-week midfielder, pictured with wife Glaucia, was snapped in his Mercedes travelling at 50mph in a 30mph zone . The first offence happened on the same day City thumped Aston Villa 4-0 on their way to the Premier League title at the nearby Etihad Stadium. The 29-year-old, whose full name is Fernando Luiz Roza, accepted the charges through his lawyer at Manchester Magistrates Court. Magistrates were told that there had been a delay in responding to requests for information from police as the player was at the World Cup in his homeland when they landed on the door of his home. Fernandinho, who arrived at Manachester City in a £30million deal in 2013, lives in the leafy, footballer-filled Cheshire village of Prestbury with wife Glaucia and their young son Davi. The footballer, who already had six points on his licence from two other speeding offences, did not attend court.

According to Manchester Evening News Nick Terry, defending the footballer, told the court:'Mr Roza accepts he has made mistakes here. He has not been driving until he has confirmation of this result. 'Mr Roza does play for Manchester City but I would ask you to consider him as you would any other defendant.

"Most expectant mother's would laugh if someone were to ask them if they were a man or a woman because the answer may seem obvious. However, one simple question on a health questionnaire has the power to change the way society defines motherhood as a whole. A New York City Health Department form for parents requesting birth certificates now asks new mothers if they identify as male or female. The change in form is aimed at transgender women who may identify as male but still are able to give birth because of their female anatomy. Heath Department: A New York City Health Department Form for parents requesting birth certificates now asks new mothers if they identify as male or female . The form also asks the father what gender he identifies as but there is no 'giving birth' notation on the father's copy. Along with the gender question are standard questions such as name, age and social security number putting gender choice in as banal a category as a standard questionnaire as it because more of a social norm. The New York Post reports that while the question over 'sex' may seem shocking to some parents, it was created a few years ago as soon as same sex marriages became legal. Before the change on the form was made, married gay couples had to go to a courtroom to secure their name on birth certificates, something that often blocked their parental rights. In 2008 the then Governor David Patterson changed the form everywhere in New York state except New York City who reviewed their policy and made their own change in 2009. 'To be clear, it is possible for a person who has given birth to a child to identify as male,' said Susan Sommer, a lawyer for an advocacy group for lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgenders. 'A form that is respectful and doesn’t make assumptions about sex or gender of people parenting children is fine to me,' Sommer said. Same-sex couples are encourages to adopt because it grants them even more legal protection. The birth-certificate change is especially helpful in clarifying parental rights in a hospital nursery or while helping their kids apply to school.

"A judge has refused to enforce the prenup that was signed by a couple from New York that after the wife claimed she couldn't understand German. Swiss-born Nathalie Karg who was raised in a German-speaking household, told the couple's Manhattan divorce judge that the document 'was in German, a language I do not speak or understand well.' Her estranged husband, attempted to convince the judge that his ex-wife was lying. Duped? Nathalie Karg, above with her estranged husband, gallery-owner Anton Kern, says she signed a prenup at his family home in Germany but did not understand exactly what she was signing at the time . Chelsea gallery owner Anton Kern said even submitted evidence to the court in the form of an e-mail his wife wrote in German in 2012 to disprove his spouse's alleged fibbing. Mr Kern who runs the Anton Kern Gallery, is the son of famous German painter Georg Baselitz, whose work is exhibited at MoMA and the Guggenheim. He is said to be worth more than $360 million. Karg filed for divorce in 2012 and is demanding $15 million although it is not clear as to whether she will get any of money until after a divorce trial has  completed. According to the New York Post, Karg who also runs an art gallery claimed Kern's parents tricked her into signing the deal. Nein! The judge felt symptahy towards Swiss-born Nathalie Karg who told the couple's Manhattan divorce judge that the document 'was in German, a language I do not speak or understand well' Karg said Kern and his parents told her they only wanted to protect their own assets, such as the castle in which they lived. 'My parents are excited about the marriage, but you are not getting the castle,' Anton Kern allegedly joked before she signed the papers. It was only when Karg filed for divorce in 2012 that she discovered the specific details of the prenup which essentially left her with nothing after waiving the rights to her husband's fortune, estimated to be tens of millions of dollars. During a court hearing in Manhattan, Kern's father, Mr Baselitz said he never offered to provide Karg a written translation of the agreement and was 'not concerned with whether or not Karg understood or did not understand German.' In court papers released this week and obtained by the New York Post, Manhattan Supreme Court threw out the prenup noting that Karg's understanding was crucial. 'While it is clear the plaintiff is a savvy business woman, independent and strong-willed, it does not contradict the fact that she trusted, relied on and believed her fiancé when he translated the meaning of the agreement as being 'You are waiving all rights to his father's wealth,' Referee Sue Ann Hoahng wrote. 'She had no reason not to believe him. According to both parties, they were in love.' Whether Karg, who now runs a gallery on Great Jones Street, will actually get a share of her hubby's inheritance is an issue for an upcoming divorce trial.

Literally four hours before we moved to take her off life support,' her overjoyed son, Ryan Roberts, said of the incident, which happened on December 22 last year. However, Mrs Roberts's awakening was bittersweet. She quickly became aware that she faced the unimaginable question: Did she want to live without her hands and feet?' The rare and sudden bacterial infection - initially mistaken for the flu  - had left her with no choice but to agree to the amputation of her four limbs in order to survive, Live Well Nebraska reported. But incredibly, Mrs Roberts has embraced her life-changing future. She has not let her loss of limbs prevent her from fussing over her family - and she even plans to walk and drive again. 'I gave up on my mom, and she didn't give up on herself,' Ryan said, explaining how he and his family had been given the choice to amputate his mother's limbs or pull the plug and let her slip away. They had all opted to turn off the life support machine, he said.

Left, Mrs Roberts is pictured with her husband, Kent, and right, her 33-year-old daughter Andrea Kruger, who was brutally murdered in 2013 . Mrs Roberts's story was revealed on Thursday at a press conference. Her son, joined by Dr Patrick McCarville, of Methodist Physicians Clinic, decided to go public following numerous media inquiries. During the conference, Ryan revealed his mother fell ill with what she believed was the flu on December 12. However, her condition quickly deteriorated and she soon ended up in intensive care. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rare, potentially deadly medical condition caused by a bacterial infection. Although it has been linked to tampon use in women, the condition can affect men, children, and people of all ages. Sufferers are typically infected when bacteria enters their body through an opening in their skin, such as through a cut or wound. Symptoms of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome tend to appear suddenly and may be attributed to other illnesses, such as the flu. They include a sudden fever, low blood pressure, a headache, muscle aches, confusion, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, a rash, redness of eyes and seizures. For doctors, patients with the syndrome are medical emergencies. According to the National Institutes of Health, the condition is deadly in half of cases. Source: Healthline . There, she was diagnosed with Group A streptococcus, which led to toxic shock syndrome - a condition caused by bacteria and typically associated with younger woman and the use of tampons. It is not known where or how Mrs Roberts contracted the bacteria. Shortly after her admission to hospital, the grandmother-of-five fell into a coma. Her condition steadily worsened, according to Omaha World-Herald. Her limbs turned black and developed gangrene, her face often contorted in pain, blisters started to erupt all over her body and her kidneys and liver began to fail. She was placed on dialysis. 'Most people don't live into it as long as Teri did,' said Dr McCarville during the conference. On December 21, doctors were convinced that there was no hope and delivered the news to Mrs Roberts's friends and family, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help her with her recovery. They gave her relatives a choice: Amputate her limbs or remove the ventilator and let her slip away in a hospice. After hours of emotion-fueled talks, Ryan and his father, Kent, decided to pull the plug. During the conference, Ryan explained how the pair had weighed up the possibility of his mother remaining in a coma forever, and how she would feel about living a life as a quadruple amputee. However, just hours before they planned to turn off her ventilator and move her into a hospice, Mrs Roberts awoke, the New York Daily News reported. And she wanted to live. Ryan said he had been told the incredible news via a call from his father. 'He said, ""Mom woke up. She doesn't want to be with Andrea yet. She doesn't care if she loses her hands and feet"",' he said.

Ryan (pictured), joined by Dr Patrick McCarville, of Methodist Physicians Clinic, decided to go public following numerous media inquiries . The 35-year-old added: 'It was, by far, the best Christmas gift I've ever had.' In subsequent days, Mrs Roberts had her hands amputated a few inches above the wrists, while her feet were removed six to eight inches below the knee after  her body refused to reclaim any tissue. Now, she is on the long road to recovery. She will shortly be transferred from hospital to a rehabilitation center, where she will embark on a rigorous program to rebuild her strength.

"The pilot of the Air Asia plane which crashed into the Java Sea killing 162 people was out of his seat at the moment the plane stalled and was unable to stop the crash, sources have said. Two people close to the crash investigation  said Captain Iriyanto had gone to disconnect the faulty Flight Augmentation Computer at the time of the accident leaving co-pilot Remy Plesel in control. Investigators believe the computer malfunctioned during the flight, but instead of resetting it, the pilot climbed out of his seat and disconnected it from a circuit breaker located behind the co-pilot. Scroll down for video . Captain Iriyanto (left) got out of his seat to turn off a faulty computer, leaving co-pilot Remy Pelsel in charge. By the time he got back, the plane was plunging into the ocean, according crash investigation sources . During the few moments Iriyanto was out of his seat the co-pilot lost control. The plane climbed sharply, before either stalling or losing thrust, then fell almost straight down into the ocean below. By the time Iriyanto had managed to get back to his seat it was too late to save the aircraft. The Flight Augmentation Computer limits the movement of the plane, preventing pilots for pulling dangerous manouvres, rather like an electronic speed limiter in a car. One man familiar with the case said Mr Iriyanto had flown in the same Airbus A320 several days before the crash and was aware the device intermittently turned itself off. But even if the device had turned itself off it would not immediately affect the path of the aircraft. An A320 pilot, who did not wish to be named, said the device could be reset using a button on the dashboard, and struggled to explain why Mr Iriyanto would have felt it necessary to leave his seat. He said: 'To cut all power to it is very unusual. You don't pull the circuit breaker unless it was an absolute emergency. I don't know if there was one in this case, but it is very unusual.' Air Asia Flight QZ8501 plunged into the sea during a flight between Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore on December 28 killing everyone on board. Moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control to report a storm ahead and asked to be allowed to climb above it, but was told the airspace was too busy. The Airbus A320 climbed suddenly before falling almost directly down into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people on board. Rescue workers are still pulling the wreckage from the ocean (pictured) The aircraft's black box recorders have now been recovered from the seabed and are being examined for any clues they might hold on the plane's last moments. AirAsia said it would not comment while the matter was under investigation by the National Transportation SafetyCommittee (NTSC) of Indonesia. The NTSC has said it is too early to say what role either human factors or equipment may have played in the crash, which is still being investigated. The head of the investigation, Mardjono Siswosuwarno, told . reporters this week it was too early to say whether the accident . involved pilot error or a mechanical fault. The NTSC said on Thursday the jet was in sound condition and . all crew members were properly certified. Airbus declined to comment. Lawyers for the family of the French co-pilot say they have . filed a lawsuit against AirAsia in Paris for 'endangering . the lives of others' by flying the route without official . authorisation on that day.

"A star-studded  advert on how to help a choking baby has been credited with saving the lives of 12 children. The advert by St John Ambulance features the voices of David Walliams as a fairy princess and Sir John Hurt as a peanut, and warns of the risk posed to youngsters by everyday objects. Since The Mail on Sunday first reported on the advert's launch, it has been seen by 20 million people.

"Michelle Obama has hit out at movie director Michael Moore and other critics of the Oscar-nominated film 'American Sniper', saying it 'touches on the emotions and experiences' of many military families. Speaking at the launch of  '6 Certified' in Washington D.C. on Friday, the U.S. First Lady said that she was aware that the film has been accused of glorifying murder and serving as war propaganda. But she said: 'The number-one movie in America right now is a complex, emotional depiction of a veteran and his family. And I had a chance to see American Sniper this week on that long flight.

Mrs Obama was joined by Hollywood star Bradley Cooper - who portrays main character, late Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle, in the film - and media heavyweights for the '6 Certified' event. The initiative will allow TV shows and films to display an onscreen badge that tells viewers the show they're watching has been certified by the group 'Got Your 6' - military slang for 'I've got your back'. To be approved, the film or show must cast a veteran, tell a veteran story, have a story written by a veteran or use veterans as resources. And it must do so 'accurately and responsibility'. During the event, the 51-year-old FLOTUS said: 'We hope our country will welcome back our veterans - not by setting them apart but by fully integrating them into the fabric of our communities.' She then spoke in defense of 'American Sniper', which has become a $264 million global box-office sensation following its cinematic release on January 16. The film has gained millions of supporters. However, it has also weathered a growing storm of criticism because of the acts of war committed by Kyle - whose autobiography the movie is based on - as well as its portrayal of Islamic people. Speaking out: Mrs Obama told attendees: 'The number-one movie in America right now is a complex, emotional depiction of a veteran and his family. And I had a chance to see American Sniper this week on that long flight' Difference in opinion: She continued: 'While I know there have been critics, I felt that, more often than not, this film touches on many of the emotions and experiences that I've heard firsthand from military families over these past few years.' Above, Mrs Obama at the event (left) and Michael Moore (right), who criticized the film . Angry: Taking to Twitter in rage, Moore seethed of 'American Sniper': 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse' On the same day the Clint Eastwood-directed film hit U.S. cinemas, Moore - director of Fahrenheit 9/11 - courted controversy by slamming snipers as 'cowards' who 'shoot you in the back' Taking to Twitter in rage, Moore seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Kyle, whose widow, Taya, attended the movie's premiere, was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills, which is the most in American military history. He claimed to have shot down 255. The film reveals not only how the sniper, who joined the SEALS in the late nineties, became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him. Raised in rural Texas, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, in 2004, and it was during the battle for that city where he made his mark.

Couple: The film reveals not only how the sniper, who joined the SEALS in the late nineties, became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him. Above, Cooper with his on-screen wife . However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that he gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired. He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry. In February 2013, the sniper was shot dead, alongside a friend, by a soldier they were trying to help who was apparently suffering from severe post-traumatic stress. Despite Moore's condemning tweet, he went on to describe Eastwood as a 'great filmmaker' on his Facebook page, saying that his movie 'Unforgiven' is his favorite Western of all time. However, he later wrote: 'But something started to go haywire with Clint in the last decade.' He then further criticized 'American Sniper' as a 'mess of a film that  perpetrates a 'racist sentiment to Arabs' Speakers: Sarah Schechter (left), President, Berlanti Productions, and Lori McCreary (right), Co-President, Producers Guild of America, are pictured speaking at the launch at the National Geographic Society on Friday . Following Moore's online rants, Sarah Palin was among many high-profile people to defend 'American Sniper', calling out the director for his 'disrespect' of U.S. troops. Moore won an Oscar in 2002 for his documentary Bowling For Columbine, exploring gun violence in America and the main reasons for the Columbine High School massacre. He is outspoken in his views against firearms and has previously described America's national symbol as the gun, not the bald eagle. During Friday's '6 Certified' launch, representatives from Warner Bros, National Geographic Channels and the Producers Guild of America were in attendance. Chris Marvin, managing director of 'Got Your 6 'and an ex-U.S. Army officer and Blackhawk helicopter pilot, said the campaign does not aim to show veterans in a good light - but in an honest one. 'Most Americans tell us that they only see veterans portrayed as broken or as heroes who walk on water in film and television,' he told the Associated Press via phone. 'We're missing something in the middle. Veterans are everyday people. They're your next door neighbor who helps you bring your garbage cans back when they blow away. 'They're your kids' fifth-grade math teacher. It's the person running for city council. You see them every day in your own life but you don't see them on film or television.' Launched in 2012, the 'Got Your 6' group aimed to enlist Hollywood to help discourage stereotypes and promote more accurate portrayals of the 2.6million soldiers coming home over the past decade. Surveys have found that many Americans presume veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, are homeless or are addicted to drugs or alcohol. The group has taken lessons from other successful efforts to change national viewpoints, including increasing gay rights, reducing teen pregnancies, encouraging colonoscopies, improving animal rights and reducing drunken driving. It has identified Hollywood as an engine of cultural change. Advocating 'accurate' portrayals of veterans: Courteney Monroe (left), CEO, National Geographic Channels U.S., and Bruce Cohen (right), producer of 'American Beauty' and 'Silver Linings Playbook', are seen at the event . Creator: Charlie Ebersol (pictured), President and CEO of The Company, created the '6 Certified Program' 'This is more of a challenge than anything else. We're challenging the entertainment industry — myself included - to live up to the responsibilities inherent in the powers we have and with the reach that we have,' said Charlie Ebersol, a producer and creator of the '6 Certified' program. Ebersol said films like 1987's 'Full Metal Jacket' by Stanley Kubrick and Clint Eastwood's new 'American Sniper' would likely be eligible for certification because they portray veterans accurately, even if the soldiers in those films aren't representative of the population of veterans. Mrs. Obama cited TV shows including 'Nashville' and 'Doc McStuffins' as ones that share stories of 'our veterans in new and meaningful ways.' During the high-profile event, she said telling veterans' stories honestly makes for 'tremendous TV and movies' and 'are good for business as well.' Director: Despite Moore's condemnation of 'American Sniper', he has described Clint Eastwood (pictured) as a 'great filmmaker' on his Facebook page, saying that his movie 'Unforgiven' is his favorite Western of all time . Ebersol had his own list of shows with positive veteran portrayals, including the Jay Pritchett character in 'Modern Family,' Sam Waterston's portrayal of veteran Charlie Skinner on 'The Newsroom' and Seth Rogen's guest role as a veteran on 'The Mindy Project.' In all of them, being a veteran was not their defining characteristic. 'We have a real opportunity to go way beyond the platitudes of the entertainment industry,' he said. 'We love to say, ""I support the troops!"" and ""I've got a yellow ribbon!"" but there's an actual, tangible way to make a difference. That's what the challenge is here.'","Michelle Obama spoke at launch of '6 Certified' project in Washington D.C.

"Catherine Mayer claims she met Prince Charles and spoke to his closest aids for her new book . The office of Prince Charles has distanced itself from claims that a controversial new book was written with its co-operation. American Catherine Mayer says she met the Prince and spoke to his closest aides while researching Charles: The Heart Of A King. A journalist with Time magazine, Ms Mayer paints a picture of Clarence House torn apart by turf wars and describes the future King grappling with insecurities and struggling to control his courtiers and their infighting. But Kristina Kyriacou, Prince Charles's head of communications, said yesterday that the publishers had overplayed suggestions of official co-operation. She told The Mail on Sunday: 'It is not an official book. The author did not have the access as claimed. Clarence House has no further comment.' Royal sources said Ms Mayer did attend a dinner with the Prince, but was one of 75 guests and had no access to the top table. Like other journalists, she joined the Royal rota to cover Prince Charles at work. To suggest there was intimate access is overblown. Ms Mayer's biography is one of three forthcoming books claiming to offer new detail about Charles, including one by American Sally Bedell Smith, who has written biographies on the Queen and Princess Diana. One source said there seemed to be a 'race' between the two women to publish first. 'Perhaps that is why Catherine Mayer is claiming to have had more access than she did. Both books are unofficial,' he said. Tony Blair's former spin-doctor Alastair Campbell is also bringing out a book which claims to have new information about Charles. Publishers say Ms Mayer's book reveals 'a man in sight of happiness yet still driven by anguish' with 'views that mean he will never be as impartial as his mother'. Ms Mayer's book – extracts of which were published on Kindle and in The Times yesterday – suggests Clarence House is riddled with 'glaring systemic weaknesses'. She also writes that any criticism of the Prince, who is known to courtiers as 'the Boss', can send him spiralling into 'despair', while turf battles between Charles's staff 'are common and bloody'. The office of Prince Charles, pictured above with the Duchess of Cornwall, say that Mayer did not have the access she claims . 'One former householder refers to Clarence House as Wolf Hall,' she says. According to Ms Mayer, much difficulty is caused by Charles's inability to create clear roles for his staff. He is accused of causing turf wars by failing to set courtiers clear boundaries. But close sources dismiss these claims. 'Anyone who visits Clarence House always say what a happy ship it is. The staff don't recognise Mayer's claims. 'It is convenient, isn't it, that the television adaptation of Wolf Hall is doing well now as the book comes out.' Distance: Charles with PR Chief Kristina Kyriacou, who says new book by Catherine Mayer, left, is not official . Despite his current PR headaches, Charles is continuing to trust press team leader Kristina Kyriacou with nurturing his public image. Kyriacou, 48, has recently signed a new contract and a source said: 'The Prince is delighted. She is the bedrock of his communications team.'","Prince Charles office say new Catherine Mayer's book is not official .

California Department of Corrections spokesman Jeffrey Callison previously stated that the wedding would have to take place on a visiting day, which happen on Saturdays, Sundays and certain holidays (including Thanksgiving). Callison said the couple would be allowed 10 guests from outside the prison, two guests from inside the prison and an officiant of their own choosing. However, the two are not be allowed to consummate their marriage since Manson's life in prison sentence bans him from receiving conjugal visits. In previous interviews, Star gushed about falling in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teen, and how she already considered herself married to him. n previous interviews, Star said she fell in love with Manson and his 'philosophy' as a teenager .

Manson has been in prison for the last four decades, after he and four disciples of his doomsday cult carried out a series of murders in 1969. One of their victims was Roman Polanski's actress wife Sharon Tate, who was butchered to death in her upscale southern California home when she was eight and a half months pregnant. Manson and his disciples were initially sentenced to death, but later had those sentences commuted to life in prison. In 2012, he applied and was denied parole, and cannot apply again until 2027 which means the couple have little chance of living together in matrimony. Manson has been married twice before, first to Rosalie Jean Willis from 1955 to 1958 and then to Candy Stevens from 1959 to 1963. Star has also been compared to one of Manson's disciples Susan Atkins, known as 'Sexy Sadie', who was also convicted of participating in eight of the August 1969 killings. Manson and his 'Family' of disciples carried out a series of murders in August 1969, which they thought would bring about a 'Helter Skelter' race war. The murders were centered on affluent Los Angeles neighborhoods, which they tried to pin on African American.","Afton Elaine Burton was pictured fabric shopping and looking at white satin, possibly for her upcoming wedding .

"A former Wall Street intern who left a top financial firm to pursur a career in porn has landed a six-figure adult movie deal just two weeks after quitting her job. Veronica Vain, a.k.a. Paige Jennings, left Lazard Asset Management earlier this month after co-workers saw nude selfies she took in the office bathroom  online. The 23-year-old has since been trying to kick start her career in the adult industry and has been offered the chance to star in a porn film called 'Screwing Wall Street'. She also admitted that since her change in career path, her boyfriend and mother have been very supportive. Scroll down for video . Career path: Veronica Vain, a.k.a. Paige Jennings, (pictured at the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas) has signed a six-figure deal to star in her first adult movie just two weeks after she left . Debut: The 23-year-old is set to start filming the first scenes of 'Screwing Wall Street' this weekend . Vain would not reveal the name of who she was dating during an interview with Business Insider, but said he was Ivy-League educated and living in New York. 'He's not the type of guy you would think would date a porn star. He's a normal guy with an office job.' It will be parody of the 1987 movie Wall Street - which starred Michael Douglas - and will be produced in partnership with arrangementfinders.com. Vain told the site it will be 'revolutionary and disruptive'. She also believes there is a huge market for 'sin products' such as non-traditional dating sites, lingerie and condoms and alcohol that mainstream marketing has rejected. Vain made the headlines a fortnight ago after she revealed her boss told her not to come in because 'just about everyone had seen me half-naked online'. Success: Since leaving the financial firm she has been trying to kick start her career in the adult industry and appeared on Inside Edition (right) According to Business Insider, in June she started as a part-time intern in alternative-investments marketing at the group in Manhattan. The Florida University graduate insisted that when the selfies surfaced she was not fired and left her position willingly. She is to believed to have already handed in her two weeks notice when she started sneakily taking pictures in the toilets. Her Twitter description reads: 'I just left a job on Wall Street for a porn career because I can't stop masturbating at work.'

Jennings is now looking to kick start her career and has made it into the final casting of the X-rated Internet reality show, 'The Sex Factor.' The porn competition which is set in Las Vegas and will be aired globally is scheduled to be hosted by Duke University porn star Belle Knox. In an interview with Bro Bible, she said she did not expect her colleagues to see the explicit images because they were not attached to her name. She said: 'Few people close to me knew what I was up to, but I firmly disbelieve they said anything, so I honestly have no idea how they came across it. So many people found out so fast, it is taking me for quite the spin. On her decision to chose a new career path, she said: 'Intellectually speaking, I love financial analysis and thinking. 'However, I found that I was not cut out for the politicking required to be successful, and sitting at a desk for eight or more hours a day really sucks the life out of you. 'More poignantly, it seems that being openly sexually confident and respectable are mutually exclusive in the corporate world for a woman, and that seriously irritates me. 'So I started exploring other options that weren't so stringent structurally. To quote Steve Jobs: 'You've got to find what you love'.' 'My boss's boss called me over the phone with a HR lady. I had a pretty good reputation intellectually, and this executive was aware of that. However, he obviously couldn't have me coming back to the office when likely just about everyone had seen me half naked online.' She had previously worked as a stripper but did not think that it was a 'viable career path'. The Daily Mail Online has contacted Miss Jennings and Lazard Asset Management for comment.

"Tony Abbott took a break amid the mounting pressure on his leadership to take a ride with Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, as three potential candidates emerged to take over as leader of the Government. The Prime Minister's leadership has been the subject of increasing speculation following a series of unpopular decisions capped by the controversy over his decision to knight  Prince Phillip. Amid backbencher disquiet Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and former Howard government cabinet minister Mal Brough have emerged as potential candidates to take over as leader of the Liberal party. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott took a break amid the mounting pressure on his leadership to take a ride with Tour de France winner Cadel Evans on Saturday . The latest sign of pressure on Mr Abbott is an expected announcement on Monday watering down his signature policy, the controversial Paid Parental Leave scheme, which has received significant criticism for being to expensive. Mr Abbott played down speculations of turmoil within the Liberal party on Saturday,  as he participated in the People's Ride as part of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. After handing out a knighthood to Prince Phillip last week, Mr Abbott gave himself a title- MAMIL, a middle-aged man in lycra, maintaining he was still in touch with ordinary Australians. 'I'll be mixing with hundreds if not thousands of people,' the Prime Minister said on Friday. 'I'm sure along the way I'll be stopping at a cafe along with the other MAMILs, as I believe we're described,' he said. 'I am regularly in contact with the Australian public and sometimes it is good news they give me, sometimes it is not good news that they give me.' Mr Abbott played down speculations of turmoil within the Liberal party on Saturday . Mr Abbott participated in the People's Ride as part of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race . The Prime Minister referred to himself as a MAMIL- a middle-aged man in lycra . His comments come as reports that Mal Brough has been approached to pave the way for Liberal party leadership contenders, rumours which Mr Brough did not deny. A challenge by Mr Brough is seen by some within the Liberal Party as an effective way to highlight dissatisfaction with Mr Abbott and push leadership change to the front of business. 'Clearly people are talking to each other because we are all interested in doing what's best for the nation,' Mr Brough told Fairfax Media. An unnamed MP said that while neither Ms Bishop, Mr Turnbull, or Mr Morrison had put their names forward, 'if one of them put their hand up things would happen very quickly'. Mr Abbott's speech to the National Press Club on Monday will aim to placate the party's waves, as the Prime Minister looks to announce the changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme. 'My job regardless is to get on with delivering for the people of Australia a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia,' he said. Mr Brough, Ms Bishop and Mr Turnbull have emerged as potential candidates to take over as Liberal leader . Cadel Evans at Saturday's People Ride as part of the Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race . Under Mr Abbott's original which would have paid 26 weeks of full wage to mothers, as opposed to the current scheme, Introduced by Labor, which pays mothers 18 weeks of the minimum wage. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry boss Kate Carnell believes the scheme should be postponed completely until the budget is back under control.

"A mother-of-two has been found stabbed to death at her home - directly opposite the house of a father jailed this week for killing a prostitute after a botched penis enlargement. Company director Emily Munemo's body was discovered just yards from the house of twisted killer Michael Wenham who was yesterday jailed for life for killing a prostitute. Police were called to the house in Hillingdon, London, following reports of a stabbing and paramedics were sent out but could not save Ms Munemo's life. A mother-of-two has been found stabbed to death at her home in Hillingdon, London - directly opposite the house of a father jailed this week for killing a prostitute after a botched penis enlargement. Road pictured . She died around an hour after their arrival. Murder detectives have swept the house for clues and a 35-year-old man was arrested in Hayes on suspicion of murder - and was today being quizzed by officers at a West London Police station. A police spokesman confirmed inquiries were still ongoing, but it is not believed the attack was linked to Wenham's trial. Police forensic teams dressed in white overalls were today seen at the £305,000 two storey house. Company director and health worker Emily Munemo set up Muney Ltd in October 2012 and ran the business from her home, where she had lived in 2008. Within hours of Ms Menemo's death, her neighbour Michael Wenham was jailed for gruesomely murdering young prostitute Karolina Nowikiewicz. Close by: Ms Munemo's body was discovered just yards from the house of twisted killer Michael Wenham (L) who was yesterday jailed for life this week for killing Karolina Nowikiewicz (R) Father of three Wenham nearly decapitated his Ms Nowikiewicz with a Stanley knife in a 'chilling and brutal' attack based on a gory horror film after a botched penis enlargement operation left his genitals two inches smaller. A judge heard Wenham, aged 36, had flown to the USA for £15,000 penis enlargement operation, but the botched surgery resulted in it shrinking by two inches and he flew out for a second operation a month before the attack. The bisexual also had fantasies about becoming a serial killer and had his wife of eight years Dawn, aged 34, humiliate him by saying how small his penis was. Police forensic officers working at the scene of the previous killing on the same Hillingdon road last February . The killing closely resembled the climax to the film, in which a group of American backpackers are lured into an eastern European hotel and tortured. An expert psychologist told the court he believed that Wenham's overactive libido had been transformed into a homicidal rage because he was unable to satisfy his sexual desires following the failed operation.

"Melissa Odabash makes 'look at me' bathing suits – the sort of thing that celebrities turn to when they want to get noticed on the beach. Her boutiques are not, you might imagine, the first place a woman would visit when shopping for swimwear after a mastectomy. Well, that's set to change. Later this month, Melissa unveils a characteristically sexy range designed with the unique needs of post-breast cancer surgery patients in mind. And if the reaction already generated on social media is anything to go by, it's going to be a hit. Sky presenter Jacquie Beltrao is the face of the range, which is raising money for the charity Future Dreams. The 49-year-old ex-gymnast, who bravely spoke about her brush with breast cancer in these pages last year, has been photographed wearing the costumes – and looks stunning. Scroll down for video . Sky presenter Jacquie Beltrao )pictured) is the face of Melissa Odabash's debut mastectomy swimwear range, which is raising money for the charity Future Dreams . 'I was daunted, of course – what woman wouldn't be?' she admits. 'But I wanted to do it because of the fact I don't look as perfect as many of Melissa's other models. It's better that I'm up there with my normal lumps and bumps because this is what a woman looks like.' Jacquie discovered a tumour in her right breast in December 2013 and underwent a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction a month later. She also had chemotherapy and is currently clear of cancer. 'I had a reconstruction using animal tissue and a small implant, so there is very little scarring,' she says. The 49-year-old ex-gymnast, who bravely spoke about her brush with breast cancer in these pages last year, has been photographed wearing the costumes – and looks stunning . 'You'd probably not be able to tell unless you looked closely – I think I just look like I have pretty good boobs for a woman who's had three children. But still I wouldn't wear a very low-cut bikini top as you'd see the scars. And everyone is different. You might have one or both breasts removed. Some women don't have an immediate reconstruction. Some can't and some choose not to.' Melissa first pondered the difficulties women face after her sister Jamie needed a mastectomy a decade ago. 'It's especially hard if you have one breast,' she says. 'The only option to make things look even is an insert, but it's so difficult to get these to look natural next to the real breast. We've worked really hard on finding the right weights of fabrics and padding.' The designs are made from a soft microfibre fabric and there are no seams or wiring. 'They look like my usual designs, but have a little bit more fabric here and there,' adds Melissa. 'They're cut a bit higher on the chest, and they have slightly wider shoulder straps as often women are left with scars there too from the surgery.' One woman who has welcomed the range is life coach Lucy O'Donnell, who was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer in 2011, aged 47, and underwent a mastectomy the following year. Jacquie discovered a tumour in her right breast in December 2013 and underwent a mastectomy, pictured with Melissa Odabash (right) The author, whose book Cancer Is My Teacher was serialised in The Mail on Sunday last year, says: 'I have always loved swimming and was depressed after my mastectomy to find the bathing costumes available for women like me seemed… well, let's call them functional at best. 'A friend jokes that when she wore hers, she'd often look down to see one of her breasts sitting somewhere around her midriff. Melissa's designs work brilliantly, and are stunning.' Jacquie, who tested a couple of the designs on holiday in Brazil over Christmas, admits she would never have posed in a swimsuit had she not had cancer, but says she felt 'liberated' by the modelling experience. 'I hope women who might be where I was a year ago – coming to terms with a diagnosis of cancer and facing surgery, worrying that they will be mutilated – will see them and think, yes, there is hope.' Melissa Odabash Future Dreams Collection will be launched at Fenwick's on February 10, and will be available at netaporter.com from March. All swimsuits cost £150 and proceeds go to Future Dreams. The designs are made from a soft microfibre fabric and there are no seams or wiring . In the grand scheme of things, whether or not a woman with cancer can buy a fancy designer bikini might seem low on the list of priorities. But part of recovery from cancer is learning to feel normal again. As Lucy O'Donnell points out on this page, just because she's had a mastectomy doesn't mean she wants to start shopping for clothes from medical catalogues. Right from her diagnosis, Jacquie approached her breast cancer with a wonderfully positive mental attitude. But she also spoke openly of her fears of losing her hair, and her breasts (both of which she did) – of appearing to be 'a cancer victim' to the outside world. She's better now, and most importantly at this point, she looks it too.","Melissa Odabash is launching a range for those post-breast cancer surgery .

"Hearing the roars of lions only meters from your bed would normally be a cause for concern, but for the guests at Jamala Wildlife Lodge, waking to the sounds of the safari is all part of the experience. Nestled in the heart of Canberra, the Jamala Wildlife Lodge at the National Zoo and Aquarium offers a taste of South Africa, all from the comfort of luxury accommodation. Daily Mail Australia took an intimate look inside the Australian capital's newest, and most unique, wildlife encounter. Scroll down for video . Jamala Wildlife Lodge at the National Zoo and Aquarium offers a taste of South Africa, all from the comfort of luxury accommodation (Sun bear Jungle Lodge seen above) The Lodge consists of 18 rooms built around the zoo, all of which offer a different, but still up-close, experience of the animals that is unlike anything else offered around the world. Arguably the most spectacular are the jungle bungalows, which are built right up against the side of either the sun bear, brown bear, or lion enclosure. One wall of the bungalow is made entirely of glass, looking out over the animals domain, and with a room cut into the hut where the animals sleep. Imagine waking up and seeing a 240 kilogram white lion staring at you as you struggle to remember where you are, or, as some guests have done, pulling sheets and blankets to lay on the ground next to the glass to sleep just centimeters away from the African kings. The Ushaka Lodge, a word which means 'shark', boasts a wall of it's namesakes built into the structure of the large and luxurious resort-style manor. Split over two levels, the Lodge offers family-sized rooms and is built over the zoo's aquarium, and up against the lodgings of one of the zoo's many primate enclosures. Leather couches and carved wooden chairs offer spots to sit, drink a cup of tea, have a snack, meet new friends, and simply soak in the atmosphere of the perfectly crafted safari lodge. All of the rooms are decorated to encourage the sense of an escape to Africa, decorated with plush couches in sand hues, stunning wall mosaics in the shape of giraffes or fish, and filled with delicate and one-of-a-kind pieces which were handpicked by one half of the zoo's founding team, Maureen Tindale. The morning private tour includes waking up the jungle's resident tigers . The afternoon private tour of the National Zoo gives guests the opportunity to meet and feed animals . Even snakes are part of the experience- the informed zoo keepers double as tour guides for guests . Maureen, along with her husband Richard, run the privately owned zoo, and have lived on the grounds for 14 years. Passionate about educating more people about the need to protect and preserve endangered species, the Tindale's see the launch of Jamala Wildlife Lodge as a way to provide personal encounters with the creatures they love. The funds raised from the Lodge will funnel straight back into the zoo's breeding program, in the hope that greater awareness will lend itself to greater preservation of some of the world's rarest animals. 'You get a lot of emotional reward from caring for the animals. It's great when you can take animals from bad situations and give them room to breathe,' Richard told Daily Mail Australia. Many of the animals in the zoo are rescue animals, including the white lions, Mishka and Jake, who Richard found in a 'tiny little enclosure' at just ten months old. The pair now recognise him and will come when he calls them, to the delight of guests. 'When you get them out of there, once you give them a bit of love and attention they really respond,' Richard said. The Ushaka Lodge has been lovingly decorated by one half of the zoo's founders, Maureen Tindale . The Ushaka Lodge is built around the wall of the zoo's aquarium and boasts six master bedrooms . The Lodge offers a place to relax and enjoy refreshments, while looking out on either sharks or monkeys . The couple transformed their family home, in which they raised six children, into the Ushake Lodge to offer others a small taste of the joy they get from living alongside the animals. 'We lived here for 14 years and we thought they'd have to carry us out. We brought up six kids, and it is our home,' said Richard. 'But as much as we love it, we thought it was too good to keep to ourselves. We wanted other people to be able to use it,' he said. The lodgings have been thoughtfully designed to interact with the surrounding environment, enfolding guests in a luxury cocoon which breaks as soon as the door is open onto the zoo. Just outside the door is the National Zoo's well-loved aquarium and animal enclosures, a space which is growing by the day as the attraction expands and more animals are introduced. From meercats, monkeys, and marsupials, to giraffes, rhinos, and zebras, the zoo is filled to the brim with animals to learn about and observe. Staying overnight in the Jamala Lodge includes two private tours around the zoo, including an early morning expedition to pat rhinos, feed antelope, and wake up tigers. Feeding Hummer, the 1.2 tonne giraffe, is part of the afternoon tour . The morning tour also includes an exclusive look at the new half of the zoo, including the painted dog enclosure . For guests staying in the Master Suite of the Ushaka Lodge, a shark experience from a private jetty is included . The guides are charismatic and informative, genuinely passionate about the work that the zoo is doing and the international programs it is involved with. The tours also include an exclusive look at the zoo's newest residents, which are still secluded from the public in the newly built second half of the zoo. The National Zoo is in the process of introducing more giraffe, cheetahs, painted dogs, leemurs, and other exotic creatures. It's not just the interaction with the animals that make the stay special, however, as no expense has been spared to create a five-star hotel stay in the midst of a safari environment. For those staying in the Ushaka Lodge, there is an open bar 24-7, with refreshments- including unlimited alcoholic beverages- available the entire stay. The Lodge's infinity pool is right outside the doorstep, and overlooks both the zoo and Lake Burley Griffin . The rooms have been decorated to encourage the feeling of being in South Africa . The bathroom is completely tiled, and incorporates a luxurious spa bath situated in front of a TV with Foxtel . The meals are generous, incorporated into the timetable in a way that provides a chance to relax and meet other guests. After a break of several hours, which gives guests a chance to luxuriate in the spa bath, dip in the infinity pool, or continue wandering around the zoo, pre-dinner drinks are offered out on the Lodge's terrace. Champagne, top-tier wine, and other beverages can be enjoyed while overlooking the zoo, as the hyenas make themselves available for feeding just metres away. Jake and Mishka, the white lions, also make an appearance in time for dinner, entering the specially designed glass enclosure which adjoins the dining room. The communal dining area is situated in an expansive room, converted from the old aquarium, fronted on two sides by animals just behind glass who curiously paw at the windows as guests walk by. 'The interaction between the venue and the animals is a fantastic plus,' said Peter O'Loughlin, who stayed overnight with his wife Kerrie. 'Lions coming up and watching you eat dinner and hyenas looking over shoulder is completely unique,' he said. The three-course dinner is a selection of traditional South African fare, including a seafood and tapas entree, roasted meats and fresh salads for mains, and cheese, fruit, and a native version of sticky date pudding for dessert. Pre-dinner drinks and entertainment: the zoo keepers feed the hyenas just moments before dinner is served . During the traditional South African three-course meal, lions and hyenas overlook and interact with guests . The Ushaka Lodge boasts an open bar which offers wine, beer, and other beverages 24-7 . After dinner, guests have free roam of the zoo and aquarium, and for those lucky enough to stay in the master suite of the Ushaka Lodge, a 'shark experience' is offered. A door from the second-storey room, which overlooks the Lodge's loungeroom, leads into the back area of the aquarium where the zoo keepers feed the marine life and dive to check on the animals health. The shark experience involves feeding the zoo's resident tawny shark, a three-metre long gentle giant with no teeth, which has been trained to surface for treats of squid. Guests have the chance to 'pat' the shark from their private jetty, under the close eye of the zoo keeper who may need to bat a hand away from the surface should some of the smaller sharks, who do have teeth, swim by. Encounters with the other animals are also available, including feeding the cheetahs and lions, an experience which guests said was unforgettable. 'The level of hospitality and the private tours made it a weekend to remember,' said Mr O'Loughlin. The zoo will continue to be a family business, a principle which makes the Jamala Lodge an intimate and unique experience for animal lovers and holiday seekers alike.

"Dog may be man's best friend but video of a chocolate lab diving 12-feet below the water proves that dogs may have some underwater pals as well. Meet Jordy the Chocolate Lab from California who can dive 12-feet-under the Smith River in Hiouchi. When Jordy's Owner Bryce Lund posted video of his adorable canine swimming to the bottom of the river to YouTube about a week ago it went viral with over 400,000 views.

Bryce Lund says that Jordy loves collecting rocks and that the best ones are often at the very bottom of the river. 'He taught himself how to dive down deeper and deeper to get rocks. This as deep of water he's ever been in and went straight to the bottom, ' wrote Lund in the description of the original video. The video begins with Jordy standing at the edge of the river and playfully looking down below, perhaps to spot a rock. Jordy then makes a splash as he swims down to the bottom of the river to collect his prize. When Jordy comes back to the surface of the water he has a smile on his face despite not carrying a rock in his mouth this time.

"She is one of the hottest stars in Bollywood, currently seen shaking her sari next to a muscle-bound hunchback in the most expensive and ambitious film ever to come out of India. She receives thousands of letters, most declaring undying love, many asking for her hand in marriage. She has a chauffeur, a make-up team and stylist, a cleaner, a cook and a personal assistant. It is all the more surprising, then, that Amy Jackson, who was 23 yesterday, is a white girl from Liverpool with a girly Scouse accent more reminiscent of a cutesy five-year-old than a silver-screen sex siren. Her extraordinary story has taken her from the quiet suburban streets of Walton in Liverpool to a jet-set life which means she is mobbed if she sets foot outside her limousine in Mumbai, Calcutta or Madras. Scroll down for video . Superstar: Amy Jackson (pictured) now has a chauffeur, a make-up team and stylist, a cleaner, a cook and a personal assistant . Origins: Amy Jackson (pictured at the Miss England final) has gone from humble beginnings in Walton, Liverpool to starring in blockbuster Bollywood films . Her new film, called I, is even pulling in crowds here in Britain where she is largely unknown. Yet she freely admits that her film career is a matter of pure chance: she had done no acting at all before her 2010 debut and couldn't speak a word of Hindi. That didn't seem to bother leading 'Kollywood' director A. L. Vijay, who happened upon Amy's modelling picture after she won the Miss Teen World beauty contest at the age of 17 in 2009. They met in London two months later and he offered her the lead role in his 2010 movie Madrasapattinam. 'I'd never acted in my life,' she says. 'A. L. Vijay asked if I could dance and I just said yes. I didn't tell him the only dancing I had done was on nights out in Liverpool. He said he would arrange workshops and help me with the scripts and the language. He liked the fact that I was English but had an Indian look.' So, just before she turned 18, Amy and her mother, Marguerita, a horse-riding instructor, found themselves in India meeting other actors and trying on costumes. Amy recalls: 'I'd never been to India or anywhere like it. 'There were cows wandering through the city. In the car on the way to the hotel I noticed Mum was grabbing on to the sides as we went in and out of traffic with the horn beeping. At one point a cow crossed the road in front of us and she screamed.' Then she had to get used to the food. 'At the start I couldn't eat anything. I didn't like the spice. I loved having Indian take-aways on a Friday night in Liverpool but it's so different in the real India.' While her friends spent their Saturdays getting 'curly blow drys' at the local hairdresser before hitting the town, Amy was working 20-hour days in Madras, trying to learn the language. Rise to stardom: Amy (left) freely admits her fame is a result of pure chance and she had never acted before her screen debut in 2010 . Big hit: Her new film 'I' is even attracted crowds in UK where she is a relative unknown as an actress . 'When my friends phoned before going out, I'd be sat in my caravan on set with Mum learning Tamil,' she says. 'We had a TV but it just played Indian shows so we didn't watch it. I was so jealous and homesick.' That all changed when Madrasapattinam became the biggest movie hit of 2010. It turned Amy into an overnight star and the offers of more roles flooded in. This year alone she will star in no fewer than four Indian movies – and she has turned down nine other offers. Amy was so much in demand that she didn't even have to audition for the part of Diya in the much anticipated I. But it hasn't all been plain sailing for Amy who has experienced racist abuse from a minority unhappy with her being cast as an Indian woman. On social media and website forums, they demanded to know what this 'foreigner', this 'fake' and 'fluke actress' who 'can't even speak Hindi' was doing in an Indian film. 'Everyone has an opinion,' she says warily. 'For me, as an actress you are playing a character and to play that character you have to get into that mindset. I don't think it's any disrespect to any race. If people enjoy your movies that's the most important thing.' I is Amy's fifth Indian movie and is directed by Shankar Shanmugham, the country's answer to Steven Spielberg. Loaded with special effects, it took her three years to make – and takes audiences three hours to watch. It tells the story of a top model (Amy) who enlists the help of a local body builder (Chiyaan Vikram). The pair fall in love before he is deliberately infected with a hideous virus and turns into a gruesome hunchback. He then seeks revenge on the people who ruined his life. Her south Indian voice was dubbed on to the pictures, but she did learn her lines in Tamil, an official language of India, so that her lips would be in sync. She says the director wanted to make her look very Indian. 'Even my mannerisms had to change. I was very soft and gentle, and a typical south Indian lady. I wore brown contact lenses, which is crazy because all the big Bollywood stars wear green ones.' Amy now splits her time between her sister's home in London and her two-bedroom, apartment overlooking the Arabian Sea in Bandra, Mumbai. Because of the crowds she attracts, she is flanked by two burly bodyguards, Adrian and Max, wherever she goes in India. She has one male assistant ('he wakes me up in the mornings and makes all my juices for me'), two hair and make-up people, one stylist, a driver and a housekeeper ('she helps with the cooking and cleans but Mum doesn't like it. One time I walked in and they were both cleaning the floor together'). She insists she loves her 'gipsy' life but does admit that being able to pop to the shops to buy a pint of milk or walk to the postbox to send a letter when she is in the UK is a novelty. 'I don't really do any of that over there,' Amy says describing how she draws a crowd from the moment she steps off the plane when she returns to Mumbai. 'It's like two different worlds. Everything is calm at home and I'm just Amy.' When she arrives in India, however, she finds she is mobbed. 'The attention I get is unbelievable. People come up for pictures and autographs. They see that you're out in the crowd and then you can't move. 'You stop and take selfies with them. I love it to some extent, but on your days off it can be a bit much. I've probably had more than 1,000 letters from India since the film opened. 'A lot of the letters are from guys declaring their undying love. I do get marriage proposals – not official ones, obviously. They say, 'We've watched the film six, seven or eight times.' That's dedication!'","She had never acted before her screen debut in 2010 film, Madrasapattinam .

"A cartoonist who survived the Charlie Hebdo massacre has attacked the hypocrisy of world leaders who march in the name of free speech but censor their press. The cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier has given his first on-camera interview about the day of the massacre, how he missed death by minutes and criticised world leaders for hypocrisy over press freedoms. Seventeen people, including journalists and police, were killed in three days of violence that began on January 7 when militants burst into Charlie Hebdo's office during a regular editorial meeting and shot dead five of its leading cartoonists. Scroll down for video . Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier spoke about the day of the massacre in his first filmed interview . The filmed interview took place in his sniper-proof flat in Paris, and throughout the interview Luz becomes visibly more and more distressed. Interviewed for Vice by reporter Milene Larsson, he said : 'There are cartoonists in France who say ""we can no longer draw things that could offend someone elsewhere in the world"" - but if we take into account the positions and opinions of the whole world, we might as well tear up our drawings. It is over.' He also reflected on the international movement of 'Je Suis Charlie' and criticised the hypocrisy of world leaders marching in the name of free speech while suppressing press rights in their own countries. He said: 'All of a sudden, Saudi Arabia says 'I am Charlie' but it is not.' A general view shows firefighters, police officers and forensics gathered in front of the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7, 2015, after armed gunmen stormed the offices . When asked how he managed to survive the massacre just over three weeks ago, he said: 'How can I put this? I was lucky. 'It was my birthday, the January 7, and I stayed in bed with my wife for a long time.' He explained she had made cakes and coffee and he was running late for the office meeting. When he arrived at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, people told him not to enter the building as two armed men had just gone in. He said: 'We tried to understand what was going on. We could not go in, we felt something was strange. 'And then we heard the first gunshots.' He describes how he walked back up the street and saw two men dressed in black, who started shooting in his direction. When he swiped into the building, he said: 'I walked up the stairs. I started seeing bloody footsteps. 'I understood later this was my friend's blood. 'I saw that there were people on the ground. On their backs. I saw a friend on the ground, his face against the floor.' 'What's strange is that you can never be prepared for this.' He also reflected on the international movement iof 'Je Suis Charlie' and criticised the hypocrisy of world leaders marching in the name of free speech while suppressing press rights in their own countries . Growing more  distressed, he said that in the immediate aftermath medics needed belts to make tourniquets, but he was not wearing a belt that day - adding that Paris was not prepared for such events. He said: 'But it happens in Syria, in Africa, in some other places. We're not used to this fear, this terror, but a lot of people are.' Ms Larsson said: 'There are people around the world saying they are Charlie, what do you think Charlie is symbolising and what do you feel about it? He spoke at length about the time their offices were burnt down for depicting the prophet Mohammed. He describe dhow following that event they were called both agitators and white knights defending free speech. 'But then, all at once, everyone was saying 'I am Charlie' and for ourselves becoming a symbol is difficult,' he said. 'Because Charlie fought against symbols. 'How do we burst the bubble of this symbol? The symbol we've become? 'Humour doesn't kill anyone. We can't be prisoners of the sense of humour of others.' French President Francois Hollande is surrounded by heads of state including  David Cameron, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . When asked if he was ever concerned that some of his cartoons offend Muslim communities, he replied: 'I think that most Muslims don't care about Charlie Hebdo. 'Those who claim all Muslims are offended take Muslims for imbeciles, I think. 'We don't take Muslims for imbeciles.' He described how he hugged a Muslim friend of Charb's at the editor's funeral, and how the Muslim man cried and told him he was sorry. Luz told the man he had no reason to be apologising, and the two men cried together. Towards the end of the interview he showed the reporter how they 'had a laugh' making a blank Charlie Hebdo newspaper 'which wouldn't offend anyone.' He said: 'This is the magazine of those saying 'I am Charlie, but.' Luz described how he hugged a Muslim friend of Charb's at the editor's funeral, and how the Muslim man cried and told him he was sorry. Luz told the man he had no reason to be apologising, and the two men cried together . When asked his opinion of the march of millions of people and world leaders that he was a part of, he said that while he is happy that people are supporting them, the hypocrisy of some world leaders 'makes him sad'. He said: 'When I saw Hollande at the march, a pigeon s*** on him. It was great. 'I told him ""You're about to have lunch with many heads of state, tell them to allow their people to laugh at them through drawings and newspapers.""

"A Canadian couple has been charged with killing every member of the woman's estranged husband's immediate family. Melissa Merritt  and Christopher Fattore of Ontario were arrested last January and charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Merritt's estranged mother-in-law, 63-year-old Bridget Harrison who died in 2010, and 40-year-old Caleb Harrison, Merritt's estranged husband who died in 2013. Then, this week, they were also charged with the 2009 death of Bill Harrison - Caleb's father and Bridget's husband - this after all three died in the same house over the course of five years. Melissa Merritt and Christopher Fattore (above) have been charged in the death of her estranged husband and her estranged mother and father-in-law . Merritt's father-in-law Bill Harrison (above) died in his home in April 2009 . Bill's wife Bridget Harrison (above) died one year later in April 2010, and her death was ruled suspicious . It is still not known what might have motivated these two to allegedly commit these crimes, though prosecutors believe custody of Harrison and Merritt's two children together played a big role. The Toronto Star reports that police began investigating in August 2013 following Caleb's murder. Police will not release details because of the trial, but say that Caleb died due to asphyxiation, a month after Merritt had filed for join custody of the children. Merritt, 34, was only able to see the children every second weekend and on select holidays due to an incident in 2009 is which she abducted the children for several months while they were in the care of Bridget. Bridget had custody while Caleb was serving an 18 month prison sentence for killing a cab driver and injuring four teenagers in a 2005 drunk driving accident that happened a month after he and Merritt, who married in 2003 after having a son and daughter, split. The children were abducted shortly after Bill's death in April of that year, a death that was not suspicious and assumed to be a heart attack. Almost one year later to the day, Bridget's grandson found her dead at the bottom of her stairs, a death that was suspicious at the time. She too died of asphyxiation, though again authorities are not releasing details. They will also not comment on the new evidence that led to the charges in Bill's death. Fattore (above in court this week) has four children with Merritt . Merritt (above in court this week) has two children with her estranged husband . In court on Thursday, Fattore, 37, and Merritt, who have four children of their own together, could be seen mouthing 'I love you' to one another. Merritt also cried as the new charges were read against her. The Harrison family declined to comment on the new charges. All six of Merritt's children are currently being cared for according to police.","Melissa Merritt and Christopher Fattore of Ontario were arrested last January and charged with first-degree murder .

"Nine babies found alive after a huge gas explosion destroyed a Mexican maternity hospital have undergone DNA tests in a bid to reunite them with their parents. The newborn babies were  rescued from the collapsed building on the western edge of Mexico City after a devastating blast that killed a nurse and two infants. Brave passers-by and emergency crews picked their way through the ruins of Cuajimalpa hospital before carrying the babies, which were just hours old, to safety. Hospital bosses have now started the process of reuniting them with their parents as investigations continue into the explosion on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Nine babies found alive after a huge gas explosion destroyed a Mexican maternity hospital have undergone DNA tests in a bid to reunite them with their parents . Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto and wife Angelica Rivera visited survivors at a nearby hospital following the blast which killed a nurse and two infants . Several babies survived the explosion because their mothers sheltered them with their own bodies during the blast . The newborn babies were dramatically rescued from the collapsed building on the western edge of Mexico City after a devastating blast that killed a nurse and two infants . Hospital bosses have now started the process of reuniting them with their parents as investigations continue into the explosion on Thursday . A leak in a hose from a gas truck, which was fueling the hospital's tanks, was believed to have triggered the explosion, officials said . Officials say the babies did not have bracelets on when the blast demolished the building leaving dozens injured. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said: 'We have nine DNA tests pending. There are parents who have identified their children, but as the babies did not have bracelets on, we have to follow a protocol to identify them.' Mancera said several babies survived because their mothers sheltered them with their own bodies during the blast. A leak in a hose from a gas truck, which was fueling the hospital's tanks, was believed to have triggered the explosion, officials said. Many areas of Mexico City have no mains gas supply and rely on deliveries from gas trucks. Mancera said the gas truck company involved had been working in Mexico City since 2007. Yesterday it emerged that the driver of the truck, which exploded while gas was being piped into the building, has been detained along with two assistants. More than 70 people were injured in the blast, it has been reported. A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said. A major clean up operation has started in the wake of the blast on Thursday which injured dozens of people . A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said . A nurse and a baby died in the blast and a second infant died later on after the blast destroyed most of the Cuajimalpa Maternal Hospital in Mexico City . Babies have been pulled alive from the debris of a Mexican maternity hospital after a  fuel tank truck exploded leaving three dead and dozens injured . On Thursday officials said as many as seven had died but yesterday they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries . On Thursday, officials said as many as seven had died but yesterday they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries. Armando Ahued, the city's health secretary said yesterday that 21 babies in all had been injured, and nine of those and seven adults were in serious condition after being rushed to other hospitals. Several babies were found under the rubble while scores of rescue workers smashed through the concrete and twisted metal in a desperate bid for survivors. The explosion occurred at 7:05 a.m. when a tanker truck was making a routine delivery of gas to the hospital kitchen and the gas started to leak. The blast is understood to have been caused by a leak in a hose carrying gas from the truck to the hospital . The explosion sent a column of smoke billowing over the area on the western edge of Mexico's capital . Dozens of people were evacuated after the truck exploded outside the hospital with many of the injuries caused by broken glass . Witnesses said the tanker workers struggled frantically for 15 or 20 minutes to repair the leak while a large cloud of gas formed. 'The hose broke. The two gas workers tried to stop it, but they were very nervous. They yelled for people to get out,' said Laura Diaz Pacheco, a laboratory technician. 'Everyone's initial reaction was to go inside, away from the gas,' she added. 'Maybe as many as 10 of us were able to get out ... The rest stayed inside.' Workers on the truck yelled: 'Call the firefighters, call the firefighters!' said anesthesiologist Agustin Herrera. People started to evacuate the hospital, and then came a devastating explosion that sent up an enormous fireball and plumes of dust and smoke. A 25-year-old nurse and a newborn between 2 and 3 weeks old died at the scene and another infant died several hours later at another pediatric hospital, city bosses said . More than 70 people were injured including mothers who reportedly used their bodies to shield their children from the huge fireball . It has emerged that the driver of the truck, which exploded while gas was being piped into the building, was detained along with two assistants . On Thursday officials said as many as seven had died but yesterday they admitted this had been a mistake amid confusion over the number of people with serious injuries . Officials say 21 babies in all had been injured, and nine of those and seven adults were in serious condition after being rushed to other hospitals . The explosion sent a column of smoke billowing over the area on the western edge of Mexico's capital and television images showed firefighters trying to extinguish fires throughout the collapsed hospital building. Herrera saw injured mothers walking out carrying babies. Officials said 110 people were inside the 35-bed hospital when the truck blew up. 'We avoided a much bigger tragedy because the oxygen tanks right beside (the area) didn't explode,' Herrera said. The worst hit parts of the hospital were the neonatology, reception and emergency reception units, he said. Passers-by rushed into the building after the blast and made their way to the nursery section, rescuing eight babies, it has been reported. Margarita Palma of Amexgas, a trade association of Mexico's propane distributors, said 80 percent of Mexicans use propane rather than natural gas delivered by mains. Some of the victims were airlifted to hospital as the scale of the explosion became clear . Several babies were found under the rubble while scores of rescue workers smashed through the concrete and twisted metal in a desperate bid for survivors . A police officer is comforted by a colleague after being injured at the scene of the explosion . People started to evacuate the hospital as the emergency unfolded, and then came a devastating explosion that sent up an enormous fireball and plumes of dust and smoke . Liquified propane, which is highly explosive, is distributed to homes and businesses either by trucks like the one that exploded or in cylinders, she said. Homes next to the hospital were also damaged in the blast, as windows broke and and shingles fell from roofs. Neighbors ran to help evacuate victims from the debris, local resident Carlos Soria Rezendiz said. People seeking information on family members gathered around police lines that were set up to keep bystanders away from the chaotic scene. Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter, and aerial footage showed firefighters scrambling over the skeletal wreckage of the building. There were seven babies with serious injuries in intensive care in a nearby hospital, said Dr. Moises Zielanowski, as well as four adults in serious condition. Injuries included burns, fractures and bruises. Some of the injured were evacuated by helicopter, and aerial footage showed firefighters scrambling over the skeletal wreckage of the building .

Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said some of the injured were about to be released from area hospitals. The gas truck driver and two other employees of the Express Nieto company were hospitalized but were in custody, Mancera said. He said the company has provided gas to all the city's public hospitals since 2007. The incident prompted tweets from President Enrique Pena Nieto to Pope Francis, who wrote, 'We are praying for the victims of the explosion in Cuajimalpa, Mexico.' According to a government website, the hospital was founded in 1993. It is located in a densely populated lower middle class neighborhood next to a school.","Powerful fuel tank explosion in Mexico City destroyed maternity hospital .

"The U.S. Coast Guard says it rescued five people from the sailboat of a prominent Pinterest investor after the boat's 78-foot mast broke about 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina on Friday afternoon. The $2.5 million luxury boat belonged to Pinterest investor Brian Cohen and he was on board with four others, some of whom were family. A statement from the Coast Guard says watchstanders at a command center in Portsmouth, Virginia, were notified Friday afternoon that the 55-foot catamaran Rain Maker suffered a broken mast in 40 mph winds and 13-foot seas at roughly 1:50pm. The damage occurred about 200 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Safe: Brian Cohen, pictured third from right, stands with his sons and the Coast Guard rescue crew . Boat suffered damage: The boat of Brian Cohen, chairman of investment group New York Angels suffered a broken mast on Saturday and the Coast Guard safely rescued he and his family . Off the coast: The boat's 78-foot mast broke about 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina and they had to be rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter crew . Rescued: The U.S. Coast Guard says it rescued five people from the sailboat of a prominent Pinterest investor after the boat's 78-foot mast broke about 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina . A helicopter crew was able to hoist all five boaters from the damaged sailboat. The Coast Guard says the boaters were taken to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo in good condition. Wral reports that the Coast Guard rescue ship arrived at the damaged boat at about 4:05 p.m., but the 350-foot cargo ship was unable to come alongside the Rain Maker. That's when a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter arrived at about 5 p.m. and hoisted all five people from the water. 'The mission today was challenging for our crews due to the distance from shore and the weather conditions,' Petty Officer 1st Class Allen Facenda said in a statement. 'The crew we rescued had a registered and up-to-date emergency position indicating radio beacon that told us their exact position. All five people were wearing life jackets and were prepared to abandon their vessel in a life raft. We were happy to get there before that became necessary.' Brian Cohen's luxury yacht was was profiled by Forbes last year. According to Forbes, the boat can sail more than 30 m.p.h. 'What I love about this boat is it’s so disruptive, in so many ways,' Cohen told Forbes last year. 'The power of this boat, its disruptive technology, the design interface–it’s all part of the entrepreneurial experience in New York,' he said last year. The yacht boasts two staterooms with interiors designed by Italian yacht-design firm Nauta Yachts. Out of harm's way: A helicopter crew was able to hoist all five boaters from the damaged sailboat and The Coast Guard says the boaters were taken to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo in good condition .

Kitchen: The boat has a fully operating kitchen onboard and was being sailed by Cohen and members of his family when it ran into difficulty . The boat has a 200 square-foot salon with coaches and Italian style flooring and is the perfect place to sip on martinis. If on of the boat's passengers get hungry they can make their way over to the kitchen that even has a pizza oven. The enormous mainsail of the boat is made of 1,300 square feet of high-tech fabric. It has a computer-designed shape that can handle a broad range of wind. The boat's cabin top is covered with solar cells that help charge an 800-watt electrical system that gives power to computer navigation screens, electric winches and a loud marine audio system. Cohen told Forbes he didn't get into sailing until he was 42-years-old. 'I didn’t know a mast from a boom,' Cohen, now an avid sailor, said. Yachts such as Cohen's are not know for their safety and can flip over if the wave hits it from the side. The boat didn't flip but a broken mast left the family in a tight knot until the Coast Guard crew arrived.

"Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber said Friday his fiancée will have no role in his administration for the rest of his fourth term after questions were raised about her consulting work. Visibly nervous as he addressed reporters with a shaky voice, Kitzhaber said Cylvia Hayes would continue her consulting business but would not work for organizations that 'have anything to do with the state of Oregon.' The Democratic governor has been on the defensive about Hays' work since newspapers first raised questions in October surrounding her consulting for organizations that want to influence the state. Addressing concerns: Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber answers questions during a news conference in Portland. Kitzhaber said that legitimate questions have been raised about his fiancee's taxes . Speaking out: Governor John Kitzhaber, 68, acknowledges legitimate questions have been raised about Cylvia Hayes, 47, taxes . 'These issues have become such a distraction that I want to make it very, very clear that she will have no policy role and no political role in the administration during the remaining four years of my term,' Kitzhaber said at a news conference at a state office building in Portland. Hayes played an active role in Kitzhaber's third term, attending meetings, communicating with state officials and helping him push for environmental and clean energy policies. At the same time, she did consulting work for several organizations involved in similar policies. He previously said her role would be re-evaluated but hadn't ruled out her continuing involvement in his administration. Kitzhaber was forced to respond to new reports this week in state newspapers that Hayes was paid $118,000 over two years for a fellowship with a green energy group — money that may not have been reported on her taxes. Kitzhaber said legitimate questions have been raised but he wouldn't address them. Keeping quiet: Reports showed that income from a renewable energy group didn't appear on Cylvia Hayes tax returns. The  governor said he and Cylvia Hayes file taxes separately and would not discuss hers . Blinded by love: Governor Kitzhaber, pictured dancing with Hayes who is 20 years his junior, will answer questions on Friday  morning - two weeks into his fourth term as governor - over her undeclared earnings . 'Cylvia and I file separate returns. I have not reviewed, did not prepare and cannot answer questions concerning her tax returns, and those questions need to be directed specifically to Cylvia,' Kitzhaber said. As Kitzhaber dodged rapid-fire questions from a large contingent of media, Hayes was in Sweden on Friday visiting friends at her own expense, he said. She has been unavailable to comment on the tax issue. She'll travel later to Berlin for meetings with an organization that promotes using happiness to evaluate the success of economies and public policies. The organization, funded by the German government, is paying for her trip. It also paid for Hayes' 2013 travel with Kitzhaber to study happiness indicators in Bhutan. Kitzhaber repeatedly deflected questions about whether her work constituted a conflict of interest, saying the Oregon Government Ethics Commission will decide. At one point, he compared himself to Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks running back who spent an entire Super Bowl press conference answering every question with the same response. Kitzhaber insists that he and Hayes worked hard to draw a clear separation between her public and private duties and to properly declare conflicts where they existed. Honorable intentions: Governor Kitzhaber is sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term in Oregon on January 12 this year next to his fiancés, Cylvia Hayes . 'That was our intent, and the ethics commission will make a determination as to whether or not we were successful,' Kitzhaber said. Asked whether he's been blinded by love, he said he does not believe he is. He said he still plans to marry Hayes, to whom he proposed last summer, and has no intention of resigning. 'I'm not going to consider resigning, of course not,' Kitzhaber said. 'I was elected by the people of this state to do a job and I'm going to do it.' Hayes has been under intense scrutiny over her business and embarrassing revelations of her past personal life. Last fall, following a newspaper report, she acknowledged that in the 1990s she illegally married an Ethiopian immigrant so he could seek residency in the United States, and that she had never told Kitzhaber about the sham marriage that ended with the filing of divorce papers in 2001. The controversy comes as Kitzhaber gears up for the five-month legislative session during which he's pushing an ambitious agenda on education and climate change, a priority for Hayes. Hayes admitted in an email to the East Oregonian that she had been paid the money by CEDC. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from CEDC on Friday. The paper also confirmed that she did not disclose $88,000 in tax filings for 2012 - claiming her income  was just over $27,000 from her own business venture, 3E Strategies. The paper reported that since Kitzhaber was sworn in as governor in 2011, his fiancée has pulled in around $213,000 in consulting fees. According to her first lady biography on Oregon.gov, Hayes has 22 years of experience working in clean energy and has served as a member and co-chair of the Oregon Renewable Energy Working Group. Her own consulting firm, 3E Strategies, had led to an ethics investigation, following complaints. Living the life: Hayes, who became engaged to her older lover last year, lives with Kitzhaber in the lavish governor's mansion in Oregon . In November, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission opened a preliminary investigation into Hayes' consulting work. The commission received three complaints about Hayes' work as a private consultant. The preliminary investigation was to determine whether the commission should proceed with a full-fledged inquiry that could lead to sanctions. The commission also rejected Kitzhaber's request for an advisory opinion about whether ethics laws apply to Hayes, whom he first met in 2002. Officials said the questions asked by the governor's office will be addressed in the investigation. Kitzhaber said Hayes carefully avoided conflicts of interest. Among those who filed ethics complaints were the Republican state party and a Republican state representative. A decision will be made on March 13 on whether a full investigation will take place.","Governor John Kitzhaber acknowledges legitimate questions have been raised about her Cylvia Hayes, 47, taxes .

"A former Newcastle United chairman has unveiled plans to put on a display in the north of England in a bid to save the Natural History Museum's famous dinosaur. Freddy Shepherd, an offshore energy tycoon, has written to museum bosses to ask if he can display Dippy the diplodocus in the Palace of Arts in Newcastle's Exhibition Park. The 83ft-long cast is due to be moved from its prime position in the entrance hall at the South Kensington museum and replaced with a giant blue whale skeleton. Boss: Freddy Shepherd has written to museum bosses asking to display Dippy the diplodocus at the Palace of Arts in Newcastle's Exhibition Park, which he recently bought and plans to rename St James' Hall . Display: The Natural History Museum revealed this week that the 83ft-long cast will be moved from its prime position in the entrance hall and replaced with a blue whale skeleton as part of modernisation programme . It was revealed this week that museum bosses no longer considered Dippy to be relevant and its marine replacement would act as a reminder of 'our responsibility to the planet'. But the decision has triggered thousands of people to sign a petition calling for it to remain where it has enthralled millions for the past 110 years. So far, more than 26,000 people have signed the 'Save Dippy' campaign, which states that his removal would lead to 'many unhappy faces in UK youth'. Mr Shepherd, who recently bought the Tyneside venue, has pledged to save the dinosaur skeleton by bringing it to North East England, attracting thousands of visitors to the area. Geordie-saur: Mr Shepherd, a former Newcastle United chairman, said his Tyneside venue - with its 100ft dome - would be 'perfect' for the replica dinosaur Dippy . He said: 'It would go perfect in the museum, we've had the plans out today and it would fit perfect. 'We've sent an email to the National History Museum saying we were interested in the future of the dinosaur and if they wish to get rid of it or move it we would be interested in taking it in. 'The Palace of Arts is a huge museum and Newcastle would be capable of taking it.' He added: 'They [Natural History Museum] wouldn't be able to take it around many places because of its length. 'The Hancock museum couldn't take it but I want to take it, it would be fantastic for Newcastle. It would attract so many visitors to Exhibition Park. People would come from all over to see it. 'We have the Rugby World Cup here this year and it would be great for the city.' The Diplodocus skeleton, in the main central hall of the Natural History Museum, will remain until 2017 . Dippy arrived in London in 1905 after King Edward VII saw an illustration of the original skeleton, which was unearthed in Wyoming in 1898 - currently on display at a museum in Pittsburgh - and asked for a copy. It has since become a favourite attraction for millions of people who visit the museum in South Kensington every year. However, as part of a 10-year modernisation programme, the museum plans to take it off display. The Natural History Museum holds over 80million specimens, including mammoth skeletons and items from the voyages of Charles Darwin and Captain James Cook. The museum has a moon rock brought back from the Apollo 17 mission, the only piece in the UK. It keeps a 900-strong colony of tiny flesh-eating beetles, which it uses to strip carcasses down to skeletons for study or display. The most valued fossil in the museum's collection is the archaeopteryx, or the 'first bird', which is 150million years old. The skeleton, which contains 356 plaster-cast bones, was constructed over a period of 18 months and shipped to England in 36 crates. Originally installed in the Reptile Gallery, Dippy was taken apart and stored in the museum's basement during the Blitz to avoid any damage. In 1979 it was rebuilt and given pride of place in the central hall, becoming the museum's most famous asset. Dippy will remain in place until summer 2017 when the whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, will be suspended from the vaulted ceiling of the Hintze Hall. The whale has been at the museum since 1981 after it beached itself in Wexford Harbour in Ireland and was bought for £250 by a local merchant. Mr Shepherd added: 'The dome is around 100ft tall so it would fit in there no problem. 'We're giving them a chance to bring it to Newcastle and here is as good as anywhere else.' In a £500,000 refurbishment scheme, Mr Shepherd and his brother Bruce have transformed the venue by replacing windows, restoring the original flooring and carrying out maintenance. Symbol of hope: The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, will be suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central Hintze Hall . The whale was found near Thurso, Scotland, in 1863, and two years later its skeleton was presented to the Museum by Captain D. Macdonald, but campaigners are calling for it not to replace Dippy . Newcastle City's Lord Mayor's carriage is currently on display at the museum, along with a Newcastle United-themed tuk tuk bought at the Alan Shearer Foundation Ball this month. The venue will also house Mr Shepherd's collection of historic horse-drawn carriages which he bought at Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland after they were put up for auction by Lord Hastings. His collection of vintage cars, including a vehicle once owned by King George V, who was patron of the North East Coast Exhibition, which was took place in the park in 1929, will also be displayed. The 7.7-litre Rolls Royce Phantom II spent decades in a private dealer's collection in the United States. The Natural History Museum (pictured in 1882) welcomes more than five million visitors a year. It also operates as a world-leading research centre . The hall photographed in 1895.

"Killer Jon Venables has blamed the mother of James Bulger for the toddler's murder saying that she should never have left him on his own, according to reports. Venables and Robert Thompson were both 10-years-old when they shocked Britain by abducting Bulger, then just 2-years-old, before torturing and killing him. The crime made the boys the youngest killers in modern English history. The duo snatched Bulger from outside a butcher's shop in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, while his mother popped into a store for just a few seconds. The toddler's mutilated body was found on a railway line in Walton, Liverpool, two days later. Scroll down for video . Killer Jon Venables, seen above age 10 after being arrested for the murder of James Bulger, has blamed the toddler's mother for her son's death saying that she should never have left him on his own . A surveillance camera image shows Venables leading Bulger out of the Bootle Strand shopping mall, near Liverpool, on February 12, 1993; the 2-year-old's mutilated body was found on railway lines two days later . Venables, now 32, is said to have told a reveller in a packed pub that Bulger's mother Denise Fergus was responsible for her son's death, an action that could have put his £1 million secret identify at risk. The killer's identity is protected by a lifelong order and has been changed four times since his release in 2001, costing taxpayers £250,000 each time. The reveller has told how he spoke to Venables in the 'gay friendly' pub after taking pity on the killer who was getting drunk alone at the bar. He said Venables had been hitting on his 56-year-old mother. Bulger's mother Denise Fergus is outraged by Venables claim saying 'how dare he try and put the onus back on me' The man, who has not been named, described Venables as a 'very troubled person' who appeared to want to reach out to someone. The man said: 'It was like he wanted me to know who he was and couldn't help himself. He told me he wasn't allowed a mobile or to go on social networking sites,' he told the Daily Mirror. 'Then something clicked. I was saying to my mum, 'I'm sure that's Jon Venables'. I said to him, 'You're Jon Venables'. And he denied it. The pair began talking about Bulger and the man said Venables claimed the death was 'the mum's fault for leaving him outside the butcher's'. Ms Fergus, 47, told the newspaper: 'How dare he try to put the onus back on to me? I was in a shop for 30 seconds and had briefly turned around. It's all on CCTV footage. 'He's already admitted that he and Thompson were to blame.' The man later searched for a picture of Venables online and claims he is 100 per cent sure it was the killer he had spoken to. Venables and Thompson were found guilty of killing Bulger in November 1993 and were sentenced to custody until they reached 18. They were freed in 2001, but by 2010 Venables was back in prison for violating the terms of his release by possessing child pornography. Venables was paroled again in 2013 and took on his fourth new identity.","Jon Venables and Robert Thompson murdered James Bulger in 1993 .

"A British healthcare worker has been flown back to England for Ebola monitoring, it has emerged this morning. The military worker was brought back to Britain after suffering a needle injury while treating a patient near Sierra Leone's capital Freetown. Public Health England (PHE) said the medic has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for assessment after being injured in a 'front line care setting'. It is thought the medic was working at the Kerry Town treatment centre, 40km from Freetown, and that the injury would have happened within the last 48 hours. Public Health England (PHE) said the individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London for assessment and next of kin have been informed . It is thought the medic would have been working at the Kerry Town treatment centre (pictured), 40km from Freetown . The individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms. Pictured is the High Secure Infectious Disease Unit at The Royal Free Hospital . This is the period when someone who has had a known exposure to Ebola would have had a window of opportunity to be safely transported to the UK as they are not yet contagious. The individual is likely to have been exposed to the virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms. Next of kin have been informed. PHE said the individual had arrived back in the UK today on an RAF flight after being exposed to the virus in a 'frontline care setting'. It is believed the military transport, bringing the patient back as a precautionary measure, arrived at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of this morning. The Kerry Town complex includes an 80-bed treatment centre managed by Save the Children and a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army medics specifically for health care workers and international staff responding to the Ebola crisis.

Part of the complex is staffed by British Army medics specifically for health care workers and international staff responding to the Ebola crisis . The Kerry Town treatment centre features a 12-bed centre staffed by British Army medics . The patient is being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital (RFH), where British nurses Pauline Cafferkey (left) and Will Pooley (right) were treated in a specialist isolation unit . Professor Paul Cosford, PHE's director for health protection and medical director, said: 'Our thoughts are with this person, who has been courageous in helping those affected in West Africa, and in preventing the wider spread of Ebola. 'We have strict, well-tested protocols in place for this eventuality and we are confident that all appropriate actions have been taken to support the healthcare worker concerned and to protect the health of other people.' The patient is being treated at London's Royal Free Hospital (RFH), where British nurses Pauline Cafferkey and Will Pooley were treated in a specialist isolation unit. They were each diagnosed with the disease after helping treat patients in Africa. A statement from the Royal Free Hospital said: 'We can confirm that a UK military healthcare worker has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital today following a needlestick injury while treating a person with Ebola in Sierra Leone. It is believed the military transport, bringing the patient back as a precautionary measure, arrived at RAF Brize Norton (pictured) in Oxfordshire in the early hours of this morning . 'The individual has been admitted to the Royal Free Hospital for assessment. The individual is likely to have been exposed to the Ebola virus but has not been diagnosed with Ebola and does not have symptoms.' The patient will be monitored for the remainder of their 21-day incubation period. About 600 British military personnel are currently working in Sierra Leone, with Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Argus stationed in the area. Part of the Kerry Town  treatment centre is staffed by staffed by British Army medics (file picture) Decisions on immediate and ongoing care will be made by the clinical team at the Royal Free Hospital. Needle-stick injuries involve a piercing of the skin, typically by a needle point but also by other sharp instruments or objects. They are a serious occupational hazard for doctors, healthcare workers and those working in law enforcement. The injuries are of particular concern because of the risk of blood-borne diseases being transmitted. Ms Cafferkey, 39, from Cambuslang, in South Lanarkshire, was discharged from the RFH this week after making a full recovery from Ebola. Ms Cafferkey, who had volunteered with Save the Children at a treatment centre in Kerry Town, in Sierra Leone, was diagnosed with Ebola on December 29, after returning to Glasgow via London. William Pooley, 29, who contracted Ebola while volunteering in West Africa, has returned to Sierra Leone to resume his work after recovering from the virus. The nurse, from Eyke in Suffolk, was flown back to the UK by the RAF on August 24 and was taken to the RFH. The worst outbreak of Ebola in history has seen Liberia and its neighbours Guinea and Sierra Leone register almost 9,000 deaths in a year. To date, more than 21,700 cases of Ebola have been reported in nine countries. The PHE announcement comes days after the World Health Organisation said the Ebola epidemic in West Africa appeared to be on the decline. It said new weekly infections had dropped below 100 for the first time in over six months.","The worker suffered a needle injury while treating patient in Sierra Leone .

"They might look like two adults playing at being astronauts while doing their weekly shop, but in fact, the two men behind the masks have a deadly allergy to the sun. Thomas and Vincent Seris, who live in Bordeaux, France, suffer from Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP), cannot be exposed to the sun and its ultraviolet (UV) light. If they are, the twins are likely to develop a 'precocious' and potentially fatal skin cancers. In some cases, just a glimpse of sunlight is all it takes for the cancer to develop. Genetic: Thomas and Vincent (pushing the trolley) suffer from a condition called Xeroderma Pigmentosum, or XP . Fatal: The genetic condition means their skin is very sensitive to sunlight, and even being exposed to a small amount can cause skin cancer . Advances: The twins have been testing new masks, designed to protect them from UV rays, for the last year . In an effort to be allowed to live a normal life, the twins, who have been dubbed The Children of the Moon by the French media, have be testing out a new protective mask. The mask is transparent and ventilated, and has been developed by several hospitals in France. Four years ago it was a different story. The boys had to wear  a ski mask every time they left home, as well as coveralls and white gloves manufactured by NASA. The boys, then 17, knew it was a scary look: so much so, they allowed their lives to be the inspiration for French film La Permission de Minuit. 'I would love to stop scaring people,' Vincent said at the time it was released. '[I hope it] will allow people to take another look at the children suffering in France.' Normal: The boys have managed to live a relatively normal life, now attending the University of Bordeaux . Precautions: Vincent uses a device to check for ultra violet light before leaving the building in Bordeaux . Danger: Even lightbulbs can be dangerous for the twins - which means they have to keep the suits on while shopping . Image: Vincent has previously said he would like people not to be scared of his appearance anymore . Vincent and Thomas are two of just 70 or 80 people living with the genetic condition in France. In the entire world, it is thought there are only somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 such cases. They were diagnosed with XP aged just two and, within four months Vincent had had three bouts of skin cancer. Their worried parents Françoise and Bernard found ways of keeping their sons safe - including putting UV filters over the windows of their home. They also set up the charity Les Enfants de la Lune in 2000, hoping to bring together people with the genetic conditions and put pressure on medical researchers to find out more about XP. Rare: The twins - seen here in their apartment - are two of just 70 or 80 people who have the condition in France . Unusual: Worldwide, it is thought only between five and 6,000 people suffer from XP . Education: Thomas (left) and Vincent talk to a student at the University of Bordeaux . However, it seems Vincent and Thomas managed to live a relatively ordinary life. Growing up, they attended school, and went to the cinema and bowling with friends, and on weekends and during the holiday, they went swimming a skiing. They also developed one hobby which was particularly well-suited to their condition: caving. And nowadays they are students at the University of Bordeaux - which made adjustments to the buildings to allow them to attend.","Vincent and Thomas Seris, of Bordeaux, have a rare genetic condition, XP .

"Two pilots in a helium-filled balloon landed safely off the coast of Mexico early Saturday after an audacious, nearly 7,000-mile-long trip across the Pacific Ocean that shattered two long-standing records for ballooning. The pilots landed four miles offshore in Baja California about 300 miles north of the popular beach destination of Cabo San Lucas, greeted by a team of balloon enthusiasts who assisted with the landing. The pilots came in low and dropped thick trailing ropes into the ocean to help slow the balloon before setting down in a controlled water landing. The balloon will be towed to the coast. Scroll down for videos . Record-breaking: Troy Bradley of New Mexico and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia have flown more than 5,260 miles (8,467km) since leaving Japan last Sunday. Mission control in Albuquerque was packed with balloon team members and the pilots' families as it descended, with all eyes focused on a giant screen showing a map of the coast and the balloon's location. They exchanged hugs and smiled with relief after it touched down . 'We're really pleased with the distance numbers we have here and very pleased with the duration numbers,' said Steve Shope, mission control director. 'These are significant improvements over the existing records. We didn't break them by just a little bit. They were broken by a significant amount.' Troy Bradley of Albuquerque and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia lifted off from Japan Sunday morning, and by Friday, they beat what's considered the 'holy grail' of ballooning achievements, the 137-hour duration record set in 1978 by the Double Eagle crew of Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman in the first balloon flight across the Atlantic. They also easily exceeded the distance record of 5,209 miles set by the Double Eagle V team during the first trans-Pacific flight in 1981. The pilots were said to be in good spirits at various times during the trip, but it was a grueling ordeal. The balloon's capsule is about the size of a large tent — 7 feet long, 5 feet wide and 5 feet tall. They were flying at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet, requiring them to wear oxygen masks and bundle up against the 50-degree temperature inside the capsule. They had sleeping bags, a small onboard heater and a simple toilet. Audacious: The pilots, dubbed the Two Eagles, have surpassed the world distance record for a flight in a helium balloon after crossing the Pacific Ocean, according to their team . Adapting: They had been aiming to land in Canada or the US but unexpected weather forced them to change course and they have now landed in Baja California, Mexico . Teamwork: The pair, who have been equipped with cold weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater, are suspended beneath the balloon in a tiny, cramped  capsule . The original route took the pilots on a path from Japan, across the Pacific Ocean and toward the Pacific Northwest before they encountered shifting weather patterns. They then made a sweeping right turn and headed south along the California coast for the Mexico landing. By Saturday morning, the Two Eagles team had smashed the records, having traveled 6,646 miles over six days, 16 hours and 37 minutes. 'The technology has improved so much in the last couple of years. I don't think there's going to be any question about the records,' said Katie Griggs, a regional director with the nonprofit Balloon Federation of America. The world has been tracking their progress online and through social media sites. Still, the official distance and time of the Two Eagles flight must be confirmed by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, which requires staying aloft 1 percent longer and farther than the previous record. The balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments that are tracking its course and compiling the data, using technology that didn't exist in decades past, leaving some claims unproven. The journey has been tough on the pilots, who have been on oxygen for days; high altitude can take a physical toll. But they've been managing to crack jokes when checking in with mission control and their families. Before the landing, though, the team was all business. 'Right now we have a big job ahead of us to get this balloon down,' Shope said. Mission: Dubbed the 'Two Eagles', they rocketed past the distance record of 5,209 miles (8,383 km) for human flight in a gas balloon on Thursday, which was set in 1981 . Aircraft: The pilots are also trying to break the flight duration record of 137 hours, five minutes and 50 seconds, set in 1978 . High aspirations: Bradley and Tiukhtyaev should pass the existing duration record at about 3.50pm GMT after staying aloft for about 138 hours and 45 minutes . An emotional journey: Tami Bradley hugs her daughter, Savannah, moments after watching her husband, The Two Eagles balloon pilot Troy Bradley, and fellow pilot Leonid Tiukhtyaev surpass a gas ballooning distance record on a giant screen inside the mission control room . Logistics: The team says the very last task will be a safe landing since there's no certainty about where the balloon will touch down . Operations: When the pilots eclipsed the distance record, a round of applause broke out in the mission control room at the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum in New Mexico . Getting ready: A network of balloonist volunteers, pictured preparing the Two Eagles' balloon for travel, has been established across the US who are ready to travel within a 200-mile radius once the landing spot becomes clear .","Pilots Troy Bradley and Leonid Tiukhtyaev traveled 5,260 miles by balloon .

"Veteran actor Brian Blessed has withdrawn from a production of King Lear just over a week after collapsing on stage due to a heart condition. The booming-voiced 78-year-old initially continued with the show, in which he took the title role,  but his agent said he was now withdrawing on medical advice. He said: 'Mr Blessed's heart condition is more serious than he was aware. On the advice of his specialist, and with a broken heart, Brian has therefore been compelled to withdraw from the production of which he is so proud. Scroll down for video . Veteran actor Brian Blessed has withdrawn from a production of King Lear just over a week after collapsing on stage due to a heart condition . Blessed continued with his performance as King Lear after collapsing on stage on January 19 in Guildford after taking a break; his agent has said the actor's heart condition is 'more serious than he was aware' 'He is immensely grateful for the support he has received from The Guildford Shakespeare Company. Mr Blessed will be making no further comment at this time.' Blessed, whose career stretches back six decades, will be replaced in the role by Terence Wilton. The sold-out production marked Blessed’s first stage performance as Lear – and the first time he has appeared opposite his daughter Rosalind Blessed who played the part of Goneril. Blessed had just started delivering his lines at the start of the Shakespearean tragedy on January 19 when he fainted, toppled off a raised platform and fell heavily, his crown rolling to a halt at the front of the stage. The sold-out production marked Blessed’s first stage performance as Lear – and the first time he has appeared opposite his daughter Rosalind Blessed who played the part of Goneril; Blessed will be replaced in the role by Terence Wilton . Fellow actor Noel White, playing the Earl of Kent, announced quietly: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, this is not part of the play. Is there a doctor in the house?’ Indeed there was. A barely conscious Mr Blessed, flat on his back and surrounded by worried cast members including his daughter Rosalind, was examined by a local surgeon who was attending the show in Guildford. After five minutes Mr Blessed was helped off stage, the audience clapping with relief that the big-voiced sometime star of Z Cars was still alive. Blessed returned to the stage some 20-minutes later, apologetically telling the audience: 'I feel such an idiot and am not in the habit of doing this, but I have a little fibrillation.' Despite waves of dizziness and such shortness of breath that he rolled his eyes and occasionally clutched his chest, he then resumed what soon became one of the more remarkable and moving renditions of Lear of all time, wrote the Daily Mail's theatre critic Quentin Letts. During the early scenes it was far from clear he would be able to continue and his fellow actors looked terribly worried about him. But there was no stopping him. ‘Let’s keep going!’ he was heard saying, and later 'we're doing it'. When he struggled to maintain his balance during a scene with James Sobol Kelly’s Earl of Gloucester, Mr Blessed growled almost with anger: ‘No, I’m not stopping yet. Maybe Lear’s not well.’ What he meant was that his illness matched the king’s physical decline. The way he was staggering round the stage, panting hard, sitting whenever possible, did indeed fit with the condition of the crumbling monarch he was playing. At the conclusion of the play Blessed  patted his heart and gave a thumbs-up gesture.","Brian Blessed's heart condition is 'more serious than he was aware'

"Illustrated is the 1215 sealing of the Magna Carta - a document that ushered in the basic rights that underpin British democracy . It was the tree beneath which King John sealed the Magna Carta – the document that first ushered in the basic rights that underpin British democracy to this day. Now, exactly eight centuries after that historic event, experts have preserved the yew tree for eternity. Saplings grown from cuttings of the tree have been planted in a hedge in Edinburgh’s Botanic Gardens, added to those of other historic yews as part of a conservation project. The Ankerwycke yew, which has a girth of 26ft and stands in a water meadow on the flood plain of the Thames, is now approximately 2,000 years old. Scientists at the gardens have created the hedge to preserve their genetic material amid fears that Britain’s historic trees are threatened by a variety of diseases. Famed for the signing of the document at Runnymede in 1215 – although the exact site is still disputed by historians – the Ankerwycke yew is also said to be the site of the first meeting between Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. It is named after the manor of Ankerwycke, part of the estate of Richard de Montfichet, one of the 25 barons who were present as King John gave his seal to the Magna Carta. Martin Gardner, who leads the gardens scheme in Edinburgh, said: ‘We are losing ancient yews all the time, to climate change, development and vandalism. These are the most iconic trees in the world. We have to conserve every single one.’ The initiative comes as celebrations of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the document move to Parliament, with an exhibition of all four existing copies of the Charter opening there this week. The manuscripts, two held by the British Library and one each by Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals, laid the foundations of the rule of law. The Ankerwycke yew was named as one of Britain’s 50 great trees in 2002 to mark the Queen’s Golden Jubilee. Cuttings in the hedge also come from a yew said to have featured in William Wordsworth’s 1803 poem Yew Trees, set in Yorkshire, and from the Fortingall Yew in Perthshire, reputed to be 4,000 years old. The Ankerwycke yew, under which the Magna Carter was sealed in 1215, will now be preserved forever .","King John sealed the Magna Carter under a yew tree in Runnymede in 1215 .

"This is the dramatic moment a self-styled 'paedophile hunter' snared a pervert  by posing as a 14-year-old girl. James Turner, 46, was caught after  writing sick messages to the youngster - who was actually Stinson Hunter pretending to be a schoolgirl - begging her for sex. Footage of the moment Turner was caught was given to West Mercia Police and he was arrested. Scroll down for video . Pervert: James Turner (pictured) was caught after writing sick messages to the youngster - who was actually Stinson Hunter pretending to be a schoolgirl . Turner, the managing director of a health supplement firm, now faces jail after he admitted attempting to incite a girl of 14 to engage in sexual activity at Worcester Crown Court. Last year, Hunter featured in a controversial documentary which revealed how he trawled the internet posing as underage boys and girls in order to catch paedophiles. In his latest sting he pretended to be young girl who caught the attention of Turner. The court heard Turner never questioned the girl's age, even when she made it clear she was sexually inexperienced and told him 'I'm 14 so I'm guessing that will put you off'. Shockingly, Turner continued to contact the girl and even pestered her to send him 'sexy' photographs of herself before arranging to meet for 'drink and lots of fun'. Paedophile hunter: Stinson Hunter has caught 18 paedophiles in the past two years . In other messages, Turner, of Broomhall, Worcester, promised to be 'gentle' with her and talked about using contraception. Last September, Hunter arranged to meet Turner at a hotel in Nuneaton, Warwickshire but when Turner arrived he was confronted by the self-styled 'paedophile hunter'. Turner was bailed and ordered to return to court for sentencing on February 27. After Turner appeared at court on Wednesday January 28, Hunter, who has caught 18 paedophiles in the past two years, said: 'This guy confirms and proves that what I'm doing is right. 'If people are talking about me then they're talking about an issue. '[Turner] is a prime example of a guy that I would suggest is from a nice background. 'That's an example of who these people are, it's not just your stereotypical greasy, dirty paedophile. 'His attitude was disgusting - at one point he laughed. 'I just want the whole world to realise that this is an issue and the Government are ignoring it. 'It's not to get people locked up, it's to get people talking, to raise awareness and hopefully get people to look at a serious issue. 'I want to get into schools, talk to parents and kids and work with them about online safety. 'I want to reach both parents and kids and hopefully change something.' Guilty: Footage of the moment Turner was caught was passed to West Mercia Police and he was arrested . Smug: '[Turner] is a prime example of a guy that I would suggest is from a nice background. That's an example of who these people are, it's not just your stereotypical greasy, dirty paedophile' Hunter, who is based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, works with his team to entrap internet perverts - including soldiers, teachers and solicitors. They track down suspects through the internet and dating apps. The vigilantes usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to  meet up. There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are then handed to police. Hunter's methods came under fire last year after one man he confronted, 45-year-old Michael Parkes, took his own life. He hanged himself after being questioned by police after he was confronted by  Hunter, and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet. Police later said they would have sought to charge Mr Parkes in connection with the incident, in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl. Mr Parkes’ partner, who was also interviewed for the Channel 4 documentary, said she 'may agree' with the vigilante going online to gather evidence, but said publishing the videos was 'what probably tipped him over the edge'.","James Turner, 46, was caught after sending sick messages to the 'girl'

"Living along the west coast of America is good for your health - if you're a killer whale. An orca called Granny, who is matriarch of a group called the Southern Resident Killer Whales in the Pacific Ocean, is thought to have reached the ripe old age of 103 - meaning she could have been a year old when the Titanic sank. Although her age is an estimate, studies into her reproductive history have plotted her birth all the way back to 1911. Experts have been studying whales in the North Pacific Ocean, called the Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKW) since the early 1970s. Granny, pictured, is said to be the matriarch of the group and was spotted in the Strait of Georgia at the weekend . Researchers began studying the resident orcas in the early 1970s. At that time they had photos of Ruffles, known as J1, and Granny, taken in 1971. Their relative size suggests they were both fully grown adults when the photo was taken, meaning they were both at least 20 years old in 1971. Experts at the time said Ruffles was the younger of the two, and due to their association, suggested Granny was Ruffles’ mother. If Ruffles was at least 20 in 1971, she would have been born in 1951, and since Granny was not spotted with any more children after this date, the researchers assumed Ruffles was her final calf. Female killer whales stop producing at around the age of 40, which means if Ruffles was born in 1951, and Granny was 40 at that time, her birth year would be 1911. Granny was spotted in the Strait of Georgia on Saturday and is thought to have travelled up from California with her pod, dubbed J-Pod. It is the first time Granny, officially known as J2, had returned to the northwest since the 3 March, according to Captain Simon Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching. He captured the images using a telephoto lens. Pidcock said he recognised Granny because she has a white patch on the dorsal fin alongside a half-moon-shaped notch. News of the Granny’s return was announced by the Pacific Whale Watch Association (PWWA). Executive director Michael Harris said J-Pod had travelled up from the coast of California, near the mouth of the Russian River, where it was spotted eight days before Pidcock’s sighting. This means the pod covered around 800 miles in just over a week. Pidcock said: ‘We were thrilled to see her. And it’s mind-blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old.  She was born before the Titanic went down. Can you imagine the things she’s seen in her lifetime?’ Granny, pictured, is thought to be 103 years old. Although her age is an estimate, studies into her reproductive history have plotted her birth all the way back to 1911. The sighting was the first time Granny had returned to the northwest since the 3 March, according to Captain Simon Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures . Experts said Granny's pod, called J-Pod, travelled up from the coast of California, near the mouth of the Russian River, marked at A, where it was spotted eight days before Pidcock's sighting in the Strait of Georgia, marked at B. This means the pod covered around 800 miles in just over a week . The average lifespan of a wild orca is between 60 and 80 years, but other members of the Southern Residents have lived almost equally as long lives as Granny, including females Ocean Sun and Lummi, who died aged 85 and 98 respectively. Other Southern Resident orcas including Tokitae, who lives in Miami Seaquarium, and Northern Resident orca Corky in SeaWorld San Diego, are both the oldest killer whales in captivity, aged around 50 years old.

Because, as he reveals today with shocking candour, his years of waking nightmare were further poisoned by physical and sexual abuse whenever his exhausted parents left him in the hands of a care home. Scroll down for videos . Ghost boy: Martin Pistorius, pictured with his wife Joanna, suffered years of physical and sexual abuse at hands of care home staff . Speaking for the first time about the shameful episode, Martin says he still has flashbacks and nightmares about the mistreatment - to the extent that he only rarely visits his native South Africa, where it took place. For Martin, a web designer from Essex, the land of his birth is forever tainted by illness and cruelty. ‘I would dread it whenever my parents told me they were taking me to the care home because I knew what would happen and I had no way of letting them know the agonies I’d suffer,’ he told The Mail on Sunday. ‘It was horrific. Of course they felt dreadful when they eventually found out and my father Rodney reported what happened but of course everyone denied it and as a result I have never had justice. ‘People in the care home would pull my hair making my eyes water, the metal spoon would crash against my teeth as they forced food into my mouth. ‘When it made me sick they’d shout and scream at me. I knew if I cried it would only make it worse. ‘I would be forced to drink scalding tea or fed until I was sick, then I’d be slapped, shouted at, made to feel worthless, then would come the sexual attacks from women who were supposed to be looking after me. ‘One woman would come into the room and straddle me and simulate sex with me and touch me inappropriately. Nothing made me feel more powerless, I longed to run away’. It was a lesser ordeal, maybe, but he was also forced to watch endless re-runs of children’s cartoon Barney the Dinosaur, which itself became a form of torture. Martin, front, with his family in the last picture before the illness struck and left him in a virtual coma . Loving family: Martin and his father Rodney as the mystery illness began to take hold when he was just 12 years of age . ‘Each day I’d count down the minutes until it was over and I was 24 hours closer to going home.’ Martin’s father tried to take action when they eventually realised what had been happening but they denied it and said there was no evidence. Martin’s miraculous recovery was recounted in his book Ghost Boy, first serialised in The Mail on Sunday. He became ill at 12, developing sore throat that soon became a mystery illness. In the months that followed his mind and body broke down and he became trapped in the shell of child he had once been. Martin, pictured left, was also forced to watch endless re-runs of children’s cartoon Barney the Dinosaur, pictured right, which itself became a form of torture . As his illness, which is believed to have been a degenerative neurological disorder, took hold, Martin became completely unresponsive. Doctors told his devastated parents to simply wait for him to die. Ultimately, Martin became utterly unresponsive. Yet at the age of 16, he suddenly began to become aware of his surroundings and by the age of 19 his mind was fully intact. But, frighteningly, he was still unable to communicate. ‘You have no idea how frightening it was. The stark reality that I was going to spend the rest of my life like that, totally alone,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t make a sign or a sound to let anyone know I’d become aware again. I was invisible, a ghost boy.’ Martin’s miraculous recovery was recounted in his book Ghost Boy. Hollywood is now fighting over his story to make it into a movie . Such were the depths of his family’s despair in those early years, that his agonised mother Joan, 64, told him she hoped he’d die before then trying to kill herself. Abandoned by doctors who were baffled by his mysterious illness, Martin regained full consciousness at 25. Martin met his wife Joanne, now a social worker, on the internet. They talked by email and, before long, she asked him to visit her in Britain. They married in 2009. Life partners: Martin and Joanna shortly after their engagement . Now, as he sits with his wife in a country manor hotel near his home in Harlow, speaking with the aid of a voice synthesiser, Martin admits the continued interest in his story is at times overwhelming. Martin, says proudly: ‘Getting a degree was never something I could imagine happening. I had stopped my schooling at 12, I had no memory of anything – basic maths, the alphabet – but I went along to an open day at the University of Hertfordshire. ‘They told me to write about why I wanted to study Computer Science and to my shock and amazement they offered me a place unconditionally’. Despite not being able to hold a pen at the time, he applied for a scholarship from Google and fought off competition from Oxford and Cambridge students to secure a grant to help pay for his studies. ‘I am by nature quite a shy, reserved person and but I made new friends at university, we were all geeks together. I learned a lot and grew an enormous amount as a person, I felt more confident and it was as if I was able to regain a big part of my life that I’d missed out on. ‘But it wasn’t easy. I was juggling full-time studies with working and a five hour daily bus commute. And on top of that I had to learn all the basic maths– like multiplication and algebra – that my memory had erased’. Martin admits that graduating in July 2013 was one of the proudest days of his life. Milestone: Martin and Joanna on their wedding day in 2009. The happy couple has set up home in Hertfordshire and now rarely returns to his native South Africa . ‘The ceremony in St Alban’s Cathedral was amazing, my parents flew over from South Africa and I was even asked to speak on behalf of the other graduates. It was very emotional for all of us, we could never have believed I could succeed like that’. Martin’s next milestone was learning to drive and in 2012 he went for an assessment to determine if he’d be safe on the road. ‘It took a while to find an instructor who could teach me to drive an adapted car so I studied for my theory test in the meantime and passed first time. My first time scared me initially, the closest I had come to driving was controlling my electric wheelchair and I was terrified that if I wasn’t properly in control I could injure someone. Martin, pictured with wife Joanna, says he would like to be played by Matt Damon if his story is turned into a movie . ‘But my instructor told me I was a natural and took to it like a duck to water and after 40 lessons I passed my test in October 2013, I was ecstatic. My confidence has built and now I drive all over the country which has helped me build up my computer consultancy business and given me a freedom once unimaginable to me’. His book is enjoying renewed popularity and has once again reached number 5 in The New York Times best sellers list. With 40 rival Hollywood film makers competing for the rights to his story, it looks as though his life will be immortalised on screen, too. Determined to build a new future, he and Joanne are now planning a family, something they had initially ruled out. ‘She is the love of my life and perhaps, selfishly, we didn’t want to share each other with anyone else. ‘But now I’ve finished studying and we are in a better position financially and professionally and we would love to have a family of our own. We are a little older now but we hope it may happen, we will just have to see’. The couple hope that with Hollywood knocking at their door they may eventually be able to move out of their small flat but like everything else in his life, Martin takes each new day in his stride. And his sense of humour has never waned. Asked who might play them on screen he confesses Matt Damon and Cameron Diaz are their favourites. ‘Anyone good looking, obviously’, he jokes.

"David Cameron faced embarrassment over the NHS crisis last night after his doctor brother-in-law warned of ‘unprecedented’ pressure on the health service. Cardiologist Carl Brookes, who is married to the Prime Minister’s sister Tania, spoke of the ‘extraordinary’ challenges faced by his own hospital trust in Hampshire over the past few weeks. It also emerged that the trust, which is made up of three hospitals, is so stretched that it has asked IT workers and other non-medical staff to help out on the wards. Scroll down for video . Carl Brookes warned his brother-in-law David Cameron warned of 'unprecedented' pressure at the A&E department in Basingstoke, meaning IT workers have had to help serve meals and do laundry . Dr Brookes, medical director at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Trust, raised the alarm over the pressure his A&E department in Basingstoke was coming under. He said: ‘It is important people understand this is unprecedented. There is no doubt that we, and other hospitals around the country, are facing extraordinary challenges.’ Mr Brookes' wife Tania is the sister of Tory party leader David Cameron . Dr Brookes revealed that the A&E department was dealing with 11 per cent more patients than at the same period last year and was struggling to move patients on and make space for new arrivals. He said: ‘There are problems with access to adult services – we are seeing a lot of frail, elderly people who need special care. If the back door is blocked, it makes it difficult to get in the front door.’ The trust has tried to relieve the pressure on doctors and nurses by asking administrative and IT staff to help on wards by serving meals or sorting laundry. In a leaked email, management told staff: ‘There is a desperate need to support clinical staff on wards.’ It is not the first time Mr Cameron’s brother-in-law has embarrassed the Prime Minister over the NHS. Four years ago, he warned hospitals could lose out under the Coalition’s controversial NHS reforms by giving too much power to GPs, though he later backtracked on the remark. Dr Brookes and the trust were not available for comment last night, but Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘If Mr Cameron won’t listen to patients and the public, maybe his own family will have better luck. ‘He has been warned for months about the A&E crisis he’s caused.’","Dr Brookes said problems in A&E departments are 'unprecedented'

"Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was revived on Saturday morning after being found face down and unconscious  in a bath tub full of water. But the 21-year-old remains in a medically induced coma suffering from swelling on the brain, reports TMZ. Bobbi was discovered at home by her husband Nick Gordon who began CPR before police took over as they awaited an ambulance. In an eerie co-incidence, her mother was found dead almost three years ago when she accidentally drowned in a bath tub at the Beverly Hills Hilton Hotel - she too was face down. Her father Bobby Brown is currently by her side along with family friend Tyler Perry. Scroll down for video . Hospitalised: Bobbi Kristina, pictured at an event on January 25, was found unresponsive in the bath tub on Saturday morning . Bobbi looked frail at an event in  Los Ageles last January . Police investigation: Police tape surrounds the home Bobbi Kristina shares with her husband Nick . Investigation: Detectives gather outside the home of Whitney Houston's daughter as they try to establish exactly what happened . Family members were seen entering the hospital on Saturday evening to see Bobbi . According to local reports, the emergency services were called to Bobbi and Nick's home in Roswell Georgia at 10.25am on Saturday. It is the same house they shared with her mother. The reality star was rushed to a hospital where her condition is now described as stable in the intensive care unit. In a statement the Roswell Police Department said: 'Her husband and a friend located her in a bath tub this morning and she was unresponsive. 'He started CPR and a police officer took over life-saving measures until an ambulance arrived.' The friend telephoned for help as Gordon worked at saving his wife. Having fun: Hours before she was found, Bobbi posted a snap of herself with a friend at her home, writing 'YAYYYY :) finally my famBAM!!!' Married last year: Bobbi seen here on January 17th - who struggled in the wake of her mother's death - married Nick Gordon last year . Taken to the Emergency Room: The reality star arrived here at  North Fulton Hospital on Saturday morning . The unresponsive reality TV star was immediately transferred to North Fulton Hospital where she is still being treated in ICU, according to TMZ who describe her current condition as stable. It is as yet unclear what caused her collapse and a police search of the home turned up no drugs. 'Obviously we all know her mom died this very same way,' said Lisa Holland of the Roswell PD. 'Can't say how sad this is. It's a difficult situation for police officer to perform CPR on any person.' Press interest: Lisa Holland of the Roswell Police Department briefs the press pack that have gathered at the North Fulton Hospital where Bobbi Kristina is being treated . Desperate for news: Members of the press and public anxious for updates Whitney's daughter's condition . At a press conference outside the hospital on Saturday afternoon Holland confirmed 'she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition.' She added that nobody knows what caused her collapse but that, police are talking to friends and family and obtaining a search warrant so they can look through the residence. 'We don't know if this was a medical condition where she had a problem in the tub or if it was any type of self-initiated or overdose type of situation,' Holland admitted. Police were last called to the home on January 23rd after a 'reported fight,' but officers found no one home when they arrived. I Will Always Love You: Bobbi tweeted an emotional message to her dead mother on January 26th . Anniversary looming: . 'She's been through a lot, you know what I'm saying. This is a hard time, it's her mother's anniversary of her death. It's been a hard time, it's a rough time of year,' Jerod Brown, who said he was Bobbi Kristina Brown's first cousin, told NBC News. 'But she's a tiger, she's going to pull through it.' He then added; 'Kris has been doing well, working out. She's been in the gym, doing cardio. ... Swimming a lot, getting her vocals right for this album that she's about to come out with.' Another cousin, YF Kennedy, told E! News; 'Krissi doesn't do drugs. She hasn't been drinking or doing drugs and she's cut down on cigarettes. She's been trying to get her music together and keep her voice clean. Her voice is so beautiful.' Kennedy also said; 'She's still been going through the grieving stages but is trying to keep her spirits up. She's been going to the gym every day with her husband and trying to be happy. She swims a lot.' 'Kris has been doing well, working out. She's been in the gym, doing cardio. ... Swimming a lot, getting her vocals right for this album that she's about to come out with,' said Bobbi's cousin . On January 26th, Whitney's daughter made reference to the upcoming anniversary with an emotional tweet. She posted: 'Littlelady & yourgrowing young man @nickgordon miss you mommy so much...loving you more every sec, #Anniversary!' Speaking to Oprah Winfrey about her mother’s death in March 2012, Bobbi said: ‘It’s so surreal sometimes. I still walk in the house and call her name. ‘She’s always with me. I can always feel her with me. ‘She used to say, “Do you need me?” and I would say, “I always need you.’” In a heart-wrenching admission, Bobbi said she can’t bring herself to listen to her mother’s songs. ‘I can hear her voice telling me to keep moving, baby – I gotcha. Her mother Whitney died on February 11th, 2012 hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy Awards party. The Los Angeles County coroner’s office later confirmed the I Will Always Love You hitmaker passed away as a result of drowning and 'effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use'. The cause of Bobbi’s incident is currently unknown, but local police are investigating the situation at her home while she recovers in hospital. The death of her mother left Bobbi distraught, and this is not the first time emergency services have had to intervene. Revived: Bobbi was rushed to hospital in 2012, a year after her mother died, after taking a sedative with alcohol . Mommy's girl: Kristina has always been fiercely proud of her mother and still mourns her loss greatly . Indeed just two days after the first anniversary of Whitney's death, Bobbi  was pictured being taken from her then home in Los Angeles on a stretcher appearing unconscious. She was hospitalised for treatment, after mixing alcohol with a sedative. Even before Whitney died  Bobbi was the subject of rumours as to her alleged use of drugs. In March 2011 Bobbi took to Twitter to deny claims she had checked into rehab after pictures surfaced that allegedly showed her snorting lines of cocaine. At the time her mother was said to have desperately pushed the teenager to seek treatment soon after, with no success. 'Excuse me,' Bobbi Kristina tweeted, 'but I’d like to say that I am NOT going to rehab? I’m perfectly healthy and I am not addicted to anything but life.' The National Enquirer, which published the scandalous pictures, reported that Whitney had attempted an intervention of sorts. Further pictures published by the tabloid in March 2012 shortly after Whitney's death showed Bobbi apparently using a three-foot bong to smoke marijuana. Happier times: Whitney cradles the infant Bobbi back in 1993 . Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown and Bobbi Kristina at the premiere of The Princess Diaries 2 - Royal Engagement in 2004 . A recent Lifetime biopic of Whitney focused heavily on her drug use, received mixed reviews from viewers. Bobbi did not comment on the movie after it aired earlier this month, although she had expressed her displeasure in advance. Her grandmother Cissy was the most outspoken, angrily objecting to the movie even being made. 'Lifetime has chosen to go ahead with the movie about Whitney in spite of my family's objections,' the bereaved mother said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in June. 'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.' Cause of death: The LA County coroner said her death was as a result of drowning and effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use; pictured is the scene of her death . The last supper: A photo of Whitney's room at the Beverly Hills Hilton showed the remains of a meal . After her mother's death, Bobbi began a relationship with Nick who was described as like being a brother to her as she grew up. The couple married in January 2014 but faced criticism after it emerged they had shared a home since before they were teens. But they have insisted they are not blood related and are not even connected in any family way as Gordon was never adopted by Houston. In late January Nick told Extra the jabs 'put a fire in us' and added: 'The critics can say whatever they want to say… it's like we have a force field and that s**t's just bouncing off of it.' The two became friends when Whitney asked Nick, who was going through a rough time, to move in with them when he was only 12 years old. Close for years: Bobbi, with her husband Nick at the premiere of The Houstons in 2012, who moved into the family home when she was just 12-years-old . But the relationship heightened a rift between her and her grandmother, Cissy who she fell out with when the matriach announced plans to write a book about her tragic daughter's life. And in July 2013, Cissy penned an open letter to her granddaughter airing her concerns about her well-being. She wrote: Krissi, all I want for you is your good health and your happiness. 'Do I want you to get married in the near future? No, I don't. I think you're too young and I wish you'd wait. 'But that's because I'm Grandma,"" she continues. 'I'm supposed to worry about you. I'm supposed to wonder if Nick or ANY man is good enough for you, My Baby's Baby.'

"Photographer Daniel Sullivan endured a blistering 220-mile hike to document Hawaii's ancient King's Highway, a landmark withering away with time that he hopes to immortalise with his remarkable images. Sullivan, 39, walked the once popular coastal route in Maui during the summer of 2013 and is currently running a Kickstarter campaign to fund a book of 100 pictures of the trail entitled The Maui Coast - Legacy of the King's Highway. He crossed sheer cliffs, battled white water and dense jungle to uncover the amazing island scenery of the King's Highway, which was built over 500 years ago by King Pi'ilani who ruled the island during the 16th Century. Scroll down for video . Turtles make their way across Ho‘okipa Beach, Maui, as photographed by Daniel Sullivan on his journey along the King's Highway . The Hui Aloha Church in Kipahulu stands out like a beacon along the train, the white building among the bright green foliage among them . The sun spectacularly sets behind a preserved section of the King's Highway, a road of jagged stone built by King Pi'ilani in the 16th Century . 'I've always been interested in Hawaiian culture. And since I moved to Maui 10 years ago, I've been searching for the Kings Highway,' said Mr Sullivan. 'Several years ago a Hawaiian man by the name of Eddie Pu'u died. He was a legend here among the Hawaiian's as he used to walk the King's Highway every year barefoot because of a dream he had once had about having to preserve the Aina, or the ""sacred land"" as the Hawaiians call it. 'He was the only person I had ever heard of who knew the ancient trail, who had actually hiked it. The next summer my wife and two children were leaving for a 10-day trip to visit their grandparents in Idaho and I decided to walk around the island.' Mr Sullivan battled through pain as he woke up at 5am every morning and hiked until the dark of night. He said: 'Physically the hike was a bit of a challenge for me. By the end I had layers of blisters and my calves were really swollen. An oasis-like scene at the Twin Falls in Maui alongside the disappearing King's Highway that Sullivan is aiming to immortalise . An exposed section of the King's Highway in Kanio, Maui, that Sullivan hiked during the making of his book about the ancient trail . 'Water was also a challenge. The summer before I left, a hiker had died of dehydration on the trail past Kanio, which is where the lava fields are. 'I was especially nervous about this section. The lava rocks are like razors and can cut easily through skin. 'Unfortunately, I ran out of water here and was forced to make a decision to hike along the coast or climb up several miles to the road at Ulupalukua where I could find water. I decided to hike up, over the sharp rocks. The detour took me a while and by the time I reached the road, I was dizzy and exhausted. 'The first car I saw I flagged down to ask for help. It turns out it was a good friend of mine and her mother who had set out to find me and bring me food and water.' The Highway was once considered the artery of the island for commerce, trade and protection from invasion. Today, large sections of the King's Highway have disappeared into the jungle or have been completely destroyed. Mr Sullivan said: 'Along the way I stopped and asked locals and elders about the Kings Highway. The sun rises over Oluwalu, Maui, in this serene image that will feature in his book, The Maui Coast - Legacy of the King's Highway . A stark example of the blue stone at Gorge Kaupo, Maui, that locals told Sullivan to follow in his quest along the King's Highway . 'Look for the blue stones' is what they told me, so I set out looking the blue stones. Everywhere I walked I would find ancient heiau or temples coved up in the jungle, pieces of the Highway. 'In some sections the road had been covered up, by jungle, and vines, in some areas it had been paved over or developed but in others the road stood out as if each stone had been laid out yesterday.' Despite being a landmark on the island, there is no preservation or protection for this valuable historical relic, which was once at the heart of Hawaiian culture. Mr Sullivan said: 'I think much more could and should have been done to preserve the King's Highway. Large sections have been paved over, bulldozed or left neglected. The trail was an amazing feat of craftsmanship 500 years ago, laying hundreds of thousands of small stones through cliffs and gorges. Another beautiful sunset scene on the Maui trail, this time at Wailea (left) and the fishing stone shrine in Kanio . 'The fact that sections of it still remain is a testament to the people who built it. The King's Highway should be protected as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but sadly there is no state of federal protection or funds to protect most of it. 'There are so many sacred sites here in Hawaii that are not protected. Some are on private land some are in the rain forest and jungles.' For the past 20 years, Mr Sullivan has been taking photographs in Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa, documenting the human spirit. His photographs and essays have explored Afghanistan's refugees, the tribes of Ethiopia's Omo River and the eagle hunters of Mongolia. Mr Sullivan added: 'When I graduated from college in 1999, I sold my car and bought a one way ticket to Jerusalem for the New Year Celebration. I spent the next year photographing in Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan and Afghanistan. 'From early on I believed in getting close to my subjects. In Peshawar, Pakistan, I lived for six weeks with a family of Afghan refugees. In Syria I lived with a group of Jesuit Monks at a sixth century monastery in the desert. I learned a lot about cultures, religion and people.'","Daniel Sullivan has photographed the King's Highway in Maui, Hawaii, in a bid to preserve its heritage .

"An armed robber was caught after a security guard likened him to The Cat from the television comedy series Red Dwarf. Usman Ali made off with £14,000 after threatening a Loomis driver with a hammer outside a Wickes store in Birmingham on July 26 2014. The victim of the attack told police that Ali appeared to look like the character The Cat from Red Dwarf, played by actor Danny John-Jules. The victim of the robbery carried out by Usman Ali (left) told police that the 26-year-old appeared to look like the character The Cat (right) from Red Dwarf, played by actor Danny John-Jules . Usman Ali made off with £14,000 after threatening a Loomis driver with a hammer outside a Wickes store (pictured) in Birmingham on July 26 2014 . The next day Ali, also from Birmingham, was spotted ploughing hundreds of pounds of stained notes into gaming machines at a Ladbrokes near his home. Officers swooped immediately and recognised the 26-year-old as the suspect in the Loomis robbery. Scientific analysis of the contaminated notes confirmed they had come from the stolen cash box − and at Birmingham Crown Court Ali was jailed for eight years after being found guilty of conspiracy to rob. West Midlands Police Detective Constable Andrew Mitcham, said: 'Ali was at the bookies with the sole purpose of getting rid of the dye-stained notes and taking his winnings receipt to the counter to get clean notes. 'It was effectively quick-fire money laundering. At Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) Ali was jailed for eight years after being found guilty of conspiracy to rob . 'The victim gave us a distinctive description and said his attacker looked like ""Cat"" from Red Dwarf − and in court prosecutors presented an image of the character to the jury to illustrate the comparison. 'The prosecutor clearly had a sense of humour as in his closing speech he said ""Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, the robbery at Wickes has his (pointing at Ali) name on it"" - in a clear reference to the company's advertising slogan! 'Ali has rightly been handed a long prison term. Although he didn't use the hammer in anger, he threatened violence against the security driver and left him fearing the threats would be carried out. 'We were able to present strong evidence to the court which highlighted his lies to police and led to the jury unanimously finding him guilty.' When Ladbrokes staff emptied the gaming machine Ali was using they discovered £480 in dye-stained notes, whilst arresting officers found another £400 in tainted cash on the 26-year-old. Ali claimed he had got the cash after selling off car parts but could not name the buyer or provide a contact number. At the time of the robbery Ali was on licence having been released from prison part-way through a conviction for supplying Class A drugs. He must now serve the remainder of that sentence − which runs until September 2016 − before his eight year robbery term begins.","Usman Ali stole £14,000 after threatening a security driver with hammer .

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed one the main topics of conversation heading into Super Bowl week in a news conference on Thursday - the deflated footballs used by the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game. 'Whether a competitive advantage was actually gained or not is secondary in my mind to whether that rule was violated,' said Goodell, who noted a resolution would not come until after the Super Bowl. He then added; 'We don't know enough in this investigation to know who was responsible or whether there was even an infraction.' Scroll down for video . NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a news conference for NFL Super Bowl XLIX football game on Friday that Deflategate would not be addressed until after Sunday's game . Patriots owner Robert Kraft has said he expects the investigation to determine his team did nothing wrong — and he expects an apology from the NFL. Kraft did not attend Friday's news conference. Goodell also described his league — and himself — as having addressed missteps on difficult matters such as domestic violence and being ready to move on. 'As an organization, and as an individual, it's been a tough year,' said Goodell, 'but a year of great progress, and I'm excited about the future.' Nearing the end of a season he acknowledged was filled with 'plenty of challenges.' Goodell was also asked whether he thought he deserved a pay cut and said; 'That's up to the owners.' Asb for whether or not he bleives he should be fiored, he said; 'No, I can't. Does that surprise you?' Goodell brushed aside a question about whether there are conflict-of-interest problems with paying those who head up independen"" investigations, such as into the league's handling of the Ray Rice case or the ongoing look at the New England Patriots' use of deflated footballs in the AFC title game. 'We have had people who have had uncompromising integrity' run those inquiries, Goodell said. Then, speaking directly to the reporter, he added: 'Somebody has to pay them ... unless you're volunteering, which I don't think you are.' Rice is the former Baltimore Ravens running back who punched his now-wife in an elevator, drawing an initial suspension from Goodell of two games. Goodell also said the league was improving, despite numerous scandals involving domestic abuse and assault this year . Goodell changed that to an indefinite ban after video from inside the elevator was posted by TMZ. Rice later appealed, and an arbitrator reinstated him. That and other domestic violence cases led the league to design a new personal conduct policy, which was approved unanimously by owners but has been criticized by the players' union. 'We've made enormous progress,"" Goodell said Friday. 'We're in a good place.' Another issue that won't be resolved until after the season's final game, Goodell said, is whether Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch will be fined for refusing to answer any questions at required media sessions this week. The NFL docked Lynch $100,000 earlier this season for not talking to reporters. 'I understand it may not be on the top of his list,' Goodell said. 'But everyone else is cooperating, everyone else is doing their part.'","NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said no decision will be made on Deflategate until after the Super Bowl .

"The sister of missing Manic Street Preachers lyricist Richey Edwards has revealed her family's battle to come to terms with his disappearance. This Sunday marks 20 years since the guitarist checked out of a London hotel never to be seen again. Two weeks later his car was found abandoned at a motorway service station. Despite numerous and high-profile appeals in the media, no trace of Edwards has been found - either dead or alive. Although he was declared legally dead in 2008, Edwards' sister Rachel Elias hopes he will be remembered for his talents rather than his troubles - which culminated in him being admitted to a mental health unit. Scroll down for video . The sister of missing Manic Street Preachers lyricist Richey Edwards (pictured in 1992) has revealed her family's battle to come to terms with his disappearance . Edwards' sister Rachel Elias (left) hopes he will be remembered for his talents rather than his troubles. Richey Edwards is pictured right performing with the Manic Street Preachers . But while Mrs Elias is aiming to secure a more positive legacy for her brother, coming to terms with the events of February 1 1995 is still a long way off for her family - especially in light of the death of her father Graham two years ago. She said: 'It was difficult losing dad....he had terminal cancer. 'He knew towards the end that his life was limited. It wasn't a sudden death. It was difficult because he had to face up to that realisation - that we all may have to - we may not find out what happened to Richard. It was obviously difficult for my father. 'Going through his bereavement, I recognised the difference between that and someone who is missing. 'It is very different. When someone dies you have that acute loss. It sounds like a cliche, that bereavement is a process - but it really is. 'You can go to a crematorium, graveyard or place where you have scattered their ashes and remember.....but when someone goes missing you are left with this ongoing uncertainty. 'Not knowing makes it worse.' Much has been made about Edwards' sudden disappearance - which came against a backdrop of personal turmoil. In 1994, Manic Street Preachers released their third album and dark masterpiece The Holy Bible. This Sunday marks 20 years since the guitarist checked out of a London hotel never to be seen again . With 70 per cent of the words written by Edwards, a man who once famously carved the words 4 REAL into his arm in response to a journalist who questioned his band's integrity, many sought to draw parallels between his state of mind and songs on subjects such as prostitution, anorexia and the horrors of the Holocaust. In the run up to the LP's release, Edwards was admitted to Whitchurch Psychiatric Hospital in Cardiff before being checked into the Priory Clinic as his alcoholism and self-harming spiralled out-of-control. Less than two months on from smashing his guitar to smithereens at a sold out London show in Christmas, a now shaven haired Edwards appeared to be on the mend. As well as writing lyrics for new Manic Street Preachers songs, the ever-professional and punctual university graduate prepared to for an upcoming promotional tour of the US. He and his band's singer James Dean Bradfield checked into London's Embassy Hotel ahead of a flight across the Atlantic the next day. But the following morning when Bradfield went to rouse his bandmate, no answer came from room 516. When hotel staff opened up the room, they found the room empty - save for a handful of personal items. A car belonging to Richey Edwards (pictured) was found abandoned at a motorway service station two weeks after he was last seen . His sister said that immediately sent alarm bells ringing. 'Despite what people may think, his disappearance really was out of character for him. He was always constantly there, if not physically, in conversation with you,' she added. 'Even when he was touring, we always knew where he was. 'The idea he was acting out and walked off as to say ""I'm not getting on this flight"" was not him. 'He was always passionate and professional about the band. He had never done anything like this before.' The days that followed were pure agony for the Edwards family as well as his bandmates - who were all childhood friends. Eventually his silver Vauxhall Cavalier was found at the now defunct Aust Service Station - next to the old Severn Bridge. The car, which had been lived in for some time and had a flat battery, was later put on a tow rope and transported back to Edwards' parents house in Blackwood. But the fact a steering lock was on gave the Edwards' parents a sign of hope. Mrs Elias added: 'Why would you worry about someone stealing your car if you were chaotically thinking of ending your life?' However, the days and months passed with no real progress on his whereabouts. Already emotionally exhausted by what had happened, his family said they were left further drained by the ordeal to come. Mrs Elias said: 'He was reported missing in Paddington Green Police Station because the hotel was nearby, yet his car was found near the Severn Bridge which involved Avon & Somerset Police and at some point he had returned to his flat in Cardiff which involved South Wales Police. 'At one point my mother and father had a visit to the house from the police at about 3am. 'They had been sent here to search the premises on instruction of the Metropolitan Police. 'I don't know why they did it. Possibly because they thought it was a publicity stunt or they possibly thought it was foul play.' Then there were the false gossip and rumours to deal with. Mrs Elias said: 'People said all sorts of things in the initial stages - that he was hiding out at a fan's house or that we knew where he was. It was just totally fabricated. In 1994, Manic Street Preachers released their third album and dark masterpiece The Holy Bible . 'That hampered the police's involvement, they had to explore statements like that rather than just be focused on the investigation. 'Also he was noted as a vulnerable adult on his missing person's file - because he had a recent hospital admission and prescribed anti-depressants. 'We assumed the police would risk assess the situation. But in retrospect, there wasn't that much active searching done. They would follow up leads if people contacted them, but they didn't actively try to find him. One officer even said he had a right to go missing. 'It was incredibly hurtful.' However, Edwards' sister refused to give in - tirelessly campaigning and working so other families going through same hell as her would be met with fewer barriers. 'Things have definitely improved. People have family liaison officers now and improvements have also been made in the way the police communicate with families of missing people,' Mrs Elias added. As well as promoting the charity Missing People, which helped her family so much, she has also campaigned for changes in the law to those seeking to have their relative declared presumed dead when a body has not been found. She added: 'Even though we had Richard declared legally dead that hasn't assisted us in anyway dealing with the loss of him. 'That process was just a financial matter. 'I think unless somebody returned or you recover their body or you at least know where they are - even if they don't want to return - that would resolve the matter. Richey Edwards bottom left with his band mates (left) in 1992 and second left in front of Buckingham Palace in 1991 . 'The only thing that has helped me is meeting other family members. Even though every missing person disappears for a different reason, the experiences are the same for those left behind. 'What you end up being left with is your imagination and you can construct everything in that....some people get a fair set of beliefs as to what happened. 'But I try not to go down that route because that's just speculation.....it is very difficult not to do that though. 'One of things that can go through your mind is 'was it something I said? Was it something I didn't say but should have done?' 'Every person I've met who has had someone go missing has felt that. You question whether you are part of the reason why they don't want to be here any more. That makes feel sad because it could possibly be the case.....you can't help but not think that.' Mental health support worker Mrs Elias added that one thing which has helped her has been her renewed faith in God. She added: 'Over the last few years I have been going back to church - the church I used to go to years ago. And I've really found that having a faith has really made sense of the situation to me. 'I feel now that even if I don't know where Richard is or ever find out where he is, eventually at some point I will know. I feel that strongly now about it. That's just me. I can't talk for other people.' In the meantime, Edwards' sister wants people to remember him as a brilliant writer than a mere tragic figure of 'cult of Richey' caricature. Richey Edwards is pictured in a 'missing people' poster held by his sister Rachel Elias . James Dean Bradfield, Nicky Wire and Sean Moore of Manic Street Preachers, pictured in 2012 . 'It's sort of snowballed into this identity that he's only known for. 'The fact that he was really intelligent and sensitive and that he was the force behind the band their lyrics just seems to get forgotten. 'We've always been tremendously proud of Richard. 'He always excelled at whatever he did at whether that was at school, college and university or with the band. 'I suppose his legacy lives on in a way through the songs he wrote for the band - but his work is often set against the backdrop of his disappearance and his problems. 'I haven't decided what shape that will take, but there are number of plans I'm working through at the moment.' Mrs Elias also plans to keep up her charity work too. She is a member of The Missing People Rock Choir who have released a fundraising single called I Miss You. The track can be downloaded for a donation of £1.","Sunday marks 20 years since the disappearance of lyricist Richey Edwards .

"A TV host has apologized for shaming a black model's hairstyle live on air. Sandra Bennett was discussing fashion accessories on shopping channel QVC last Sunday when the camera turned towards Michelle Holloway who was posing with a handbag. The host is then heard saying: 'You may look back and think, ""Why did I wear my hair like that?"" But you’ll like your bag still.' Controversial: QVC host Sandra Bennett has apologized for any misconceptions her comments about Michelle Holloway's (pictured) hairstyle caused . Insensitive: Bennett (right) was speaking to a Dooney & Burke spokeswoman when the camera turned to Holloway. She then said: 'You may look back and think, ‘Why did I wear my hair like that?' Her co-host, a spokeswoman for fashion company Dooney & Burke then said: 'That’s right. You won’t look at your hair in the picture; you’ll look at your handbag.' Bennett was slammed on social media for making the 'insensitive' comments, forcing her into an apology. A blogger known as 'Bougie Black Girl' then asked the presenter about the controversial remarks on Twitter. Bennett replied: 'I'm so sorry. I wasn't talking about her. She also didn't think so. It was bad timing and I'm so sorry to have offended. 'I didn't even notice the camera was on her. I would never hurt her. I adore her. I'm very sorry that I offended.' Apology: She responded to blogger 'Bougie Black Girl' saying she was 'sorry' and 'wasn't talking about her' (Holloway). These tweets were later deleted . 'Light-hearted': Bennett wrote a final apology on Facebook suggesting she didn't realize anything she had said caused offence until she was notified by other people . The tweets were taken down but Bennett then went on Facebook to clarify what happened. She wrote: 'Hi everyone. I want to apologize to anyone I offended during a recent Dooney & Bourke show. I made a comment along of the lines of when you carry a Dooney, you look good even if you don't do your hair. 'It was meant to be lighthearted, but in the middle of my comment, the camera cut to Michelle, an African American model. I want to be clear that I was in no way talking about her. It was just terrible timing. In fact, despite how it may have appeared, I didn't even realize this had happened until today when I saw some comments on Facebook and received a phone call. 'I have since called Michelle to apologize and thankfully, she didn't remember the comment or even know any of this had happened. 'I'm confident that anyone who knows me personally understands I would never even think to make such a connection. Still, in our business perception is reality and I'm mortified that I gave that impression. So again, I'm very sorry to our viewers who felt hurt or angered by my comments.'","Sandra Bennett was discussing fashion accessories on QVC last Sunday .

"Ravel Morrison will suffer the ignominy of training with the Under 21 side following his return to West Ham. The forward has been on loan at Cardiff City but has returned to Upton Park early after Bluebirds manager Russell Slade made it clear he had no future at the club. However, there will be no place for the former Manchester United forward in Sam Allardyce first-team plans, meaning Morrison will be told to train with West Ham's Under 21 side. Ravel Morrison has returned from his loan at Cardiff City (left) early and is now back with West Ham . Morrison posted a photo of himself on Instagram in West Ham United training kit during a gym session . Hammers boss Sam Allardyce won't risk the harmony in his squad by giving Morrison another chance . Age: 21 . Born: Wythenshawe, Manchester . Position: Midfielder . Clubs: Manchester United (2010-12), West Ham United (2012-), Birmingham City (loan, 2012-13), Queens Park Rangers (loan, 2014), Cardiff City (loan, 2014) Career appearances: 80 . Career goals: 14 . Allardyce is delighted with his squad's dynamic following their excellent start to the season and doesn't want to do anything that may harm that. Morrison and Allardyce have not always seen eye-to-eye since the 21-year-old's arrival at the club in 2012, and the manager fears the talented forward could have a disruptive influence at Upton Park. The Hammers will try to sell Morrison in the January transfer window, but know that will be easier said than done. Morrison is understood to have an £18million release clause in his contract, but West Ham will let him leave for a mere fraction of that price just to get him of their books. If they don't find a buyer they will even consider the option of paying-up the remaining seven months of his contract to ensure he leaves the club as soon as possible. West Ham's third option will be to let him run down his contract when he becomes a free agent in the summer. Despite the club's seeming desperation to rid themselves of Morrison in the coming weeks, there remains regret they were unable to make the move work. The midfielder has been at West Ham for two-and-a-half years and scored this great solo goal against Spurs . The 21-year-old (right) takes a shot during a match for Queens Park Rangers against Brighton in March . Morrison holds off the challenge of Wayne Roony during a Premier League game for West Ham last December . Sir Alex Ferguson persuaded Allardyce to take a chance on Morrison during a PFA event ahead of his move to east London in January 2012, insisting West Ham would be signing potentially one of the best players of a generation if they could keep him focused. The Hammers knew at the time the move for Morrison would represent a major gamble, but because of his undoubted potential felt it was gamble worth taking. But it looks certain he has played his last game for West Ham.","Ravel Morrison has returned from his loan spell at Cardiff early .

"The family of a man killed in the 80s by two police detectives who were working as hit men for the mob is receiving a $5 million settlement nearly 30 years after his death. Nicholas Guido was showing off his new car outside his mother's home on Christmas Day 1986 when he was gunned down because he'd been mistaken for a mobster with the same name. The bad information, prosecutors said, came from two decorated police detectives who would later be convicted of moonlighting as hit men for the mob. Mob: Nicholas Guido was killed in the 80s by two police detectives who were working as hit men for the mob . Twenty-nine years later, the city has reached a $5 million settlement with Guido's family in part of the fallout from one of the most stunning police corruption cases in New York history. 'This tragic matter involves the murder of an innocent man. After evaluating all the facts, it was determined that settling the case was in the city's best interest,' the Law Department said in a statement. The family's lawyer didn't immediately return a call Friday night seeking comment. Guido's mother, Pauline Pipitone, was washing dishes after Christmas dinner when gunfire erupted outside her Brooklyn home. Gunned Down: Nicholas Guido was showing off his new car outside his mother's home on Christmas Day 1986 when he was gunned down because he'd been mistaken for a mobster with the same name . She ran over to the car and found her 26-year-old son sitting up at the wheel, she testified at the ex-detectives' 2006 racketeering trial. 'I went to touch his hand, and he must have just died,' she said. 'His fingertips were cold.' Guido's killers had him confused with an enemy of mob underboss Anthony Casso who paid then-detectives Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa to be his criminal 'crystal ball,' a source of help killing eight of their patron's foes between 1986 and about 1990, Brooklyn federal prosecutors said. The detectives were accused of carrying out two of those killings themselves. In others, they made traffic stops that ended with the driver killed; another time, they kidnapped a target and turned him over to the underboss, prosecutors said. Life: Former New York City police detectives Louis Eppolito (left) and Stephen Caracappa (right) were arrested in 2005 and are serving life sentences . Crystal Ball: The two detectives were on the payroll of mob underboss Anthony Casso (photographed) who paid them to be his criminal 'crystal ball' The detectives got $4,000 a month for inside information on law enforcement investigations, and they got $65,000 for carrying out one killing, prosecutors said. 'This is probably the most heinous series of crimes ever tried in this courthouse,' a judge said at one point. Eppolito and Caracappa, who insisted they were innocent, are serving life in prison. Caracappa helped establish the police department's office for Mafia homicide probes. Eppolito wrote an autobiography, 'Mafia Cop,' about his life as a police officer who grew up in a mob family. He also played a bit part in the classic 1990 mob movie 'GoodFellas.' By the time of their 2005 arrests, Eppolito and Caracappa had retired to Las Vegas. In 2010, New York City agreed to pay $9.9 million to an innocent man who spent 19 years behind bars after being framed by Eppolito, whose arrest prompted a re-examination of the man's case.","The family of Nicholas Guido is receiving a $5 million settlement nearly 30 years after the death of the 26-year-old .

She attempted to harness Father Divine's ideal of a 'Perfect Picture' that his congregation could achieve if they 'focus their lens', live peacefully, observe celibacy, give generously, and treat all races equally. 'If a follower is able to fully embody his truth, they would be in turn creating ""the Perfect Picture,""' she continued. 'In the photographs, I capture that in the small details of everyday life.

"She has been portrayed as a ‘royal benefits scrounger’, a holidaying princess who lives a life of idle luxury at the taxpayer’s expense. But last night Princess Beatrice took the unusual step of responding to the criticism, telling friends that she is about to accept one of several job offers following the end of her post at Sony Pictures. Prince Andrew’s eldest daughter is said to have been very upset to find herself accused of being workshy after quitting her £20,000-a-year job before taking three holidays in as many weeks. In fact, it seems that the Princess was an unexpected victim of the attacks on Sony’s security system, presumed to have been made by North Korea, in December. Scroll down for video . Unfair: Princess Beatrice has hit out at claims that she is 'workshy' after quitting her job at Sony . A friend of the Princess said last night that Sony bosses insisted she and other employees take time off. ‘Beatrice’s job was semi closed down by North Korea when her social security details were splashed all over the pages of American newspapers,’ he said. As a result of the hacking, she resigned. Beatrice, 26, has since been approached by headhunters, resulting in two job offers, one with a reputable technology company, and a further two interviews. Sony is also said to be attempting to persuade her to stay with them by offering to promote her above her current position. The friend said: ‘Beatrice has got another two interviews next week and she is not scared of hard work. She’s in her mid-20s and is trying to build up work experience with financial companies and start-ups. ‘She has done plenty of work experience, so she can forge a serious career with lots of skills.’ Last night, a friend of the family spoke out, telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is like going back to the Tudor times when some people attacked the Yorks, and we are not going to tolerate it.’ A close friend of the Duchess of York added: ‘The Duchess is incredibly protective of her daughters and may well make a robust statement defending them. ‘She will not accept unfair treatment of her girls. One of the reasons Princess Eugenie went to New York to work was to escape the intense spotlight in the UK media. ‘On top of her day job, Beatrice can also say she works for her grandmother, the Queen, and has on occasion attended charity events at Buckingham Palace in her lunch hour.’ Beatrice on holiday with pals in St Barts . A friend of Beatrice said: ‘How dare people attack her for not working hard when she does exactly that in her office for charities and for the Royal Family?’ Beatrice, 26, is said to be very passionate about the six charities of which she is a patron, including The Helen Arkell Dyslexia Centre and Big Change, a charity founded by her close friends Sam and Holly Branson. The Princess carried out ten Royal engagements last year while also working for Sony, and in November Beatrice and her mother attended a charity fundraiser at Lancaster House, held in aid of the Northwood African Education Foundation. Beatrice is patron of the charity and helped to raise £150,000 that night. As the sixth in line to the throne, Beatrice is constantly monitored by security guards, paid for by her father. She receives no public funds for her accommodation or lifestyle. Last month, she and boyfriend Dave Clark, 32, took a trip to the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents own a £13 million chalet, and visited the Caribbean island of St Barts twice. But the new claims suggest she took the trips in the expectation that February would bring a more important job with a healthier wage. Buckingham Palace has insisted that the Princess’s travel is always ‘entirely privately funded’ often with help from her parents and sometimes Mr Clark, who earns a six-figure salary at Virgin Galactic. Catherine Mayer, wrote the new Prince Charles book . Charles Crushes biographer's claim: Palace says writer had NO special access to the Prince . by Robert Jobson, Royal Commentator . The office of Prince Charles has distanced itself from claims that a controversial new book was written with its co-operation. American Catherine Mayer says she met the Prince and spoke to his closest aides while researching Charles: The Heart Of A King. A journalist with Time magazine, Ms Mayer paints a picture of Clarence House torn apart by turf wars and describes the future King grappling with insecurities and struggling to control his courtiers and their infighting. But Kristina Kyriacou, Prince Charles’s head of communications, said yesterday that the publishers had overplayed suggestions of official co-operation. She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is not an official book. The author did not have the access as claimed. Clarence House has no further comment.’ Royal sources said Ms Mayer did attend a dinner with the Prince, but was one of 75 guests and had no access to the top table. Like other journalists, she joined the Royal rota to cover Prince Charles at work. To suggest there was intimate access is overblown. Ms Mayer’s biography is one of three forthcoming books claiming to offer new detail about Charles, including one by American Sally Bedell Smith, who has written biographies on the Queen and Princess Diana. One source said there seemed to be a ‘race’ between the two women to publish first. ‘Perhaps that is why Catherine Mayer is claiming to have had more access than she did. Both books are unofficial,’ he said. Tony Blair’s former spin-doctor Alastair Campbell is also bringing out a book which claims to have new information about Charles. Publishers say Ms Mayer’s book reveals ‘a man in sight of happiness yet still driven by anguish’ with ‘views that mean he will never be as impartial as his mother’. Ms Mayer’s book – extracts of which were published on Kindle and in The Times yesterday – suggests Clarence House is riddled with ‘glaring systemic weaknesses’. She also writes that any criticism of the Prince, who is known to courtiers as ‘the Boss’, can send him spiralling into ‘despair’, while turf battles between Charles’s staff ‘are common and bloody’. ‘One former householder refers to Clarence House as Wolf Hall,’ she says. According to Ms Mayer, much difficulty is caused by Charles’s inability to create clear roles for his staff. He is accused of causing turf wars by failing to set courtiers clear boundaries. But close sources dismiss these claims. ‘Anyone who visits Clarence House always say what a happy ship it is. The staff don’t recognise Mayer’s claims. ‘It is convenient, isn’t it, that the television adaptation of Wolf Hall is doing well now as the book comes out.’ Distance: Charles with PR Chief Kristina Kyriacou, who says new book by Catherine Mayer, left, is not official . Despite his current PR headaches, Charles is continuing to trust press team leader Kristina Kyriacou with nurturing his public image. Kyriacou, 48, has recently signed a new contract and a source said: ‘The Prince is delighted. She is the bedrock of his communications team.’","Princess Beatrice was said to be upset after being branded 'workshy'

"When Amjad Bashir sensationally defected to the Conservatives last week, Ukip leader Nigel Farage claimed his party had been 'begging' him to drop the MEP after being 'increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months'. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal the party was warned about his links with a convicted criminal a year ago – months before he was elected to the European Parliament. Local activists urged Ukip chairman Steve Crowther to investigate claims Mr Bashir 'was joined at the hip' to Mujeeb Bhutto - a former Ukip spokesman who was forced to resign from the party when it emerged he had masterminded a £56,000 kidnapping plot in Pakistan. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Ukip knew about Amjad Bashir's (left) links to alleged kidnapper Mujeeb Bhutto (right) before the Tory defector became an MEP . 'Joined at the hip': Local activists wanted Ukip to investigate Amjad Bashir (second from right) because of his links to Mujeeb Bhutto, who was forced to resign from Ukip when it emerged he had masterminded a £56,000 kidnapping plot in Pakistan . Party spin Mr Bashir's defection to the Conservatives last week triggered an immediate damage limitation exercise by Ukip . Leaked emails, seen by The Mail on Sunday, show that Mr Crowther was warned last February that the pair had possibly broken party rules by not admitting Bhutto's criminal past, and even questioned if they were 'Conservative plants'. Despite this, the party selected Mr Bashir as a candidate and he was elected MEP in May. Mr Bashir's defection to the Conservatives last week triggered an immediate damage limitation exercise by Ukip, which announced Mr Bashir had been suspended pending an investigation into 'extremely serious' allegations. These included questions over his 'continued affiliation with Mujeeb Bhutto, despite the party's protests against Mr Bhutto's involvement with Mr Bashir or Ukip', as well as his 'finances' and his alleged interference in a candidate selection processes. Mr Farage even said that MEPs in his party had been 'begging me to get rid of Bashir in October and November of last year' and were 'increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months'. Mr Bashir dismissed Ukip's response as a 'desperate attempt' to smear him and insists there is 'not a shred of truth' to the claims. Allegations: Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) claimed his party had been 'begging' him to drop Amjad Bashir (left) after being 'increasingly alarmed by his behaviour over the last few months' Distanced: Upon Mr Bashir's (pictured) defection to the Tories, Ukip announced he had been suspended pending an investigation into 'extremely serious' allegations . But last night, former Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom said the leaked emails revealed the party hierarchy knew there were questions over his conduct well before Mr Bashir was appointed as Ukip candidate for the European Parliament. He added Mr Crowther should resign as he had been 'dishonest' in his appointment.Mr Bloom said: 'I am making no criticism of Ukip or Nigel Farage. This is about one man's dishonesty. I believe Crowther should resign.' On February 6, 2014, worried party members wrote to Mr Crowther after Bhutto was unmasked as the boss of a gang who kidnapped a Pakistani businessman's son in Karachi in 2004. Bhutto was later convicted in the UK. The email to Mr Crowther said: 'These two have been joined at the hip from the day they joined the party. Bhutto refers to Amjad as uncle… Amjad must have known Bhutto's past and his convictions.' It adds: 'Why did Amjad not disclose the truth, especially as a senior party member? He must have known.' Finally it questioned whether the pair were 'Conservative plants', after it was revealed Mr Bhutto was formerly a Tory Party member. Mr Crowther apparently investigated some claims and responded to activists on March 2 saying: 'As I understand it, Mujeeb Bhutto is not related to Amjad Bashir, but has been involved with him in a business context. Mr Bashir tells me he did not know of Mujeeb's conviction before I raised it with him. At that point, Mr Bhutto confirmed the facts to him and immediately resigned from the party.' But Mr Bloom said Mr Crowther's email showed he was 'trying to sweep the issue under the carpet'. He said: 'Crowther knew this man's criminal associations in February.' Last night, Mr Crowther had no comment to make.","Ukip leader Nigel Farage claims his party 'begged' him to drop Amjad Bashir .

"Britain will be gripped by an 'arctic airmass' as freezing snow blizzards of up to 70mph are set to bring further travel chaos. The Met Office has issued yellow warnings - urging the public to be aware - for ice across the entire country and snow across the Midlands, northern England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes after 'thundersnow' storms battered large parts of northern Britain on Thursday, with up to 9in of snow falling in some parts of the UK. Scroll down for video . More snow to come: An Arctic blast will sweep across Britain this weekend bringing more extreme weather. Pictured, Curbar, Derbyshire today . With temperatures remaining low overnight, forecasters have warned that ice is likely to form on road surfaces and more snow is expected on high ground, especially across Scotland. But much of the UK will be affected by the conditions, with several crashes already reported today, including a seven-car pile-up in Cornwall. The Met Office have said on Sunday and Monday temperatures will drop well below freezing and will feel like -6C in parts of Scotland due to the northerly winds. Strong winds of up to 70mph are predicted in north-west Scotland, meaning blizzard conditions are likely, experts say.

Job commitment: A postman makes his morning rounds in Surrey today where a layer of snow has settled on the ground . MeteoGroup forecaster Chris Hogan said 'heavy snow showers' were forecast in higher areas as a band of cold weather moved south across England. London could also see a 'dusting' of snow, although sleet and rain were more likely, he added. The Met Office's chief forecaster Eddie Carroll said: 'Road surface temperatures will fall widely below freezing, leading to a risk of ice on untreated surfaces. 'This will be exacerbated by showers in places, more especially across Scotland, where 2-5cm of fresh snowfall may accumulate above 150m, with up to 10cm settling above 300m. 'Further south, a mixture of rain, sleet and wet snow is likely, with most of any settling snow taking place above about 200m. However, wet roads at low levels will contribute to the risk of ice formation.' The Met Office said sleet and snow showers would affect parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, with snow falling to lower levels and extending further south through the day. Longer spells of sleet and snow are also possible, especially across the high ground of Scotland and north-east England.

Mr Carroll added: 'A very cold airmass will spread southwards across Scotland and Northern Ireland accompanied by strong winds, spreading southwards into northern England and north Wales later in the day. 'Frequent showers are likely to form in this airmass, and with the cold air snow is likely to accumulate, even to low levels in places. 'Periods of enhanced snowfall are possible within this general flow, perhaps more especially across the high ground of Scotland and north-east England, but these details are more uncertain. 'There is the potential for disruption throughout this period due to the accumulating snow and ice but also with temporary blizzard conditions leading to very difficult driving conditions.'

A car and lorry crash on the M6, near Cheshire, also caused problems earlier - closing all but one lane southbound. This afternoon there was an accident on the M8 near Glasgow and a three-car smash on the M20 near Kent. Manchester Airport, which was forced to close both of its runways for several hours on Thursday, said a total of 36 flights inbound or outbound had been cancelled yesterday. It said on its website: 'We are fully open today, but as things get back to normal and aircraft get back to where they should be, passengers are advised to check with their airline for specific flight queries as some may be subject to delays.' Yesterday, commuters across the UK faced nightmare delays after accidents and treacherous conditions on motorways resulted in multiple lane closures, leaving thousands of people stuck in traffic as they made their way to work. The M4 was facing delays early this morning after a multiple car pile-up late last night. Queues stretched along the motorway after the smash at junction 15 near Swindon, Wilts, as sleet and rain which had fallen during the day turned to black ice. Several people needed treatment but nobody was killed in the accident which involved at least five vehicles near the junction with the A346.

"A man has been arrested after he allegedly lit his girlfriend's cat on fire and beheaded it with scissors to 'prove a point' before biting off part of the woman's ear during an argument. Michael Trudeau from Chaska, Minnesota, has also been accused of trying to shove an umbrella down the 42-year-old victim's throat while threatening to kill her. The 51-year-old was arrested last Sunday after the woman managed to escape and call 911. Officers arrived and saw her in the building's lobby shaken and covered in blood. Shocking: Michael Trudeau, 51 from Chaska, Minnesota, has been charged with many felonies after he allegedly bit part of his girlfriend's ear off and shoved an umbrealla down her throat after burning and decapitating her cat . The first responders then found Trudeau 'agitated and angry' and looking for a weapon. They then tased him after he 'refused to obey comments' and asked to be shot. The alleged victim told authorities Trudeau had traveled to her apartment after drinking vodka throughout the day. According to Fox 9 they began arguing about their relationship. She claims it escalated to the point where Trudeau put was in a headlock. He is believed to have choked her until she passed out before trying to push the umbrella into her mouth. She managed to get away and bit his finger in self-defense, but he responded by biting off part of her ear. Violence: The 42-year-old alleged victim said the terrifying incident unfolded after Tridueau visited the Cedar Creek Apartments after a day of drinking. They got in a row and then he threatened to kill her . Later, the woman told officers that three weeks earlier, Trudeau lit her cat on fire in the middle of her living room to prove a point. When the flames were extinguished, he then choked it to death before decapitating it. 'When the cat was extinguished, [Trudeau] choked the cat with both hands until it died,' the complaint says. 'After the cat was dead, the defendant went into the kitchen and used a pair of kitchen scissors to dismember the cat by cutting its head off of its body.' Trudeau has been charged with first-degree assault, terroristic threats and mistreatment of animals. He remains in custody and won't be released unless he puts up $1 million cash or a $10 million bond. Trudeau's criminal record contains a 2006 conviction for animal cruelty and a prior for domestic assault by strangulation.","Michael Trudeau, 51, from Chaska, Minnesota, is facing multiple charges .

"There were echoes of Harald Schumacher's infamous pole-axing of Patrick Battiston as Manuel Neuer clattered in to Gonzalo Higuain in Sunday night's World Cup final. True, the giant German goalkeeper got the ball as he came out to punch clear early in the second half, but as his flying floored the Argentina strike, thoughts immediately turned to the 1982 World Cup semi-final. Then-Germany keeper Schumacher was nowhere near the ball when he took Battiston out, with the referee somehow not awarding a free-kick after the ball had trickled wide.

Painful memories: Another German goalkeeper, Harald Schumacher, pole-axed Patrick Battiston in 1982 . Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli came up with a baffling decision early in the second half when Manuel Neuer clashed with Gonzalo Higuain. The Germany goalkeeper had every right to go for the ball with his fist, made a clean connection and his follow-through was natural. He inadvertently cleaned out Higuain but there was no case for a penalty. For some observers it may have brought back memories of West German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher’s awful challenge on Patrick Battiston of France in a 1982 semi-final (above). But it was nothing like it for dangerous play. However, why Rizzoli decided to award Germany a free-kick was a mystery. A throw-in to Argentina would have been the right choice.

"David Cameron last night made an appeal to Syria's military and security leaders in an extraordinary attempt to spark a coup against Bashar al-Assad. The Prime Minister said the future of the country's army and security forces would be guaranteed were Assad's regime to fall. He persuaded his G8 counterparts – including Russia, which has long supported the Assad regime – to sign up to a declaration that Syria needs a 'transitional government' that can command the 'mutual consent' of its people. Prime Minister David Cameron (fourth from left) arrives for a group photo with the leaders at the G8 Summit, at Lough Erne, near Enniskillen, in Northern Ireland . Outlining a future for the country, a statement said 'public services must be preserved or restored'. 'This includes the military forces and security services,' it added. Diplomats confirmed this was a direct message to the leaders of Assad's military and security forces that they would not be swept aside if he is removed. Western leaders hope elements of the Syrian regime who are losing patience with their president may be persuaded to move against him if they believe their future is secured. Russian president Vladimir Putin, however, refused to agree to an explicit demand that Assad should go, and claimed that arming the Syrian opposition could deliver weapons into the hands of the sort of people who slaughtered Drummer Lee Rigby on the streets of London. Mr Putin also defended Russia's supply of arms to the Assad regime, saying it was fulfilling 'legal contracts' made with the 'legal government of Syria'. In a reference to the 'brutal killing' of Drummer Rigby in Woolwich last month, the Russian president added: 'Clearly the [Syrian] opposition is not composed all of this but many of them are exactly the same as the ones who perpetrated the killing in London. Leaders of the G8 meet during a round table session at the summit in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland . Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks as Prime Minister David Cameron holds a meeting with G8 leaders . From left, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, British Prime Minister David Cameron, U.S. President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso . 'If we equip these people, if we arm them what is going to control and verify who is going to have these weapons, including in Europe as well. 'So we call all our partners, before making this dangerous step, think about it very carefully.' Mr Putin firmly rejected suggestions that the Syrian talks had pitched him against the other G8 nations over his continued support for the regime. Meanwhile, Mr Cameron, who chaired the G8 summit on Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, backed further away from the prospect of Britain supplying arms to rebel groups. The Prime Minister has been warned by senior colleagues that he would be unlikely to win a vote on such a move in the Commons. Syrian army soldiers take control of the village of Western Dumayna, some five miles north of the rebel-held city of Qusayr . 'Nobody wants to see more conflict, nobody wants to see more arms, nobody wants to see more death,' Mr Cameron said. Instead, he made an appeal to those around Assad who know 'in their hearts' that he can never again lead a stable country, following two years of conflict and at least 93,000 deaths. 'Clearly in Syria there are all sorts of people who desperately want Assad to go. There are those in the official opposition who have put their lives on the line to achieve that,' Mr Cameron said. 'But I suspect there are also many, many others who may have supported him in the past but who know after all that has been done, after all the horrors committed, after the use of chemical weapons, that it is literally unthinkable that someone like this would be able to run a unified and stable Syria into the future.' It is hoped a transitional governing body will be agreed at a peace conference in Geneva, which the G8 wants to see happen in August or September. Yesterday's summit also agreed to call for all parties to the conflict to allow access to a UN team investigating the use of chemical weapons. The U.S., the UK and their allies are convinced Assad has ordered chemical weapons attacks on his own people and say tests have now confirmed them beyond doubt. But Russia still disputes the evidence. The summit also agreed to almost $1.5billion in aid to assist the millions displaced by the conflict. Mr Cameron agreed the largest single funding commitment ever made by the UK in response to a humanitarian disaster, as he announced a £175million emergency package for the Syrian crisis, taking UK funding for Syria to date to £348million.","Declaration signed that says Syria needs a 'transitional government'

Three other people, including the Garcias' teenage passengers and the driver of the other vehicle, were injured in the crash and required hospitalization, reported KTLA. The collision took place about three blocks from Banning High School, which both the Garcia siblings attended. According to investigators, surveillance video taken from a nearby business showed the Garcias’ red sedan speeding in the wrong direction and possibly racing a dark-colored truck also going against traffic. Police say Elexis was the one driving. Her brother was sitting in the front passenger seat and their two friends from Banning High School were riding in the back. Heartbroken friends and family of the Garcia siblings have been flocking to the site of the accident, leaving flowers, candles and money for their funeral.

According to surveillance video and witness accounts, Elexis and Elias’ mother rushed to the scene of the accident and was heard wailing in grief. A police officer was seen holding her back from her children's mangled car, which responding officers covered with a tarp while waiting for the coroner to arrive and remove the teenagers' bodies. Elexis Garcia, known to her friends as Lexi, was a senior while her brother was a sophomore. By all accounts, the two siblings were inseparable, even jokingly calling themselves twins, reported The Daily Breeze. Those who knew Elias described him as the most popular boy in school, known for his fashionable hip hop-inspired clothes and his bold nickname, ‘The King.’ ‘He was the center of attention at all parties,’ said Christopher Ortega, a former Banning student. ‘Everybody liked him.’ Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represents Wilmington, started a fund to help the Garcias’ family with the teens’ final expenses.

"Grant Shapps said migrants' desire to work hard to provide for their families should encourage them to vote Conservative in May . Immigrants to Britain are natural Conservatives who are finding the party more and more attractive, Grant Shapps has claimed. The Tory party chairman said the Conservative message of working hard and getting on appeals to voters who have come to settle in Britain and often ‘work every hour’ to provide for their family. Mr Shapps was responding to Manchester University research, reported in yesterday’s Daily Mail, showing two London seats – Brent North and East Ham – which will be contested at the general election contain a majority of voters born overseas. Many other constituencies contain large minorities. A record four million migrants born abroad will be entitled to vote in May, half a million more than at the last election. Cabinet Office minister Mr Shapps said he did not believe the trend posed a threat to his party’s chances in the election. Mr Shapps, whose father’s Jewish family emigrated from Poland in the late 19th century, said: ‘I see the Conservative party becoming more and more attractive to people from all different backgrounds, particularly because so many of the immigrant communities are people who work hard and get on in life... so I think they are naturally Conservative.’ The Manchester University research has led to speculation that the biggest losers could be the Tories, who have been accused of pursuing anti-immigrant rhetoric in response to the Ukip threat. Mr Shapps conceded that the election would be ‘incredibly close’, but insisted that David Cameron would not go into a coalition with Ukip if he fails to win a majority in May.

"A man who had sex with a performing dolphin at an amusement park in the 1970s has claimed the encounter took place because the animal seduced him. Malcolm Brenner, 63, claims that he fell for Dolly, a bottlenose dolphin who lived at the now-defunct Floridaland theme park in Sarasota, after her amorous advances. Brenner told the story of their year-long affair relationship again in Dolphin Love, a new film which premiered last week at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Slamdance, which takes place at the same time as the more famous Sundance film festival, is seen as its edgier alternative and hosts more niche films. Scroll down for video . Dolphin Lover: Malcolm Brenner, (left in 2014 and right in 1971 with Dolly) has admitted pursuing a sexual relationship with a bottlenose dolphin in 1970s Florida . 'I started rubbing her': In new film, Dolphin Lover, which premiered this week, Brenner discusses his taboo relationship . Sneaking off: Brenner has previously described how he was trusted to be alone with the dolphins, and waited until after nightfall to have sex with Dolly . In the fifteen-minute video, Brenner tells the cameras: 'I started rubbing her along her back, working my way to her flukes – her tail. 'And as I was rubbing her and moving my hand towards her tail, Dolly was slowly rolling around her long axis.' According to Fusion, Brenner went on to describe the sex in even more detail, while an 'animated interpretation' of the encounter was played. In previous interviews about this encounter, which he also turned into a novel called Wet Goddess, Brenner has claimed the relationship was consensual. The relationship reportedly lasted a year. Last year he told Britain's Daily Mirror: 'There's something quite transcendental about making love with a dolphin. 'The dolphin is very aware, the dolphin is an intelligent and creative creature and making love is a consummate act.' He added that their courtship began when Dolly 'announced her intentions to me by positioning herself so I was rubbing against her.' He then detailed how he was often left alone with Dolly and the other dolphins, whom he was photographing at the time. This allowed him to sneak off with her after closing time to have sex. In another interview, Brenner said: 'It's like being with a tiger or a bear. This is an animal that could kill you in two seconds if it wanted to.' According to Brenner's blog, the screening of the film was 'well-received' by its initial audience, and nobody walked out. In a personal verdict on the film, he describes the sex animation as 'beautiful'. He also says it is 'oddly accurate, without being graphic or vulgar.' Performer: Dolly, pictured above during a show, lived at the Flordialand theme park in Sarasota . Defunct: The park no longer exists, but used to offer sealife shows, as well as steamboat trips such as the one shown above . He also reveals that some animators turned down the project once they discovered the controversial content of the film. Brenner's acts would be illegal today. But Florida only enacted a law banning bestiality in 2011, so the encounter he described in 1971 would not be covered. Filmmakers Kareem Tabsch and Joey Daoud have defended their film's content, say that Brenner's experience is 'unique' and an 'appealing' subject for a documentary. They told the Miami New Times: 'However uncomfortable it can be as a subject matter, what Malcolm experienced is unique and very real and very serious to him. 'He is a member of a community (zoophiles) who live on the outermost fringes of society. 'Their reality is something most of us can not comprehend, relate to or know much about- all of that makes it all the more appealing to me as a subject to tackle.' While Brenner's experience is undoubtedly out of the ordinary, there are other recorded incidents of dolphins having sex with humans - or at least trying to. One well-documented case involves a female scientist who started having sex with a dolphin in the 1960s as part of a Nasa experiment to try to teach the creatures to speak English. Margaret Howe Lovatt was stationed in a flooded house in the U.S. Virgin Isles in 1963, where she was tasked with trying to teach an adolescent dolphin called Peter. 'Precious and gentle': Margaret Howe Lovatt, who had sex with a dolphin called Peter, above, in 1963, has also opened up about her relationship . At first she let Peter relieve his urges with female dolphins kept nearby - but later claimed it helped the experiment to let him have sex with her, instead. In a BBC film about the relationship, she said: 'Peter liked to be... with me. He would rub himself on my knee, my foot or my hand and I allowed that. 'I wasn't uncomfortable - as long as it wasn't too rough... It was just easier to incorporate that and let it happen, it was very precious and very gentle, Peter was right there, he knew that I was right there.' 'It was sexual on his part - it was not sexual on mine, sensuous perhaps... I was there to get to know Peter, that was part of Peter.' Dolphins also often target their advances on humans who have no interest in reciprocating. Several tourists at dolphin swimming events have been leaped on and mounted by aroused dolphins, often to the amusement of onlookers, whose videos of the events have gained significant attention. However, the dangers of an advance can in some situations be very real, given the strength and size of dolphins, who often weigh more than 400lbs. In 2002, swimmers on the English coast were warned of a dolphin which tried to attack a series of female swimmers in the sea by encircling them and isolating them from their companions.","Malcolm Brenner, 63, pursued relationship with bottlenose Dolly in 1971 .

"Hundreds of thousands of people marched through Madrid today in a show of strength by a fledgling radical leftist party, as it becomes the latest European political organisation to gain widespread support for its anti-austerity stance. Podemos ('We Can') supporters from across Spain converged around the Cibeles fountain today before packing the avenue leading to Puerta del Sol square in what was the party's largest rally to date, as it hopes to emulate the success of Greece's Syriza party in the Spanish general election later this year. Podemos aims to shatter the country's predominantly two-party system and the 'March for Change' gathered crowds in the same place where sit-in protests against political and financial corruption laid the party's foundations in 2011. Scroll down for video . Podemos supporters gather at Puerta del Sol square today to 'March for Change' and protest against political and financial corruption . A man wearing the colours of the fledgling radical party Podemos shakes his fist during the party's largest show of strength to date . The party's rise is largely due to the charisma of its pony-tailed leader Pablo Iglesias, a 36-year-old political science professor. Pictured are supporters rallying in Madrid . State broadcaster TVE said that hundreds of thousands were at the march, but no official attendance figures were provided. The party's rise is greatly due to the charisma of its pony-tailed leader, Pablo Iglesias, a 36-year-old political science professor. Hailing from the Madrid working class neighborhood of Vallecas, Iglesias prefers jeans and rolled up shirt sleeves to a suit and tie and champions slogans such as Spain is 'run by the butlers of the rich' and that the economy must serve the people. 'We want change,' Iglesias told the crowd. 'This is the year for change and we're going to win the elections.' Speaking at a meeting in Barcelona, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he didn't accept the bleak picture of Spain that Podemos propagated. 'They're a sad bunch, who go around saying how badly things are going,' he said, giving them no chance of winning the elections. 'They're not going to do it.' Senior Podemos member Rita Maestre said that their aim was to show that the party is the instrument for change. 'We called the demonstration in the hope of lighting the torch (flame).' In roughly a year, Podemos has leap-frogged from being the dream of a handful of university professors and activists to a political party. A supporter shouts slogans during the rally - attended by hundreds of thousands - in downtown Madrid today . An activist holds a sign reading 'hello troika' as Podemos builds on its early success and aims to replicate the support of Greece's Syriza party . Podemos supporters claim the traditional political class has lost all credibility. Pictured is an activist chanting during the party's rally in Madrid . Opinion polls show the party could possibly take the number one spot in upcoming elections and thus trigger one of the biggest political shake-ups in Spain since democracy was restored in 1978 after decades of dictatorship. 'The two-party framework has suffered a change. It now really does seem like a third political force can achieve government, so yes, I think it can have a great impact,' said literature student Alicia Sanchez, 20. This year, Spain holds elections in 15 of its 17 regions followed by general elections. Podemos' first battle will be in the southern Socialist heartland of Andalusia in March, followed by regional and municipal elections in the crucial ruling Popular Party stronghold of Madrid in May. 'The political class has lost all credibility,' said unemployed lathe worker Marcos Pineda, 54. 'The PP that governs today had its former treasurer in jail for corruption and the banks were bailed out with 40 billion euros ($52 billion) of European money, but the government refused to call it a bailout.' The leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias (left), smiles and waves during the massive rally - held for a party established only a year ago . People wave Republican and Podemos party flags during the rally as they marched through the streets of Madrid, Spain . The protest swamped Puerta del Sol Square today where sit-in protests in 2011 first laid the party's foundations . Podemos has often expressed its support for some of the policies of left-wing governments in Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador, which makes many Spanish mainstream politicians bristle. In Europe, it openly supports Syriza, which won national elections in Greece on January 25 and which has pledged to challenge the austerity measures imposed on the country by the European Union and International Monetary Fund. While there are major political and economic differences between Spain and Greece, both countries have suffered severe economic crises, massive unemployment and austerity measures while simultaneously having to put up with myriad political corruption scandals. This combination has given rise to a nationwide anti-establishment movement that has boosted Podemos and Syriza immensely. A poll published earlier this month showed that Podemos was again in the lead to win Spain's next general election, which could result in the formation of party pacts, or even the country's first coalition government. The Metroscopia poll of 1000 people, published in the left-leaning newspaper El Pais, showed one-year-old Podemos would take 28.2 percent of the vote, up from 25 percent in December when it fell back to second place behind the Socialists. Podemos stood at 10.7 percent of the vote when it was first included last August. Spain has a general election due by the end of the year and a regional and municipal election expected in May. Most of those who told Metroscopia they would vote for Podemos said they believed Spain needed to get rid of its two-party system.","The streets of Madrid were today filled with activists supporting Spain's fledgling anti-establishment party Podemos .

"Jailed: Lauren Ashford, 29, turned up at the couple's doorstep claiming her six-year-old had climbed out of his bedroom window . A former heroin addict tried to steal a purse from the home of two pensioners after duping them into believing she was searching for her missing autistic son. Lauren Ashford, 29, turned up at the couple's doorstep claiming her six-year-old had climbed out of his bedroom window and she needed to search their garden for him, Cardiff Crown Court heard. But in reality, two of her children had been taken from her and put into care. It is said she was upset on the day she committed the offence because it was one of their birthdays and she was not allowed to contact them. She had taken a large amount of Valium and drunk alcohol, the court heard. On January 7, Ashford told the pensioners her name was Louise and begged to search their back garden. Prosecutor Rebecca Griffiths told Cardiff Crown Court yesterday: 'She said her son suffered autism and had climbed out of his bedroom window and disappeared. 'Because this was a terraced house in the Adamsdown district, Cardiff, she had to go through to get to the garden and the couple helped her.' Ms Griffiths said the couple called out the name she gave them over the fence and when they couldn't find him, made her a cup of tea. The court heard she asked for a cigarette, said she felt sick and  would like another cup of tea. It was when the couple got back to the living room with the second cup that they found she had moved seats and was now sitting on a chair where a shoulder bag had been hanging, the court heard. 'She was actually sitting on the bag and the purse from inside had been taken out,' Ms Griffiths said. Ashford was asked to leave and was arrested the next day, on January 8, at the YMCA in Roath where she had been living since her release from jail for an identical diversion burglary in 2013. She admitted the burglary and asked the court to take into account an attempted burglary committed 30 minutes earlier when she went to a house a few doors down from the couple's home with the same story. Justice: Ashford was jailed for two years and eight months when she appeared at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured) yesterday . A woman there said Ashford was pretending to be upset but she could see it was 'just an act'. In mitigation it was said Ashford, a former heroin addict who had relapsed, was upset that day because it was the birthday of one of her two children who had been taken from her and put into care. She wasn't allowed to contact them and took large quantities of alcohol and Valium. Jailing her for two years and eight months, Judge Neil Bidder QC said committing more offences on top of the 32 already on her record wasn't the way to see her children again. He said: 'This was premeditated and you clearly targeted people who were aged 65 and 70 and were vulnerable. 'You took advantage of their charitable and trusting nature with an utterly false but a heart-jerking account of a missing six-year-old. 'It was an unpleasant experience and had badly affected them. They may never feel secure in their home again'. In a victim impact statement, the woman said she could not believe anyone could be so callous as to concoct such a story. 'My faith in people has gone,' she said.","Lauren Ashford, 29, claimed her son had climbed out of bedroom window .

"Top secret papers used to break the Enigma Code were discovered at Bletchley Park - because they were used as draught excluders. The papers include the only known examples of 'Banbury sheets' which were devised by Alan Turing to speed up the process of decrypting Nazi messages. They were found in Hut 6 of Britain's main codebreaking centre, codenamed Station X, in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in September 2013 by builders who were renovating the unit. They are the only examples of Banbury sheets ever to be discovered. Scroll down for video . The documents, pictured above, were discovered screwed up between the roof beams of Hut 6 at Bletchley . All paper evidence from the codebreaking centre was supposed to be destroyed for security reasons, but some paperwork survived after it was placed into holes in the walls and ceilings to protect codebreakers from the cold. During the war, Hut 6 had poor heating, no toilets and nothing in terms of insulation. Betty Webb, from Wythall in Worcestershire, who is now in her 90s, was a member of the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). She worked on German police messages in the mansion at Bletchley Park, which revealed the beginning of the Holocaust with the massacres of thousands of Jews on the eastern front. 'The huts we slept in were thrown up in a great hurry and had thin walls so in the winter one's flannel would be frozen by the morning. 'They were very, very basic conditions, but we were young, we didn't mind,' she said. Top-secret papers used to break the Enigma Code were used as draught excluders by cold codebreakers at Bletchley Park. They were devised by Alan Turing, left, and portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch, right . Amongst the documents found in the roof of Hut 6 were notes made by Turing's team of codebreakers (left) and a banbury sheet (right) devised by Alan Turing as part of the efforts to crack the Nazi Enigma code . The Imitation Game, which also stars Keira Knightley, left, is based on Hodges' book Alan Turing: The Enigma . Bletchley Park's codebreakers provided vital intelligence which helped win the Battle of the Atlantic. Their contribution to the war effort is told in The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing. Turing was praised by Winston Churchill as having made 'the single biggest contribution' to the Allied victory. The British mathematician and pioneer in computer science hastened the end of the Second World War by cracking Germany's wartime communications code. Notes made by the Bletchley codebreakers during the Second World War (pictured above) were found along with parts of an Atlas, a pinboard and a fashion article from a magazine in the space between the roof beams . He devised the process of 'Banburismus' in 1940 in order to glean information about the likely daily setting of the Enigma machine used by the Germans to encrypt messages. It involved aligning two Banbury sheets and placing them over a light. If two holes corresponded, then the light would shine through and using this, likely settings could be deduced. Bletchley Park has now undergone an £8million renovation to restore the codebreaking centre. The papers found in Hut 6 have been frozen to prevent decay and will go on display there next month. Ian Standen, chief executive of the Bletchley Park Trust, told The Times: 'Discovering these pieces of code-breaking ephemera is incredibly exciting and provides yet more insight into how the codebreakers actually worked. 'The fact that these papers were used to block draughty holes in the primitive hut walls reminds us of the rudimentary conditions under which these extraordinary people were working.' The work carried out in the mansion at Bletchley was kept secret for decades and many of the women who worked there thought they would take their experiences to the grave . In the early 1940s, Britain was losing the Battle of the Atlantic and was on the verge of being invaded by Germany. Geniuses were needed to crack the highly cryptic code Germans used to communicate with their U-boat submarines. Turing's top-secret work with cryptologists at Britain's main decryption centre at Bletchley Park saved countless lives by breaking Germany's Enigma machine code. The codebreakers were bound by the official secrets act and forbidden to utter a word of their mission. And Turing was praised by Winston Churchill as having made 'the single biggest contribution' to the Allied victory. But the computer pioneer received no credit and as a gay man in an era when homosexuality was illegal, was convicted of gross indecency in 1952. He committed suicide two years later. He was only pardoned for charges of homosexuality 60 years after his death in 1954. The story of Turing and the codebreakers is told in The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. It has been nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Cumberbatch's performance. Betty, today, left and right during the war, said she struggled to find a job after Bletchley because she wasn't able to tell anyone what she had been doing in the Forties . A handwritten notebook by mathematician Alan Turing is expected to fetch $1million at auction in April .","The discovery includes the only known examples of 'Banbury sheets'

"Thousands of Shiite Muslims took to the streets of Pakistan to protest against the deaths of 61 worshippers, who were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a mosque during Friday prayers. The sectarian attack - the worst to hit the country in almost two years - took place at a mosque in the Shikarpur district of southern Sindh province, about 300 miles north of Pakistan's biggest city Karachi. Thousands attended funeral prayers for the dead on Saturday, which had been designated a day of mourning by the provincial government, while others protested against the bombings.

Distraught: A day of mourning was declared by the government in southern Sindh province, closing businesses across the area . Shocking: The attack at the mosque in the Shikarpur district was the most violent in Pakistan since March 2013 . Local television broadcast footage of huge crowds of mostly Shiite Muslims, carrying black flags and beating their chests as they offered their prayers, one after another. Karachi, Pakistan's economic heart and Sindh's provincial capital, also shut down for the day, with hundreds of Shiites staging protest rallies. Police said unidentified 'miscreants' had set fire to a passenger bus and a truck in the city early in the day, but no one was hurt. Police on Saturday said the devastating explosion was a suicide attack, and the bomber detonated the explosives strapped to his body 'in the middle of the mosque'.

Khitab said the bomb was loaded with steel pellets, ball bearings and other shrapnel to cause maximum damage. Protests: Thousands attended the funerals, with more people taking to the streets to protest against sectarian attacks like this one . Grief: Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday the whole nation was in mourning after Friday's bombing . Funerals: As people prayed for the dead, Prime Minister Sharif vowed the attack would strengthen the government's resolve to stop terrorism . Rising: There has been an increase in sectarian violence over the past couple of years in Pakistan . Hardline: Most of the violence has been perpetrated by hardline Sunni Muslim groups against the minority Sunnis . Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the whole nation was in mourning after the bombing, but vowed that it would strengthen the government's resolve to stop terrorism. Pakistan 'will win the war against terrorism at any cost', he told a crowd of almost 1,000 counter-terrorism officers in eastern Lahore city. Pakistan has suffered a rising tide of sectarian violence in recent years, most of it perpetrated by hardline Sunni Muslim groups against minority Shiites, who make up around 20 per cent of the population. Friday's bombing was the bloodiest single sectarian attack in Pakistan since March 2013, when a car bomb in a Shiite neighbourhood of Karachi killed 45. A spokesman for the shadowy Jandullah militant group, a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, said they were behind the latest blast. Injured: Relatives help an injured blast victim at a hospital following Friday's bomb explosion at the mosque . Abandoned: Shoes, left at the entrance by worshippers, were left behind after the blast tore through the mosque . Horrific: Hundreds of people had been attending Friday prayers at the mosque when the suicide bomber detonated his explosives . Prayers: As the community mourned its loss, the Jandullah militant group claimed responsibility for the bombing . Planned: The suicide bomber had apparently chosen his spot in the mosque carefully, so it would have the maximum impact . Anti-Shiite attacks have been increasing in recent years in Karachi and also in the southwestern city of Quetta, the northwestern area of Parachinar and the far northeastern town of Gilgit. Around 1,000 Shiites have been killed in the past two years in Pakistan, with many of the attacks claimed by the hardline Sunni group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Pakistan has stepped up its fight against militants in the past month, following a Taliban massacre at a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar. Heavily armed gunmen went from room to room at the army-run school gunning down 150 people, most of them children, in an attack that horrified the world. Since then, the government has ended a six-year moratorium on executions in terror-related cases and pledged to crack down on all militant groups. Death toll: About 1,000 Sunnis have been killed in sectarian violence in Pakistan over the last two years . Massacre: The suicide bombing comes just two months after gunmen stormed a school, killing 150 people - mainly children . Death sentence: The Pakistani government has bought in executions in terror-related cases and pledged to crack down on all militant groups .","Shiite worshippers were killed by a suicide bomber who targeted a mosque in the  southern Sindh province .

"The Taylor Swift/Hottest 100 scandal has been reignited. In the days leading up to the Australia Day poll, a social media campaign to have American pop artist Taylor Swift’s song Shake it Off win the poll stole the spotlight. On the morning of the national countdown, Triple J announced Shake it Off was disqualified from the countdown, largely because it had never been played on the station. But news has surfaced that the ninth-placed song on the countdown, Chandelier, by Australian artist Sia, also had never been played on the youth broadcaster either, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Scroll down for video . The ninth-placed song on the countdown, Chandelier, by Australian artist Sia (left), had never been played on Triple J,  one of the chief reasons that Taylor Swift's (right) song Shake it Off was disqualified . Taylor Swift was disqualified for a number of reasons, including KFC's decision to offer a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop stars latest album 1989 . An article on Tone Deaf called 'A Song Triple J Never Played Made The Hottest 100 Top 10 And Nobody Noticed' has reported that Triple J only ever played a cover of Chandelier, not the original song. Chris Scadden, Triple J’s station manager, told Tone Def the song had been played on the station's DJ shows House Party and Mix Up. ""Triple J has been playing Sia for more than 15 years, since she was a young artist in Adelaide... we played 4-5 songs from her 1000 Forms Of Fear album on Triple J in 2014,"" he said. He pointed out that by comparison, none of Taylor Swifts songs had been played on the station. There have been previous examples of songs appearing on the poll without ever being played, including Alanis Morissette, Green Day, U2 and the Foo Fighters. me over (featuring Safia) in fifth spot. Chet Faker took the top position with his song Talk is Cheap. 1. Chet Faker - Talk is cheap . 2. Peking Duk - High (featuring Nicole Millar) 3. Hilltop Hoods - Cosby Sweater . 4. Milky Chance - Stolen Dance . 5. Peking Duk - Take me over (featuring SAFIA) 6. Mark Ronson - Uptown Funk (featuring       Bruno Mars) 7. Chet Faker - Gold . 8. Chet Faker - 1998 . 9. Sia - Chandelier . 10.Asgeir - King and Cross . On the morning of the countdown, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’. An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted. Daily Mail Australia viewed the post which is titled 'eight hilarious but totally true reasons you didn't hear Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100'. The humorous article, laden with sarcasm, has copied the format of the website 'Buzzfeed' which lead the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign. 'Their #Tay4Hottest100 campaign bought Taylor a one-way ticket to bansville,' a Triple J author wrote. Although they did wish to clarify, 'triple j doesn't have beef with Taylor Swift.' 'She's smart, she's cool and she has excellent taste in BFFs,' in reference to Swift's friendship with Lorde, who made numerous appearances in last year's Hottest 100 countdown. Before the music countdown began, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’ The Triple J author explains that they took issue with the fact Buzzfeed, an international media company worth $850 million and the allegedly the leading source of cat GIFs, was 'throwing their weight around to influence a publicly voted music poll'. 'It's not legit for other media to try and troll the poll,' Triple J wrote. Triple J has strict rules which promise to 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'. The article then points out the number of 'trolls' who voted for Taylor Swift to 'prod the hipsters for lulz', meaning they did not vote for the young muso because of a genuine interest in the countdown. 'Do we really want to be talking about this every year?' Triple J asked. They argue that if the Taylor Swift campaign was successful it would have a long-term impact on their music poll, with other campaigns inevitably set to follow in future years, supporting people like 'Rebecca Black, Crazy Frog and Paris Hilton'. That would be a 'sh***y, sh***y tragedy.' KFC were also pointed out as being partially responsible for their decision after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual Australia Day countdown. 'Not every KFC idea is a good one,' pointed out Triple J in their 'Triple J Feed' post. The fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the Triple J Hottest 100, a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers. The fast food chain offered a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop star's latest album 1989, to customers who posted their favourite Swift song- a move which may breach the countdown's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote. '""We'd prefer that people vote for the love of music, not the love of cholesterol"",' Triple J responded on Australian Day, hitting out at the fast food chain after they tried to cash in on the Hottest 100 hype. An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted . Triple J confirmed that the voucher was in direct violation of the Triple J Hottest 100 voting rules, which clearly state that the station will 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'. Following the announcment, Social Media was bombarded with posts – some celebrating the decision, others devastated by Swift’s exclusion. ‘Dear @triplej why do you hate joy and puppies and kittens and bubbles and good things YOU MONSTERS,’ wrote Aya Reina. ‘Is it too cliche to tell @taylorswift13 fans to shake it off?’ said Chris Matthews-Darby . ‘Now the people who were waiting for Taylor Swift, but have never listened to @triplej can go away now,’ said Ren. Almost in direct response, Dylan Malloch posted ‘So, @triplej just ensured I won't be listening to any of the #hottest100 this year by not including #taylorswift.’ Harsh: In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters . Earlier on Tuesday, an unofficial poll shed some  insight into who might take home the coveted Triple J Hottest 100 crown, with Swift making the cut despite the controversy. Taylor Swift was given a number 75 ranking on the Social Hottest 100 which has proved an inaccurate prediction, many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves. Nasty: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS . Too cool for school: The campaign to get Taylor on the list kicked off after super fan Joe McKenzi  tweeted ABC boss Mark Scott (pictured) about the omission of Swift's hit Shake It Off from the voting list .","Number nine on the countdown, Chandelier, had never been played by Triple J .

"All 17 of the Nomads bikie gang who had got together at their regular 'church meeting' have been arrested in a pre-emptive raid by NSW Police. Senior members of the gang were among those charged during Friday night's raid on their recently furnished western Sydney clubhouse. Officers executed a search warrant on the property in Wetherill Park as part of an investigation into the outlaw motorcycle gang. As a result, 13 Nomads members have been charged with habitually consorting with convicted offenders and four others charged with various drug, weapons and traffic offences. Police first raided their western Sydney clubhouse and had it shut down. Scroll down for video . Thirteen Nomads OMCG members charged with consorting following clubhouse raid in western Sydney . The men were taken to police stations and were charged with habitually consort with convicted offender . Officers executed a search warrant on the property in Wetherill Park at about 7.45pm on Friday as part of an ongoing investigation into criminal activity by the outlaw motorcycle gang. Following the raid, 13 Nomad members were arrested  under anti-consorting legislation after a joint operation by the Gangs Squad's Strike Force Raptor and Fairfield Local Area Command. The men were taken to various police stations and were charged with habitually consort with convicted offender. Gangs Squad Commander Superintendent Deborah Wallace says police wanted to disrupt the group's regular meeting, described as a 'church night' with a party vibe. It's at these get-togethers that criminals usually meet to hatch out their plans, she said. 'We would allege the clubhouses are used to further their criminal activities and associations,' she told reporters on Saturday. Consorting-related offences relate to those who organise to meet on two separate occasions with two separate criminals. 'It's a complex piece of legislation, we have to ensure that each criminal has been warned about their association prior to us arresting them,' Supt Wallace said. During the raid on the Nomads' clubhouse, which was recently created after the shutdown of their previous club two years ago, police say they also found drugs and evidence of illegal alcohol sales. Drugs, believed to be cocaine, were also found hidden under the petrol cap of a motorcycle. All those arrested have been granted conditional bail to appear in court in the coming months. Gangs Squad Commander Superintendent Deborah Wallace says the arrests were made as part of a crackdown under anti-consorting laws. 'These arrests have been made under legislation that makes it an offence for a person habitually to associate with two more convicted offenders,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'My message is that if further offences are detected under these laws, my detectives will continue to enforce the legislation to the fullest extent by arresting and charging those involved.' Supt Wallace said many more consorting-related arrests were anticipated following the raid. During the search, 13 men were arrested by the Strike Force Raptor under anti-consorting legislation . Four of the 13 men arrested on Friday have been variously charged with traffic, drug and weapon offences . It is anticipated that Strike Force Raptor will be making many more consorting-related arrests. In addition to the consorting arrests and charges, four of the 13 members arrested on Friday have been variously charged with traffic, drug and weapon offences. A 25-year-old member of the gang was arrested after a drug dog detected 29 grams of a white powder, believed to be cocaine, hidden under the petrol cap of the motorcycle he was riding. The man was taken to Green Valley Police Station but has been released pending further inquiries. A 27-year-old associate of the gang was issued with a field court attendance notice for riding while unlicensed. He was also found to be in possessions of an Ice pipe and, as a result, was taken to Fairfield Hospital for blood and urine testing, before being released pending the outcomes of the tests. He is scheduled to appear in Fairfield Local Court on 20 April 2015. It is anticipated that Strike Force Raptor will be making many more consorting-related arrests . The men were taken to  police stations and were charged with habitually consort with convicted offender . A 21-year-old member of the gang was found to be in possession of a knife and was issued with a field court attendance notice for custody of a knife.

"Record producer Nigel Wright's six-bedroom mansion near the Surrey commuter town of Chertsey may seem a million miles from the frantic world of pop superstardom. But the recording studio in the garden is where Nigel worked on hits for the biggest names in the music business, including Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Cliff Richard and Jose Carreras. Perhaps most exciting of all for the producer's four daughters, however, was when they came home from school one day and heart-throbs Take That were frolicking in the pool. Record producer Nigel Wright has put his six-bedroom home in Surrey on the market for £1.59million . The recording studio (pictured) in the garden is where Nigel worked on hits for the biggest names in the music business . 'They were over the moon,' says Nigel, who produced the band's first hit single It Only Takes A Minute in 1992 and several of the tracks on their second album, Everything Changes, released the following year. 'We had no idea just how big they were. They were just a bunch of kids. We took them to the local pub for lunch and word spread like wildfire. Next thing we knew, we had fans camping outside the house and my wife even found girls in the kitchen who had snuck into the house when we weren't looking.' Now that Nigel's daughters have grown up and flown the nest, he and wife Deana, a nurse, are looking for a smaller property near the coast. They have put their home of 34 years on the market for £1.59million. 'This has been a great family house – when our children were young and went to school nearby, we had loads of friends here and it felt more of a community, but as the years have gone by, everyone has moved away,' says Nigel. 'It's no longer the centre of the family.' Mr Wright (pictured) has produced tracks for Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Cliff Richard and Jose Carreras . The mansion would be ideal for a large family, pictured is the spacious, modern kitchen with an island . The Wrights built the swimming pool and pool-house as well as increasing the number of bedrooms from three to six . Its location, on St Ann's Hill, has been home to other music industry stars, including Keith Moon of The Who and Vince Clarke of Erasure, who finally sold Ammonite, his custom-made, snail-shaped home, two years ago after several years on the market. Oliver Clarke, of Barton Wyatt estate agents, believes it's more likely that a large family rather than a pop star will buy Nigel's house. 'Buyers who have been priced out of London realise they can get much more for their money here but still be in town in 45 minutes on the train or M25,' he says. Nigel bought the house when he was 26 in 1981 while he was working at nearby Shepperton Studios. Born and brought up in Bristol, he performed in bands from the age of 15. He moved to London at 19 and in 1980 was one of the founding members of the jazz-funk band Shakatak. 'We'd just had a hit album and suddenly I could afford a house,' says Nigel, 60, who was renting in nearby Laleham at the time. 'I thought, rather than paying to use a studio, I might as well build my own.' So the house comes with its own recording studio. The dining room of the six-bedroom mansion in St Ann's Hill, which also boasts a pool house with kitchen . One day Mr Wright's four daughters came home from school to find Take That (pictured) playing in the pool . The property's 2.2 acres, cluttered with outbuildings, were ripe for redevelopment when Nigel bought it from an elderly widow for £123,500. At the time it was half its current size. The former owners were from Scotland and named the house Lockerbie because of their connection with the Scottish town – years before the air disaster there. Price: £1.59million . Location: Chertsey, Surrey . Bedrooms: Six . Unique features: Recording studio, pool that chart-toppers Take That went swimming in . 'It's been a non-stop spend, really – we've been adding a bit here and a bit there and refurbished the studio three times over the years,' says Nigel, who has been Andrew Lloyd Webber's music producer for nearly three decades, collaborating with him on his musicals as well as TV shows including How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria? The Wrights built the swimming pool and pool-house as well as increasing the number of bedrooms from three to six. 'What we love about the house is the high ceilings and windows which flood it with light,' says Nigel, whose love of music began when he asked his parents if he could take up the trombone at the age of nine after hearing a brass band play on a visit to church with his father. 'I loved it and found it really easy,' he explains. The couple are also selling a five-bedroom holiday home in Majorca's Valldemossa, which they use less now their daughters are older. They hope to put the proceeds from both sales towards a barn conversion with equally high ceilings but less living space.

"Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern oil magnates who've spent the past year salivating over the Pierre Hotel penthouse originally priced at record-breaking $125million are in luck, as the exclusive property has just been relisted for half price. With a new asking price of 'only' $63million, the 16-bedroom triplex - the former home of the late financial analyst Martin Zweig - is widely considered a steal by New York real estate experts. In December 2013, after about eight months on the market, the lavish apartment's eye-watering asking price was slashed down to $95million, but by Christmas the property was yanked off the market altogether. Scroll down for video . On sale: The Pierre Hotel penthouse originally priced at record-breaking $125million has just been relisted for $63million . Sticker shock: At whopping $125million, the 16-bedroom triplex was considered the most expensive apartment in the history of New York City real estate . On top of the world: The Pierre Hotel penthouse on Fifth Avenue occupies the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd floors of the Upper East Side hotel . A year later, the owner of the palatial digs, Martin Zweig's widow Barbara, re-listed the penthouse for 49.6 per cent off the original asking price. Mrs Zweig's late husband famously predicted the 1987 market crash three days before it happened. Brown Harris Stevens realtor Mary Rutherford, who took over the listing from Sotheby's International Realty, told the Wall Street Journal that the new, more affordable price tag is 'right in the middle' of New York’s luxury apartment market. The Pierre Hotel penthouse on Fifth Avenue occupies the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd floors of the Upper East Side hotel and has 16 rooms, six bathrooms and five fireplaces beneath 23-foot ceilings.

There are arched cathedral windows and fireplaces designed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries - including one in the private gym. Other features include a Swedish sauna, three powder rooms, a private elevator that services all three floors and three kitchenettes as well as a main kitchen. There's also a grand wooden staircase, a library with 18th-century paneling and a guest suite with two bedrooms, three bathrooms, a kitchen and two living areas. But prospective buyers will not be able to spend all their cash on the home because they'll also need to cover the monthly maintenance bill of $47,000 for electricity and two housekeeping staff. What a welcome: The entrance has an impressive wooden staircase and two reception rooms . Historic: There are four fireplaces at the home, which were designed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries .

"A professor was beaten to within an inch of his life because four Polish robbers knocked on the wrong door. The four men were so high on drugs that they continued their onslaught despite coming face to face with a middle-aged white man rather than a black robber in his twenties.

Paul Kohler, 54, the victim of the horrific attack which left him disfigured and requiring a blood transfusion, said he was 'certain' that mistaken identity had been at the source of the burglary. The picture of his battered and bloodied face taken after the attack was a pertinent reminder of the beating the father-of-four endured. Pawel Honc (left), 24, and Mariusz Tomaszewski (right), 32, were arrested and both jailed for 19 years . Oskar Pawlowichz (left) and Dawid Tychon (right) were jailed for 13 years after they pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary . Mr Kohler said that his suspicions of mistaken identity had been confirmed by police who gave him information 'in confidence'. A judge ruled yesterday that all four men had binged on drink and drugs before bursting into the £2million home where Mr Kohler had been playing board games with his family. A court previously heard that the men were regular substance users and that a stash of drugs had been found in the car driven to the address. Mr Kohler, a friend of Prince Edward, was attacked by the thugs when he opened the door to his home in Wimbledon on August 11 2014. The four men, now identified as Marius Tomaszewski, 32, Oskar Pawlowicz, 30, Dawid Tychon, 29 and Pawel Honc, 24, burst into the house and began their attack. Their faces were masked and they wore blue latex gloves. Two members of the group viciously beat Mr Kohler while the others set about finding valuables in the house. Yesterday a court heard that while Mr Kohler was being pummelled, one of the gang shouted the words: 'Where's the money?' His wife Samantha MacArthur, 50, was blindfolded and held down while she could hear her husband screaming downstairs. Yesterday, Judge Susan Tapping, sentencing at Kingston Crown Court, described the attack, which lasted around eight minutes as 'savage'. Judge Tapping branded the pictures of Mr Kohler's face 'appalling'. She said that the men would have continued their 'unrelenting' beating had police not interrupted them. Paul Kohler smiles with his family outside court after the sentencing yesterday. Pictured (l-r) Daughter Saskia, wife Samantha, Mr Kohler, daughters Beth and Eloise . Judge Tapping said: 'The violence was increasing and showed no sign of stopping.' Speaking to the court on Thursday, prosecutor Charles Evans said that Mr Kohler believed the man who forced him to the ground and beat him had 'enjoyed' it. A police source confirmed that the men may have come to Mr Kohler's house because they were looking for Rowe, who lived in social housing next door in a large property divided into flats in King's Road in Wimbledon. Rowe, who police confirmed was a notorious criminal in the area, was arrested 13 days before the ambush. Despite his anger at the men who viciously beat him in his own home, Mr Kohler said he 'took no pleasure' from seeing them jailed. He said: 'I feel vindicated by the sentence but I don't want to be vindictive about it. 'I take no pleasure in their deservedly long sentence - and it is a long sentence, and that's right and proper. 'It will be difficult for them, as it should be, but I'm not going to sit here and jump up and down looking delighted about it. 'I still feel some anger, I hope I don't feel bitter. I hope in time that will pass. 'It depends what they do with their lives after this sentence whether or not my anger eventually subsides. 'I've been told something by the police in confidence which confirms my view they got the wrong address. I'm sure that's what it was, I've always thought that and now I'm pretty convinced that was so.' He was jailed for eight years in January after violently robbing two women in the street. His police mugshot shows him wearing a t-shirt with words Walter White - a reference to a professor who makes money by manufacturing drugs in television series Breaking Bad. During the heist, Rowe pointed a gun at a woman's head as she was walking down the street alone. He then threatened to shoot if she did not hand over her bag. Another detective in Mr Kohler's case dismissed Rowe's link to the investigation saying that the information did not 'add up' and labelled him a 'two bob burglar' who had long been known to police. The police source also said that when questioned, Oskar Pawlowicz, one of the four men who stormed the house, said that Mr Kohler's home was just one of three possible addresses they had thought of robbing that night. Judge Susan Tapping yesterday accepted that the men may have planned to collect a debt but had gone to the wrong house. She said: 'Their house was deliberately targeted, either in expectation that items of significant value were inside or the wrong address was identified where a debt was to be collected. 'When the doorbell rang and Mr Kohler opened it the violence exploded immediately.' After the four men were sent down to face lengthy sentences behind bars yesterday, the Kohler family huddled together and hugged as the six-month ordeal finally drew to a close. Eloise Kohler, 25, who had effectively saved her parents' lives by calling the police as she hid in her bedroom sobbed as the sentencing drew to a close. Speaking after the men were jailed yesterday, Mr Kohler said: 'I feel vindicated but I am not going to be vindictive. 'I am not going to gloat about the deservedly long sentences.' Weapon: A flamethrower was found in the back of Tychon's car on the night he was arrested . On Thursday, Mr Kohler had directed a plea directly to his attackers, asking them to reveal why his family had been targeted. He said that, by understanding their motives, he hoped to forgive them. But the men failed to answer the question put to them in court on Thursday. All four men stared ahead, their faces void of emotion as they heard their fate yesterday. Mr Kohler said he still did not believe the men were sorry. 'I didn't see any remorse today. I hope it's something that will come,' he said. He admitted that facing up to the men in court had been a 'scary' experience. Focussing on life after the ordeal he added: 'The family is strong. We have already moved on and we are stronger for it.' Pawel Honc, of no fixed address, and Mariusz Tomaszewski, of Crusoe Road, Mitcham, south London, were both sentenced at Kingston Crown Court to 19 years after admitting grievous bodily harm with intent and aggravated burglary. Oskar Pawlowicz, of Pitcairn Road in Mitcham, and Dawid Tychon, 29, of no fixed address, were both sentenced to 13 years after they pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary. Judge Tapping yesterday said that all three men would serve at least two thirds of their sentences. Tychon will be deported to Poland after his sentence to face jail for a separate crime there. It was previously revealed that all the men in the case, apart from Honc, had committed crimes in Poland before moving to Britain. Between them, the three men had more than 30 convictions. Mr Kohler said he would still angry with the burglars for the attack, but would not be celebrating them being jailed .","Four Polish burglars jailed for savagely beating a lecturer during a raid .

"Google is making a wristband that detects cancer cells, and using human skin to do it. Scientists in the life sciences division of Google X laboratories are working on a proactive, preventative approach to one of the world's deadliest diseases, according to The Independent. The wristband would work in tandem with a pill that would send nanoparticles through the body to latch on to markers of different conditions and diseases including cancer, Andrew Conrad, head of Google Life Sciences, told The Atlantic. 'We have (the nanoparticles) circulate around your whole body looking for those cells and we collect them using a magnet and basically ask them what they saw,' Conrad said. Scroll down for video . Human Skin: Scientists in the life sciences division of Google X laboratories are working on a preventative approach to curing cancer and using man-made human arms using both synthetic and real human skin to do it . The nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body, Conrad explained. The system relies on light emitted from the cells as a result of the nanoparticles, so scientists must understand how light passes through skin, according to the Independent. So Google started making skin. To assist with their research, the scientists have made molds of human arms using both synthetic and real human skin from donors. Light: Andrew Conrad, head of Google Life Sciences (here), explained the nanoparticles would cause the cancer cells to light up, allowing the wristband to record whether there are dangerous cells in the body . While using skin in the research, scientists have to account for people of different ethnicity, resulting in different skin pigmentation, and thickness of skin, The Atlantic reports. As the wearable is still in the early stages of development, Google X is working to determine what defines a 'healthy' person. They are monitoring 175 healthy volunteers to frequently collect physiological information. Wristband/Pill: The wristband would work in tandem with a pill that would send nanoparticles through the body to latch on to markers of cancer cells . Differences: While using skin in the research, scientists have to account for people of different ethnicity, resulting in different skin pigmentation, and thickness of skin . Conrad admitted that people may find it 'weird' having particles constantly tracking the cells in their body. 'It’s way weirder to have cancer cells floating through your body that are constantly trying to kill you,' Conrad continued. Conrad told the Atlantic that the Google X team is trying to change medicine from being episodic and reactive to being proactive and preventive. 'We're making good progress but the journey is long and hard, he said. 'So I think we will get there and I hope it's years, not decades.'","Scientists in the life sciences division of Google X laboratories are using human skin in their research to develop a wristband to detect cancer cells .

"An ISIS chemical weapons expert who the U.S. feared was 'gathering equipment' for the militants has been killed in an airstrike in Iraq, officials have claimed. Abu Malik was killed on January 24 near Mosul, after being 'specifically targeted' by the U.S.-led forces because of growing concern ISIS may be trying to secure chemical weapons. Malik had worked at Saddam Hussein's Muthanna chemical weapon production facility - a factory to the north-west of Baghdad known for producing lethal sarin gas. The factory - which still housed the remnants of about 2,500 rockets filled with sarin and other deadly nerve agents - was seized by ISIS-led Sunni rebels in June last year. Scroll down for videos . Killed: Abu Malik is said to have been killed near Mosul, Iraq, in a targeted airstrike carried out by U.S. airforces on January 24 (not pictured) Weapons: The chemical engineer worked at Saddam Hussein's Muthanna chemical weapon production facility, which produced the deadly sarin gas, before the fall of Iraq . It is thought Malik, also known as Salih Jasim Muhammed Falah al-Sabawi, joined ISIS at about the same time. However, a statement from the UN and U.S. said the weapons would have degraded too much to be any use to the extremist group. An official, speaking under condition of anonymity, told the Washington Times coalition members had become increasingly concerned about the extremist group's efforts to acquire chemical weapons. He was thought to be capable of creating harmful and deadly chemical agents - although there is no evidence ISIS has an arsenal of chemical weapons. But it is believed to be attempting to pursue a chemical weapons capability. Another source told the Daily Beast: 'He was gathering a lot of equipment—we're not really sure for what—before we killed him. 'But it's concerning that someone who was fairly seriously high up in the [chemical weapons] infrastructure linked up with [ISIS]. This wasn't some enlisted guy.' Captured: The factory - which still contains 2,500 rockets filled with gas - was taken over by ISIS militants last summer, about the same time Malik is thought to have joined the group . Fears: An anonymous source claims the U.S. was worried Malik was 'gathering equipment' which could be used to up ISIS's chemical weapons capability . Malik, who is understood to have defected to Al-Qaeda in 2005, before changing his allegiance to ISIS more recently, is the first of the 8,000 militants killed since airstrikes began in August to be named by the U.S.. It is thought a number of his associates had already been rounded up by Iraqi troops. A statement from Central Command said: 'His death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ISIL's ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people.' ISIL is another term for ISIS. Mathanna, just 45 miles from Baghdad, was once one of Iraq's biggest producers of the deadly sarin gas. The complex is thought to have been capable of producing around 4,000 tones of nerve agent a year. The factory began producing mustard gas in  1980, but didn't begin producing significant amounts until a couple of years later. It moved onto nerve gasses in 1984 - including sarin, which it used to deadly effect in the 1980s and early 1990s. Sarin gas - which was outlawed in 1993 - is lethal even in small doses, taking one to 10 minutes to kill a person after they inhale the deadly nerve agent if an antidote is administered. If it is drunk, the victim can survive for up to 18 hours. It is one of the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Exposure to the gas causes pupils to shrink to pinpoint sizes and foaming at the lips, while symptoms include paralysis, loss of consciousness and respiratory failure. The site was bombed by the US during the 1991 Gulf War, but the munitions there were only partially destroyed, according to the UN - then left to Iraq to take care of. But the last major report by U.N. inspectors after the fall of Saddam revealed Bunker 13 still contained 2,500 sarin-filled 122-mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991, and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide, 'a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun'. ISIS fighters took over the factory on June 12 this year, in a dawn raid captured on CCTV watched by security guards.","U.S. claims chemical engineer Abu Malik was killed on January 24 .

"The mistress of married 60 minutes correspondent Steven Kroft sent him raunchy selfies while he demanded she dress low key in a bid to keep their illicit affair secret. The messages between veteran broadcaster Kroft, 69, and Lisan Goines, 41, include pictures of the corporate lawyer posing in her underwear. The newsman also asks her a number of raunchy questions - including how many New Years resolutions she had broken. Ahead of a date at the Park Hyatt in the capital in September 2011, he told her dress 'in Washington is Either professional or Laura Bush' and insisted she did not look like Beyonce to avoid attracting attention. A source told the New York Post's Page Six Kroft was 'really paranoid about right-wing zealots' finding out about their three-year illicit affair and threatening his career at CBS. They also said: 'He was unwilling to be seen publicly with [Goines] because she’s black — because they’d be more noticeable.' Affair: Lisa Goines, the mistress of married 60 minutes correspondent Steven Kroft, would send him selfies posing in her underwear while they exchanged raunchy messages . Demands: The newsman told Goines (pictured) to dress more like Laura Bush and not Beyone in a bid to keep their affair a secret. He was reportedly paranoid 'ring-wing zealots' would find out about the illicit relationship . Together: Kroft (right) is pictured with lover Lisan Goines outside a hotel in New York City on December 17. This picture was released a short time after the broadcaster admitted the affair . The paper  reported that Kroft boasted in the texts about his rapport with President Obama who he has interviewed on numerous occasions. Their source said: '[Kroft] definitely said Obama feels comfortable with him, because he was the first person to take him seriously when he was running for president,” the insider said. They have a rapport. They used to smoke together.' Kroft's representatives however have denied the allegations, saying they are 'filled with distortions, exaggerations and outright falsehoods.' In the string of messages Kroft says: 'Wanting to taste you again' before Goines replies by saying 'same here'. The next morning he the told her: 'Gonna explode if I can’t have you soon.' While staying in the same Washington Hotel they had a date in he messaged Goines saying: 'I’m in my room at the same Washington hotel where I remember having you for a four hour full course Meal plus desert.' Illicit: The texts between the pair included selfies of Goines while Kroft arranged to meet her at a hotel . Plans: The messages also include Kroft asking how many New Years resolutions she had broken and how the pair should celebrate Kroft's birthday . He also said: 'Very hard playing golf with A bulge in my pants.' Earlier this month, a week after the veteran correspondent admitted to a lengthy affair with Goines , a snap has emerged of the pair together. The pair, who are both married, met for drinks at the five-star Essex Hotel and were later seen kissing in the back of a cab, according to the National Enquirer. Kroft has admitted to the affair, calling it 'a serious lapse in personal judgment' after the magazine revealed that the duo had carried on a three-year relationship. 'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he told the New York Post. 'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011 . The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, it reported. Kroft had spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend. While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, ""I have to see you again"",' a source said. A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported. Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work. 'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied. Together: Kroft, pictured with his wife in May 2014, said they were working hard to get past the affair . In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly responded:  'U all over and deep inside of me.' Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it. But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said. She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added. 'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said. They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17. Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992 . The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'. The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John. Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award. He told the New York Post that his 'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist. Watch full interview on CBS .","CBS Newsman, 69, and corporate lawyer Lisan Goines had lengthy affair .

"Radio DJ and TV presenter Chris Evans has been pictured for the first time since revealing that he is is in the middle of a prostate cancer scare. The  father-of-three, 48, told millions of listeners about his plight on the Chris Evans Breakfast show yesterday. He spoke after The Who drummer Kenney Jones - who has overcome the disease and now campaigns for the cause - had been a guest reader on the show's regular On This Day slot. Radio DJ and TV presenter Chris Evans, 48, has been pictured for the first time since revealing that he is is in the middle of a prostate cancer scare . Evans, pictured above backstage during BBC One’s The One Show, said that he had 'completely changed my tune on this over the last couple of years' and encouraged anyone 'worried about anything' to see a doctor . Evans last night took to Twitter where he acknowledged he didn't know how serious the scare was but also downplayed the threat saying he might just be suffering from a urinary infection . Evans said he was prompted to see a doctor after not being able to stop 'peeing' since Christmas. He told his listeners: ‘Thank you once again to Kenney Jones, of The Who who was diagnosed with prostate cancer a couple of years ago and since recovery has been a fundraiser and supporter of Prostate Cancer UK. ‘Prostate cancer, and colon cancer of course, are one of the most survivable forms of cancer there is, if caught early enough. It not, one of the least. It's a fine line between life and death, happiness and tragedy. ‘And I've got to say I'm in the middle of a prostate issue right now! I couldn't stop. I have not been able to stop since Christmas - peeing - or wanting to go. So I've gone to the doctor. Evans said he was prompted to see a doctor after not being able to stop 'peeing' since Christmas . Evans said hew had 'scared myself half to death' by going on the internet and looking up the condition . ‘I've done all the internet stuff that you shouldn't do, I've gone on the internet, scared myself half to death, then gone to see the doctor. And we really should do it the other way round. However I'm in the middle of the tests.’ Last night Evans took to Twitter thanking his fans for their support and downplaying the scare. He wrote: Getting lots of concerned messages about me and my prostate. Probably more likely a urine infection or irritable bladder. But always best to check. That's the message.' During Evans' radio show, traffic presenter Lynn Bowles told the star: 'You seem ok about that.’ Evans replied: ‘Well, you've got to be. I've completely changed my tune on this over the last couple of years. So there you go. If you are worried about anything just go and sort yourself out - if not for you, for your family.’ Evans is married to golfer Natasha Shishmanian, with whom he has two young sons, Noah, five, and Eli, 18 months . Evans is also co-host on BBC One’s The One Show, pictued above, on Friday evenings . The presenter added that he had previously been put off the traditional test for prostate cancer, adding: ‘I was scared of them. I'm a bloke remember.’ Evans is married to golfer Natasha Shishmanian, with whom he has two young sons, Noah, five, and Eli, 18 months. His morning radio show commands more than 9.9 million listeners while his TV commitments including acting as co-host on BBC One’s The One Show on Friday evenings. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. The disease, which usually affects men over 50, often develops slowly, so there may be no signs a man has it for many years. The prostate is a walnut-sized gland that sits below the bladder in men. Its main function is to produce a white fluid that is mixed with the sperm produced by the testicles, to create semen. The gland is shaped like a doughnut with a hole in the middle. Through this hole runs the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. The problem is that the prostate often grows with age, squashing the urethra and obstructing the flow when a man urinates. This can be a sign of an enlarged prostate, which is not usually a serious threat to health. However the following symptoms can also be a sign of prostate cancer. These include: . Needing to urinate more frequently, often during the night . Needing to rush to the toilet . Difficulty in starting to pee . Straining or taking a long time while urinating . Weak flow or feeling that the bladder has not emptied fully .","Evans said that he had not been able to stop 'peeing' since Christmas .

"It is the epitome of genteel sophistication, but behind the scenes The Ritz hotel has been rocked by a scandal that could have its regulars spluttering into their high teas. The managing director of the five-star London landmark has abruptly left his prestigious post after giving his secret girlfriend – a former Bulgarian reality TV contestant 22 years his junior – a coveted job as a resident singer. Stephen Boxall, who had an enviable 19-year career at the hotel, did not disclose that he was in a relationship with 29-year-old Alexandra Anastas before giving her work in The Ritz’s elegant restaurant. Stephen Boxall's lover Alexandra Anastas (pictured) was hired by Mr Boxall as a 'singer in residence' at The Ritz without declaring he was in a relationship with her . Miss Anastas moved to Britain in 2013 with dreams of making it as a singer . Ms Anastas (pictured) met widower Mr Boxall at a London nightclub last year, and the couple spent the festive season together. Here she is pictured in photos posted on her Instagram account . After this was discovered 51-year-old Mr Boxall tendered his resignation, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. Miss Anastas excitedly announced her appointment as the hotel’s Thursday night singer on social media four months ago – the month after she updated her Facebook page to say she was ‘in a relationship’ with an unknown partner. Miss Anastas moved to Britain in 2013 with dreams of making it as a singer. She previously studied music in Sofia and took part in Star Academy, a Bulgarian music reality TV show, in 2005. She and widower Mr Boxall are understood to have met at a London nightclub last year, and the couple spent the festive season together at his £1.1 million gated home in Oxshott, Surrey. On Christmas Day Miss Anastas posted online a picture of herself cuddling Mr Boxall’s son, with the message: ‘It’s been a fantastic year, I could not thank the Lord enough for everything… Feeling blessed and loved and HAPPY!’ Miss Anastas has enjoyed a life of high society since arriving in London, sitting in the Queen’s box at the Royal Albert Hall to watch Cirque du Soleil, seeing Cats at the London Palladium and going to the Royal Ballet. Online snaps show her dining on lobster, drinking champagne and preparing to fly business class to Zurich. A spokesman for The Ritz (pictured right) said Stephen Boxall (left) tendered his resignation on Friday . Mr Boxall worked his way up the ranks at The Ritz, becoming managing director in 2009. Last year, he said: ‘There is not another hotel that I would want to work in. Where do you go after The Ritz? I’ve got the best job in the world.’ The Ritz issued a statement confirming that Mr Boxall had tendered his resignation on Friday, which was accepted, and spoke of his role in maintaining the hotel’s reputation. However, a spokesman refused to comment further on any details, and would not confirm if Miss Anastas was still working as a singer. But a source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There were questions over her suitability for the job, considering her background. A reality TV star is not ordinarily what The Ritz would look for on a CV.’ Neither Mr Boxall nor Miss Anastas would comment yesterday. She had previously studied music in Sofia and in 2005 took part in a Bulgarian music reality TV show .","The Ritz's managing director sacked after giving his lover a singing job .

"Former French president Jacques Chirac had innumerable mistresses and was allegedly nicknamed Mr Three Minutes, shower included, according to a new book. Bernadette Chirac would ask her husband whether he would be 'dining here this evening', to which he would reply 'you're getting on my nerves', before going to meet other women, it has been revealed. Scroll down for video . Unfaithful: Former French President Jacques Chirac (pictured right) and his wife Bernadette (left) pictured together in 2002. A new book has revealed Mr Chirac was nicknamed 'Mr Three Minutes, Shower Included' Former French president and his wife pictured on the steps of the Élysée Palace in Paris in 2002 . And it seems the former first lady's patience has now run out, if her recent outspoken comments are anything to go by. The book, entitled Les Chirac, Les Secrets d'un Clan, is written by Beatrice Gurrey, a political journalist at French newspaper Le Monde. Mr Chirac, now 81, suffers from poor health and memory loss, following a stroke while he was still the country's president in 2005. His condition means he is unaware he is unwell.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott will today announce he has taken his signature paid parental leave (PPL) scheme off the table, as he launches a desperate bid to save his leadership. Mr Abbott is trying to avoid blame for the disastrous Queensland election result on the weekend, which saw a massive swing to Labor, as the latest opinion poll confirmed his government's standing is plummeting. A Fairfax/Ipsos poll showed Bill Shorten's Labor government has soared ahead of the Coalition with 40 per cent of the votes, after the Queensland ALP secured a massive swing in an election which saw Premier Campbell Newman lose his seat. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott's leadership deepened overnight when Queensland voters delivered the conservative government a massive blow in the state election . Queensland Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk on Friday. The ALP secured a massive swing in an election which saw Premier Campbell Newman lose his seat. The Coalition dropped in popularity by three per cent, down to 38 per cent. The polling numbers would see Labor snatch as many as 40 seats in the next election. This comes as Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed the government's PPL scheme will be scrapped. In a major policy speech at the National Press Club on Monday Mr Abbott will announce he is dumping the PPL scheme and will instead introduce a 'families package' focussing on childcare. 'We sought the advice of the Productivity Commission and I have listened to the feedback from my colleagues and from mums and dads around Australia and they have said that, with our current budget constraints, the better focus now is on childcare if we want higher participation and a stronger economy,' Mr Abbott will say, the ABC reported. The scheme would have paid new mothers their full salary for six months, capped at an annual income of $100,000. It will be replaced with a revamped families package. 'He's got a tin ear. The captain's pick of Prince Philip was basically a fatal blow to his prime ministership. I think he's got until the end of this week.' - South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon. 'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people.' - Opposition leader Bill Shorten . 'It's not just Tony Abbott, it's the Abbott government policies that are the problem. They have to reject the cruel and arrogant way they have been leaning on the poor.' - Greens leader Christine Milne. 'We would be crazy to repeat the experience of the last Labor government.' - George Brandis. 'We can't continue as we are. We are getting bad feedback.' - Liberal back bencher Jane Prentice looking at the federal impact of the Queensland election wipeout on Saturday night. 'The prime minister has the support of all members of his government, including me.' - Communications Minister and purported leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull. The results come as speculation grows that a leadership adjustment is on the cards, possibly reinstating Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull to the top role . 'There will be an emphasis on child care and how we can build and boost female workforce participation,' Mr Frydenberg said. It was too difficult to proceed with Mr Abbott's 'signature' parental leave policy given the tight budgetary environment. 'The prime minister recognises that he has to be pragmatic about it,' the assistant treasurer said. He batted away criticism of the decision, saying Mr Abbott had consulted colleagues extensively and taken into account the Productivity Commission's report into child care. 'You can't criticise him for taking leadership on this issue even though he said at the last election that we're going to introduce the PPL.' The news comes as speculation is growing that a Liberal leadership spill is on the cards, with suggestions that Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull could again lead the party. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the deputy Liberal leader, has also been rumoured to be in line for the job. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the deputy Liberal leader, has also been rumoured to be lined up for the job . Backbenchers began talking openly about dumping Mr Abbott as leader after the 'catastrophic' election result in Queensland. Mr Abbott called an emergency Cabinet meeting on the weekend to restore backbenchers' confidence following the humiliating start to 2015. Some of Mr Abbott's closest allies on Sunday conceded party members were unsettled but insisted his leadership was not under imminent threat . 'A few anonymous voices and a couple of people who have been prepared to put their head up do not constitute a basis to unsettle a prime ministership,' Attorney-General George Brandis said. However, opposition members have called for an end to Mr Abbot's time as Prime Minister, claiming his days are numbered. 'If they think it's the salesman, not what they're selling, they will have learned nothing. It's the arrogance which really frustrates people,' Opposition leader Bill Shorten said on Sunday. 'All we are talking about now is the timing and method of execution,' one Queensland MP told ABC News. 'This is catastrophic, unimaginable,' said another. And its not just Mr Abbott that some people have in their sights. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch was back on Twitter again berating the government for its poor showing in the Queensland elections. 'Shock turnover in Q'land outing okay government.. Blank check to nobodies. Can't ignore this a huge message for Feds. People have spoken!' Earlier in the week the media tycoon tweeted that Mr Abbott should sack his chief-of-staff Peta Credlin after his widely scorned decision to award British royal Prince Philip a knighthood on Australia Day. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has confirmed to the prime minister privately she would not challenge him for the leadership at this point, but refused to deny it may happen in the future. Following leadership troubles for Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister steered clear of the Queensland campaign amid fears his presence would be a detriment to the campaign.","Fairfax/Ipsos poll shows support for the Coalition has plummeted .

"From its adulterous beginnings to the final years of cold indifference, the relationship between Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh was one of the great love stories of the 20th Century. Now the story of their steamy passion – and its eventual demise – can be told in the great actor’s own words, as a cache of previously unpublished letters is made available to the public for the first time. Olivier wrote more than 200 letters to Gone With The Wind star Leigh over the course of their affair. It began in 1936, when the two screen icons were both locked into their first marriages, and ended in their divorce in 1960. The following year, Olivier married Joan Plowright, the actress who would remain his wife until he died in 1989. Here The Mail on Sunday presents a revealing selection of Olivier’s correspondence, held in the archives of London’s Victoria & Albert Museum and which curators are making available for the first time. Scroll down for video . Passion: Olivier (left) and Leigh (right) on screen together in 1936, the year their affair began, in the film 'Fire Over England'. Their turbulent relationship ended in divorce in 1960 . The ardent early years . In the early years, when the infatuated Olivier said he ‘worshipped’ Leigh and likened life without her to ‘purgatory’, he wrote candidly sexual declarations of his love. In one undated letter believed to be from 1938 or 1939, he wrote: ‘I woke up absolutely raging with desire for you my love... Oh dear God how I did want you. Perhaps you were stroking your darling self. ‘Oh dear sweet, I haven’t done anything. I’ve often thought of it, but it isn’t that I want to satisfy myself so much because I wouldn’t do that without you, so I’m not going to if I can help it. I know it won’t be right or do any good. 'If we loved each other only with our bodies I suppose it would be alright. I love you with much more than that. I love you with, oh everything somehow, with a special kind of soul.’ On April 23, 1939, he wrote: ‘I am sitting naked with just my parts wrapped in your panties. My longing for you is so intense.’ In a footnote, he added: ‘I’m loving and adoring and want you so.’ In an undated letter at about the same time he said: ‘I do really love and worship you, my jewelkin. You are in my thoughts and weighing so heavily in my heart all the time. I am only existing until I see you again and only just managing to do that.’ Playful: the couple pictured at home in London in 1950. The couple married in 1940, and were divorced in 1960. In the early years, the infatuated Olivier said he ‘worshipped’ Leigh and likened life without her to ‘purgatory' In another undated letter the actor told her that he longed for her embrace: ‘I am in your arms and your are stroking and coddling me and I am doing little more than grunting and nuzzling (except adoring and drawing all thought of life from you).’ Olivier was both relieved and excited when Leigh landed the role of Scarlett O’Hara in 1939’s Gone With The Wind. He wrote: ‘The idea of you playing Scarlett is wonderful… in fact it’s glorious and magnificent. [I’m] sure no one can teach you anything about Scarlett.’ But Olivier’s enthusiasm soon turned sour when Leigh told him she was struggling with the role. Both worried – needlessly as it turned out – that the film would flop and that its producer David Selznick would cancel plans to make Leigh a huge star. On August 2, 1939, he wrote: ‘My poor little precious you do sound unhappy. But the plain sense of it is – and this is very hard to hear – that not only have you got to be good in this if you can, and if you can’t you’ve got at least to be good enough from Selznick’s angle to have your option taken up because you have got to justify yourself in the next two or three films by proving that the presumable failure of Gone WTW was not your fault... Star-crossed lovers: The couple appeared on stage as Romeo and Juliet in 1940, the same year that they married . ‘You have got to be damn smart to make a success of your career in pictures which is ESSENTIAL for your self-respect... I am afraid you may become just boring. Never to me... But to yourself and because of that to others.’ Olivier had to continually remind Leigh that the scandalous nature of their relationship meant they couldn’t be seen together in public, even when their affair became an open secret. On May 30, 1939, he wrote: ‘I have come to the conclusion you’re very naughty. We are a popular scandal, or rather a public one. Therefore it is only reasonably good taste to be as unobtrusive as possible. Can you dance and be gay and carry on like the gay happy hypocrite days? No my love you cannot. Why because of your fame, tripled with our situation – quadrupled with the fame there off.’ Olivier and Leigh were finally free to marry in 1940 following their respective divorces. Initially married life did nothing to dampen the couple’s passion. In 1945, Olivier wrote: ‘It is not possible to express my feelings and thoughts about you my dear one. I long for you with such a wretchedness.’ Leigh responded in kind in letters sent during the 1950s. On August 1, 1950, while on a plane she wrote: ‘Oh sweet Baba. If we were together I expect this would seem quite exciting, but then that applies to everything in life.’ Later in the decade she wrote: ‘Whenever you think of Me my Larry-boy you will know I am with you adoringly Vivien.’ The end of the affair . Yet while Leigh never stopped loving Olivier, by the late 50s the marriage was over in all but name. Leigh suffered a serious of mental breakdowns and Olivier tired of her extramarital affairs and erratic behaviour. The couple divorced in 1960. In a letter from the early 1960s, Olivier wrote of how he was grateful for being ‘set free’, and urged Leigh to make a fresh start with her new love Jack Merivale. ‘What horror it must have been for you and I want to say thank you for understanding it all for my sake... You did nobly and bravely and beautifully and I am very oh so sorry, very sorry, that it must have been much hell for you, and I am very grateful to you for enduring it and setting me free to enjoy what is infinitely happy for me. Oh God Vivling, how I do pray that you will find happiness now.’ Fear: Leigh (left) as Scarlett O'Hara in the Oscar-winning classic Gone With The Wind - which she secretly feared would be considered a flop and ruin her burgeoning career . In another letter he wrote: ‘Please do take great care of Jack. He loves you and however saint-like don’t try [him] too hard – he’s a real man and he loves you wonderfully well – keep hold of that. It’s infinitely precious.’ He apologised to Leigh when she learned from the media that he was to remarry. But he urged her to confine their relationship to the past. In happier times: The pair were globally renowned for their public displays of affection and their intense passion . ‘Thank you so much for the most wonderful roses. I can’t pretend that viewing them did not distress me because such thoughts always do because you know Darling, don’t you, that I can’t return them, those thoughts and mementos of romantic occasions. I am so dearly sorry about the beastly way you found out, [but] I do, as you know, want to get married – and the less we stir up about it the better for me and I’m sure for you too.’ Leigh did her best to remain a part of Olivier’s life but he was keen to keep his distance. In an undated letter written from Brighton he said: ‘Please do not think I am being aloof. I have thought it all over very deeply and I am quite sure now that for all our sakes it would be much better for me to continue the plan I decided upon two years ago for us not to meet for the present.’ Olivier’s attitude meant Leigh was desperate for every letter she received. On February 11, 1963 she wrote: ‘Darling Larry, you can never know how very much your letter meant to me today. How really adorable of you to take time to write.’ In 1966, Leigh wrote to Plowright after she had given birth to her third child with Olivier. In response Olivier told Leigh not to correspond with his wife again, saying: ‘You must not I’m afraid expect an answer. She is too desperately ill to think of turning her hand to letter writing’ On May 28, 1967, Olivier penned his last letter to Leigh – five weeks before her death. It ended simply: ‘Sincerest love darling, your Larry.’","Previously unpublished letters reveal intense passion during affair .

"Jailed: Zaher Somani (pictured), 58, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after admitting tax evasion and fraud . A disgraced former magistrate who lived a life of luxury on the proceeds of tax fraud and money laundering has been jailed for more than three years. Zaher Somani, 58, built up a huge property portfolio, sent his children to private schools, was a regular at casinos and lived in a £300,000 house in an upmarket village. But HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) discovered Somani, who also ran a taxi firm, was pocketing hundreds of thousands of pounds by lying to officials about his true income. Between 2004 and 2011 Somani, who was serving as a Justice of the Peace at Loughborough Magistrates' Court at the time, fiddled self-assessment tax returns to pocket around £250,000. He was jailed for three-and-a-half years yesterday at Nottingham Crown Court after admitting tax evasion and fraud at the same court in October. Four co-conspirators, including his wife, appeared alongside him and were all given suspended prison sentences. The court heard Somani, of Quorn, Leicstershire, committed the offences while he was the owner of two Loughborough taxi companies, A1 and Charnwood Taxis, which operated 30 private hire vehicles. Family members helped hide his firms' earnings by using bank accounts and assets in Jersey, Canada, India, Turkey and Morocco, the court heard. Somani's wife Ashraf, 43, brother Pyarali, 61, sister-in-law Shabina, 50, and officer manager Darren Green, 44, were also sentenced for their part in the conspiracy. Judge James Sampson said: 'Zaher Somani lied to the bitter end and has been shamed and disgraced. 'The offending spanned many years while sitting as a magistrate, pretending to be a man of integrity and honesty. The hypocrisy could not have been greater.' Stuart Taylor, assistant director of criminal investigation at HMRC, said: 'Zaher Somani was a serving magistrate at the time of these offences, a man supposed to uphold the law.

'This man and his family lived well beyond their legitimate means, until HMRC uncovered their extensive tax evasion, associated money laundering and benefit fraud. 'Somani and his family failed to pay their full taxes, at the expense of honest taxpayers.' Zaher's wife, Ashraf Somani, 44, of Quorn, was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work. Along with her husband, she admitted tax evasion totalling £250,000 for self-assessment income tax fraud, unpaid VAT and tax credits fraud. Zaher's brother, Pyarali Somani, 61, of Loughborough, worked as a taxi driver for both companies. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work. He admitted self-assessment income tax fraud and tax credits fraud totalling £60,000. Pyarali's wife, Shabina Somani, 51, of Loughborough, was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for 18 months. She was ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work. She admitted tax credits fraud jointly with her husband totalling £16,049. Taxi driver Darren Green, 43, of Leicester, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and given a nine-month supervision order.

"One of the men who helped shape Twitter has claimed a technology revolution means that traditional relationships will soon be a thing of the past. Chris Messina, who coined the now-ubiquitous Twitter hashtag, helping it achieve enormous popularity, has said the world has changed so much people no longer need a single partner. Messina, who used to work for Google, said that the increasing wealth of the Western world means people no longer need partners to meet their basic needs and care for offspring. Scroll down for video . Theory: Chris Messina, pictured above, set out how he thinks technology will change relationships in a blog . Writing in a blog post for CNN Money, he then argues that internet phenomena like dating websites and Tinder-like hookup apps mean that many people can find a ready supply of partners. Messina says he lives out his theory with his partner, who whom he has a 'committed' relationship - but one in which both people are free to see others. He wrote: 'We're committed to each other, but have a porous boundary around our relationship, meaning we've agreed that it's OK for either of us to express romantic feelings toward other people or to be physically intimate with other people, so long as we're honest and transparent about our intentions with one another. Path to non-monogamy? Messina said hookup apps, like Tinder, above, could change social norms . 'These things don't diminish the integrity of our relationship. Rather, they deepen our understanding of each other's wants and desires, and give us the space to grow independently, without growing apart.' Messina termed the catalyst for the predicted social change Big Dating - and said it could be as fundamental as the invention of the computer. According to the tech guru, the constant connections and the rise of mass-use apps like Snapchat, where you post to large audiences rather than individuals, feed in to the idea of having multiple partners. He wrote: 'Big Dating unbundles monogamy and sex. It offers to maximize episodes of intimacy while minimizing the risk of rejection or FOMO [fear of missing out]. 'Today's most interesting apps (Snapchat, Secret, et al) are designed to support Big Dating, offering discreet, asynchronous, anonymish, non-exclusive communications. 'Multiplied against algorithms that optimize the pool of potential partners for connection (requiring no more than swipe left, swipe left, swipe right to operate), romantic partners are now more fungible [interchangeable] than ever.' Messina, an early adopter of Twitter, though not an employee, made his contribution to social media history by suggesting users type a # symbol before key terms to organize posts. The trend took off, providing an easy way for users to make sense of sometimes-chaotic feeds and find posts they were interested in, and quickly became part of the internet's vernacular.","Chris Messina, who came up with Twitter feature, said traditional models for relationships are obsolete .

"A new shark safety app will help swimmers know when it's safe to go back in the water. The SharkSmart app, launched on Saturday by the NSW government, provides basic information on shark species and how to identify and avoid them across the state. Tips include keeping out of the water during twilight or darkness, avoiding areas popular with diving seabirds and don't rely on dolphins to indicate the absence of sharks as they often feed together. Scroll down for video . The SharkSmart app is designed to help swimmers and surgfers know when it's safe to go back in the water . The app also includes two different maps pinpointing the specific beaches that have shark nets and swimming enclosures that offer swimmers a safer environment. 'There are no 100 per cent guarantees when entering the ocean,' Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson said. 'But the NSW government will continue doing all it can to reduce the risk for swimmers.' The launch comes after shocking underwater footage revealed many of the nets which partially cover NSW beaches but reportedly 'have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through'. Twisted, tangled and tattered nets could soon be replaced with a new shark detecting system across NSW . Large holes were discovered in many of the shark nets, which many believe protect them from sharks . A Shortfin Mako Shark was found trapped in the nets during a report by Channel Seven . The state government has promised $100,000 to trial shark-detecting sonar technology that will alert lifesavers each time a shark swims close by if the coalition wins the state election. The sonar technology will initially undergo a trial at an aquarium, where it will need to be assessed how well the program differentiates between a shark and a dolphin or whale. NSW goes to the polls in March and when it gets the all clear, it will be rolled out at popular beaches across the state. Other shark-proof products that have been released, include: shark wristbands, anti-shark wetsuits, shark shields, ankle-worn devices and a variety of sonar technologies. The latest band designed to prevent shark attacks on surfers and swimmers, Sharkbanz uses electromagnetic currents to deter sharks from an area. The Elude wetsuit (pictured) with its unusual design of jagged blue shapes, conceals divers from sharks by exploiting the predator's colour blindness . A new device called Sharkbanz recently in Australia, aiming to make the ocean a safer place for swimmers . Shark Shields sends electronic pulses from the device, which causes the shark to experience muscle spasms . The band, which was launched in Australia early this month, is about the size of a watch and has been tested on nearly a dozen species of sharks and aims to ensure humans and sharks can enjoy the ocean together without danger. In 2013, Australian scientists developed a pair of anti-shark wetsuits that make divers appear invisible by camouflaging their bodies in the sea. The blue pattern of the Elude suit aims to trick sharks into thinking surfers are poisonous and the colour can't be seen by the sharks because fishes are colour blind. While the Shark Shield consists of two electrodes that emit a three dimensional electronic field that surrounds the swimmer. When a shark swims nearby, the strong electronic pulses and releases from the device, which causes the shark to experience muscle spasms. Bondi Beach was the first to trial the 'Clever Bouy' which uses sonar technology to detect shark-shaped objects in coastal areas. When detected, the bouys send signal to the lifeguards.

Beachgoers were forced to evacuate following the sighting of a shark along the coastline of NSW on January 10, prompting the closure of all six Newcastle beaches for a record of 10 consecutive days. Several other sharks, including tiger sharks feeding on dolphins were seen along the coast but authorities have reopened the beaches after jetski patrols found no sign of the sea creatures. Hundreds of swimmers were forced to dash for the shores at Manly and North Steyne beaches on the Nothern Beaches of Sydney after a shark was spotted in the water last week. Just recently, a 17-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark after he went spearfishing off Mollymook beach on the South Coast of NSW.

"'Wriggling': Miliband as Labour Party Parliamentary Candidate for Doncaster North in 2005 . Ed Miliband has finally admitted that The Mail on Sunday’s account of his Mr Bean-type blunders when he lived with the family of a former Labour mayor is true. In a speech in Westminster last week, the Labour leader tried to make light of his habit of getting into scrapes. But his attempt to play down his ‘Calamity Ed’ image stalled as he made a series of eccentric and contentious remarks, including: . Miliband’s comments broke his silence after this newspaper’s serialisation of an explosive new book by Martin Winter, the former mayor of Doncaster. Winter claims Miliband’s ‘clueless and arrogant’ behaviour while he lived with his family in the run-up to the 2005 General Election made him lose faith in him. Miliband and his advisers initially dismissed the revelations as ‘ancient history’ – but it didn’t stop David Cameron, Boris Johnson and others taunting him. It led to the Labour leader responding on Thursday in a speech to more than 200 people, including many of Britain’s leading political journalists, at the Commons. He devoted a large chunk of his speech to this newspaper and Winter, admitted the reports were true, and even said he found the accounts of his bumbling behaviour ‘hilarious’. However, some members of the audience were mystified by Miliband’s attempt to laugh off the book’s extraordinary disclosures – such as the incident when he nearly killed himself when he accidentally set fire to Winter’s office and, inexplicably, bought the family a £25 Muslim prayer mat for Christmas to cover the hole burnt in the carpet. ‘They [the MoS] revealed how I gave Martin a Muslim prayer mat to cover up a singed carpet,’ said Miliband. ‘I just thought it was what we in the Jewish community call a nice piece of schmutter.’ There was laughter when he continued facetiously: ‘They [The MoS] got me banged to rights because this atheist Jew confesses tonight to being a secret Muslim. That was during my Islamic arsonist phase.’ But there were raised eyebrows when he compared his prayer mat gift to the attempt in 2011 by Right-wing US tycoon Donald Trump to smear Obama by suggesting he was a Muslim and not born in America. That incident caused outrage among Obama’s supporters. Miliband mused: ‘I was wondering, where have I heard that before about a political leader? I think Donald Trump is available to go in search of my birth certificate and prove where I was really born.’ Martin Winter (pictured left with Cherie Blair centre), said Mr Miliband told local councillor Nora Troops (far right) 'Nice carp you've got there', after looking at pictures of her fishing trophies . Miliband confirmed Winter’s account, reported by The Mail on Sunday, of how he nearly missed a meeting with Gordon Brown when he locked himself into his own house. He recalled: ‘Eventually – and this is true – I escaped through a window and therefore made history as the first person to make a break for freedom to get closer to Gordon Brown.’ He tried to ridicule one of Winter’s most damaging revelations, that Miliband told him in October 2007 – a year before the UK financial crash – that the British economy was about to ‘fall off a cliff’, and that Labour had wanted to call an early election to cling to power before voters found out. ‘I am apparently Mystic Mili,’ said the Labour leader sarcastically. Mr Winter said last night: ‘Mr Miliband (pictured) can sneer all he likes. He cannot deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house.' ‘I kept the global financial crisis from everyone and revealed it to only one person – not the head of the World Bank, the IMF, or the governor of the Bank of England, but someone at the epicentre of global finance – the mayor of Doncaster.’ Mr Winter said last night: ‘Mr Miliband can sneer all he likes. He cannot deny saying he knew the economy was about to fall off a cliff because he said it in my house. ‘In mocking a local political ally he mocks all his supporters and his own town.’ Linking an emotional passage about his grandfather who died in a Nazi labour camp to the media’s role in the coming Election, Mr Miliband said ‘some tough stuff’ had been written about him in recent weeks. He added that ‘truth-telling’ was part of the job of the press – as had been ‘very ably demonstrated by The Mail on Sunday’. The killing of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists by Islamist terrorists in France underlined the need for a free press, he said. But he went on to argue that he and other politicians should be taken more seriously by the media. Journalists should ‘report on what [politicians] believe’ and not encourage ‘cynicism’ by suggesting they had ‘base motives’. Press and MPs alike were ‘custodians of politics and its reputation’. One observer said: ‘It was entertaining, moving and cringe-making all at the same time. ‘He wriggled about knowing the economy was falling off a cliff in 2007. He seemed to say “poke fun at politicians – but not me”. Winter has got under his skin.’ Ed Miliband was presented with a light-hearted list of his top ten calamities when he lived with Martin Winter. The ‘Top Ten Edisms’ – as the Winter family called it – were inspired by the Labour leader’s own description of incidents which occurred when he first became MP for Doncaster in 2005. They include: . In his book, Fallout, Mr Winter tells how he and his family got a unique insight into Miliband when he secured his selection as a Labour candidate. ‘We gave him the list of “Edisms” because he got involved in so many catastrophes when he lived here,’ Winter says. ‘It was like having Frank Spencer as a lodger. It was meant in good fun and Miliband joined in the laughter.’ THE 'EDISMS': . 1. ‘Things like that always happen around me.’ Winter says: ‘Miliband candidly admitted he had a reputation for getting into awkward spots – usually of his own making.’ 2. ‘No… I can’t smell burning.’ Winter: ‘This was inspired by the way we found him in a semi comatose state in the office in my garden, having set fire to the carpet. For a moment we thought he might be dead.’ 3. ‘Tyson, Tyson, get down! Oo it bit me!’ Winter: ‘When Ed visited retiring Doncaster MP Kevin Hughes to ask for his support, Kevin’s Staffordshire terrier, Tyler – Tyson as we called it – attacked him. It ripped his jacket and he had to wave his arm around to shake it off.’ 4. ‘Nice carp you’ve got there, Nora.’ Winter: ‘Ed asked local Labour councillor Nora Troops, a keen angler who had lots of photos of her with carp on the wall, to back him. I said, “What on earth did you say to her?” He said this.’ 5. ‘Hi guys – am I Blair or Cliff?’ Winter: ‘He didn’t like Tony Blair at all and took the mickey out of him by doing an impression – “Hi guys, who am I?” – and when you said “Blair,” he would say, “No, it’s Cliff”.’ Ed Miliband mocked Tony Blair (right) in an impersonation that made him sound like Cliff Richard (left) 6. ‘I do have cultural reference points, you know.’ Winter: ‘We tried to help him connect to ordinary people by getting him to have a flutter on the Grand National or have the occasional pint, but he didn’t get it, and doesn’t have interests or knowledge outside politics.’ 7. ‘John Prescott? A joke politician.’ Winter: ‘I have always rated John Prescott as someone who understands working-class people, but whenever his name was mentioned, Ed would scoff, “He’s just a joke politician”.’ 8. ‘Help! I’m locked in my house and I’m meeting Gordon in 20 minutes!’ Winter: ‘Ed had to be rescued by my partner because he couldn’t unlock his own front door when Gordon Brown visited.’ 9. ‘Has she really got 19 cats?’ Winter: ‘Ed had just been to visit a local Labour supporter and it was the first thing he said to me when he came back. It had us in stitches.’ 10. ‘Did he just call me Jim?’ Winter: ‘We initially gave Miliband the code name Jim to conceal the fact that I was backing him as mayor – but Miliband blurted it out by mistake when we were in the pub.’ The Winters also chose two songs for a farewell party for Miliband – The Trammps’s Disco Inferno, with the lyrics ‘Burn baby burn’, and Smooth Operator by Sade. Winter: ‘He was always telling us what a smooth operator he was – sadly he was too busy for the party to take place. He was in such a hurry to leave that he left some possessions behind.’","Ed Miliband has finally admitted the MoS account of his blunders is true .

"Amal Clooney could find herself with one less high profile case to fight after Greece's new culture minister revealed they were reconsidering how to win back the Elgin Marbles. Aristides Baltas revealed they were looking at the 'strategy' behind his country's attempts to get the 5th century BC statues returned - and were willing to 'tweak' it if necessary. What this means for Mrs Clooney and the legal team from London chambers Doughty Street, who have been advising the Greek government on possible action in the international court to force the British Museum to hand over the marbles, is not yet known. Scroll down for video . Amal Clooney is part of a high-profile team of lawyers who have been advising the Greek government on possibility of international court action to force the British Museum to return the Elgin Marbles . The Greek government began working with Doughty Street Chambers on the return of the Elgin Marbles, which have been at the British Museum for almost 200 years, last year . But new culture minister Aristides Baltas, of the left wing Syriza party, which came into power last Sunday, has said while the campaign will continue, the strategy may be tweaked. Pictured: Greeks celebrating after the election result . Mr Baltas was quoted in The Times as saying: 'Our campaign will continue, but the strategy and how we go about that may be tweaked, if required. 'We'll be looking over these details in the coming weeks and if we see a need to alter them, we will.' His comment comes as Greece's new left-wing government - which has pledged to ditch austerity and negotiate a better deal for the country - looks at other ways to save money. Syriza were elected to lead the country last Sunday. It is thought the chambers are charging hefty fees, something which has raised eyebrows in the cash-strapped country. However, Mrs Clooney's attachment to the case brings with it a high profile. Mrs Clooney and her husband George (pictured together at the Golden Globes) have been vocal supporters of Greece's attempts to get the statues back . Speaking in October, Mrs Clooney said it was time the British Government recognised Greece's just cause and return them . Some of the Elgin Marbles, pictured here at the British Museum, have been lent to a museum in St Petersberg . She and her husband, the actor and director George, have both spoken passionately on the subject. Mrs Clooney said in October: ‘The Greek government has just cause and it’s time for the British Museum to recognise that and return them to Greece. The injustice has persisted for too long. ‘The Greek government has the right to ask for the return of the marbles, 200 years after they were taken to the United Kingdom.’ MailOnline has contacted Doughty Street for a comment.","Amal Clooney is part of high-profile team advising Greeks on Elgin Marbles .

'It's something I've been planning on doing for a while for my own personal reasons,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I did my research when deciding where to go and chose The Cosmetic Institute because of their excellent reputation, as well as their affordability. I also looked at going overseas but chose to stay here in Australia, and thank God I did.' When Ms Rickhuss woke up at Westmead Hospital confused, she says her plastic surgeon Dr Niro Sivathasan was there to explain what had happened. 'Dr Niro was with me all the way and came and visited me in the hospital,' she said. 'The personal care and attention I have received from Dr Niro, as well as the fact that he literally saved my life, has proved that I made the right choice when selecting him as my surgeon. I could not be more grateful.' Ms Rickhuss also reached out to the clinic on Facebook and wrote: 'The Cosmetic Institute and Dr Niro saved my life. Me and my boobs are going to be fine.'

"A new TV experiment will test the survival skills of a group of volunteers by tossing them back into the Stone Age where they must make fire, forage and hunt while wearing only animal skins. The eclectic band of men and women, who include a former male model, a farmer and a nightclub owner, will be left in a remote Bulgarian forest for five weeks to battle nature and the elements. The groundbreaking reality TV show, called 10,000 BC, starts on Channel 5 next week and will treat viewers to plenty of tears and tantrums as the disparate bunch struggle to acclimatise to a Stone Age existence. Scroll down for video . Volunteers: The Harding family, five of the 20 participants of Channel 5's new reality TV show 10,000 BC . Some of the volunteers, whose ages range from 20 to 65, arrived in high spirits while texting friends on smartpones - and another turned up in high heels looking immaculate from head to toe. But any misconceptions they had about their five weeks of fame were soon laid to rest when the group was presented with a freshly slaughtered deer. The kill was designed to give the volunteers a running start - but for vegetarian Josie O'Rourke, 48, from East Sussex, who's there with her 23-year-old daughter, Jodie, the sight is repulsive. For the rest of the 20 though, hunger rather than eating preferences becomes the real issue and as starvation sets in, splinters and cracks appear in the group - creating scenes which viewers will no doubt relish. Harsh conditions: The contestants must survive in Stone Age conditions and will have to make fire, forage and hunt while wearing only animal skins . Struggle: Just two days into the five week experiment, two members of the tribe give up because of heat exhaustion and homesickness . The programme was filmed over two months last autumn in a large but remote forested region of Bulgaria - prone to extreme temperatures and inhabited by dangerous wild boars. By 10,000 BC, humans had a range of technologies to aid them in their exploitation of the environment, most importantly the ability to make fire. The hunter-gatherer people of 10,000 BC used stone, wood, bone and antlers for their weapons and implements. Some groups practiced primitive mining, or more strictly quarrying, for flint, digging shallow pits and trenches. People wore clothing made from animal skins, which they sewed together using intricately-crafted bone needles. They had mastered the use of cords and threads fashioned from plant materials to aid them in making their clothes as well as for making baskets. Their weaponry included spears, bows and arrows, and harpoons. People rarely lived past 30. Source: www.timemaps.com . For their first two days in the wildnerness the participants are given tips by survival expert Klint Janulis, before being left to fend for themselves. Before he leaves, two of the group have already surrendered to heat exhaustion and homesickness - less than than 48 hours after their adventure began. 'As well as being about survival this is a social experiment,' says Janulis. 'We will discover how they work together and make decisions. Some of them arrived thinking it was a camping trip.' The programme attempts to recreate the harsh existence of Stone Age men and women as much as possible. During this period in human history, hunter-gatherers were required to roam miles to find food and use flints tools. The TV show does allow some modern necessities such as sturdy hiking boots but the group still struggles to adapt - with the lighting of a fire presenting the biggest issue in episode one. A few hours later and the group have still not managed it - and as the light begins to fade, the rain sets in and dampens spirits even more. Experiment: Contestants Terry Perry and Kym Hall sit around a campfire during reality show 10,000 BC . Other contestants: Vegetarian mother and daughter Josie and Jodie O'Rourke (L) and Tom Reader reflecting in his hut (R) The participants must live in basic-looking huts with no soap or cleaning products - and many admit to possessing no practical skills that will help them to survive over the five weeks. 'I was born in the 1970s but that was 10,000 years too late,' says astute 41-year-old lorry driver Paul Barnes, from Bristol. As the show goes on, cliques develop, a leader is chosen and the group struggle to cope with daytime heat, mosquitoes and lack of hygiene. Disputes break out as some members of the tribe fail to pull their weight and in one moment of desperate hunger, the discarded maggot-ridden remains of the earlier deer are dusted down and eaten. Cracks: Not long after they begin the show, the tribe begins to splinter.

Pictured, participants Kym Hall (L) and Kam Khaira (R) Summarising the programme on their website, Channel 5 say: 'These men and women will be going back to basics – big time. They'll be hunting animals, foraging for food, subsisting on whatever they can scour from their environment. 'They'll be cold, hungry, scared and pushed to the limits of endurance. They'll have no one but themselves and each other to help get them through. 'How will they fare?

"A 'backroom butcher' who used a five-kilo sledgehammer to 'stun' piglets before slaughtering the animals and then trying to sell them to pub goers has walked free from court. Stefan Holub, 38, smashed in piglets skulls in a shed next to The Crewe Arms Hotel, where he worked previously as a handyman in Madeley Heath, on the Cheshire-Staffordshire border. But Holub's sideline was brought to an end when a concerned resident alerted the authorities to the fact animals were being killed on the premises. Stefan Holub, 38, admitted failing to prevent suffering and ensure the welfare of the pigs, which he killed in a shed next to The Crewe Arms Hotel . The handyman then sold the meat to customers at the pub in Madeley Heath (pictured) When they raided the pub  in October 2013, officers from Staffordshire County Council and Newcastle Borough Council discovered three halves of two piglets in the kitchens, wrapped in clingfilm. Prosecutor Lucy Daniels told North Staffordshire Magistrates Court: 'The piglets were completely skinned and gutted. 'The head chef in the kitchen said half of a piglet carcass had been offered for sale at the pub, but no one had purchased it that day and it had been disposed of.' The court heard how Holub approached one of the animal health officers during the raid and admitted killing pigs in the shed. Ms Daniels said the piglets had come in a wooden box, adding: 'Before killing them, he used a sledgehammer to stun them and then hung them in the shed.' The animal health team consulted a senior vet from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), who examined photos of the evidence. He estimated the sledgehammer used by Holub, of Madely, weighed around five kilos. Holub - who admitted the offence - had used a five kilo sledgehammer to 'stun' the piglets before killing them . Ms Daniels told the court: 'Attempting to stun a small piglet with a sledgehammer, without the proper means of restraining the animal, is likely to cause the animal suffering. 'A misplaced blow could also cause serious injuries without stunning.' Several samples were later taken and sent for analysis. They included black coarse hair and a red substance which turned out to be blood containing pig DNA. Holub - who had experience of killing animals as he had previously worked in slaughterhouses in France and Switzerland - admitted failing to prevent unnecessary suffering to two piglets and failing to ensure their welfare on Thursday. He was sentenced to six weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months, and was also ordered to pay £700 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Trevor Massey, chairman of the bench, told him: 'We are quite horrified by your actions. 'In all my time as a magistrate, I've not come across anything like this before. 'There were two incidents of ill-treatment, the use of a weapon - a sledgehammer - and two animals affected.'","Stefan Holub used sledgehammer to 'stun' pigs before slaughtering them .

"A man indicted for the murder of his second wife and under investigation for the suspicious death of his first in 'glaringly similar' circumstances may have plotted to kill a third woman – his sister-in-law – according to newly submitted court documents. Harold Henthorn was indicted for the murder of his second wife, Toni, 50, last November. The indictment was the result of a two-year investigation during which the FBI eavesdropped on the Colorado widower's telephone conversations, combed through his finances, scrutinized his employment history and concluded that the 'freak' hiking accident that claimed the mother-of-one's life was murder. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet Henthorn plunged 140 feet to her death while on a remote hike with Henthorn who was the only witness to her death. Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012 . Twenty years earlier Henthorn was the only witness to the 'freak accident' that killed first wife, Lynn Rishell. She was crushed under the front of his Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark. In both cases Henthorn stood to benefit from substantial life insurance policies taken out on the women in his name. Now new court documents have revealed that the prosecution will submit 'evidence that Harold Henthorn killed his first wife and collected life insurance on her to establish intent, motive, planning, preparation and lack of accident' in the death of his second. And, shockingly, the court papers have revealed that, in 2009, Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his sister-in-law, Grace Rishell, who was married to his first wife's brother. Grace Rishell was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn taking out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to the prosecution, 'The evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.' The documents reveal that Rishell had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. But unbeknownst to Grace Rishell, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well.' Henthorn made payments on the policy until December 2012 and instead of listing her daughter as brothers as beneficiaries, the policy listed only Henthorn. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in Rishell. Family: Dr Henthorn, a skilled ophthalmologist, left behind a seven-year-old daughter when she died in 2012 . Mystery: Harold Henthorn told authorities his wife slipped on a steep mountainside while taking a photo . Henthorn, who was arrested on November 6 when FBI swooped on the 59-year-old returning home after dropping his daughter, Hayley, 9, at school, was was denied bail by US District Judge Kathleen Latoyfa. Ms Latoyfa described him as a 'danger' and noted, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second,' and pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.' Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire . Though Henthorn claimed to work as a fundraiser for a charity the economic crime auditor for the US Attorney found no evidence that the geology graduate from Virginia had any earnings other than some in 1993, 1999 and 2000. The only job he appears to have had was one briefly held in the petroleum industry – the job that saw him and his then new bride, Lynn Rishell, move from their hometown of Harrington, Virginia, across the country to Colorado. Now in documents that provide further damning detail of the deaths of both Toni Bertolet Henthorn and Lynn Rishell Henthorn the prosecution has highlighted the similarities between both women's passing. Both deaths, the documents state, 'involved bizarre 'accidents.' Both left Henthorn with significant insurance benefits. He is beneficiary or trustee on three policies on Toni, totaling around $4.5million and received a $500,000 pay out on the death of his first wife. Both occurred in remote locations. Both times Henthorn was the lone witness. Both deaths occurred after about 12 years of marriage. Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths. According to the documents the man who met his second wife on a Christian dating website, even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy. In the case of his second wife, an incident which happened just two years after she almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Harold had thrown off their deck is disclosed in the documents. After that incident, Harold joked to friends: 'I was trying to kill my wife.' In both situations, the documents continue, the women were doing atypical things when they died. Lynn Henthorn was 'fastidious in dress and a cautious women who would not ordinarily crawl under a jacked-up car to search for lug nuts while wearing a nice sweater, especially after exploratory surgery only two weeks earlier.' Scene: The couple were on an anniversary hike - they had been married 12 years - on Deer Mountain in Rocky Mountains National Park on September 29, 2012 when Dr Henthorn fell to her death . Toni Henthorn 'was not likely to scramble down a rocky face on bad knees to look over a cliff in the midst of a tough hike at elevation.' Investigators have also established that Henthorn 'extensively scouted' the fatal hike. Contrary to what he told law enforcement he made nine different trips to the area around Rocky Mountain Park that summer. And the fortnight before their anniversary – the date of her death – Henthorn had hiked six trails to 'find the perfect one for the trip.' Damningly a map found in Henthorn's car suggested that the detours Henthorn claimed to have preceded his wife's fall were not, as he stated spontaneous: it marked the spot near where Toni fell with a pink X. In both situations Harold was eager to have the bodies quickly cremated despite family requests against it. And, disturbingly, Harold spread both women's ashes on the same mountain near Ouray, Colorado. Henthorn has not been indicted for the murder of his first wife and has entered a not guilty plea on the murder of his second. The trial date is set for May 4 – 15.","Harold Henthorn is being charged with the murder of his wife Toni who he claims fell to her death in Rocky Mountain Park .

"Mary Cheney finds it hypocritical that drag queens can impersonate women but white people cannot 'put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African-Americans'. The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney took to Facebook to ask: 'Shouldn't both be ok or neither? Why does society treat these activities so differently?' She wrote in a private post seen by CNN: 'Why is it socially acceptable -- as a form of entertainment -- for men to put on dresses, make up and high heels and act out every offensive stereotype of women (bitchy, catty, dumb, slutty, etc.) -- but it is not socially acceptable -- as a form of entertainment -- for a white person to put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African Americans?' Scroll down for video . Sparked outrage: Mary Cheney is under fire after posting this comment on Facebook . Cheney, pictured with her father the former Vice President Dick Cheney (right), said 'shouldn't both be ok?' According to CNN, Cheney made clear that her words referred to men in drag, not transgender people. The comment was said to be prompted by a trailer for the upcoming season 7 of RuPaul's Drag Race, which debuts on March 2. Lashing out at the 45-year-old's comments, the show's official Twitter account tweeted: 'Oh no she better don't', and shared a video titled 'a Message for Mary Cheney'. The video takes Cheney through a history of drag, and explains that 'the most important thing of all, drag never ever takes itself too seriously'. Response video: RuPaul, host of talent show RuPaul's Drag Race, made a video for Mary Cheney . A lesson: The video takes Cheney through a short history of drag saying 'it doesn't take itself too seriously!' On the show's website, a statement response to Cheney read: 'Y’know we don’t have a clear-cut answer—and maybe there isn’t one. All we know is what a queen told us once: “Drag queens don’t make fun of women, they make fun of society’s expectations of women.

"Japanese officials says efforts to free a captive journalist from Islamic State extremists have reached a 'state of deadlock'. The fate of veteran war reporter Kenji Goto has been linked to that of another hostage, Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Muath Kaseasbeh, with the extremists threatening to kill both of them. Jordan and Japan are reportedly conducting indirect negotiations with the militants who control a third of both Iraq and Syria. Scroll down for video . Japanese journalist Kenji Goto (left) and Jordanian pilot Maaz al-Kassasbeh (right) are being held captive by the Islamic State in Syria . Jordan has demanded evidence that the pilot, who crashed in Syria on December 24, is still alive before freeing would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi (pictured), who is on death row . A threat by the militants to kill the pilot at sunset on Thursday - unless an al-Qaeda prisoner was released by Jordan - has passed without word on the fate of the two hostages. Japan's deputy foreign minister, Yasuhide Nakayama, told journalists in Amman last night that 'the situation is in a state of deadlock.' He said: 'Staying vigilant, we will continue analysing and examining information as the government is making concerted efforts together.' Meanwhile, it has been reported that the family Kassasbeh has received no word on his fate since the threat to kill him earlier this week. ISIS had vowed to kill Kassasbeh by sunset on Thursday unless Amman hands over an Iraqi female jihadist in return for Goto. Jordan has demanded evidence that the pilot, who crashed in Syria on December 24, is still alive before freeing would-be suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, who is on death row. The fate of veteran war reporter Kenji Goto (pictured) has been linked to that of another hostage, Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Muath Kaseasbeh, with the extremists threatening to kill both of them . A banner with a picture of Jordanian pilot, Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh, who is held by the Islamic State group militants, is  raised by workers near a tent prepared for receiving supporters, in Amman, Jordan . Jordan has offered to free Rishawi, who was convicted for her part in triple-hotel bombings in Amman in 2005 that killed 60 people, if ISIS releases the pilot. Amman has been under heavy pressure from Tokyo -- a major aid donor -- to save Goto, as well as calls from Jordanians to bring Kassasbeh home. While ISIS threatened Kassasbeh's life, it was not clear from its latest message if the jihadist group was ready to free him as part of an exchange. ISIS had set the Thursday sunset deadline for Rishawi to be released at the Turkish border in return for Goto but there was no news of a swap. Japan, which plays no military part in the fight against ISIS, was thrust onto the front line last week when a video appeared in which Goto and Haruna Yukawa, a self-described contractor, were seen kneeling in the desert. A masked, knife-wielding militant said Tokyo had 72 hours to pay a $200million ransom if it wanted to spare their lives. When that deadline expired, new pictures appeared to show Yukawa had been beheaded, and a voice identifying itself as Goto demanded the release of Rishawi.","Officials say negotiations to release Kenji Goto are in state of deadlock .

"Hall of fame Quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers has no doubt in his mind that patriots quarterback Tom Brady is responsible for the Deflategate scandal. 'If I ever want a ball a certain way, I don’t do it myself. So, somebody did it for him,' said Montana on Thursday. 'But I don’t know why everybody is making a big deal out of trying to figure out who did it. It’s pretty simple.If it was done, it was done for a reason. There is only one guy that does it. Nobody else cares what the ball feels like,' he added. Pointing fingers: Hall of fame Quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 49ers has no doubt in his mind that patriots quarterback Tom Brady is responsible for the Deflategate scandal . The New England Patriots are accused of intentionally under-inflating the footballs they used in their AFC championship game win over the Indianapolis Colts, writes The Boston Globe. Reports say that 11 of the 12 balls the Patriots used were more than 2 pounds per square inch lighter than required by NFL rules. Both The Patriots and Tom Brady have adamantly denied the allegations saying they 'didn't touch the footballs.' Joe Montana said that just because Tom Brady may not have physically touched the footballs for him, someone else could have done it. 'The quarterbacks don’t touch the footballs,' Montana said. Ode to Montana: Tom Brady posted this snap of him wearing a 49ers Jersey back in 1983 along with the caption 'I've been preparing for Sunday since 1983! Ha' Accused of tampering: New England Patriots quarter back, Tom Brady, answers questions about the low pressure footballs during a press conference on January 22 . Montana's comments may have hit close to Home for Brady who posted a photo of himself to his Facebook page wearing a 49ers Jersey in 1983 in honor of Montana, his childhood hero. 'I've been preparing for Sunday since 1983! Ha,' said the caption along with the photograph. Though Montana thinks Tom Brady is responsible for deflating the balls, he didn't have all bad things to say about him. Montana said that Tom Brady falls in the 'greatest-ever-to-play' category. Montana also said that the ball inflation rule merely shouldn't exist. Montana joked that he and fellow Hall-of-Famer Troy Aikman have laughed about how they should have doctored their footballs. 'Troy and I are in the back talking going, ""Dang, we weren’t smart enough to think about air pressure,""' Montana said. 'Cause he couldn’t go in the rain he said, I go, ‘And neither could I.’ I said we should have thought about that earlier.'

"The husband of brain-dead woman whose right-to-die battle in Florida sparked national outrage has slammed then-Governor Jeb Bush as 'vindictive', 'untrustworthy' and 'a coward' Theresa Marie 'Terri' Schiavo lived in a vegetative state from 1990 to 2005 following a cardiac arrest as doctors kept her alive with feeding tubes. Throughout the 15-year battle, her husband Michael Schiavo said, Jeb Bush fought with the courts to prevent her euthanasia. Scroll down for video . 'Untrustworthy': Michael Schiavo (left) has not forgiven Jeb Bush (right) for trying to stop his brain-dead wife Terri Schiavo from being given the right to die . Battle: Theresa Marie 'Terri' Schiavo lived in a vegetative state from 1990 to 2005 following a cardiac arrest as doctors kept her alive with feeding tubes . 'It was a living hell and I blame him,' he told Politico. 'I wouldn't trust him in any type of political office.' Insisting that the 'thinking part' of his wife's brain no longer functioned, Michael Schiavo - and numerous physicians - called on the state, and the federal government, to let her die. However, her Catholic parents, and their privately hired physicians, disputed the diagnoses and adamantly opposed euthanasia. In April 2001, a court ordered for the tube to be removed - but it was inserted days later following an appeal. In February 2005, a Pinellas County judge ordered for the tube to be removed - prompting President George W Bush to sign legislation designed to prevent the order. However, the court upheld its ruling. On March 18 the tube was finally removed. On March 31, 2005, Terri Schiavo died. Died: On March 18 the tube was finally removed. On March 31, 2005, Terri Schiavo died . It has since emerged that Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, wrote to prosecutor Bernie McCabe following Schiavo's death, to say: 'I urge you to take a fresh look at this case without any preconceptions as to the outcome.' He called on McCabe to check how long it took Michael Schiavo to call 911 after his wife's initial fall. However, McCabe found no evidence of criminality. Ten years later, as Jeb Bush reveals plans to potentially succeed his father and brother in the Oval Office, Schiavo is livid. He lambasts the younger Bush for siding with his wife's parents, pushing executive power to its limits, and never getting in touch following the debaucle. He told Politico: 'I've had politicians come to my home and apologize to me for what they did to me... But I never heard from Jeb.' He says he relishes the prospect of meeting Bush if he decides to attempt a rapprochement during his 2016 campaign. 'Bring it on,' Schiavo said. 'Come visit me. I'm asking you. Almost 10 years later and I still haven't heard from you. 'Was he afraid to meet with me? To see me? Why? That's what burns me. You got so much to say—but where are you? You lost against this little ordinary man from Philadelphia. You lost. And then to continue on? Unspeakable. 'Why? Give me an answer. Why? Why? What was Terri Schiavo to you? Why? Tell me why. Why do you think you had the right to be involved? Why would you put me and my family through hell? And what did you gain from that? And after you lost, why did you pursue it? What did you gain from that? 'He made life, for a lot of people—the nursing home people, the local police, lawyers—he made everybody miserable.' 'It was appalling,' Jon Eisenberg, one of Michael Schiavo's attorneys and the author of The Right vs The Right To Die, told Politico. 'And I think it's important for people to understand what Jeb Bush is willing to do. It's important for people to know who Jeb Bush is, and the Terri Schiavo case tells us a great deal about who Jeb Bush is.'","Terri Schiavo was left brain-dead for 15 years after cardiac arrest in 1990 .
Husband Michael called for her to be allowed to die, her Catholic parents opposed him - and Republican government supported the parents .
Physicians' tests found 'thinking part' of Schiavo's brain was dead but her parents' private doctors opposed diagnoses, Jeb Bush supported them .
In 2001 a court ruled to remove the tube, but was overruled .
After she died in 2005, Jeb Bush called on prosecutor to investigate Michael Schiavo for criminality .

"Close: Prince Charles and butler Michael Fawcett. People quoted in the book report 'bruising experiences' with Fawcett . Rampant feuding, squabbling and backstabbing among Prince Charles’s courtiers has seen the heir’s household nicknamed Wolf Hall. Biographer Catherine Mayer said a ‘former householder’ made the comparison to ‘the treacherous and opportunistic world depicted by Hilary Mantel in her fictionalised account of the rise of Thomas Cromwell under Henry VIII’. The author claims that Clarence House has ‘glaring systemic weaknesses’ and is riven by intense rivalries between several staff factions. ‘It is hard to know who can be trusted, and criticism can send the prince into despair,’ she adds. On one occasion, the divisions reportedly led to the collapse of a multi-million-pound deal to base all of Charles’s charities in one site. More than £100,000 was said to have been wasted on the deal. One businessman who helped the household to organise an event said: ‘No company would be expected to run along these lines. There was a lot of backstabbing.’ An insider added: ‘There are certain people who, because they’re pretty cunning in the dark arts but loyal and able and are good in their timing, also involve themselves in the dark arts of undermining other people. I think [the prince] hasn’t always been best served by this.’ Others quoted in the book recount ‘bruising experiences’ with Michael Fawcett, Charles’s former personal assistant who was rumoured to squeeze the prince’s toothpaste for him. Mr Fawcett, who remains a close adviser despite having resigned his post in 2003, is described as one of the most talented individuals in the household, praised for his ‘gimlet eye for detail’. Miss Mayer also describes how he mixes easily with ‘Bond villains’ – the wealthy donors entertained by the prince. She suggests, however, that Charles ‘hasn’t always chosen his sages wisely’, and has instead been surrounded by by those who tell him what he wants to hear. ‘That factor, combined with his native insecurity, means he doesn’t always believe that he’s earned the praise that comes his way, while criticism has the power to cast him into despair.’ The heir is said to be called ‘The Boss’ by his staff – but also apparently identifies with Blackadder’s bumbling Baldrick.

"A woman hailed as a leading architect of anti-stalking legislation has reported her former campaign partner to the police – for alleged stalking. Laura Richards, 39, the civilian former head of Scotland Yard's controversial Homicide Prevention Unit, has made the astonishing allegations against Harry Fletcher, 68. The pair worked together advising MPs and senior police officers on the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act, which specifically outlawed stalking. Scroll down for video . Laura Richards, 39, (pictured) the civilian former head of Scotland Yard's controversial Homicide Prevention Unit, has made the astonishing allegations against Harry Fletcher, 68 . Ms Richards was involved in the charity Protection Against Stalking (PAS) and they both became fellow directors of a not-for-profit company called Paladin, which advises victims. Police have already interviewed Mr Fletcher, a former official of probation officers' union Napo, who is married with children. He strongly denies the allegations. Friends of his claim that Ms Richards – who calls herself a 'criminal behavioural analyst' – is deploying some of the key weapons in the stalker's armoury of smear, innuendo and character assassination. Ms Richards told The Mail on Sunday that Mr Fletcher was 'obsessed' with her and stalked her when she spurned his advances. She said: 'He has rummaged through every part of my life, my friends, my relationships, my work colleagues. I feel really violated. 'He made out that we were in an intimate relationship and told people he was worried about my mental health. 'He would call me all the time, sometimes 50 times a day, and would never leave a message, always keep ringing until I picked up. 'It's ironic we have both achieved domestic violence law reform on coercive control, the very thing that he's been doing to me through his stalking behaviour, and that's been the problem. I've had sleepless nights. It's changed me. I shall never be the person I was.' Mr Fletcher, who voluntarily attended Brixton Police Station in South London with his solicitor in November to be interviewed about the complaint, said last night: 'I completely and utterly deny these allegations and have fully co-operated with the police. I look forward to their inquiry reaching its conclusion.' His supporters say Ms Richards's allegations are groundless and stem from professional jealousy over his standing in the field of stalking and domestic violence legislation. Police have already interviewed Mr Fletcher, a former official of probation officers' union Napo, who is married with children. He strongly denies the allegations . Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd, who was the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on stalking and worked with Ms Richards on legislation, said: 'I found her difficult to work with. She was making some rather strange allegations against Harry. I found her accusations to be utterly incredible.' Senior forensic psychiatrist Dr David James, who was on the board of PAS, described Ms Richards as 'reacting extravagantly when crossed'. He added: 'I resigned from the board of PAS because I feared that any form of association with her would be harmful to my professional reputation. 'I was aware she has made complaints of harassment against others in the past.' Mr Fletcher is now a director of Digital-Trust, which advises on cyber stalking. Fellow director Jennifer Perry said: 'Harry has been given advice and emotional support as a stalking victim himself. Spreading malicious allegations about someone is one of the stalker's weapons.' Ms Richards led the Homicide Prevention Unit, which aimed to draw up a list of the most high-profile 'future offenders' based on past records and psychological profiling. In 2006 she said: 'It is trying to pick up Ian Huntley before he goes out and commits that murder.' A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'An allegation of harassment has been made by a 38-year-old woman. [Ms Richards was 38 at the time of her complaint]. A man has been interviewed under caution and the police investigation continues.'","Laura Richards made allegations against former campaign partner to police .
