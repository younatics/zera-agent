"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Beautiful parts of the county are being 'gutted' by second home owners pricing young families out of the area, Nick Clegg claimed today. Mr Clegg said parts of the Lake District and the South West were being 'filleted' by wealthy families who were driving up house prices by snapping up second homes in the countryside. The Deputy Prime Minister said he was looking at measures to cap the number of holiday homes that are blamed for destroying picturesque towns and villages. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning said holiday home owners had 'gutted' beautiful areas of the country like Cornwall and the Lake District . Lib Dem MPs have led calls to limit the number of second homes in an area or force families to get planning permission to turn a permanent home into a holiday getaway. There have also been calls to hike council tax on second homes. The Coalition has so far only given councils the power to remove the council tax discount on second homes, which ranged from 10 per cent to 50 per cent. At a press conference this morning - called to unveil a manifesto promise to ring-fence education funding 'from cradle to college' - Mr Clegg was asked whether there would be an election pledge on tackle the blight of holiday homes. The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'It’s a huge problem in parts of the South West and the Lake District. 'And we’ll constantly look at we can make sure, yes, people who want to come and invest in the community and create a holiday home are not barred from doing so, but that we don’t have this problem of the whole community being filleted. Gutted. 'With no prospect of youngsters finding a home they can call their own. One of the ways out of this, difficult though it is in beautiful parts of the country, is to build more homes on the scale we need.' Villages like Wells next the Sea in Norfolk are luring second-home buyers looking to escape the city. But this can drive up property prices, forcing local families out . Nick Clegg spends at least one holiday a year in his wife's family home in the tiny Spanish village of Olmedo, near Valladolid. He also has a share in his family's 20 room ski chalet in Switzerland's Klosters ski resort - the Alpine playground of the Royals. The traditionally-designed lakeside villa – built by Mr Clegg’s Dutch grandfather - is worth an estimated £7million. The Deputy PM also has use of a grace and favour country house, which is usually reserved for the Foreign Secretary, near Sevenoaks in Kent. Chevening was built in the 17th Century and has 115 rooms to entertain guests at the taxpayers expense. On top of these options Mr Clegg owns a £1.5million townhouse in South West London - just a stone's throw from the Thames - and rents a two-bedroom flat in Sheffield. The Lib Dem leader also announced the party will fight the next general election on a promise to protect education spending from children’s earliest years to the time they go to college. Mr Clegg said that extending the existing 'ring fence' on schools spending to cover the whole of the education budget from the ages of two to 19 would cost an additional £10 billion a year, rising annually with inflation. 'Liberal Democrats will protect the full education budget, from the cradle to the college,' Mr Clegg told the Westminster news conference. 'Money invested in our children is the best investment of all because education can really transform lives. We believe education should be properly funded because education is the very core of a liberal society.' Mr Clegg would not be drawn on whether it would be a 'die-in-the-ditch' commitment for the Lib Dems in any future coalition talks. He said the party would spell out how it would be funded closer to the time of the general election next May. 'My challenge to Labour and the Conservatives is if you are not going to do this, what are you going to cut? Are you going to cut money to colleges? Are you going to cut apprentices? Are you going to cut help for toddlers? 'I think it would be unimaginable for us as a country, having made these steps, to reverse them.' Mr Clegg has promised a regular 'drumbeat' of policy announcements over the summer as his shattered party tries to rebuild support following its hammering in last month's European and English local council elections. Mr Clegg also announced plans to protect the education budget 'from cradle to college' during the next Parliament. But the Lib Dem leader could not say how he would fund the £10 billion pledge. The move is designed to win back support lost over the failure to honour his 2010 election promise to scrap tuition fees . David Cameron and Nick Clegg sparked fury in China after meeting Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in 2012 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg this morning risked a fresh diplomatic rift with China after defending his decision to meet Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama - while also attacking the country's human right's record. His controversial intervention, at his monthly press conference this morning, came on the first morning of a three-day visit to London by China's Premier Li Keqiang. Mr Clegg said he had 'no regrets at all' that he met the  Dalai Lama with David Cameron in 2012. He said: 'There’s nothing in the diary for the Dalai Lama to be met by either myself or David Cameron again, but I would be more than honoured to meet him again. 'We’ve always recognised that Tibet is part of China and we equally recognise the Dalai Lama’s very important role as a highly-respected religious leader – I would hope that I can meet someone of his distinction some time in the future, but there are no government plans to do so right now.' Mr Clegg also insisted the Government drive to increase trade with China would not stop minister criticising its human rights record. He said: 'We remain deeply concerned about the very large scale abuses of human rights that still occur.' The Lib Dem leader meanwhile used the opportunity to rubbish Tony Blair's claim that the current chaos in Iraq was not linked to the 2003 invasion. He said: 'For me it’s just self-evidently not the case that you can claim that what’s happening in Iraq, never mind any other country, is separated from a massive military invasion of that country just 11 years ago. 'I find it a really peculiar reading of history that you can overlook an international invasion of another country and say it has nothing to do with the predicament that the country finds itself in now.' Mr Clegg also announced that his party will fight the next general election on a promise to protect education spending from children's earliest years to the time they go to college. He said that extending the existing ‘ring fence’ on schools spending to cover the whole of the education budget from the ages of two to 19 would cost an additional £10 billion a year, rising annually with inflation. ‘Liberal Democrats will protect the full education budget, from the cradle to the college,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘Money invested in our children is the best investment of all because education can really transform lives.

"By . Katy Winter . At just eight months old Prince George is already stealing the limelight away from his parents as he gets his first taste of the spot light as they embark on their tour of New Zealand and Australia. However while the presence of the future king is clearly delighting the crowds, and no doubt giving great joy to his doting parents, such a long and arduous schedule is likely to take its toll on the youngster. His parents possible worry about how their son will handle the tour will be exacerbated by the fact that he is teething - with several gnashers clearly visible as he smiled and gurgled at Wellington Military Terminal on the first day of their official tour to Australia. Scroll down for video . At eight months old it is normal for children to have begun to grow teeth and Prince George appears to have a healthy set, with numerous teeth visible in his lower mouth yesterday . Kate carried George, who showed a few teeth as he  gurgled and smiled, stepping off the plane to begin their three week tour, which has been carefully scheduled to minimise the impact on the young prince . Kate and William's unusual decision to base their tour around three main hubs in Wellington, Sydney and Canberra, rather than changing location daily, is thought to be an attempt to minimise the trauma on the baby Prince. The arrangement means his doting parents will be able to travel back to see George almost every night – bar a stop-over in Queenstown, New Zealand, and another at Ayers Rock in Australia. The 18-day visit, which begins in Wellington, New Zealand, is the Cambridge family’s first official overseas trip together and Kate and William’s first major journey with eight-month-old Prince George. While George seemed in good spirits as the family brought their long flight to an end, experts warn that teething can cause a range of distressing symptoms and increased irritability . Sources have told the Mail that the little prince is also starting to crawl  which will only add to the unpredictability of official events on the tour . Royal aides have warned that George’s scheduled public appearances are open to change given his young age and the fact that no-one knows how he will cope with the long journey and 11-hour time difference, especially since he is teething. Sources have told the Mail that the little prince is indeed teething - as well as starting to crawl - which will only add to the unpredictability of official events on the tour. As well as enduring a 22-hour-flight to reach their destination, moving between their three hubs and travelling to engagements will result in Kate and William being forced to travel extensively with the teething prince over the next three weeks. However as mother of one, Charlotte, 31, tells MailOnline, the two are not happy bed companions: ‘Having recently endured an overnight flight to Cape Town with my teething 10-month-old, I have every sympathy for what Kate must have gone through on her journey to New Zealand. 'Seeing my baby in pain is distressing at any time, but teething is especially hard to deal with – not least because at first it’s often impossible to know what’s wrong. 'My baby had a temperature, a runny tummy and an awful rash when we were on board and a dose of Calpol didn’t restore her to her usual cheery self – or help her sleep! I was desperately worried she was ill until I realised that she seemed to be soothed by biting hard on her teether. Of course the unfamiliar surroundings of the aeroplane and the changing air-pressure made her even more uncomfortable – as did the constant stream of dribble soaking her pyjamas. 'One thing the Princess should be glad of is that she didn’t also have to deal with the tuts from other unhappy passengers!’ Dentist Dr Uchenna Okoye, from www.londonsmiling.com says: 'I am sure William and Kate will be having a few sleepless nights already down to teething, as many parents do. 'Babies teeth vary at what age teeth come through but around 6 months is the average age. A range of symptoms can affect a baby from red and slightly inflamed gums, flushed face and cheek to dribbling. There is an urge to chew and gnaw things so a chilled teething ring is a good option. Cool things seem to soothe. Teething gels may offer some instant comfort and lots of cuddles for additional comfort (parents often need that too from the sleepless nights!) Some babies get red /flushed cheeks and can be quite irritable and it's important to make sure they don't get rashes from the constant dribbling so they chin needs to be wiped and kept dry. 'Some parents have said it can cause diarrhoea but if this does occur with a temperature it shouldn't be left for more than 24 hours.  Length of time with symptoms can vary but for the majority of children it tends to be whilst their first 2 teeth are coming through.  Avoid anything with sugar though e.g. teething rusks instead chilled vegetables, carrots work well.' Eager members of the public are expected to be given no less than six glimpses of the tiny future king on his first royal tour, including a photo call at Government House in Wellington and a visit to the world famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney. Perhaps revealing the couple are feeling the effects of the hard work involved in raising a teething infant Prince William said recently that 'one is enough at the moment' when it comes to babies. The royal father made the telling comment when the couple visited the Irish Guards barracks for St Patrick's Day in March, and judging by the numerous teeth glimpsed in the young prince’s mouth, it is unlikely that their experience of parenting will have eased in the past month. Being trapped in a confined space with a grizzly, inconsolable, teething baby for 30 hours is most parents' idea of hell. Including mine. Even if the baby is prince and you are in a luxurious first class cabin, surrounded by nannies and assistants, there'd be no getting away from those piercing cries, the angry red cheeks and the fury and frustration of a 10-month-old who is in a whole world of pain and doesn't understand why. But that's only the half of it. Very often, teething babies also suffer from sore ears (not helped by changes in cabin pressure) diarrhoea, fever and vomiting as a side effect. My daughter Minnie, now thankfully four and in possession of a full set of gnashers, would projectile vomit when I fed her and do horrendously acidic poohs which burnt her bottom and gave her nappy rash unless changed instantly, when she had teeth coming through. Monty, now 22-months, was also quite sick and dribbled so excessively that I would have to change his T-shirts four or five times a day as he'd be soaking wet. I wish Kate all the luck in the world for the next few weeks and the lengthy flight home – in my experience, she's going to need it!

"By . Richard Spillett . A luxury mansion bought for just £20,000 more than 50 years ago has gone on the market for a staggering £3MILLION. The lavish property, near Cardiff, was bought in 1962 by late banker Sir Julian Hodge - one of Britain's wealthiest men before his death 10 years ago. The Hodge family are now selling up - and expect to get around 150 times the amount Sir Julian first paid for it. The mansion was bought for just £20,000 in 1962 but is now on the market for a massive £3million . The sprawling estate includes servants' quarters, a two-storey oak-panelled reception hall and access to an observatory . Estate Agents say the house offers beautiful views of the surrounding gardens and nearby Bristol Channel . Speculation is mounting in the local area about the host of celebrities rumoured to be taking tours. Former Baywatch star David Hasselhoff, 61, and his Welsh girlfriend Hayley Roberts have been linked to neighbouring properties in the leafy village of Lisvane, near Cardiff. And with TV's Sherlock being filmed nearby, those living in the area are hoping heart-throb Benedict Cumberbatch, 37, could become the home's new A-list owner. Doctor Who is also being shot in the region, leading some to suggest new Doctor Peter Capaldi, 55, may stump up for the estate. David Hasselhoff and his Welsh girlfriend Hayley Roberts could be in the running to buy the mansion, as well as Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch . Leading Cardiff estate agent David Ricketts said: 'It is a grand and imposing looking building which was once stately enough for one of Britain's biggest bankers. 'Its value in the early 1960s was round about £20,000 - it's gone up a bit since then. 'These days properties like this attract film stars and rock musicians who want to make a statement. 'Cardiff is becoming a mini Hollywood with Pinewood Studios setting up here and TV successes like Sherlock and Dr Who being filmed in South Wales. 'It will be interesting to see who moves in. 'It will certainly attract interest from outside of Wales and maybe even Europe.' The mansion also comes with its own lodge, three-bedroomed detached house and two cottages in a converted coach house . Estates agents suggest the building could be converted into a boutique hotel or luxury health spa . Locals say the countryside around Cardiff is becoming a 'mini-Hollywood' after Pinewood set up a studios in the area . The eight-bedroomed mansion has views over its formal gardens and across to the Bristol Channel. There is a magnificent two-storey oak-panelled reception hall with a huge leaded-light window and an imposing fireplace. The second floor - which was the servants' quarters - has five further rooms, two bathrooms, a large storeroom and access to the mansion's own octagonal observatory built to view shipping in the channel. Estate agents are braced for a rush of interest from foreign millionaires and celebrities . Property prices in the Cardiff area grew by nearly five per cent in the last year and the trend is set to continue . Sir Julian, best known for forming the Bank of Wales and later his own Julian Hodge Bank in Cardiff, bought the property after amassing a fortune from his businesses in the 1960s. When he died 10 years ago at the age of 99 his estimated wealth of £48million made him the oldest of Britain's 1,000 richest people. The property comes with its own lodge, a single-storey three-bedroomed detached house and a coach house which has been converted into two cottages. Sir Julian bought the mansion near Cardiff 'for a song' back in 1962 and his family has owned it ever since. Francesca Tanguy, of estate agent Cooke and Arkwright said: 'It would make a grand family home unique to Cardiff and South Wales. 'Its layout, location and grounds also make it ideal for conversion into a boutique hotel or wedding venue, or even as a destination health spa or corporate headquarters. 'We expect interest in it to come from a wide variety of sources.'","Late banker Sir Julian Hodge bought the property 'for a song' in 1962 after amassing his fortune .

"By . Jason Groves . Nigel Farage has praised Putin's handling of the Syrian civil war as 'brilliant', despite the country propping up tyrant Bashar Al-Assad who gassed his own civilians, including children, last year . Nigel Farage today names Vladimir Putin as a political hero, saying his handling of the brutal civil war in Syria has been ‘brilliant’. In an extraordinary intervention, Mr Farage praised the thuggish Russian President as a superb ‘operator’ who had succeeded in outwitting the West. The comments will reopen the row about the UK Independence Party leader’s outspoken views on foreign policy. Asked which current world leader he most admired, Mr Farage told GQ magazine: ‘As an operator, but not as a human being, I would say Putin. ‘The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?’ Last week Mr Farage sparked a furious row after claiming the European Union had ‘blood on its hands’ for provoking Russia over Ukraine. He said he did not approve of Mr Putin’s annexation of Crimea, but said EU leaders had been ‘weak and vain’, adding: ‘If you poke the Russian bear with a stick he will respond.’ Russian state television said Mr Farage had ‘directly accused the EU of a coup d’état in Ukraine’, and suggested polls showed the majority of British people agreed with him. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who will hold the second of two debate on Europe with Mr Farage tomorrow, described his comments as ‘perverse’. He added: ‘It shows quite how extreme people can be when their loathing of the EU becomes so all-consuming that they even end up siding with Vladimir Putin to make their point.’ The praise for Russia’s handling of the Syria crisis will raise fresh controversy, given Moscow’s role in propping up the hated regime of tyrant Bashar al-Assad. Russia is even accused of assisting the supply of chemical weapons that were used by the Assad regime in a barbaric against innocent civilians, including children, last year. However, even Russia’s harshest critics acknowledge Moscow then played a strong diplomatic hand to head off the threat of retaliatory strikes by the West on its ally. When asked who he admired politically, Mr Farage cited Putin, praising his strong political will and ability to outwit the West while defending his allies . Mr Farage’s praise for the Russian president was in stark contrast to his unflattering assessment of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ‘She is incredibly cold,’ he said. ‘I always say - I agree this is a bit rude - but whatever you think of the public image of Merkel, in private she is even more miserable. I warm to more extrovert people.’ Asked to say ‘something nice’ about the three major party leaders, the normally garrulous Mr Farage was almost lost for words, describing each of them as ‘nice’. He said Mr Cameron was ‘a perfectly nice fellow who stands four-square for nothing,’ Mr Miliband a ‘nice chap, not very worldly - I would love to see him in a working men’s club in Newcastle’, while Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg - who took on Mr Farage in a TV debate last week - was a ‘very nice guy, just wrong’. Asked who he would like to win the election, assuming Ukip does not, he replied: ‘I don’t care... If I was back in the London Metal Exchange I’d not give a toss, because 100 per cent of the legislation affecting me is made in Brussels.’ In a wide-ranging interview he also suggested he would like to become a US-style radio ‘shock jock’ when he eventually quite politics.","Ukip leader Nigel Farage has praised Russian President Putin .

"By . Rob Draper . Follow @@draper_rob . It is has been a long journey back to credibility since former France manager Raymond Domenech sent Nicolas Anelka home in disgrace from the last World Cup and Patrice Evra led the team’s infamous mutiny in South Africa, 2010. That episode prompted national outcry in France and an anguished debate over the identity of Les Blues, a team which had been powerful symbol of national unity in the Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps era but now had seemingly become a spoilt group of overpaid underachievers. Even as recently as last November, when they lost the first leg of their World Cup play-off against Ukraine 2-0, it seemed unlikely that the French public would fall back in love with their players. But a stirring 3-0 win at the Stade de France and now a major tournament with star players performing, no splits in the camp and an attacking team winning games, seems to be doing the trick. Scroll down for video... Changing opinion: France's performances at the World Cup have reignited the nation's interest . United front: Coach Didier Deschamps and Hugo Lloris (R) attend a press conference ahead of Nigeria game . Super saver: Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris has helped France qualify top of their group at the World Cup . VIDEO France favourites over stormy Nigeria . Captain Hugo Lloris senses that the Ukraine match was the turning point. ‘There have been some up and downs in the past few years, I admit,’ said the Tottenham goalkeeper. ‘But since the return leg against Ukraine in November we felt an enthusiasm behind the team. And in the friendly matches, we’ve noticed a rekindled love between the team and our fans. ‘There are very high expectations to please the supporters and up to now we’ve done what we needed to on the pitch to make them happy. But we want to go further and have all French people proud of the national team.’ On Monday in Brasilia they take on Nigeria team that has been the latest African squad to be beset by bonus rows – resolved only on Friday when the nation’s President Goodluck Jonathan intervened to ensure £2.25million of back payments arrived in Brazil. If France can get past Nigeria a potential quarter final with Germany looms. Dark days: France's previous World Cup was disrupted by players revolting against coach Raymond Domenech . Turning point: France's comeback play-off win against Ukraine got the nation back on side . It’s enough to bring back memories of the Deschamps team, the current manager having of course been captain in the final – because of Laurent Blanc’s suspension - when France won the World Cup in 1998. ‘They are a reference for all French players for future generations of footballers,’ said Lloris. ‘I grew up watching them on TV and they are an example to all of us on the pitch and especially as a collective unit. 'They achieved a lot. They did wonderful things in 1998 and 2006 and we try to be inspired by that.’ Role models: Didier Deschamps holds aloft the World Cup after France's victory in 1998 . Disruptive influence? Manchester City playmaker Samir Nasri was omitted from the World Cup squad . Lloris; Debuchy, Varane, Koscielny, Evra; Matuidi, Cabaye, Pogba; Valbuena, Benzema, Griezmann . Deschamps, who axed Samir Nasri from this squad, has himself has been part of the healing process. Evra, who led the munity of 2010 and was subsequently banned from the national team for five games, is now fully rehabilitated and now one of the manager’s key lieutenants in the group. It was  Deschamps who signed Evra from Nice for Monaco when he 22 years old, a move that provided a springboard to his move to Manchester United. ‘We go a long way back,’ said Deschamps. ‘He was 22 years old when I met him when I was at Monaco. Patrice is very, very experienced player, it’s his ninth season with Man United, he’s won a lot of titles and been a captain there. He’s a winner and he’s accustomed to big matches and he’s prepared very well for to be ready for this World Cup.’ Re-integrated: Patrice Evra (L) has gone from outcast to an important member of Didier Deschamp's team . Deschamps is under pressure to replace the criticised Paul Pogba in midfield but Laurent Koscielny is expected to fill in for Mamadou Sakho in central defence due to Liverpool’s player’s calf injury. But Deschamps has made light of the fact that both France and Nigeria were refused permission by FIFA to train at the £600 National Stadium in Brasilia because of fears about the playing surface. ‘FIFA wanted to protect the pitch for the upcoming matches after this one, ‘said Deschamps. ‘So we have to adapt and go to another stadium to train. We have to take everything with a smile.’","France have fallen back in love with their team at the World Cup .

"By . Simon Walters . A senior Tory MP is to study a dossier of secret emails in an investigation into a £5 billion deal plotted by two disgraced Conservatives on the public payroll. The inquiry has been ordered by former Tory Minister Henry Bellingham, who is responsible for the Policy Research Unit (PRU), which advises Conservative MPs and is funded by their Parliamentary expenses. Mr Bellingham acted after The Mail on Sunday revealed PRU boss Iain Corby emailed Tony Caplin, a crony of David Cameron, from his official Parliamentary account, suggesting they could both make money from a £5 billion investment project. Iain Corby, left and Tony Caplin, right who are accused of suggesting they could make money from a £5bn government deal . Mr Corby, who ran the PRU for six years, was fired on the orders of No 10 last month after claims he was guilty of misconduct over a sex texts scandal. Mr Caplin was sacked as the head of a £60 billion Treasury quango after a separate investigation by this newspaper revealed how the Prime Minister gave him the job despite the fact he had been declared bankrupt for not paying his taxes. Mr Bellingham told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have asked to look at all Mr Corby’s emails to see if this was a one-off or part of a pattern of outside activities. I am determined to establish the truth. The PRU is funded by taxpayers. If anyone is dealing in shares or other commercial activities, they should not be doing it via the PRU.’ PRU director Eoghan Williams, appointed to clean it up after Mr Corby’s abrupt departure, is compiling a dossier of the messages. The email concerning the £5 billion deal was sent to Mr Caplin from Mr Corby’s PRU email address. Headed ‘spending some cash,’ it was sent in March 2013, ten months after Mr Caplin, a member of the Public Works Loans Board (PWLB), which controls £60 billion of loans to town halls, was declared bankrupt. Four months later, Mr Cameron promoted him to the post of Board chairman. Former Tory minister Henry Bellingham has ordered an inquiry into the secret emails . Mr Caplin and Mr Corby had access to privileged Government information as a result of their positions. Two other powerful groups of MPs, the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Administration Committee,  are also expected to discuss the allegations concerning Mr Caplin this week. Downing Street last night admitted no checks were carried out on Mr  Caplin before his appointment as head of the PWLB last year. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood said in a letter to Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie: ‘Mr Caplin should have told the Treasury he was bankrupt.’ Tory ‘quango king’ Mr Caplin is the former boss of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, where the Prime Minister’s father, Ian, was one of three generations of Camerons to work. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is a former business associate of Mr Caplin and gave him a top Tory HQ post. Further details of how Mr Caplin cheated friends as he tried to avoid bankruptcy and public disgrace emerged last night. ‘He borrowed more and more money from friends to pay off other debts without telling them he was going broke – like using one credit card to pay off another – but it collapsed,’ said one.","Former minister Henry Bellingham to study dossier of secret emails by two disgraced Conservatives .

"By . Luke Garratt . Hundreds of hip fractures could be prevented every year by adding magnesium to tap water, according to a newly published study. Scientists at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have found drinking water with a higher concentration of magnesium helps with hip fractures, a common injury suffered by the ageing population of Britain. Public health experts in Norway, where drinking water varies in quality widely, found that in areas where tap water contained magnesium both men and women suffered less hip fractures. Previous successes in adding different naturally occurring materials include the addition of fluoride to drinking water, which led to better dental hygiene across the country . However, the study didn't find a link between calcium in drinking water and the number of hip fractures suffered even though calcium is often associated with bone strength. The researchers have said water companies should add the mineral dolomite to public supplies, because it is rich in magnesium. The study, which took place in Norway, seems to point to a link between increased intake of magnesium and hip bone strength . It is the first time the link between calcium/magnesium and hip fractures has been looked at this way. Co-author of the study Dr Cecilie Dahl said: 'The protective effect of magnesium was unsurprising but the correlation between calcium and magnesium in water and hip fracture was complex and somewhat unexpected. 'Therefore more research is needed to get a more reliable result of the relationship between drinking water and hip fractures and to get a better picture of the biological mechanism in the body.' Hip fractures are a major public health problem across western countries. We already know many factors that could affect the development disease, such as smoking, height and weight, physical activity and diet, and the amount of vitamin D intake. Norwegian researchers created a register of all hip fractures in Norway and a map showing the coverage of the various water utility companies in Norway. This made it possible to determine which water utility company is most likely to supply each area in Norway. The researchers compiled data from three sources; an earlier project on drinking water in Norway, the National Population Register with inhabitants in Norway from 1994 until 2000, and the register of hip fractures in Norway. These data sources were linked together to create a compilation of fractures in areas with the highest and lowest areas of calcium and magnesium. The researchers followed approximately 700,000 men and women over seven years and registered about 5,500 hip fractures among men and 13,600 hip fractures for women in this period.","Norwegian study has found link between bone strength and magnesium .

"By . Damien Gayle . Sprinkled with flowers and bearing the signs of a violent end, the carcasses of two elephants lie amid the long grass, where they fell after a savage brawl. Around them stand mourning forestry workers, who had raised the antagonists since they were calves at the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, north-east India. A vast expanse of tall elephant grass, marshland, and dense tropical moist broadleaf forests, Kaziranga is a world heritage site and hosts an incredibly wealth of biodiversity. Dead: Bull elephant Gautam's body is sprinkled with flowers after his death in a savage clash with a female . Brawl: Ron, the female, who killed Gautam, here lies dead. Her trunk is severed and her tail missing . But most visitors come to see the elephants, with huge numbers successful breeding in the hundred-year-old game reserve nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas. The duelling pair - called Gautam and Ron, a male and female respectively - inflicted mortal wounds on each other in a ferocious clash. Pictures show Ron's trunk completely severed and a deep gouge where her tail should begin. Gautam's injuries are less apparent, but they were nevertheless evidently severe enough to seal his fate, too. Grief: Forestry workers look on at dead Gautam, who was raised by humans at Kaziranga National Park . The horrendous injury to Ron's trunk can be seen more clearly in this picture taken from another angle . Fighting is common among male elephants, but rarely serious. Fights between a male and a female, such as this, are very rare - particularly ones with such a tragic outcome. However elephants have been known to be aggressive towards humans. In India, male elephants sometimes enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Such attacks have often occurred after elephant culls, a factor that, combined with the animals' remarkable intelligence and self-awareness, has led some to interpret them as vindictive.","Bull and cow killed each other in savage jungle brawl in Assam .

"By . Rob Davies . British drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline is to face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office, it emerged last night. The SFO said it was probing Glaxo’s ‘commercial practices’, understood to be a reference to allegations of bribery in China and several other countries. The pharmaceuticals firm, one of only two British drugs giants alongside AstraZeneca, became embroiled in a scandal last year when Chinese officials accused it of operating a vast bribery network. The Serious Fraud Office said it was probing Glaxo's 'commercial practices', understood to be a reference to allegations of bribery in China and several other countries . Investigators said the company used hundreds of middlemen to bribe doctors with money and even sexual favours provided by prostitutes, in order to sway them into buying its drugs. The SFO was known to be scrutinising Glaxo but announced its decision to launch a formal criminal investigation late last night. While the allegations relate to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) staff on foreign soil, the SFO has jurisdiction over any alleged bribery offence carried out by a British firm, regardless of whether it takes place overseas. The probe comes after former company executive Mark Reilly was accused of bribery in China . ‘GSK is committed to operating its . business to the highest ethical standards and will continue to cooperate . fully with the SFO,’ the company said. Glaxo executive Mark Reilly, who ran its Chinese business, was charged earlier this month with bribery, an offence that carries a maximum tariff of life in prison in the ‘People’s Republic’. Mr Reilly initially left the country as the allegations emerged, but later returned to be grilled by investigators. The pharmaceuticals giant has previously admitted that some of its Chinese executives, two of whom were charged alongside Reilly, appeared to have broken the law, calling the allegations ‘shameful’. ‘We take the allegations that have been raised very seriously,’ Glaxo said at the time. ‘They are deeply concerning to us and contrary to the values of GSK.’ The allegations came to light at an inconvenient moment for Prime Minister David Cameron, who last year used a visit to China to lobby on Glaxo’s behalf. Glaxo later revealed that it was investigating claims that staff were involved in bribery in Poland, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. The huge company is behind a large range of products found in pharmacies around the world, including Beechams Cold and Flu remedies, Panadol painkillers, Aquafresh toothpaste and Horlicks malted milk drink. Dr Mick Cooper, an analyst for investment research firm Edison, told City AM: 'This looks more serious than what has happened in China, this is the first time the SFO has investigated a major pharma company in the UK.'","Serious Fraud Office confirmed it was probing firm's 'commercial practices'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Would you class yourself as a night owl or more of a morning person? Be careful how you answer because it could give clues to your personality traits. Australian researchers have discovered that a preference for staying up late or into the early hours has a direct link to anti-social behaviour and so-called Dark Triad traits. The Dark Triad traits consist of narcissistic and selfish actions, cunning or deceitful Machiavellian behaviour and psychopathic tendencies. Australian researchers have found a direct link between night owls, people who stay awake into the early hours, and narcissistic or psychopathic behaviour. These behaviours form what's called the Dark Triad of personality traits and the study claims people who prefer evenings to mornings are more anti-social . The Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The narcissistic personality is characterised by a 'grandiose self-view, a sense of entitlement, lack of empathy, and egotism. The Machiavellian personality is characterised by manipulation and exploitation of others, with a disregard for morality and a focus on self-interest and deception. A psychopathic personality is characterised by thrill-seeking, selfishness, callousness, lack of personal affect, superficial charm, and remorselessness. The paper from Dr Peter Jonason from the University of Sydney surveyed 263 students online. The average age was 24 and there were 74 men and 189 women involved. Participants were asked about their chronotype. A person's chronotype reflects at what time of the day their hormone levels, temperature, brain function, eating and sleeping are most active, change or reach a certain level. People who are more active and feel more alert in the morning are referred to as 'larks', while people who prefer late evening hours are classed as 'owls'. Questions included, 'During the first half hour after you wake up in the morning, how do you feel?' People were then rated based on a narcissism scale and were asked how strongly they agreed with statements including 'I have a natural talent for influencing people.' Future studies are being planned to look at whether larks, people who function best in the morning, portray certain behaviour types as well, in a bid to see whether bodies actually do function at different times of the day, or whether people just perceive that they do . They were additionally asked how they felt about statements made on the psychopathy scale, for example, 'I think I could beat a lie detector', and a Machiavellian scale, such as 'It is hard to get ahead without cutting corners here and there'. Across the 263 students, the darker a participant's personality score, the more they tended to be an 'owl' and said they functioned more effectively in the evening hours. People who feel more active and alert in the morning are referred to as 'larks', while people who prefer late evening hours are classed as 'owls' This was also the case when the three traits were analysed separately; each trait was stronger in people who considered themselves to be night owls. The paper claims the results are consistent with a 'niche-specialisation' hypothesis. Niche specialisation is the process where traits have developed over time, through evolution. Dr Jonason said in the study: 'It could be adaptively effective for anyone pursuing a fast life strategy like that embodied in the Dark Triad to occupy and exploit a low-light environment where others are sleeping and having diminished cognitive functioning. Such features of the night may facilitate the causal sex, mate-poaching, and risk-taking the Dark Triad traits are linked to.' For example, humans and animals may have evolved to be night owls because the low-light conditions made it possible to carry out these behaviours and actions without being seen. Dr Jonason concludes that more work is needed, but the results highlight an important step in the study of the darker aspects of human nature. Future studies are being planned to look at whether larks portray certain behaviour types, in a bid to see whether bodies actually do function at different times of the day, or whether people just perceive that they do.","Researchers find a link between night owls and anti-social behaviour .

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . and Mike Browne . Shady: Tony Caplin was made chairman of the Public Works Loan Board by David Cameron . A vineyard owner cheated out of £100,000 by the Tory crony put in charge of billions of pounds of public money has denounced the bankrupt businessman as a  ‘devious b******’. Bill Hulme, who owns the Fleur Fields vineyard in Northamptonshire, backed calls for an inquiry into disgraced ex-Tory chief Tony Caplin, who was put in charge of Public Works Loan Board by David Cameron. ‘There is something wrong with the judgment of a Government that puts a bad man like that in charge of public money when he has duped innocent people like me and others out of enormous sums,’ said 71-year-old Mr Hulme. ‘The man is a devious b****** and had all the hallmarks of a conman. There should be an inquiry to establish the truth.’ Meanwhile, another businessman today speaks of how Caplin conned him out of another £250,000. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how Caplin, who ran the Cameron family stockbroking firm, was made chairman of the £60 billion quango despite being declared bankrupt. Mr Cameron claimed he had no idea the ‘quango king’, who owed more than £3 million, including £200,000 to the taxman, had been made bankrupt – and fired him immediately. We also revealed Caplin’s link to disgraced Iain Corby, former boss of a publicly funded Conservative MPs’ research group. Corby, who was sacked on Mr Cameron’s orders over sex texts and boozing claims, secretly emailed Caplin from his Commons office in an apparent bid to profit from a £5 billion deal. The Prime Minister hoped his instant dismissal of Caplin – who was also the Conservatives’ chief operating officer when Mr Cameron became party leader – would end the row, but The Mail on Sunday has established the scandal is much deeper. The picture now is of an unscrupulous man in cahoots with shady  figures who cheated innocent people out of vast sums – and tried to lie his way out of it. It raises key questions: why did Cameron trust Caplin with such a vast amount of public money? Did Caplin use his privileged Treasury role to abuse taxpayers’ money? And did friends in high places cover up his activities? The pressure for an inquiry into Caplin grew after new details emerged of how he: . A vivid account of the misery caused by Caplin is provided by Bill Hulme and wife Flora. They set up their vineyard 14 years ago, which has become one of England’s most successful winemakers – but they were rocked when Caplin cheated them out of £100,000. Charge sheet: The complaints against Tory crony Tony Caplin investigated by The Mail on Sunday . They say they were persuaded to lend him the money in 2010 by their financial adviser. What they didn’t know was that the adviser was, like Caplin, soon to be embroiled in a separate financial scandal. Mr Hulme recalls: ‘He said Caplin was worth about £2 million, had deals going through and would soon pay me back, so I agreed.’ The couple say their adviser played up Caplin’s role as former head of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers, which employed three generations of Camerons, including the Prime Minister’s father Ian. ‘It sounded impressive.’ So they lent Caplin the money – but ‘then he stopped paying interest. ‘Another man told me Caplin did the same to him. We were told he was paying cheques into his wife’s account. They are both “A Caplin.” ‘It turned out he already had huge debts when I lent him money. If I’d known I wouldn’t have gone near him.’ Vineyard owners: Flora and Bill Hulme lost out when they lent Caplin £100,000 . When Caplin was quizzed at a bankruptcy hearing in February 2012, it seemed he could not even remember Bill Hulme’s name. He said he owed ‘someone called Bill’ £100,000. The Hulmes’ story was echoed by the boss of a high-tech firm who said he was cheated out of £250,000 by Caplin. The entrepreneur, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, told how Caplin boasted of his Tory links. ‘He would say things like, “I had lunch with George the other day.” He was definitely close to Osborne. He said “Theresa [Villiers] told me she wants one of your computers, but can she have it in pink?” Or he’d say, “I saw Oliver [Letwin] at the weekend.” He mentioned Cameron a couple of times.’ The businessman described how Caplin persuaded him to lend him £250,000 – which he is still waiting to get back. ‘I knew he had a senior job at the Tory Party and he was very plausible. He rang me in summer 2010 and asked to borrow £250,000 for a deal. I said, “No problem.” ‘A few weeks after that, he came to France with me. He phoned from Nice airport to say thanks. That was the last I heard from him. ‘When he was taken to court, he said he had money coming in, but he never did. He produced a cheque for £200,000 from a company in Northern Ireland. It was fake. He said he couldn’t attend court because he had a boil on his bum. It was ridiculous. ‘He is a Walter Mitty. He said he had a collection of vintage Fiat cars, but there is no trace of it. He is intelligent, but has a fatal flaw. Perhaps being too close to political power, and the need for money to maintain his position, affected his judgment. ‘Maybe he thought he could go bankrupt, conceal it, reinvent himself and get away with it. He nearly did – until you caught him out.’ When he appeared at the bankruptcy court, Caplin admitted that he paid money earned from his quango work into wife Angela’s bank account, which is also in the name  ‘A Caplin’. Asked why, he said it was ‘easier’ than using his account. This included his £6,000-a-year payment from the Medical Research Council. Last year he was reappointed as chairman of its finance committee by another Tory friend, Business Minister David Willetts, but he was sacked last week. Revelations: The question has been raised of why Caplin, pictured, was trusted with such a vast budget . Also paid into Mrs A Caplin’s account was the £20,000 a year he received as chairman of the North West London Hospitals NHS Trust. As he fought a losing battle to avoid bankruptcy, Caplin told the court that he was due to receive £63,000 in weeks from two US clients and $600,000 (£350,000) in two months from US firm Americana Investments. The money never materialised. He said he had been wealthy before the banking crash, but now had no stocks, shares or savings. His £1 million Cotswolds home had been repossessed by Barclays Bank, he said – and he still owed them £500,000. Prominent: Caplin at a previous event . Caplin’s current home is a penthouse apartment near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Kensington Palace in London. He told friends he bought it last year after selling the Cotswolds home and his £1.85 million home in Fulham. In fact, both were sold to pay off debts. And he does not own the apartment in Queen’s Gate. Land Registry records show it was purchased last July for £2.4 million by Raj Bansal and wife Urmila Mistry, British doctors practising in Florida. Caplin rents it for an estimated £7,000 a month – and is thought to be facing eviction for rent arrears. Seven years before his bankruptcy case, the London Stock Exchange publicly reprimanded an investment bank that Caplin chaired for breaking strict City rules. Durlacher bank and Prestbury Holdings, a ‘boutique bank’ chaired by Tory grandee Francis Maude, were both rapped after Durlacher advised Prestbury to delay announcing a profits warning. When it was finally issued, Prestbury’s shares fell nearly 75 per cent. Soon afterwards, Caplin contributed to the 2005 Conservative manifesto along with Mr Letwin. When Mr Maude became party chairman after the Election, he appointed Caplin as the Tories’ chief operating officer at Central Office. A spokesman for Mr Maude said: ‘Francis Maude did not meet Caplin until later, after the 2005 Election.’ Another of Caplin’s business associates is Ulster property developer Glenn Boyd who, in 2007, faced charges relating to a £1.2 million land deal, including transferring the proceeds of crime and possessing property as the proceeds of crime. Charges were dismissed, but he was struck off as a director until 2022. Caplin told his bankruptcy court in 2012 that Boyd was due to pay him £250,000 ‘later that day’ – and hoped to earn another £250,000 from him. It never arrived. Boyd confirmed that he has business links with Caplin, but refused to comment further. Caplin is one of two directors of HFX Globex Realisations, set up last October with Yvonne Anderson – Boyd’s wife – and registered to the couple’s former home in Londonderry. Questions to answer: It was Prime Minister David Cameron who made Caplin chairman of the major quango . Caplin is believed to have had the tables turned on him by falling  victim of a $2 billion Venezuelan bond fraud. He set up a company in the tax haven of the Isle of Man to receive millions of pounds in expected interest from investments, but Caplin told his bankruptcy hearing he ‘never received a penny and no bond was ever issued’. Caplin was discharged from bankruptcy just weeks before his appointment to the quango, but still owes money. Labour’s Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The more we learn about this man, the more questions need to be answered.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Mr Caplin has not been a member of any donor club and we have no record of him attending any lunches with George Osborne.’ A Government spokesman said Caplin was made commissioner of the Public Works Loan Board after being nominated by the outgoing chairman of the independent board. Caplin was unavailable for comment.","Vineyard owner tells how Tony Caplin cheated him out of £100,000 .

"By . John Hall . Pope Francis will travel to the mafia heartland of Calabria for the first time on Saturday to spend a day in the hometown of a toddler who was murdered in a clan drug war. His tightly packed schedule in one of the poorest regions of Italy will see the pontiff visit a prison, hospital and care home in and around Cassano allo Ionio before celebrating mass with an expected 100,000 pilgrims. The visit comes as the Vatican was forced to deny claims Francis is ill following an abrupt decision to cancel his popular morning Mass until September, and all general mid-week audiences in July. Threat: Pope Francis' determination to rattle organised crime groups - such as Saturday's visit to Calabria - has sparked warnings that he himself could become a target for the mafia . During his visit to Calabria, the pope is expected to speak out about two of the region's biggest challenges: towering youth unemployment and the pervasive grip of the immensely powerful and secretive 'Ndrangheta crime group. Unemployment among the under-25s in the region stands at 56.1 per cent - the highest in Italy in 2013 according to Eurostat - and local mobsters thrive by offering idle youngsters well-paid work, luring them into their networks. The Argentine pope has previously denounced Italy's mafia organisations - which also include Sicily's Cosa Nostra and Stidda, Campania's Comorra and Puglia's Sacra Corona Unita  - warning mobsters to relinquish their 'bloodstained money' which 'cannot be taken to heaven'. Tragic: Cassano allo Ionio was home to Nicola 'Coco' Campolongo (pictured), a three-year-old shot dead in January alongside his grandfather in a suspected mafia hit . Pope Francis will spend Saturday in the villages of Castrovillari and Cassano allo Jonio in Calabria - a region in southern Italy that is under the pervasive grip of the immensely powerful and secretive 'Ndrangheta mafia . After meeting relatives of mafia victims in May - including the families of butchered children and priests - he told gangsters that they would 'go to hell' if they did not repent. When John Paul II voiced a similar threat in Sicily in 1993, Cosa Nostra responded by bombing two historic churches in Rome. Francis's determination to rattle organised crime groups has sparked warnings that he himself could become a target for the mafia. In November, respected Calabrian state prosecutor Nicola Gratteri said 'Ndrangheta was 'nervous'. 'If the mafia bosses can trip him up, they won't hesitate,' he said. The Vatican brushed off the warning, insisting there was 'no reason for concern'. Yesterday they also moved to ease renewed concerns about the pope's health, following his decision to suspend all midweek audiences to cancel his popular morning Mass until September, and all general mid-week audiences in July. Fear: The discovery of the bodies of three-year-old Nicola Campolongo and his grandfather in a burnt-out Fiat Punto (pictured) sent shockwaves through Italy . Reverend Thomas Rosica, a consultant to the Vatican press office, told CNN: 'There is no sickness whatsoever... If there was, we would be open about that and asking people to pray for him.' The town of Cassano allo Ionio, nestled at the bottom of a steep mountain, was home to Nicola 'Coco' Campolongo, a three-year-old shot dead in January along with his grandfather. The murders were apparent mafia assassinations over money. The discovery of their bodies in a burnt-out Fiat Punto sent shockwaves through Italy, as did the murder just two months later of another three-year-old in the nearby Puglia region. During his visit to Castrovillari prison, the 77-year-old pope will meet Coco's father, who was serving time in prison alongside the toddler's mother for drug crimes when their son was killed. He may also meet the man who murdered priest Lazzaro Longobardi, who was beaten to death with an iron bar the same month after a failed extortion attempt. Poor: Unemployment among the under-25s in Calabria (pictured) stands at 56.1 per cent - the highest in Italy. Local mobsters thrive by offering idle youngsters well-paid work, luring them into their networks . The 'Ndrangheta plays a leading role in the global cocaine trade and its bastion, the Calabria region, is a major transit point for drug shipments from Latin America to the rest of Europe. It has benefitted in the past from historic ties to the Church, with dons claiming to be God-fearing Catholics and priests turning a blind eye to crimes. But over the past 20 years numerous priests have taken part in the fight against the clans - sometimes paying for their bravery with their lives. Francis is likely to call on anti-mafia campaigners to continue their struggle, praising the work of organisations like Progetto Sud in Lamezia, which has transformed a gambling arcade and drug-trafficking base into a community for handicapped people. He may also hail the courage of those who break ranks with the mob despite the clans' stringent code of loyalty, which punishes rebellion by death. The 'Ndrangheta has been successful in combining elements of archaic tradition with modernity and has proved particularly difficult to infiltrate because of its reliance on a tightly knit network of families. But a small but growing number of wives and daughters in particular are speaking out against their mobster fathers, brothers or sons.","Pope Francis will spend day in hometown of toddler murdered in mob hit .

"By . Gareth Rose . One of Alex Salmond's biggest financial backers has warned Scottish independence could be bad for business. Bus giant Stagecoach, run by SNP donor Sir Brian Souter, joins a growing list of Scots firms to raise fears over the impact of Alex Salmond's bid to break up Britain. Standard Life, the Weir Group and Barrhead Travel - whose boss Bill Munro was subsequently targeted by cybernats - have all warned about the consequences of a Yes vote. However, the concerns raised by Stagecoach - over the impact on regulation and funding - is particularly embarrassing for Mr Salmond. Only last month, Sir Brian pledged £1million to the SNP and has given £100,000 to pro-separation campaign group Christians for Independence. Despite this, Stagecoach's preliminary annual report references independence under 'principal risks and uncertainties'. It says: 'Regulatory changes and availability of public funding - there is a risk changes to the regulatory environment or changes to the availability of public funding could affect the group's prospects. Sir Brian Souter last month pledged £1million to the SNP and has given £100,000 to pro-separation campaign group Christians for Independence . 'Such changes may arise as a result of the outcomes of the September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence and/or the 2015 UK general election.' Unionists seized on the comments as proof that even the most committed supporters of independence recognise the economic risks. Ian Murray, shadow business minis-and Labour MP for Edinburgh South, said: 'When even Brian Souter, who has bankrolled the Nationalists for years, thinks separation is a big risk, you know Alex Salmond has a problem. This intervention drives a coach and horses through the Nationalists' case for separation. 'Breaking up the UK would be a big risk for Scotland. Stagecoach is right to highlight the risk separation poses to public funding in Scotland. 'When Alex Salmond can't even tell us the basics like what would replace the pound, how pensions would be afforded or what would happen to funding for our schools and hospitals, it's no surprise the majority of Scots are saying No Thanks to separation.' Mr Murray added: 'Being part of the UK single market works well for firms like Stagecoach. Scottish employers have access to a market of 63million people across the UK, rather than five million people in Scotland. Where is the sense in putting up barriers between Scottish firms and their customers based elsewhere in the UK?' Scottish Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: 'Surely it's ironic for Brian Souter to wager an each way bet, mouthing off and bankrolling Yes Scotland on the one hand, despite it seems, his views as the public face of Stagecoach being far from representative of the very company he has built from scratch? 'Scotland and Stagecoach realise independence is a one-way ticket to a poorer nation.' The concerns raised by Stagecoach - over the impact on regulation and funding - is particularly embarrassing for First Minister Alex Salmond, who yesterday posed for selfie with former pupil and apprentice Rachel Kyle, at Ayrshire College Kilmarnock Campus in Ayrshire . Wrangling over the crucial TV debates between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling continued yesterday amid a farcical row over dates. Both sides have now accepted invitations from BBC and STV, but not to the same programmes. Better Together originally agreed to a live showdown on July 16 with STV, although Mr Salmond said he would only take part if it involved Prime Minister David Cameron. He insisted a debate with Mr Darling must wait until after Glasgow's Commonwealth Games. STV agreed to 'review' the proposed date as a result and August 5 has now been accepted by the First Minister's camp. However, Better Together chiefs are furious that Mr Salmond has been able to dictate the timing, with SNP strategists thought to be desperate for a contest closer to the referendum in the hope of receiving a bounce in the polls. The pro-Union campaign has therefore not agreed to the August 5 switch, but has accepted an invitation from the BBC to take part in a separate show on August 12. To confuse the matter further, the SNP has yet to accept the BBC's offer. A Better Together spokesman said: 'We are glad the BBC have begun serious discussions with both sides. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: 'When it comes down to the nitty-gritty of his business, even Brian Souter recognises the risks of independence. 'The questions on Alex Salmond's independence plans are stacking up day by day. 'With concerns now coming from their strongest supporters, the Nationalists should give people the facts they deserve on issues like set-up costs, EU membership and currency.' The overall Stagecoach report is encouraging for the company, with an operating profit of more than £200million, an increased share price and a reduced debt. Chief executive Martin Griffiths said: 'In the UK, we have placed record orders for new vehicles at our regional bus networks in 2014-15, a sign of our confidence in continuing to get people out of their cars and back on board the bus.' Yes campaigners played down the significance of Stagecoach's intervention. David Cairns, executive chairman of pro-independence group Business for Scotland, said: 'Brian Souter is on record as a business leader who will vote Yes, so we can build a more prosperous economy and fairer society.' A Stagecoach Group spokesman said: 'We ensure our investors are aware of relevant matters affecting our business, both risks and opportunities. 'This section of our preliminary results makes the point that our business operates in an environment which can be subject to political change. 'It highlights the September 2014 referendum on independence and the 2015 UK general election as events which could result in change. 'It is not a comment on the merits of Scottish independence, which we have consistently stated is a matter for the people of Scotland to decide. Stagecoach Group remains neutral on the issue.' A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'Investment in Scotland is booming in the run-up to the referendum, underlined by the Ernst & Young attractiveness survey showing foreign direct investment in Scotland last year reached its highest level for 16 years and Scotland retained its position as the top UK location for inward investment outside London. 'An independent Scotland will be a hugely attractive place to do business and invest in.'","Bus giant raises fears about impact of Yes vote on regulation and funding .

"By . Darren Boyle . FIFA president Sepp Blatter has admitted that it was 'a mistake' to choose Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. Blatter said that the technical report into Qatar's bid had warned that it was too hot but despite that, FIFA's executive committee had voted for the Middle Eastern country. However, despite his admission, the FIFA chief will not change the World Cup's destination, instead he will force through plans to run the 2022 tournament during the Qatari winter. And the winner is: Blatter names Qatar as the winning hosts back in December 2010 . Owning up: FIFA president Sepp Blatter says it was a mistake to award Qatar the 2022 World Cup . The temperature in Qatar between May and September ranges between 30C  and 50c with humidity of 90 percent. The area also suffers sandstorms during the dry season. In December and January, Qatar can be hit by rain showers, although the temperature will drop to mid to the mid 20s. Protestors believe that Qatar's human rights record and stance against homosexuality should preclude it from hosting the tournament. Speaking to Swiss television, Blatter claimed it was 'probable' that the tournament would be moved to the winter. In an interview with RTS he said: 'Yes, it was a mistake of course, but one makes lots of mistakes in life. 'The . technical report into Qatar said clearly it was too hot but the . executive committee - with a large majority - decided all the same to . play it in Qatar.' Blatter . denied that Qatar had 'bought' the competition while acknowledging the . bidder had spent a great deal of money on sponsorship and development . programmes. He added: 'No, I have never said it was bought, but that it was due to political considerations.' Later, . a FIFA spokesman clarified Blatter's earlier comments reiterating that . Qatar was still going to host the 2022 tournament. A . statement claimed: 'As explained in his answer to the journalist, the . president reiterated that the decision to organise the World Cup in . summer was an ""error"" based on the technical assessment report of the . bid, which had highlighted the extremely hot temperatures in summer in .

"By . Damien Gayle . A British company hopes to bring electric light to 1.5billion people who live off the grid with an incredible electric light that is powered by gravity. The GravityLight uses a sack of sand to gradually pull a piece of rope through a dynamo mechanism which generates electricity to power an LED light. A three-second pull on the rope to raise the sack will keep the LED bulb running for up to 30 minutes, its makers claim. Scroll down for video . The light, named GravityLight,works by suspending a bag filled with a heavy substance like rocks, dirt or sand from the light. London-based designers Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves of Therefore.com spent four years developing the light . London-based design and innovation initiative deciwatt.org designed the GravityLight as a sustainable lighting solution for the 1.5billion people in the world who have no reliable access to electricity. Most of these people rely on biomass fuels like kerosene for lighting once the Sun goes down, but such fuels can be hazardous to health - as well as posing a fire risk. Deciwatt.org, a division within design . company Therefore, which came up with the casing for the Psion range of . handheld computers, say the trend for rapid advances in technology has . made their product possible. Low power: A three-second pull on the rope to raise the sack will keep the LED bulb running for a full 30 minutes, it's makers claim . Their website cites Koomey's law, a . lesser-known parallel to Moore's law, which describes how the number of . computations possible per joule of energy has doubled roughly every year . and a half since the Fifties. The flip side of this is that relatively simple devices progressively need less energy to run, making possible a whole range of relatively simple gadgets that can be powered by unconventional means. The GravityLight was co-invented by Martin Riddiford, who designed the Psion hardware, and Jim Reeves, both directors at London-based Therefore. 'We've done a number of projects, including the Psion products - where the requirements were incredibly efficient in terms of power usage,' Mr Riddiford told The Register. 'The digital age has made products much power hungry but now there’s a reversal of that – everyone’s chasing lower power again.' Deciwatt.org appealed for backing from crowd funding website indiegogo.com, and have already more than tripled their goal. With the $55,000 initially requested they had promised to fund the manufacture of 1,000 gravity-powered lights for free distribution to impoverished communities in Africa and India. They have since been promised $183,407, with nearly a month left of their appeal. Kerosene is responsible for thousands of deaths across the developing world every year, deciwatt.org says on the GravityLamp indiegogo page - and it can be expensive. Sand not included: The GravityLight comes as an easy to assemble kit. Its makers say they hope to use backing from crowd funding to distribute 1,000 to impoverished communities in Africa and India . Elegant solution: The GravityLight in action. A sack containing sand or rocks gradually pulls a rope through the device's mechanism to gradually generate electricity . 'The World Bank estimates that, as a result, 780 million women and children inhale smoke which is equivalent to smoking 2 packets of cigarettes every day,' the page says. 'Sixty per cent of adult, female lung-cancer victims in developing nations are non-smokers. 'The fumes also cause eye infections and cataracts, but burning kerosene is also more immediately dangerous: 2.5 million people a year, in India alone, suffer severe burns from overturned kerosene lamps. 'Burning Kerosene also comes with a financial burden: kerosene for lighting ALONE can consume 10 to 20% of a household's income. 'This burden traps people in a permanent state of subsistence living, buying cupfuls of fuel for their daily needs, as and when they can.' Designers at Therefore: Left to right, Patrick Hunt, Martin Riddiford, Mario Siqueira and Jim Reeves. They say rapid advances in technology have made a range of low-powered gadgets possible . The device can also be used to power other small lights, a radio or to charge batteries . The bag is then pulled down by gravity feeding a belt through the light giving 30 minutes of power. The device can also be used to power other small lights, a radio or to charge batteries . Deciwatt.org explains how solar-powered lighting, often offered as an answer to these problems, is not yet an economical prospect for many poor communities. Solar panels are expensive and only produce electricity when the Sun shines, and when there is no sunlight the energy must be stored in expensive batteries. 'Very often, when buying a low cost solar lamp with an inbuilt rechargeable battery, a full third of what you're paying for is the battery, and you will need to replace it every few years. Assuming you can get a new battery,' the company says. The team is now investigating using the GravityLight technology to power other devices or even mobiles. 'The ultimate goal for our longer term research is to establish if/how small amounts of constant power can be utilised to provide access to the internet, from very remote locations, at incredibly low cost,' they say.","The GravityLight uses a sand-filled sack to pull a rope through a tiny generator to power an LED light .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A family from North Carolina had to change their vacation plans after a hotel canceled their reservation because of their son's service dog. Golden retriever Chip is never far from the side of Karen Vaughn's son, Beau, who has a rare form of epilepsy. But despite a law allowing service dogs in all facilities, the owner of Baton Rouge Best Western refused to have the animal on the hotel premises. Scroll down for video . Vital: Service dog Chip, who has been trained to spot the early signs of a seizure, goes everywhere with Beau . Ms Vaughn said she was shocked when she received an email telling her the family's reservation at the Siegen Inn had been cancelled. When the attorney and mother-of-two pushed for an explanation, she was told that the Best Western was not pet friendly. Chip is far from being a family pet however. The dog has been trained to alert Beau and his family before the 13-year-old, who has Landau-Kleffner Syndrome, suffers a seizure. And being right by his young owner's side - including in restaurants and on vacations - is never usually a problem. 'He's been at the hospital with Beau when Beau had to have surgery. He was in the pre-operative room,' Ms Vaughn told WAFB. Under the American with Disabilities Act, service dogs should be welcome at any place open to the public, and without prior notice. Canceled: The Siegen Inn, Baton Rouge, told the Vaughns they couldn't stay because the hotel is not pet friendly .

As a courtesy, the family always calls . ahead when staying in hotels to let the staff know a service dog will be . traveling with them. Ms Vaughn said that after alerting the Best Western in Baton Rouge, she was told the hotel could no longer honor her booking. 'We got an email saying due to unforeseen circumstances, they will not be able to honor our reservations,' she said. A reception later told WAFB that although she is aware of the law, the staff were unable to go against what the hotel owner had ruled. Best Western's corporate office has since reached out to Ms Vaughn, and offered to let her family stay at the hotel - but she declined their offer.

"By . Ben Spencer . Dog food companies are producing tins and packets containing huge amounts of salt, sugar, oils and fats, a former industry insider claims . The food we eat is subjected to incredibly close scrutiny - we fret over trans fats, count every calorie and agonise about cholesterol, sugar and salt. But we do not pay nearly enough attention to the food we feed our dogs, according to animal lovers. Dog food companies are producing tins and packets containing huge amounts of salt, sugar, oils and fats, a former industry insider claims. They are even putting in food colouring, despite the fact dogs are colour blind. Labels do not give us nearly enough information about what is in the cans we buy each week, campaigners say. David Jackson, a former pet industry nutritionist, has found a product advertising as a 'succulent moist chicken' meal - but it contains just 4 per cent chicken. The Bakers Complete Chicken and Vegetable meal details on its ingredients lists unidentified 'meat and animal derivatives in the chunk' as making up 26 per cent, with chicken making up just 4 per cent. Mr Jackson has set up a new website, whichdogfood.co.uk, to inform dog owners about the food we feed our four-legged friends. He claims that the additives and fat in pet food is contributing towards dogs' obesity and behavioural problems, including hyperactivity. Mr Jackson, who used to work as a nutritionist for a number of pet food companies, said: 'For so long, pet food manufacturers have been able to get away with producing, frankly, awful foods for our pets. 'The most successful foods in the UK all have two things in common - low grade ingredients and elevated prices. 'Most consumers simply aren't aware that alternatives exist and the health problems that low grade foods often bring are so widespread that many pet owners simply disregard them as a normal part of a dog's life. Labels do not give us nearly enough information about what is in the cans we buy each week, campaigners say (stock picture) 'So many dogs are living short, . problem-filled lives and nobody is blinking an eye.' His claims are . dismissed by multinational giants - including Nestle and Mars - which . dominate the £500million-a-year industry. And some vets are also sceptical. The . British Veterinary Association said dogs have adapted to eating almost . anything so do not need to pay as much attention to their food as . humans. Robin Hargreaves, the association's . president, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'My advice to my clients is you . can feed most dogs most things. 'They . are scavengers so I don't get as precious about diet as some might . because they have coped with an incredible variety of foods over . thousands of years.' 'Mars and Nestle have paid some people a lot of money to formulate diets and the chances are they will make a better dog food than you will.' He said that the dog obesity is due to feeding dogs too much, rather than the wrong things, as well as a lack of exercise. A spokesman for Bakers, which is owned by Nestle, said: 'Regarding the 4 per cent declaration, this is a pet food industry-wide labelling requirement. 'That doesn't mean there is only 4 per cent of that meat in the food. 'Our recipes will also contain other meat proteins such as poultry, turkey and lamb. These will be classed as 'Meat and animal derivatives' rather than listed individually to allow for supply fluctuations during the year depending on availability and in some instances the seasons.' Mars Petcare UK - which owns Pedigree - said: 'Mars Petcare is globally recognised for its expertise in pet nutrition. 'Our understanding of the needs of pets is based on 50 years of scientific research from the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, which is the world-leading scientific authority on the health and nutrition of pets and continues to advance the frontiers of our knowledge on pet nutrition. 'In the UK our main-meal wet pet foods contain up to 60 per cent meat and animal derivatives and our dry food range contains approximately 20 per cent.

"By . Chris Parsons . The BBC rejected a campaign to erect a statue of George Orwell outside Broadcasting House in London because the author was 'too left-wing'. The 1984 author, who worked as a journalist for the Corporation during World War Two, was the subject of a campaign to get a statue in his honour outside BBC's Broadcasting House near Oxford Circus, central London. But Baroness Joan Bakewell, who is leading the campaign to honour 'the greatest British journalist of his day', said outgoing BBC director general Mark Thompson turned down plans for the statue. Inspirational: George Orwell (real name Eric Arthur Blair), worked for the BBC during World War Two before leaving to publish Animal Farm and 1984 . Orwell produced radio programmes at Broadcasting House during World War Two, before leaving to write Animal Farm and dystopian masterpiece 1984. Baroness Bakewell, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said she put the idea to Mr Thompson in a meeting earlier this year. Campaign: Baroness Joan Bakewell is leading the campaign for a statue of Orwell . She said: 'I met Mark Thompson at a BBC reception and mentioned the project. 'He said, 'Oh no, Joan, we can’t possibly. It’s far too Left-wing an idea.' Mr Thompson has been appointed chief executive of the New York Times Company, which publishes the New York Times, and will hand over to new BBC director general George Entwistle next month. The campaign to honour Orwell outside Broadcasting House has raised more than £60,000 and gained the support of currently-serving journalists including Andrew Marr and James Naughtie. The BBC confirmed that plans for a statue in the piazza outside Broadcasting House had been turned down, saying the area already houses Mark Pimlott’s £1.6million work World. A spokesperson for the Corporation . added that there were plans to put the Orwell statue on a nearby site in . Portland Place, which does not belong to the BBC. A . spokesperson said: 'We cannot put the statue immediately outside New . Broadcasting House as the BBC piazza already has artwork by Mark Pimlott . built into the pavement which would be obscured. 'We are, however, working with . Westminster city council and those involved with the statue to find an . appropriate location nearby.' The statue was commissioned by the George Orwell Memorial Trust run by Ben Whitaker, a former Labour politician. Denied: Mark Thompson, the outgoing director . general of the BBC, rejected plans for an Orwell statue outside . Broadcasting House near Oxford Circus, right. Orwell first started working at the BBC in 1941, working as a Talks Producer for the Corporation's Eastern Service. He initially supervised broadcasts to India designed to counteract German propaganda, working full time for the BBC until 1943. Martin Jennings, the sculptor commissioned to create it, told the Telegraph: 'George Orwell is regarded as something of a patron saint of political journalism so his presence near the BBC could surely act as some kind of inspiration to all independent-minded broadcasters.' Fans of George Orwell may want to remind Mark Thompson of the hatred felt by many on the Left towards the author after his searing condemnation of Communism in Animal Farm and 1984. Early in his career, Orwell certainly harboured disgust with aspects of imperialism and capitalism. But these views changed dramatically during the Spanish Civil War when he was caught up in a bloody purge by Spain's increasingly Communist-controlled Republican Government. Writing on MailOnline, RightMinds columnist Nigel Jones said: 'The experience of being hunted by the secret police and seeing his comrades arrested, tortured and killed by the Spanish Stalinists and their Russian bosses gave Orwell an abiding horror of Marxism, Soviet Communism and Stalin's many British apologists - including his own publisher, Victor Gollancz, who refused to publish Orwell's account of his Spanish experiences ""Homage to Catalonia"" for fear of upsetting the Communists.' Orwell saw what horrors could be committed in the name of 'socialism' and, although he did quit the BBC during the war to become literary editor of Left-wing Tribune magazine, he went on to publish the dystopian novels Animal Farm and 1984, the most cutting indictments of Marxist totalitarianism ever written. Mr Jones said: 'A doughty warrior in the cause of liberty, free thought and political prose as clear as a glass pane, Orwell deserves his statue all right - but on second thoughts perhaps Mark Thompson is right. 'Today's BBC - aka the Ministry of Truth (from 1984) - might not be the best place for it after all.'","Iconic author worked as political journalist for BBC during World War Two .

"By . Mark Duell . Heathrow worker: Nohad Halawi, 49, says she was wrongly accused of being 'anti-Islam' A Christian working at London Heathrow Airport has claimed that harassment by fundamentalist Muslim colleagues led to her dismissal. Nohad Halawi, 49, says she was wrongly accused of being ‘anti-Islam’ and unlawfully dismissed while working as a uniformed beauty consultant in the duty-free shop at Terminal 3. Having now taken her case to the Court of Appeal, she is appealing against employment tribunal decisions that, because she was self-employed, she was not a ‘worker or employee’ entitled to seek the protection of unfair dismissal and anti-discrimination laws. Mrs Halawi, from Weybridge, Surrey, asserts that she and other Christian staff were victims of systematic harassment, with one friend reduced to tears for wearing a cross. She has consistently argued there was ‘a significant rise in Islamic fundamentalism at Heathrow Airport’ in the period leading up to her dismissal, but management was ‘unwilling to stand up to this because of fears of being labelled Islamophobic’. She said in a statement to the tribunals she was ‘well-known for standing up on behalf of those Muslims bullied by the extremists’. In one incident, a Muslim colleague ‘misheard’ a conversation she was having and mistakenly thought she had criticised Islam. Soon after she was accused of being anti-Islam, and faced an internal investigation followed by dismissal in July 2011 from a job she had held for over 13 years. Her case of unlawful religious discrimination was rejected by an employment tribunal in 2012, and then by the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in October last year. With the support of the Christian Legal Centre (CLC), she is challenging the EAT decision in the Court of Appeal. Mrs Halawi, who came to Britain from Lebanon in 1977, worked for Autogrill Retail UK, which trades as World Duty Free (WDF). Employment: Mrs Halawi worked at Heathrow for Autogrill Retail UK, which trades as World Duty Free (WDF) Paul Diamond, appearing for Mrs Halawi, told three appeal judges - Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Christopher Clarke and Mr Justice Barling - it was a case of ‘workplace religious discrimination’. Although Mrs Halawi provided her services through a limited company she had set up, she was entitled to protection under EU employment law because she ‘for all intents and purposes was a shop worker’. Mr Diamond said she was paid a fixed standing wage by WDF and was in ‘a position of subordination’. Mr Diamond argued that it was a case of ‘disguised employment’. When WDF took away her store pass allowing her to work ‘airside’ she was no longer able to continue her job. Airport: She has consistently argued there was 'a significant rise in Islamic fundamentalism at Heathrow' in the period leading up to her dismissal. Terminal 3, her workplace, is pictured . He argued that WDF ‘liberally uses the . power of removal of the pass as a tool of employment control’ believing . its use was ‘beyond the purview of employment tribunals’. Legal action: Mrs Halawi, of Weybridge, Surrey, came to Britain from Lebanon in 1977 . Mrs . Halawi is appealing against a ruling by EAT judge Mr Justice Langstaff. He said in an October 4 judgment that he shared an ‘uneasy feeling’ that the airside arrangements were such that Mrs Halawi ‘could have been . the victim of discrimination and yet have no right to complain to a . tribunal’. But she could not sue as an employee as she did not have a contract of employment and could not be classed as a worker, the judge ruled. WDF is opposing her appeal and arguing that the judge was right. Mr Diamond said the case raised ‘wide-ranging and important issues’ which had not been fully analysed or tested by the employment tribunals. The CLC says 22 of Mrs Halawi's Heathrow . colleagues, including other Muslim workers, signed a petition saying . they were ‘shocked and saddened’ by her dismissal ‘as a result of . malicious and unfounded allegations made against her’. CLC chief executive Andrea Williams said: ‘This is a clear case of injustice involving a Christian worker which was obvious to many of Nohad's colleagues - including some Muslim colleagues - who signed a petition protesting against her dismissal. 'This is a clear case of injustice . involving a Christian worker which was obvious to many of Nohad's . colleagues - including some Muslim colleagues - who signed a petition . protesting against her dismissal' Andrea Williams, Christian Legal Centre . ‘In order for us to challenge Nohad's unfair dismissal, and the unequal treatment of Christians in the workplace, we need a judge to rule that she was in fact employed. 'This is why we're supporting Nohad as her case goes to the Court of Appeal.’ Ms Williams added: ‘This is an issue of justice affecting thousands of people and their right to proper protection if they work at the command of others and are subordinate to them, even if they have self-employed status.’ Diya Sen Gupta, appearing for WDF, told the judges there was . no suggestion that Mrs Halawi had been forced into the working arrangements she . had made with WDF. She had gone to an accountant for advice and accepted a . self-employment package with tax and flexibility advantages. Ms Sen Gupta said: ‘There is no suggestion by the claimant . that WDF forced her in any way to enter into this arrangement. This was not a . disguised employment relationship.’ The appeal judges reserved judgment to a later date.","Nohad Halawi says she was unlawfully dismissed from T3 duty-free shop .

Cheryl Prudham, 32, and husband Rob, 29, who are expecting twin girls in September, were pictured last month in shorts and flip-flops soaking up the sun on a break with their brood in Menorca, Spain. They stayed at the three-star Hotel Victoria Playa in Santo Tomas, which has two swimming pools and a beach nearby, and Mrs Prudham claimed she was not concerned about using taxpayers’ money.

The mother, who lives in a five-bedroom council house with her family in Gravesend, Kent, told Closer magazine: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday. ‘We spent our days going for walks on the beach, having toasties by the pool and watching the hotel entertainment in the evenings. One of our rooms had a sea view.’ Mrs Prudham, who has admitted smoking during pregnancy and taking her children out of school in term time, is expecting twin girls in September, and will get a further £1,400 a year in child benefit. She added: ‘I asked the school headmaster if we could get time off, but he said ""no"". So we decided to go anyway.

We’d pay it off gradually - there’s no way we could afford a big lump sum.’ ‘I haven’t put a limit on how many more children I’ll have.

You’re not going to say no to money if it’s offered to you.’ Soaking up the sun: The Prudham family pictured on holiday in Menorca today with their growing brood . The couple said that they . had been enjoying quality time with children George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, . nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, three, Lenny, . two, and Lainey, one. Mr . Prudham told MailOnline last month: ‘We’re having a great time. I’d like . to buy a villa out here. The kids deserved a holiday – it’s nice for . them – and we just want to spend time with them.’ Mr . Prudham also said of critics of their lifestyle: ‘I’m not bothered what . other people think. They’re just stuck up. People are just jealous. 'It’s . none of anybody else’s business. Other people like us go on holiday all . the time and it doesn’t matter if it is in England or abroad, it all . costs the same'. The couple . could be fined more than £800 after taking their children on holiday . during term time. ‘I’m not worried about the school fines. It is up to . us when we go on holiday’, Mr Prudham said. Mrs . Prudham, who posted a selfie with her husband on Facebook while on . holiday, was also seen smoking while her children were splashing in the . pool. When asked how she could justify a fortnight abroad, she told The Sun last month: 'We can't even enjoy a family holiday'. Abroad: The also admitted headteachers had warned them not to go on holiday in term time, but they went anyway, which means they face fines of £60 per child - a total of £840 . And commenting on smoking while pregnant, she added: 'I'm not drinking though, am I? I asked my midwife and she said to me it would be worse if I give up because I would get too stressed out. So I've cut down'. The couple also admitted headteachers had . warned them not to go on holiday in term time, but they went anyway, . which means they face fines of £60 per child - a total of £840. 'I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday' Cheryl Prudham . TaxPayers' Alliance spokesman Andy Silvester said: 'Taxpayers won't be convinced that chipping in for a sunny Spanish holiday is the best way for their money to be used.’ In April, part-time carer Mrs Prudham said her twins would be her last, and that she planned to be sterilised so she could focus on her career. Mrs Prudham said: ‘For one, I work more hours than what they are saying and two, I'm going to be sterilised. I'm going to have a caesarean and I'm going to get sterilised at the same time. ‘I'm glad that I am pregnant with twins and I am amazed by it. It’s not anybody else's business. I do a job that most people couldn't do. I care for the elderly every single day.’ Home life: This is the Prudams' council house in Gravesend, Kent, but they want to move again because they do not like the area . Mrs Prudham added: ‘I don't give a s*** if people are on my side or not. I don't care. ‘It is actually no one else's business . about what I choose to do in life. It doesn't matter what you say people . are still going to judge you. They are still going to bad mouth you.

Obviously I want to carry on my career and things like that.’ The parents have been involved in a long-running battle over their council house, because they said they needed a bigger one for all their family. They used to live in a tiny home in Sittingbourne, Kent, and first demanded a new home last year after hearing about other families on benefits who had landed huge properties. They repeatedly bid for new council . homes through Kent Homechoice, which works alongside Kent County . Council. However, they were left furious when they were turned down by . the authority. Instead they agreed a house swap with a family living in Gravesend, who wanted to downsize. But Mrs Prudham said previously she is unhappy with the new £200,000 home - because they do not like the neighbourhood. She . added: ‘We've been here for about three months but I'm not really happy . with the new house. We've got enough room but it's just we had to move . out of Sittingbourne and we liked it there. ‘But . there was nothing available there so I had to do a mutual exchange here . and I don't really like it here to be honest. I'm not going to be able . to go back to Sittingbourne.’","Cheryl and Rob Prudham went on holiday with nine children to Menorca .

"By . Mark Duell . British Airways tries to pride itself on ensuring passengers make it comfortably from one location to another - but even if the plane gets there, sometimes the people on board do not. And a new documentary has revealed how staff at the airline have been warned not to hide dead bodies in the toilet during a flight - because it is both undignified and a safety hazard. Cameras have filmed training sessions for BBC2 programme A Very British Airline, showing how crews are taught to deal with medical emergencies in the sky. Scroll down for video . Dealing with emergencies: Cameras have filmed training sessions for BBC2 programme A Very British Airline . In the cabin: Staff at the airline have been warned not to hide dead bodies in the toilet during a flight . Admitting that managing a dead body during a flight is a ‘grey area’, a lead trainer tells new staff: ‘You cannot put a dead passenger in the toilet. It’s not respectful and it’s not strapped in for landing. ‘If they slid off the toilet, they would end up on the floor. You would have to take the aircraft apart to get that person out. Imagine putting someone in the aircraft toilet?’ According to The Independent, she added that one former solution employed by BA staff was to prop up dead customers in their seats and pretend they were sleeping. She said: ‘It’s what we used to do many years ago – give them a vodka and tonic... and eye-shades and they were like, they’re fine. We don’t do that.’ The trainer added that she knew a member of crew who once had to sit next to a dead passenger for the rest of a flight. The bodies are often moved to an empty seat in first or business class. But they are told not to put dead passengers in the toilets because of the problems caused by rigor mortis setting in - making it very difficult to remove the body from a small space. On the ground: The documentary looks at how some of BA's 40,000 staff work to meet the airline’s standards . Training: The show, which starts next Monday, follows the training of new recruits Alice, Patrick and Jodi . The documentary looks at how some of BA's 40,000 staff work to meet the airline’s standards, in the backdrop of the business facing financial problems and increased competition. 'If they slid off the toilet, they would end up on the floor. You would have to take the aircraft apart to get that person out' The first episode looks at ‘millionaire’s door’ at London Heathrow Terminal Five, which includes a lounge, restaurant, spa and champagne bar reserved for those who fly in first class. The show, which is narrated by Green Wing and Episodes actor Stephen Mangan, follows the training of new recruits Alice, Patrick and Jodi. BBC2 documentaries commissioner Emma Willis said: ‘This three-part series will capture the immense complexities of a business that powers the nation and will offer a unique insight into British Airways’ future.’ Nick Catliff, managing director for production company Lion Television, said: ‘BA is a business of course, but it’s also an iconic British institution with a unique culture and history.’","Cameras filmed training sessions for BBC2 show A Very British Airline .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A Maryland girl who disappeared after her mother was found dead last week has been located following a nationwide search, authorities say. The girl, 11-year-old Caitlyn Virts, was located along with her father, Timothy Virts, in a motel in Florence, South Carolina, police said late Friday. She and her father had been missing since the body of the girl's mother, Bobby Jo Cortez, was found at her home Thursday. Police have since charged Timothy Virts with first-degree murder in the slaying of Cortez, 36. Manhunt: Timothy Virts abducted his daughter, Caitlyn, and brought her to a motel in South Carolina . The father and his daughter were staying at the Colonial Inn when they were discovered by the owner . The girl was found unharmed, according . to a statement by the Baltimore County Police Department. Virts is in . police custody and will be returned to Maryland 'pending an extradition . process,' the statement said. Police hope to return the girl home as . soon as possible. 'Detectives . will be traveling to South Carolina as soon as possible to continue the . investigation,' said Corp. John Wachter in a statement. Virts . and his daughter were located at the Colonial Inn, according to local . police in Florence. They first rented a room on Thursday night, said . owner Carol Gause. 'They . looked fine. She just walked right up with her father. I didn't notice . anything,' Gause said by phone from the hotel on Saturday. Gause . was checking her Facebook page from the front desk around 7 p.m. Friday . when she saw the Amber Alert posted by a friend and immediately . recognized Virts and his daughter. She called police and officers . quickly arrived. She said Virts was arrested without problems and his . daughter appeared to be OK. 'I . was startled, but I wasn't worried or frightened. You don't expect to . ever be involved in something like this,' Gause said. 'But I called . police and they took over.' The . search for Timothy Virts and his daughter, Caitlyn, become a nationwide . operation, with police believing his daughter could be in danger. Getaway car: Virts was believed to be using this 1999 Dodge Durango that has Maryland plates . Police tried to track down Virts, who was believed to be using a car belonging to the husband of his alleged victim . The FBI believed Virts, 38, may have . left the state and taken Caitlyn with him after Ms Cortez's body was . discovered at her Dundalk home. An autopsy was due to take place on Friday, and police have not said what used to inflict the injuries. Police . spokeswoman Elise Armacost said probable cause for the murder charge . was based on physical evidence and interviews with people in the house . at the time Ms Cortez was killed. Caitlyn's twin sister and Ms Cortez's young son, as well as two other adults, were also living at the home. Armacost said Virts had been staying there too, for the past several weeks. The FBI said that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland has charged Virts with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Victim: Bobbie Jo Cortez was found in her home, covered in multiple cuts, on Thursday . The agency searched nationwide for Caitlyn and Virts and put up digital billboards across the country on the search. An Amber Alert issued in Maryland was expanded late Thursday to include West Virginia. A police spokesman told WUSA9 they believed Virts had connections to West Virginia and were 'doing our due diligence' to follow tips. He was thought to be driving a black 1999 Dodge Durango with Maryland plates 5AJ4458. The car is registered to Ms Cortez's husband, Daniel Williams Cortez. Mr Cortez, 38, is currently being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center on sexual assault charges. Police said they do not believe he has anything to do with the murder of his wife.","The girl, 11-year-old Caitlyn Virts, was located along with her father, Timothy Virts, in a motel in Florence, South Carolina .

"By . Hannah Roberts . and Suzannah Hills . Updated: . 15:02 EST, 26 February 2012 . Presidential hopeful: Rick Santorum has criticised President Barack Obama's apology for the burning of Korans at a U.S base in Afghanistan . Rick Santorum has condemned President Barack Obama's apology for the burning of Korans at a U.S base in Afghanistan. The Republican presidential hopeful added that Afghanistan should apologise to the U.S. for the deaths of four U.S. soldiers during six days of violence sparked by the incident. 'There was nothing deliberately done wrong here,' Santorum told ABC's This Week today. 'This was something that happened as a mistake. Killing Americans in uniform is not a mistake. It was something that deliberate.' The comments came as it emerged that two senior U.S. military advisers shot dead in their office yesterday were targeted after they failed to take protests seriously. And another eight U.S. servicemen were wounded in a grenade attack today in the violent protests that have engulfed Afghanistan this week, killing around 30 people. At least two demonstrators were also killed. 'The response needs to be apologized . for by (President Hamid) Karzai and the Afghan people for attacking and . killing our men and women in uniform and overreacting to this . inadvertent mistake,' Santorum explained on NBC's 'Meet the Press'. 'That is the real crime here, not what our soldiers did.' The . president's apology suggests that there is blame and that the U.S. did . something wrong 'in the sense of doing a deliberate act,' Santorum said. Santorum . says that rather than saying he was sorry, Obama should have only . acknowledged that burning copies of Islam's holiest book in a trash pit . was wrong and taken responsibility for the incident, 'but to apologise, I . think, lends credibility that somehow or another that it was more than . that.' Fired up: Activists of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz burn an effigy of US President Barack Obama during a protest in Quetta after American troops burned copies of the Koran . Santorum is the latest Republican to criticise Obama for apologising for burning the religious materials. Despite apologies from the president and other U.S. officials for what they said was a mistake, their regrets have not quelled the anger of Afghans, who viewed the Quran burnings as an illustration of what they perceive as foreign disrespect for their culture and religion. Today's protest turned violent as 400 demonstrators stormed a U.S forward operating base in the northern province of Kundaz's largest city. An official says people in the crowd fired on police. NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) confirmed there had been an explosion outside one of its bases. Afghan authorities launched a massive . manhunt for a suspect in the execution of the two advisers . inside the Ministry of the Interior compound. 'There is a suspect who is an . employee of the Interior Ministry. He has been identified. Right now the . police are trying to arrest him. He is on the run,' the Afghan Interior . Ministry said in a statement, citing initial findings by investigators. Spreading: Anti-US protests have caught on in Pakistan as a  demonstrator wears a mask of US President Barack Obama . Demonstration: Protesters lynch an Obama effigy in Pakistan . Violent demonstrations: Protester burns U.S flags during an anti-American rally in Karachi . Meanwhile an account of events inside the Ministry has surfaced. The two advisers had been mocking the demonstrators, according to a government source . As they watched video footage of . protesters the two senior officers 'scolding the protesters and calling . them bad names,'the anonymous source told the New York Post. 'They called the Koran a bad book in . the presence of the guy. After all this the guy had verbal arguments . with the advisers and was threatened by them. He gets angry and shoots . them. Eight rounds were fired at them.' 'He then sneaks out and disappears. No one knew about the incident for more than an hour because the room is . soundproofed,' he said. CCTV footage has been viewed as part of the . investigation. The suspect has been named locally as . 25-year-old Abdul Saboor, who had studied in Pakistan who had risen . through the ranks after coming to work at the ministry as a driver in . 2007. In an unprecedented measure all NATO personnel have been . recalled from Afghan ministries. Security: An Afghan policeman mans a check point in Kabul. Authorities have launched a massive manhunt for the killer of two U.S. senior advisers yesterday . Manhunt: The suspect in the executions of two U.S. advisers is an employee of the Interior Ministry who is now on the run from police . About 30 people have been killed in . the violence since it emerged Tuesday that copies of the Muslim holy . book and other religious materials had been thrown into a fire pit used . to burn garbage at Bagram Air Field, a large U.S. base north of Kabul. Afghan President Hamid Karzai renewed his calls for calm in a televised address to the nation Sunday. 'Now is the time to return to calm . and not let our enemies use this situation,' he said. Asked about the . unprecedented recall of NATO staff, Karzai said it was understandable. 'It is a temporary step at a time when the people of Afghanistan are angry over the burning of the holy Quran,' Karzai said. The Taliban claimed that the shooter . was one of their sympathisers and that an accomplice had helped him get . into the compound to kill the Americans in retaliation for the Quran . burnings. Members of the international military . coalition described the removal of advisers as a temporary security . measure, stressing that they did not expect it to affect partnerships . with the Afghans that are key to preparing the country's security forces . to take on more responsibility as international troops draw down. Peace order: Afghan President Hamid Karzai renewed his calls for calm in a televised address to the nation today . 'We continue to move forward and . stand by our Afghan partners in this campaign. We will not let this . divide the coalition,' said Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, a spokesman for . the international force. The NATO recall affects advisers numbered 'in . the low hundreds,' Cummings said. The U.S. government had already . ordered its government advisers to stay inside the secure embassy . compound earlier in the week out of fear of retribution, said Gavin . Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman. Catherine Arnold, a spokeswoman for the . British Embassy, said Britain that 'as a temporary measure' the embassy . has 'withdrawn civilian mentors and advisers from institutions within . Kabul and that we're keeping the situation under review.' She declined . to say how many people were affected by the decision. President Barack Obama and other U.S. officials have apologised for what they said was a mistake, but their . regrets did not quell the anger of Afghans, who viewed the Quran . burnings as an illustration of what they perceive as foreign disrespect . for their culture and religion. The attacks on U.S. service members . were the latest in a rising number of incidents where Afghan soldiers . or policemen, or gunmen wearing their uniforms, have killed NATO forces. Last month, France suspended its training program and threatened to . withdraw its forces from Afghanistan a year ahead of schedule after an . Afghan soldier shot and killed four French soldiers on a base in the . east.

NATO . forces had advisers embedded in many Afghan ministries, both as trainers . and to help manage the transition to Afghan control and foreign forces . prepare to withdraw by the end of 2014. The Afghan Interior Ministry oversees all of the country's police, so had numerous NATO advisers. Inevitably the latest shooting has . raised questions over security at what should be one of the most secure . compounds in the city. General John Allen said the recall of advisers is . 'for obvious force protection reasons' but the alliance remains . committed to its partnership with the Afghan government. He said NATO is investigating Saturday's shooting and will pursue all leads to find the person responsible for the attack. 'The perpetrator of this attack is a coward whose actions will not go unanswered,' Allen said . The fatal shooting comes soon after three protesters were shot dead by Afghan security forces. The situation was already fragile as . NATO forces attempt to bring stability to the region before foreign . troops withdraw by the end of 2014.

"By . Martin Robinson . This winter has been the wettest in at least 248 years, and the fifth warmest since 1910. So perhaps it will surprise few that it will finish with snow and sleet. This morning – the last day of winter in the forecasters’ calendar – snow and sleet is sweeping across Wales, southern England and parts of the Midlands. As Communities Secretary Eric Pickles warned last night that the widespread flooding is set to continue for months, the Met Office confirmed that England and Wales have suffered the wettest winter since records began in 1766. Taste of things to come: Snow returned to County Durham today but the Met Office is warning that sleep and snow will fall across England and Wales today . Having fun: Monty, a Springer Spaniel enjoying a walk after fresh snow falls in Weardale but for millions snow could cause misery with hazardous conditions on the roads . Today: Snow has fallen on northern  moorland and roads in the Pennines yesterday but the Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for today . But the same Atlantic weather systems that caused the relentless rain and floods have also created a remarkably warm winter. Few . parts of southern England have seen any snow, with only sporadic . snowfalls in the north, and many areas have not had a frost since . November. The average temperature this winter has been a mild 5.2C . (41F) – 1.5C above what is expected. Southern England saw 12 per cent . more sunshine than average. Snow has been forecast for parts of the UK today . It has marked a dramatic change from the . previous three winters, which saw heavy blizzards throughout the UK and . below-average temperatures. Last year the three months of winter – . December, January and February – averaged 3.3C (38F). With the exception . of 2011-12, which averaged 4.6C (40F), every other winter since 2007-08 . has been colder than average. Mr Pickles said last night: ‘Further . groundwater flooding is unfortunately expected over the coming days in . the South and South East, and may be an issue for some months to come. ‘Local resilience forums continue to assess the risk to property.’ Forecasters . yesterday issued a yellow warning for snow, urging people to take care . of hazardous conditions on the roads, but said the snow was unlikely to . settle below high ground. Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: . ‘Areas in the South East and West as well as the south-west Midlands may . see some slushy snow. Towards Bristol and Wales is also similar. We . were expecting more but we’ve revised our predictions. ‘The yellow . warning is in place from 2am till 3pm on Friday. It’s likely to be . slushy snow – we doubt it will settle. We’re not expecting it to be too . widespread. ‘Temperatures are cooler than they have been earlier this month but this isn’t out of the ordinary.’ Records . dating back to 1766 – the oldest weather data set in the world – show . that December, January and February have been the wettest ever recorded . in England and Wales. The weather series, which is compiled by the . Oxford Radcliffe Observatory on behalf of the Met Office, started . recording data from 50 weather stations in the 18th century. Today the information comes from thousands of hi-tech stations, which feed powerful computers. The . information shows 17.1in (435mm) of rain fell between December 1 and . February 24 this year, beating the previous highest total of 16.6in . (423mm) in 1915. Paul Mott from weather forecasters MeteoGroup, said snow was likely on high ground over 300 metres. He said: 'Through this morning there will be some snow likely over the hills of Wales and maybe over some western parts of the Midlands, Shropshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. 'It will mostly be confined to the hills, which could have a covering of between 1cm and 3cm (0.4in to 1.2in), and will continue through up until 9am or 10am, when it will die away.' Picture of Britain: Experts revealed today the past winter, which ends today, has been the wettest for 250 years .

"By . Bianca London . Last week Queen Letizia flaunted a new hairstyle, which gave the appearance of a . swish bob, at the Prince of Girona Awards ceremony held at the Palacio . de Congresos of Girona in Catalonia.

"By . Paul Donnelley . England’s ‘model’ councils will get a greater share of a multi-million pound fund being set aside to repair the country’s potholes. The government is launching its biggest investment in roads since the 1970s, putting aside £168million to repair the potholes that blight the country’s roads and frustrate motorists. More than three million potholes will be filled in by March next year and the money will be spread 148 councils. Each will get a share but those councils who demonstrate ‘best practice in highways maintenance’ will get additional funding.

Among . these are Northamptonshire, which will get £3.3million after it . initiated systems to track pothole repairs in real time, allowing it to . deploy teams and co-ordinate work more effectively.

Some £10million is also earmarked for London, the Department for Transport said. As well as damaging cars, potholes can cause fatal accidents. Martyn Uzzell, a 51-year-old service engineer, on a charity ride from Land’s End to John O’Groats, died instantly from severe head injuries when he was thrown into the path of the car behind him after his bike hit a four-inch deep pothole on the A65 at Giggleswick, North Yorkshire. Gertrude Donaldson, a retired nurse who served in India during the Second World War, was walking around numerous potholes and 'unclear' road markings in Station Road car park, Kendal, Cumbria when she was hit and killed by a reversing van. The owners of the car park, Jaymar Estates, were found guilty of breaching health and safety guidelines and were fined £95,000, with £50,000 costs. Forty-five per cent of drivers say that they have had an accident or near miss because of a pothole. The money must be used to repair potholes or ensure that they do not appear in the first place. Councils will also have to publish updates on works every three months so residents can see how repairs are progressing, and all work has to be completed by March 2015. Patrick McLoughlin, the Transport Secretary, said: ‘Potholes are the bane of all our lives and the funding announced today is an important step in ridding our roads of this menace. ‘But it is only one part of a massive programme of investment to get our country up to speed as part of this government’s long-term economic plan. By building, repairing and renewing our key infrastructure we will ensure the future growth and prosperity of this country.’ The £168million pothole funding was announced by Chancellor George Osborne in March’s Budget, and is in addition to the extra £185million the government made available that month to help repair local roads damaged by severe weather. Some £24billion will be spent on England’s motorways and A-roads between 2010 and 2021, the biggest investment in the road network since the 1970s. The Government said a further £7.4billion would committed to local roads in the next Parliament, along with funding from the £12billion Local Growth Fund. 1 If it’s safe, gather evidence of the pothole as soon as you can, including photographs, measurements and position on the road (for example, is it on a blind corner?). 2 Report the pothole to the relevant council or to the Highways Agency. Councils are responsible for A and B roads, and inner-city roads. Motorways are the responsibility of the Highways Agency. 3 Obtain a full breakdown of costs for all damage caused by the pothole. If you incur additional costs, keep a record of these but remember that you might not get any or all of your expenditure back and that any unrealistic or extravagant claims are likely to be turned down. 4 Submit a Freedom of Information Act request to the relevant council or to the Highways Agency to establish how often  the road is inspected or maintained. To find out how to do this, type the name of the authority you are claiming against, along with the words ‘freedom of information’, into an internet search engine, and you will find the relevant web page. 5 Download the national code of good practice for highway maintenance and familiarise yourself with the guidance on highways management. 6 Write a detailed letter to the local authority explaining exactly what happened. Include a map of the area, marking the location of the pothole. Highlight your costs and explain that you wish to claim for compensation. Your letter might eventually be read out in court, so keep it factual and concise. 7 Your claim may be initially rejected under Section 58 of the Highways Act 1980. This allows a council or the Highways Agency to defend claims on the basis that they had taken reasonable measures to ensure potholes were found and dealt with swiftly. Provided they have followed their system of regular repairs and inspections, they may be successful in rejecting your claim. 8 Use your FoI request information and the checklist at Potholes.co.uk to evaluate the local authority’s defence against your claim. If you think you still have a case, write back to the authority pointing out the discrepancies and include evidence in the form of paperwork and photographs. Inform them that you don’t consider they have satisfied Section 58. Remember, finding discrepancies doesn’t automatically lead to a successful  claim. There could be a reasonable explanation or you may have misinterpreted the information.They might also be prepared to defend the discrepancy in court. 9 If the local authority still refuses your claim, think carefully how you want to proceed. You might even want to take some legal advice at this stage as you may end up spending more money in court fees than you receive in compensation. Small claims are effective for taking action for small amounts and can now be completed online at Moneyclaim. 10 If an offer is made, be willing to negotiate. You might not be entitled to claim for all the costs you incur.

"By . Steve Doughty . and Larisa Brown . Britain's most senior Catholic cleric - Cardinal Keith O'Brien - stands alongside his long-standing friend, Jimmy Savile. Pictured giving a thumbs-up, he is seen grinning alongside the paedophile at a fund-raising event in Edinburgh six years ago. The former leader of Scotland’s Catholics stepped down yesterday amid accuations of 'inappropriate acts' towards fellow priests. He strongly denies all claims against him. Cardinal Keith O’Brien was among many high-powered supporters of Savile who did not know about the entertainer’s sexual abuse of children. Scroll down for video . Friends: Jimmy Savile, left, and Cardinal Keith O'Brien were pictured together in Edinburgh in 2007 as the pair unveiled a £375,000 vehicle for the disabled . Resigned: The cardinal, who stepped down yesterday, was seen looking out of a window at his home in Edinburgh, Scotland, today . He met the former DJ and charity . fundraiser in the 1970s when O’Brien was a priest in Kilsyth, north . Lanarkshire, and worked with a friend of Savile’s mother. They were pictured together in Scotland in 2007 as the pair unveiled a £375,000 vehicle for the disabled. When the Savile scandal emerged, the cardinal called for him to be stripped of his papal knighthood. Following Savile’s death, Cardinal O’Brien said: ‘My friendship with Jimmy Savile developed over many years since I was assistant priest in St Patrick’s Parish, Kilsyth. ‘We were always trying to fundraise, not only for the parish, but for a variety of local and national charities and Father Denis had got to know Jimmy quite simply because of Jimmy’s mother, ""The Duchess"". ‘It was Jimmy’s fond mother who attributed the healing of Jimmy when an infant to her prayers to the Venerable Margaret Sinclair, a young Scottish nun.’ There is no suggestion that Cardinal O’Brien had any part in the Savile abuse scandal. Pictured together: Cardinal Keith O'Brien (left) was among many high powered supporters of Jimmy Savile (right) who did not know about the entertainer's sexual abuse of children . The pictures emerged as Britain's most senior Roman Catholic yesterday apologised for his failures after being ordered to quit by the Pope as a further sex scandal swept the church. Cardinal Keith O'Brien has resigned as Archbishop of St Andrew's and Edinburgh over the allegations. One of his accusers says the church would 'crush' him, given the opportunity . Cardinal O’Brien said sorry as it was revealed that he must resign now rather than wait until his 75th birthday, which falls next month. In a statement the Cardinal, 74, said: ‘Looking back over my years of ministry: for any good I have been able to do, I thank God. For any failures, I apologise to all whom I have offended.’ The Vatican instruction follows allegations made by three un-named priests and one former priest who say that they were subjected to ‘inappropriate’ approaches by the cardinal 30 years ago. The complaints were made to the Vatican’s representative in London early last month – before Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation, but after Cardinal O’Brien had made known to Rome that he wished to resign ‘in view of his 75th birthday’. The sudden departure of the cardinal leaves the church grappling with the implications of a new sex scandal affecting its senior leadership and denies British Roman Catholics any influence on the voting when 116 cardinals gather to elect Benedict’s replacement next month. The affair intensified the sense of intrigue and conspiracy that has grown around the Papacy since Benedict made the surprise announcement of his own decision to quit on February 11. The dramatic move to become the first Pope in 600 years to resign has provoked intense speculation both on what influences may have been at work on Benedict and on what role he will play after he stands down. A Vatican adviser in Scotland said the O’Brien resignation was ‘shocking and sad’ but ‘unsurprising’. Cardinal O’Brien’s apology follows growing controversy over his leadership in recent weeks. The vehemence of his public stand against same-sex marriage led to condemnation by the gay lobby. Staying away: Cardinal O'Brien, pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh and the Pope, will no longer attend the election to choose Benedict XVI's successor . However, in a surprise move just a day . before the sex scandal broke, he upset traditionalists by calling for . priests to be given the right to marry. His immediate departure was set out in an announcement from the Scottish church yesterday morning. Cardinal O’Brien said: ‘Approaching . the age of 75 and at times in indifferent health, I tendered my . resignation as Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh to Pope . Benedict XVI some months ago.’ He added that he had been ‘happy to . know’ that on November 13 last year the Pope had accepted his . resignation, but that it would take effect at an unspecified later date. Position: The archbishop was the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland and the UK's senior priest . Senior church figures are expected to . go at 75, but the Vatican often allows leeway of a year or two. Following news of the sex scandal over the weekend, the Pope gave . Cardinal O’Brien no choice. ‘The Holy Father has now decided that . my resignation will take effect today, 25 February 2013, and that he . will appoint an Apostolic Administrator to govern the Archdiocese in my . place until my successor is appointed,’ Cardinal O’Brien said. The decision means he will no longer . travel to Rome as planned to take part in the conclave that will elect . the next Pope in March. The Cardinal said in his statement: ‘I . thank Pope Benedict XVI for his kindness and courtesy to me and…I wish . him a long and happy retirement. ‘I also ask God’s blessing on my . brother Cardinals who will soon gather in Rome to elect his successor. I . will not join them for this conclave. I do not wish media attention in . Rome to be focused on me – but rather on Pope Benedict XVI and on his . successor.’ Saying mass in Edinburgh: Cardinal Keith O' Brien in his role as Britain's most senior Catholic . Cardinal O’Brien, who on Sunday missed . a mass in St Mary’s Cathedral in Edinburgh that had been intended to . celebrate eight years of Benedict’s papacy, has contested claims of . inappropriate behaviour made against him. The claims were made to the Papal . Nuncio, the Vatican ambassador in London, Antonio Mennini, in the week . before the announcement of Benedict’s resignation on February 11. According to the Observer newspaper, . one former priest claims Cardinal O’Brien made an inappropriate approach . to him in 1980, after night prayers, when he was a seminarian at St . Andrew’s College, Drygrange. The man, who is now married, says he . resigned as a priest when Cardinal O’Brien was first made a bishop. He . said in his complaint: ‘I knew then he would always have power over me. It was assumed I left the priesthood to get married. I did not. I left . to preserve my integrity.’ In Rome: The cardinal had been due to travel to the Vatican to take part in the forthcoming papal conclave . A second statement from another priest . says he was living in a parish when he was visited by Cardinal O’Brien, . and inappropriate contact took place between them. A third man said he had had to deal with ‘unwanted behaviour’ by the cardinal in the 1980s after some late-night drinking. The fourth complaint came from a priest who said the cardinal used night prayers as an excuse for inappropriate contact. Retiring: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his blessing during his last Angelus noon prayer from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square at the Vatican yesterday . A Vatican adviser in Scotland, . Professor John Haldane of St Andrews University, said: ‘The resignation . of Cardinal O’Brien as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh, within a . month of the date on which his formal resignation would normally have . taken effect is both shocking and sad. ‘Given the nature of the accusations, . however, and the publication of them over the weekend, ahead of the . formal abdication of Pope Benedict later in the week, it is unsurprising . that he has taken the decision to resign.’ Professor Haldane, added: ‘The . Cardinal could not but be mindful of the problems that would follow . given the inevitable press interest created by the accusations, and he . would not want that burden to fall upon the Church and the Pope at what . is obviously a critical moment in the life of the Roman Catholic . community.' The departure of the Cardinal leaves the five million faithful in Britain without a representative when the new Pope is chosen. It will mean that the number of cardinals with the power to vote in the conclave for Benedict’s successor is reduced to 116, with at least one other withdrawal a possibility between now and the opening of discussions in the Vatican next month. There are some 750,000 Catholics  in Scotland who would have been represented by the Cardinal as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh. More than four million Catholics in England and Wales will be unrepresented in the final reckoning because there is no qualified cardinal among their leaders. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, who stepped down as Archbishop of Westminster in 2009, is 80, and so too old to join the voting bloc of cardinals. He will, however, travel to Rome to take part in advisory talks. His successor as Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Reverend Vincent Nichols, has yet to be given a cardinal’s hat more than three years after taking over as leader of Catholics in England and Wales. Some observers believe this is because Benedict has been suspicious of what he sees as liberal tendencies among English bishops. Another cardinal is under pressure to follow Keith O’Brien out of the conclave. Roger Mahony, former Archbishop of Los Angeles, who is being urged to step down by lobby groups who accuse him of covering up sex abuse by priests. The conclave may now begin around March 10. The Pope’s resignation takes effect on Thursday evening this week, 28 February.","Cardinal Keith O'Brien faces claims of inappropriate attention by four priests .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . One of the biggest and hottest explosions in the universe - a rare event known as a gamma-ray burst (GRB) - has been spotted on camera. And this particular event, caused by the enormous explosions of a star, occurred shortly after the Big Bang about 12.1 billion years ago. The intense light recently reached Earth and it could give astronomers useful information about the conditions in the young universe. Light from an explosion of a massive star at the end of its life 12.1 billion years ago reached Earth recently. An image of its peak afterglow, circled with blue and yellow, was captured by Southern Methodist University's Rotse-IIIb telescope at McDonald Observatory, Fort Davis, Texas. A bright star sits on the left of the afterglow . Gamma-ray bursts are believed to be the catastrophic collapse of a star at the end of its life. The observation was made by the telescope Rotse-IIIB at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of West Texas, owned by the Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas. A gamma ray burst occurs when a massive star dies and collapses, causing a huge explosion known as a supernova. The remnant of this supernova is often a neutron star, quark star or black hole. During the supernova a narrow beam of intense radiation known as a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is sometimes released from either pole of the star. This burst can last anywhere from a few milliseconds to several minutes, with an ‘afterglow’ normally persisting after. A GRB is incredibly powerful, typically releasing more energy in seconds than the sun will in its 10 billion-year lifetime. A planet caught in one of these bursts would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder, astronomers say. Scientists might be able to detect warning signs of an impending gamma ray burst but if a burst were headed for Earth there wouldn't be anything anybody could do about it. However, astronomers put the chances of that happening at around 1 in 10 million. SMU physicists report that their telescope was the first on the ground to observe the burst, and to capture an image. This particular explosion, first spotted back in April, was recorded as GRB 140419A by Nasa's Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN). Gamma-ray bursts are not well understood by astronomers, but they are considered important, according to Farley Ferrante, a graduate student in . SMU's Department of Physics, who monitored the observations along with . two astronomers in Turkey and Hawaii. 'As . Nasa points out, gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions in . the universe since the Big Bang,' he said. 'These bursts release more . energy in 10 seconds than our Earth's sun during its entire expected . lifespan of 10 billion years.' Some of these GRBs appear to be related to supernovae and correspond to the end-of-life of a massive star, said Dr Robert Kehoe, physics professor and leader of the SMU astronomy team. 'Gamma-ray bursts may be particularly massive cousins to supernovae, or may correspond to cases in which the explosion ejecta are more beamed in our direction. By studying them, we learn about supernovae,' Kehoe said. SMU's Rotse IIIb telescope (pictured) at the McDonald Observatory, Fort Davis, Texas had the earliest and brightest observation from the ground of a gamma-ray burst that occurred more than 12 billion years ago. The telescope is part of the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment . Scientists weren't able to detect optical light from gamma-ray bursts until the late 1990s, when telescope technology improved. Among all lights in the electromagnetic spectrum, gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and are visible only using special detectors. Gamma-ray bursts result from hot stars that measure as enormous as 50 solar masses. The explosion occurs when the stars run out of fuel and collapse in on themselves, often forming black holes. Outer layers detonate, shooting out material along the rotation axis in powerful, high-energy jets that include gamma radiation. As the gamma radiation declines, the explosion produces an afterglow of visible optical light. The light, in turn, fades very quickly, said Kehoe. Physicists calculate the distance of the explosion based on the shifting wavelength of the light, or redshift. 'The optical light is visible for anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours,' Kehoe said. 'Sometimes optical telescopes can capture the spectra. This allows us to calculate the redshift of the light, which tells us how fast the light is moving away from us. This is an indirect indication of the distance from us.' To put into context the age of the new gamma-ray burst discoveries, Kehoe and Ferrante point out that the Big Bang occurred 13.81 billion years ago. GRB 140419A, meanwhile, exploded about 12.1 billion years ago, which is 'only about one and a half billion years after the universe began,' said Ferrante. 'That is really old.' A planet caught in the path of a gamma-ray bursts burst would lose its atmosphere instantly and would be left a burnt cinder, astronomers say (artist's illustration shown). The chances of Earth being hit by one, which would apparently be almost undetectable, stands at around 1 in 10 million . Armed with images of the burst, astronomers can analyse the observational data to draw further conclusions about the structure of the early universe. 'At the time of this gamma-ray burst's explosion, the universe looked vastly different than it does now,' Kehoe said. 'It was an early stage of galaxy formation. There weren't heavy elements to make Earth-like planets. 'So this is a glimpse at the early universe. Observing gamma-ray bursts is important for gaining information about the early universe.' The GRB's brightness, regarded as being 'of the 12th magnitude', was also impressive; it was just 10 times dimmer than what can be seen through binoculars in the night sky and only 200 times dimmer than what the human eye can see. 'The difference in brightness is about the same as between the brightest star you can see in the sky, and the dimmest you can see with the naked eye on a clear, dark night,' Kehoe said. 'Considering this thing was at the edge of the visible universe, that's an extreme explosion. That was something big. Really big.'","Astronomers using a telescope in Texas have spotted the gamma-ray burst .

"By . Associated Press . The founder of a prominent Mormon women's group held a vigil in Salt Late City, Utah, Sunday night as her former church leaders met in Virginia to decide if she will be ousted from her church. About 200 supporters turned out to get behind Kate Kelly, who decided not to attend the disciplinary hearing in her former congregation. Instead, she sent in a letter she wrote and about 1,000 letters from supporters. The leader of Ordain Women is accused of . apostasy, defined as repeated and public advocacy of positions that . oppose church teachings. The bishop of her former congregation . emailed Kelly to tell her he and other leaders considered her status and . reviewed her response, spokeswoman Laurie Turner said in a statement. Kate Kelly, center, walks with supporters to the Church Office Building of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during a vigil Sunday in Salt Lake City . It says the bishop wants to weigh the decision, and he will notify her likely Monday. Whatever the outcome, Kelly said she will always be Mormon. 'I don't feel like Mormonism is something that washes off,' she said. 'That identity is not something that they can take from me.' She was shocked to find out earlier this month from her bishop that she is facing excommunication from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which she is a lifelong member. Similar vigils were held in 17 countries, according to Ordain Women. 'I'm overwhelmed by the positive support, and I think it really demonstrates that this isn't just happening to one person,' Kelly said before the vigil started. 'This isn't just happening to me, but it feels like the entire Mormon feminist community is being put on trial.' Kelly, an international human rights lawyer, said she stands behind everything she has done since forming Ordain Women in 2013. The group advocates for gender equality in the faith, with the ultimate goal of allowing women in the lay clergy. Kelly insists that she has not spoken out against church leaders or church doctrine. Kelly wipes a tear from her face during the vigil, which took place as her former church leaders meet in Virginia on Sunday night to decide if she'll be ousted from her church . Women can hold many leadership positions in church, but aren't allowed to be bishops of congregations or presidents of stakes. Stakes are made up of up to a dozen congregations, known as wards. The church's highest leaders, called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, are also all men. The church says only men serve in the lay clergy as prescribed in 'the pattern set by the Savior when it comes to priesthood ordination.' Mormon officials aren't discussing Kelly's case specifically. They say they are open to questions and sincere conversations about the faith, but that some members' actions 'contradict church doctrine and lead others astray.' 'In the Church, we want everyone to feel welcome, safe and valued, and of course, there is room to ask questions,' church spokeswoman Ally Isom said. 'But how we ask is just as important as what we ask. We should not try to dictate to God what is right for his Church.' Kelly's group drew rebukes from church leaders in April when they marched on church property in downtown Salt Lake City's Temple Square. The women asked to be allowed in a . meeting reserved for members of the priesthood, which includes most . males in the church who are 12 and older. Kelly receives a hug from a supporter after walking to the Church Office Building of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . Church leaders had previously told the group they wouldn't be let in and warned them not to disturb the faith's biannual general conference that weekend. Kelly is one of two well-known Mormons facing excommunication. John Dehlin, an outspoken advocate for gays and the creator of a website that provides a forum for church members questioning their faith, has a meeting with his stake president in Logan on June 29 to discuss his case. Scholars who study the Mormon religion say Kelly and Dehlin are the most high-profile examples of excommunication proceedings since 1993. That year, the church disciplined six Mormon writers who questioned church doctrine, ousting five and kicking out a sixth temporarily. Jan Shipps, a retired religion professor from Indiana who is a non-Mormon expert on the church, said church leaders are practicing 'boundary maintenance,' using Kelly and Dehlin as examples to show people how far they can go in questioning church practices. Melissa Mayhew, 31, traveled about 40 miles from Orem to attend Sunday's vigil and to support Kelly's right to advocate. 'We are all of us people who see things that we would love to improve about the church that we love deeply and dearly,' Mayhew said. 'And we want to be able to actually have these conversations, even with people with whom we disagree.'

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Centuries after he became famous, Shakespeare's well-delivered lines are being blamed for creating stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease . William Shakespeare was a master of insult, particularly when it came to a character’s appearance. From ‘foul moles and eye-offending marks’ to ‘a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle’, the playwright had a sharp tongue when it came to physical imperfection. And now, centuries after he became famous, Shakespeare's well-delivered lines are being blamed for creating a painful stigma for millions of people suffering skin disease. The world’s most famous playwright has been the subject of new research being revealed to doctors during the annual conference of the British Association of Dermatologists. Researchers from Nottingham, Leicester and Derby, analysed Shakespeare’s language and found that it reflected the Elizabethan obsession with perfect, unmarked, pale skin. They speculate that the playwright’s status as the most well-known English language writer of all time may be helping to fuel ongoing stigma around skin disease. For instance King Lear describes his daughter Goneril as ‘an embossed carbuncle’ and a prostitute calling a soldier a ‘scurvy companion’ in Henry IV part II. King Lear describes his daughter Goneril as ‘an embossed carbuncle’ (right), while in The Tempest, the deformed Caliban (right) is cast as the subhuman son of the malevolent witch, Sycorax . In Henry IV part I, a man with a red nose is described as ‘an everlasting bonfire-light’ and ‘knight of the burning lamp’. Dr Catriona Wootton, Dermatologist at Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham, said: ‘Rat-infested and with open sewers, overcrowding and sexual promiscuity, Elizabethan London was a melting pot for diseases such as plague, syphilis and smallpox. 'Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle' (King Lear) 'Thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire night. Thou has saved me a thousand marks in links and torches' (Henry IV part 1) 'A pox upon him' (All’s Well That Ends Well) 'I scorn you, scurvy companion' (Henry IV part 2) 'Foul moles and eye-offending marks' (King John) Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd' (Coriolanus) 'Never mole, hare-lip nor scar... shall upon their children be' (A Midsummer Night's Dream) ‘Many of the diseases of the time involved lesions or sores on the skin, so skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for contagious disease. ‘This was not limited to signs of infection, but to any blemishes or moles, which were considered ugly and signs of witchcraft or devilry.’ In Shakespeare’s defence, he highlights the innocence of affected individuals in Hamlet: 'that for some vicious mole of nature in them, as in their birth – wherein they are not guilty, since nature cannot choose his origin. ‘Their virtues else, be they as pure as grace, as infinite as man may undergo, shall in general censure take corruption from that particular fault'. However, researchers say many far less tolerant examples can be found in Shakespeare's work and it is argued that his success has led to strengthening of the stigma around skin disease. Nina Goad of the British Association of Dermatologists said: ‘It is interesting to note that much of the Elizabethan stigma over disfiguring skin disease still persists today. ‘Over the last few decades dermatologists have tried to address the effect this can have on patients. In A Midsummer Night's Dream (pictured), a blessing to young couples includes the line: 'Never mole, hare-lip nor scar... shall upon their children be.' Professor Michael Dobson, the director of Birmingham University’s Shakespeare Institute, believes the suggestion that Shakespeare was to blame for skin stigma is ridiculous . ‘However, even now, many examples exist in films and literature where visible disfigurements are used to represent villainy or malice. ‘Nobody is suggesting that we edit Shakespeare but maybe we should ensure that new films and books don’t reinforce this stereotype . Professor Michael Dobson, the director of Birmingham University’s Shakespeare Institute, believes the suggestion that Shakespeare was to blame for skin stigma is ridiculous. He told the Independent: ‘Has any writer in history ever suggested that the symptoms of skin disease are attractive? 'And have audiences for the last 400 years really been coming out of theatres saying ""Ah yes – I’d nearly forgotten – pox is to be avoided."" ‘What a genius Shakespeare was!’ Next week: has the fairy tale of Snow White been creating a misleadingly favourable impression of dwarfism?’","Study suggests writer's language reflects an obsession with perfect skin .
This may be because Elizabethan London was a hotspot for disease .
Skin imperfections were seen as a warning sign for a contagious illness .
But in Hamlet, Shakespeare highlights innocence of affected individuals .
Researchers say many far less tolerant examples are found in his plays and that his success has fuelled stigma around skin disease ."

'Bags shoes bikinis, clothes, toiletries, underwear, pj's, makeup, toiletries taken. Disgusting & the customer service getting is terrible. She faced a . string of sarcastic comments from some of her followers who commented that she could perhaps afford to replace the items. However, . she angrily replied that it is not about the money, tweeting: ‘And you . can stick all the sarcastic comments about money. It’s not all about . money it’s about people going through my personal stuff and taking stuff . that I need for my holiday’. The couple are staying at the luxurious Encore Beach Club while the footballer enjoys a break before heading back to training with Manchester United. It is set to be another big season for the striker as he starts work under new manager, Louis van Gaal. British Airways told MailOnline: 'We are very sorry. We are contacting Mrs Rooney to apologise and have begun a full investigation.' Coleen may have been the victim of an airport computer glitch that meant some air passengers have still not been reunited with their luggage days after a problem started. The glitch began on Thursday at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 (T5) and has affected departing British Airways passengers. Missing: Despite arriving with a large selection of suitcases, Coleen tweeted that not all of them made it . Angry: Coleen took to Twitter to complain about the state of her luggage . Some of these travellers had to fly without their hold luggage and although normal baggage check-in has resumed at T5, not all the affected passengers have got their bags yet. T5 had a disastrous opening in March 2008 when thousands of bags went missing and there were long delays and cancellations. A Heathrow spokeswoman said today: 'We experienced intermittent issues with the T5 baggage system between June 26 and 29 which caused some bags to be processed manually. Passengers can now check in bags as normal. 'Manual processing led to some bags not making flights in time. While passengers are receiving bags all the time, it will take several days to reunite all passengers with their bags. 'We are very sorry for the disruption passengers have experienced and we are working round the clock with airlines to reunite passengers with their bags as quickly as possible.'

"By . Ellen Branagh, Press Association . When news of Rolf Harris's arrest broke, a collective gasp swept across the nation. This was not just a famous face, this was one of the best-loved celebrities of past and present - a true family favourite. Born in 1930, Harris grew up in Perth suburb Bassendean and went on to carve himself a 60-year career that saw him achieve success as an artist, musician and TV personality, with a list of honours to match. Outside court: Veteran entertainer Rolf Harris arriving with daughter Bindi (left), wife Alwen and niece Jenny at London's Southwark Crown Court . Archive photo: Rolf Harris from footage taken from footage of the ITV programme Star Games filmed in 1978 in Cambridge which was shown to a jury in the trial of the veteran broadcaster at Southwark Crown Court . As a teenager and young adult, he . became a champion swimmer, and in 1946 was the Australian Junior 110 . yards Backstroke Champion. Struck . down by a mysterious illness that left him paralysed for several weeks, . Harris said it was this that prompted him to take the leap and travel . to England to pursue a career in art. 'I . thought that if I were to continue teaching I would be a weekend . painter, which is like a weekend driver, you never get any better than . you were the previous weekend,' he told jurors at his trial. That . was in 1952, and after a few failed attempts at art school, Harris . managed to get himself a slot on a BBC show, despite his first audition . being a self-confessed 'disaster'. Also . a keen musician, he started by entertaining at the Down Under club, a . haven for ex-pat Australians and New Zealanders, playing his piano . accordion. Sketches: From the 2001 book 'Can you tell what it is yet?' by Rolf Harris, published by Bantam Press . Santa: Harris's biggest hit was in 1969 with Two Little Boys, originally written in 1902. The hit became the Christmas Number One in the UK and remained at the top of the charts for six weeks . His song Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport, became a hit in Australia, the UK and the United States in the 1960s. Over the following years, Harris's musical career was to grow and grow, and he became well-known for his use of instruments, from the didgeridoo to his famous 'wobble-board'. The entertainer released comedic song Jake the Peg in the 1960s, but his biggest hit was in 1969 with Two Little Boys, originally written in 1902. The hit became the Christmas Number One in the UK and remained at the top of the charts for six weeks, selling more than a million copies. Harris went on to perform his own versions of several hit songs, including Led Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven. Animal Hospital: Harris (pictured in 1997) performed his own versions of several hit songs . Royal visitor: Harris and his wife Alwen (centre) as they met the Duchess of Cornwall in October 2012 . He performed at Glastonbury for the first time in 1993, going on to appear a number of times, including a spot on its world-famous Pyramid Stage in 2010. Despite his musical success, Harris's art career was not forgotten. His work was exhibited in many places, and in 2005 he had the rare privilege of painting a portrait of the Queen to mark her 80th birthday. One of the best-known names in showbiz, the boy from Bassendean's celebrity extended beyond art and music, as he became a TV personality and all-round household name. His catchphrases were known worldwide, . from 'Can you tell what it is yet?' accompanying his painting stints, . and his emotional references to 'the poor little blighter' as he hosted . TV programme Animal Hospital, based at a British veterinary practice. Harris . appeared on This is Your Life on two occasions, and in 1989 featured in . a child abuse prevention video called Kids Can Say No. Musical: Harris became well-known for his use of instruments, from the didgeridoo to his famous 'wobble-board' Honour: His work was exhibited in many places, and in 2005 he had the rare privilege of painting a portrait of the Queen to mark her 80th birthday . In November 2011 he appeared in an episode of Piers Morgan's Life Stories, where he described what he called the darkest periods of his life, revealing that he had suffered deeply from depression and describing his regret over missing key events in daughter Bindi's life. It was this less jovial side of Rolf Harris that his daughter may have alluded to when she described him during her evidence. 'Dad didn't really take much notice of me or anybody at home,' she told jurors. 'I think when he is out in the world he wants to give everyone his time and everyone is new and he can tell new jokes and new everything. But when he's at home he is very much switched off, very quiet, quite often working, making something.' Despite home relationships appearing to be somewhat strained, to the rest of the world Harris has always been a fond favourite. Crowd favourite: Harris performing on the main stage at Glastonbury Festival in Somerset in June 2002 . Rolf's Amazing World of Animals: One of the best-known names in showbiz, the boy from Bassendean became a TV personality and all-round household name . With an MBE, OBE and CBE under his belt, as well as a fellowship from Bafta, he was loved nationwide. And in a nod to his standing as a British favourite, the veteran entertainer starred in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Concert outside Buckingham Palace in June 2012. But just months later, the career he spent years building was thrown into disarray as he became one of the names linked to the now well-known Operation Yewtree. He denied anything unlawful, with friends and family jumping to the entertainer's defence, insisting there was nothing sinister about the 'cuddly' star's behaviour around women. But the 84-year-old was forced to admit that he had a 'darker side' as he confessed to not one, but two affairs - one with one of his daughter's friends - and even admitted to finding the girl attractive when she was just 13. With the details of his private life laid bare for the world to see, it is clear that no matter what the outcome of his trial was, the nation's view of Rolf Harris would never have been quite the same again.","Harris born in 1930 in Australia and was a champion swimmer in his youth .

"By . Nick Mcdermott, Science Reporter . Martians may well have existed, and still be on the red planet - but not in any recognisable form, British scientists said today. Scientists believe the discovery of minerals below the Red Planet's surface is the 'strongest evidence yet' it may have supported life. But far from hosting little green men, our celestial neighbour was likely inhabited by simple microorganisms. The huge McLaughlin Crater created by a meteorite which smashed into the surface of Mars, has been shown to reveal signs of life . Layers with Carbonate Content Inside McLaughlin Crater on Mars . This view of layered rocks on the floor of McLaughlin Crater shows sedimentary rocks that contain spectroscopic evidence for minerals formed through interaction with water . Scientists at the University of Aberdeen looked at data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA's Mars Express spacecrafts and analysed rocks and found they contain clays and minerals whose chemical make-up has been altered by water . Lifeless: This image provided by NASA shows the late-afternoon shadow cast by the Mars rover Opportunity . A new study led by the Natural History Museum, with the University of Aberdeen, found that all the ingredients for life were present just below the planet's surface for much of its history. When meteorites strike the surface of Mars, they act like natural probes, bringing up rocks from far beneath the crust. Looking at data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA's Mars Express spacecrafts, they analysed rocks and found they contain clays and minerals whose chemical make-up has been altered by water. With up to half of life on Earth consisting of simple microorganisms that live in below the surface, scientists have suggested that the same may have been true for Mars. Prof John Parnell, 55, a geochemist at the University of Aberdeen was one of the experts who have uncovered evidence of life on Mars . Dr Joseph Michalski, lead author and planetary geologist at the Natural History Museum said: 'All the ingredients were there for life, but only small single-cell organisms could have survived in those conditions. 'But I would now be more surprised if there was never any life on Mars, than I would be if we did one day discover that simple life lived in that environment. 'And if life existed then, there is a chance it could still exist now.' Some deep craters on Mars also acted as basins where groundwater likely emerged to produce lakes, which contain clay and carbonate minerals. The fluids that formed these minerals could one day tell us more as to whether there was life beneath the surface, and also carry clues to how life developed on Earth. Dr Michalski, whose study is . published in the journal Nature Geoscience, said: 'We don't know how . life on Earth formed but it is conceivable that it originated . underground, protected from harsh surface conditions that existed on . early Earth. 'Due to . plate tectonics, however, the early geological record of Earth is poorly . preserved so we may never know what processes led to life's origin and . early evolution. 'Exploring . these rocks on Mars, where the ancient geologic record is better . preserved than on Earth, would be like finding a stack of pages that . have been ripped out of Earth's geological history book. 'Whether the Martian geologic record contains life or not, analysis of these types of rocks would certainly teach us a tremendous amount about early chemical processes in the solar system.' Nasa's Mars probe, the Curiosity rover, will begin drilling on the planet's surface in the next few days [check it hasn't started] for rock samples. It is the most highly anticipated milestone since the six-wheel, nuclear-powered rover landed near the Martian equator five months ago.","Red Planet could have hosted microorganisms .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A weekend New York Times story that questioned the government's intelligence following last year's terror attack in Benghazi, Libya has members of Congress crying foul. Some believe the report's conclusions were calculated to help Hillary Clinton's future political fortunes. 'I don't know why they put it out, unless it was for political reasons,' Rep. Lynn Westmoreland said during a 'Fox and Friends' broadcast on Monday. The Georgia Republican said the Times was 'laying the groundwork' for a Clinton presidential run. 'Of course, Secretary Clinton was in charge at the time,' said Westmoreland of the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack on state Department facilities. 'I think they're just ... trying to absolve her from the lack of security that was sent over there, the number of requests for security that was turned down.' The Times reported that the attack on U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi was not solely the result of a pre-planned, carefully coordinated terrorist action, as American intelligence has determined in the 15 months since the military-style assault left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others dead. Instead, the report claims, an ad hoc group of Islamist militants were largely motivated by a blasphemous video, made in the United States, which circulated on YouTube in the week preceding the attack. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was laid waste by militant Islamists on September 11, 2012, and the Obama administration initially claimed an anti-Islam video sparked the attack -- a claim now reinforced by a controversial New York Times story . On the critical question of whether the Benghazi attack was preplanned by terrorists or generated spontaneously by a street mob, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked a Senate panel in January, 'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Earlier on the same day as the Benghazi debacle, violent protesters in Cairo, Egypt demonstrated against the video. And President Barack Obama, . then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-UN Ambassador Susan . Rice all pushed that version of events during . the short time between the Benghazi attack and the 2012 presidential . election. But the CIA determined almost immediately that it was a premeditated terror attack. Clinton's State Department sanitized the agency's approved talking points before Rice went on television to denounce the video, removing references to a Libyan terror group affiliated with al-Qaeda. It was Clinton who presided over the State Department at the time of the attack. Her agency was also faulted, under her leadership, for failing to beef up security in Benghazi after several requests from Stevens. Now poised to run for the presidency in 2016, Clinton aides see the Benghazi episode as a significant political obstacle. And Republican political operatives told MailOnline that the Times story seemed constructed specifically to help her. One, a GOP-linked campaign adviser in the swing-state of Ohio, said the report 'was meant to give Hillary Clinton an escape hatch' so she can 'cite The New York Times every time someone claims she lied about the video.' 'We talk about plausible deniability all the time in political scandals,' the operative said. 'We'', this smells like a recipe for political deniability.' In a ceremony marking the U.S. return of the Benghazi victims' bodies, both Obama and Clinton referred to the anti-Islam video, despite likely knowing the CIA's conclusion that an al-Qaeda-linked group had preplanned the attack . Another, . an election lawyer in Florida who was central to President George W. Bush's razor-thin victory over then-Vice President Al Gore in 2000, said . that the Times story would 'set the Benghazi investigation back months' and 'give the Hillary people something to point to, because God knows . they can't point to the facts.' Both asked MailOnline to withhold . their names. 'It's election season,' said one, 'so it's time to start . filtering what I say publicly again.' Two Clinton advisers failed to respond to requests for comment. New York Times editorial page editor Andrew Rosenthal wrote on Monday that his paper wasn't expressing a political preference with the story. 'Since I will have more to say about which candidate we will endorse in 2016 than any other editor at the Times, let me be clear: We have not chosen Mrs. Clinton. We haven’t chosen anyone,' he wrote. U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (L) said Monday that the Times was attempting to 'absolve' Hillary Clinton of her responsibility in the Benghazi mess in order to aid her future election hopes . Times reporter David Kirkpatrick, who wrote the contested story, defended his reporting on the Sunday NBC program 'Meet the Press.' 'There's just no chance this was an al-Qaeda attack,' he said, 'if, by al-Qaeda, you mean the organization founded by Osama bin Laden.' Kirkpatrick wrote on Sunday that he determined 'Benghazi was not infiltrated by al-Qaeda, but nonetheless contained grave local threats to American interests. The attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned, but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs.' Witnesses to the events of Sept. 11, 2012 told Fox News on Monday that the Times report is 100 per cent wrong. Benghazi 'was a coordinated attack. It is completely false to say anything else. … It is completely a lie,' one witness said. Lawmakers, particularly Republicans, agree. 'What we do know is, it was not an accident,' California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa countered during the same broadcast. 'These are terrorist groups, some of them linked to or self-effacing or self-claimed as al-Qaeda-linked.' Issa chairs that House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has aggressively investigated the causes of the Benghazi attack and allegations that the Obama administration engaged in a post-Benghazi cover-up. But 'there is a group that was involved [in Benghazi] that claims an affiliation with al-Qaeda,' Issa insisted. Emotions: President Obama shed a tear in May as he answered tough questions about Benghazi during a rare public press conference . That organization, the Libyan-based Ansar al-Sharia, has claimed partial responsibility for . the mortar, rocket-propelled grenade and automatic-weapons barrages. Issa also said he knew of no evidence suggesting that the controversial anti-Islam video gave rise to the attack. Writing on Sunday about the events of . Sept. 11, 2012, Kirkpatrick reported that 'a Libyan journalist working . for The New York Times was blocked from entering by the sentries . outside, and he learned of the [anti-Islam] film from the fighters who . stopped him.' 'Other Libyan . witnesses, too, said they received lectures from the attackers about the . evil of the film and the virtue of defending the prophet,' Kirkpatrick . reported. Renewed emphasis on the now-infamous video put members of congressional intelligence committees on their heels, and forced . them to defend their conclusion that al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups . planned the attack and carried it out with ruthless precision. The . resulting debate has been reduced to the thorny but semantic question . of whether or not Ansar al-Sharia is part of the al-Qaeda network. Blasphemy: A 13-minute trailer for a low-budget film portrayed the Muslim prophet Muhammad as a gluttonous, vicious womanizer whose parents were unknown to him . Was it an anti-American attack or the product of religious righteousness? The New York Times story has reignited a debate that Congress thought it settled months ago . 'The assertion [in the TImes] that Ansar al-Sharia does . not have links to al-Qaeda was wrong' and contradicted by 'the intelligence, to . a large volume,' House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, said on 'Fox News Sunday.' Rogers drew careful distinctions between the Pakistan-based 'al-Qaeda core,' led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, and its affiliates – including Ansar al-Sharia – that have sprung up throughout the Arab world. 'Did they have differences of opinion . with al-Qaeda core? Yes. Do they have affiliations with al-Qaeda core? Definitely,' Rogers allowed. Fellow . Republican Rep. Peter King, a New Yorker who has chaired the . intelligence committee in the past, declared on Fox News that 'Ansar . al-Sharia is considered part of the . al-Qaeda network, supporters of al-Qaeda, and they have a training camp . right out near Benghazi. So I’ve known all along it was Ansar . al-Sharia, and I consider that to be an al-Qaeda affiliate.' Wrong? Susan Rice, then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appeared on five different Sunday talk shows following the Benghazi attack, claiming throughout that it resulted from the video's publication on YouTube . Madame President? Former Secretary of State and former first lady Hillary Clinton is expected to run for president, and GOP operatives suspect the Times story was a conscious effort to give her 'plausible deniability' about the attack which happened on her watch . Rogers insisted that his committee has 'gone through some 4,000 different classified cables leading up to the event, talked to people on the ground during the event, done the postmortem on the event through the committee investigation.' That effort, he suggested, should trump what a news organization with more limited resources can conclude with any certainty. California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who sits on Rogers' committee, said U.S. intelligence included intercepted phone calls and other conversations that contradict the Times. 'They didn't have the same access to people who were not aware that they were being listened to,'  said Schiff. 'They were heavily reliant, obviously, on people that they interviewed who had a reason to provide the story that they did.'","Times report claimed the Obama administration's early story about Benghazi, blaming the attack on an anti-Islam video, has some merit .

"By . Dan Bloom . BBC staff complained after a religious guru who follows a highly controversial Indian mystic gave them a talk about meditation. Anand Arun was invited to the Corporation's London headquarters New Broadcasting House last Wednesday to give a talk on 'mindfulness in an era of the 24-hour news cycle'. Mr Arun is a swami for a religious order called Osho Tapoban, based on the teachings of Osho - a mystic with divisive views on Jews and homosexuality, and two of whose followers carried out an infamous bioterrorist attack in 1984. Anand Arun was invited to the Corporation's London headquarters New Broadcasting House last Wednesday to give a talk on 'mindfulness in an era of the 24-hour news cycle' Photos from the talk on the swami's Facebook page show him in a room full of staff with their eyes closed and wearing a BBC identity card. Swami Arun works from an Osho Tapoban meditation camp in the forests of Nepal, whose website states: 'Swami Anand Arun is a true devout and lover of Osho. 'His . undying love for the master, his simplicity in life and his compassion . for everyone are his true gifts that have given birth to beautiful Oasis . of Osho around the world.' The website adds that he met Osho, who also went by the name Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, . in 1969 and ‘took initiation’ from him in . 1974 before being ‘instructed’ to return to Nepal to ‘pioneer the Osho . movement’. Jatinder Sidhu, a senior producer on Radio 4’s Today Programme, complained in a letter to the BBC's in-house magazine Ariel, which is published online. He wrote: 'I’m a bit concerned that something called the BBC Faith Forum . has invited a man who claims to have been inspired by Osho, aka Swami . Rajneesh, to give a ""discourse"" to BBC staff. 'Rajneesh . was a discredited ""godman"" hounded out of several countries, who ran . ashrams best known for attempted murder, sexual licentiousness and . amassing vast quantities of money (and scores of Rolls Royce cars). 'As I said in my email to the organisers: What next for the faith forum - a devoted follower of Charles Manson? Mr Arun is a swami for a religious order called Osho Tapoban, based on the teachings of Osho - a mystic with divisive views on Jews and homosexuality, and two of whose followers carried out an infamous bioterrorist attack in 1984 . Photos from the talk on the swami's Facebook page show him addressing a room full of staff wearing a BBC identity card . 'As . an organisation populated by a large number of journalists and . (hopefully) critical thinking intellectuals, I’m not sure we should be . promoting people who legitimise cults and criminals.' Another BBC worker, who asked not to . be named, said: 'How they let this guy in is incredible - if he believes . the teachings of Osho then he’s not someone the BBC should be inviting . to talk to our staff.' Two followers of Osho, who died in 1990, were convicted of carrying out an infamous bioterrorist attack using salmonella in 1984. Some 751 people were given food poisoning in the attack in Oregon, where Osho's followers had begun a new commune and wanted control of the area. Osho was never himself convicted of any offence over the attack. In a 1985 talk quoted in a book of his speeches, From Death to Deathlessness, Osho claimed the Holocaust was more peaceful than the way in which Indians died under colonial rule. 'Adolf Hitler’s violence with the Jews was far more peaceful, because he killed people in the most up-to-date gas chambers, where you don’t take much time,' he said. 'Thousands of people can be put in a gas chamber, and just a switch is pressed. Within a second you will not know when you were alive and when you died. Within a second, you evaporate. 'The chimneys of the factory start taking you, the smoke – you can call it the holy smoke – and this seems to be a direct way towards God. The smoke simply goes upwards.' In another lecture in the same collection, he claimed a previous Pope had been gay and said: 'If the pope is homosexual – and popes are infallible – it creates great suspicion, because Jesus was also hanging out with twelve boys. It may be something coming down from Jesus himself.' The chair of the BBC's Faith Forum, Susan Hayman, said the aim of the Forum was to 'promote greater understanding' among BBC staff and would never lend its support to Osho . And he said: 'AIDS is a religious disease. It started in the monasteries where monks were put together and no woman was allowed. It is the ultimate result of homosexuality, it is a by-product of homosexuality.' The chair of the BBC’s Faith Forum, Susan Hayman, said the aim of the Forum was to ‘promote greater understanding’ among BBC staff and would never lend its support to Osho. In a reply to Ariel today, she wrote: 'The BBC Faith Forum is a forum governed by its own constitution and supported by BBC Diversity. 'The main objective of the Forum is to promote a greater understanding and awareness to BBC staff, in general, of the faiths and related faith groups that make up the audience and source of BBC output and in order to do this we have begun to organise various events to be held from time to time. 'For the first of these events, the BBC Faith Forum decided to invite Swami Anand Arun, a meditation guru from Nepal. 'His presentation was well received by the 50 strong audience which was testimony to the interest it generated.' She added: 'The BBC Faith Forum has no position regarding Osho or any other religious or spiritual gurus and we would like to clarify that the Forum will not be used in any way to promote any cult, sect or groups so as to hurt deep personal sentiments of BBC staff. 'We welcome suggestions and constructive comments from all BBC colleagues.' The BBC said that events organised by the BBC Forums were entirely independent. A BBC spokesperson said: 'BBC Faith is one of a number of independently-run staff forums which organise their own events and choose the speakers invited to participate.'","Anand Arun gave a talk on 'mindfulness in an era of the 24-hour news cycle'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Scientists have printed new eye cells for the first time . Scientists have printed new eye cells for the first time - paving the way to cure some types of blindness in humans. Their research, which used animal cells to test the concept, is the first step towards producing tissue implants. British researchers used inkjet printers to print two types of central nervous system cells from the retina of adult rats - ganglion cells and glial cells. Retinal ganglion cells transmit information from the eye to certain parts of the brain and glial cells provide support and protection for neurons. The study, by the University of Cambridge,  found that printed cells were able to grow normally and can be kept healthy but more tests are needed before human trials can begin. ‘The loss of nerve cells in the retina is a feature of many blinding eye diseases,’ said Professor Keith Martin and Dr Barbara Lorber from the university who co-authored the study. ‘The retina is an exquisitely organised structure where the precise arrangement of cells in relation to one another is critical for effective visual function.' They said that the study has shown for the first time that cells derived from the mature central nervous system of the eye, can be printed using a piezoelectric inkjet printer, which uses electrically-charged crystals to deposit materials directly on substrates. ‘Although our results are preliminary and much more work is still required, the aim is to develop this technology for use in retinal repair in the future,’ they said. Clara Eaglen of the RNIB, told the BBC: ‘The key to this research, once the technology has moved on, will be how much useful vision is restored. British researchers used animal cells to test their concept which thy believe is the first step towards producing tissue implants, which could be used to cure some types of blindness . ‘Even a small bit of sight can make a real difference, for some people it could be the difference between leaving the house on their own or not.’ While it is in its very early stages, 3D printing makes it possible to arrange cells into highly defined patterns and structures that can be used in regenerative medicine. Researchers used an inkjet printer that pushed the cells out through a tiny nozzle when an electrical pulse was applied. They also used high speed video technology to take high resolution footage of the process. It is the first time the technology has successfully allowed scientists to print mature central nervous system cells. ‘The ability to arrange cells into highly defined patterns and structures has recently elevated the use of 3D printing in the biomedical sciences to create cell-based structures for use in regenerative medicine,’ the researchers said. The researchers said the loss of nerve cells in the retina is a feature of many blinding eye diseases. Their study has shown for the first time that cells derived from the mature central nervous system of the eye can be printed using a piezoelectric inkjet printer. Here, a woman has her eyes tested . However, 3D printing of cells can present challenges. Dr Wen-Kai Hsiao, a researcher at Cambridge, said: ‘In order for a fluid to print well from an inkjet print head, its properties, such as viscosity and surface tension, need to conform to a fairly narrow range of values. Adding cells to the fluid complicates its properties significantly.’ The scientists plan on attempting to print other types of retinal cells, such as rods and cones, which handle vision in low light and changes in shape, plus colour and detail. Professor Martin said: ‘We plan to extend this study to print other cells of the retina and to investigate if light-sensitive photoreceptors can be successfully printed using inkjet technology. ‘In addition, we would like to further develop our printing process to be suitable for commercial, multi-nozzle print heads.’ The research was published in the journal Biofabrication.","British researchers used inkjet printers to print two types of central nervous system cells from the retina of adult rats .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . In this modern image-conscious world, when we all want to portray ourselves in the best possible light, a man might want to smell of many things. He certainly wants to smell of diligently washed skin and newly cleaned clothes. He probably wants to smell of expensive hair products. He might even want to smell of whatever fragrance David Beckham is flogging this week, or some other fine aftershave. Kicking up a stink: Norse Power attempts to bottle the smell of a ninth century Viking warrior . But one thing he probably doesn’t want to smell like is a stinking bearded warrior from 13 centuries ago. A stinking bearded warrior, who, to be precise, has a penchant for smashing up villages, wearing blood-stained battle gear and sporting awful helmet hair. Nonetheless, this hasn’t stopped tourist officials in York from launching ‘Norse Power’, a – shall we say – niche-appeal perfume which will help a man to reek like a Viking. Visit York has created this bottled attack on our nostrils in tribute to the city’s Norse past. It has been concocted using assorted pungent ingredients: deep-soaked sweat (worked up during a raid on a British settlement); seawater (from a long voyage across the North Sea from the Viking heartland of Norway); mud and damp (from travels on foot over sodden terrain); dried blood (not necessarily model’s own – from a day’s fighting and pillaging). Fighting fit: The 'deodorant', launched by Visit York, combines the aromas of blood, sweat, seawater and meat . The . eye-watering package is completed by the ‘aromas’ of cooked meat from . Viking feasts, hard liquor (Vikings had a noted appetite for mead) and – . as a token pleasant inclusion – notes of fresh pine from all those . lengthy hikes though deep-rooted forests. ‘With . Norse Power, we wanted to try and capture the sort of smells that would . have been part of the lives of Viking warriors around the time that . York was the Norse capital of England,’ says Michelle Brown, the . marketing manager at Visit York. ‘But . more than that, with all the bath products, deodorants, perfumes and . aftershaves available today, we wanted to give male visitors to York the . chance to cast aside their allegiance to modern aromas and instead . embrace the smells from an era of warriors.’ The launch of Norse Power is, of course, just a bit of fun – although those who really want to smell like the inside of an animal-skin cloak can try the fragrance this weekend. It will be available to wear at Visit York’s main visitor centre this Saturday and Sunday (17-18 May) – with men encouraged to swap their usual body spray for Viking stench. I'll have what he's having: The 'fragrance' also contains the scent of roasted animal meat . York was effectively the heart of Viking culture in Britain after it was attacked and quelled by Viking invaders in 866AD. The Viking era ran roughly between the end of the eighth century and the middle of the 11th. In Britain, it came to a bloody conclusion in 1066, when an invading force from Norway was defeated at the Battle of Stamford Bridge (in modern Yorkshire) – just days before the Battle of Hastings saw William the Conqueror and his cohorts complete the Norman Conquest. Notorious for their ferocity, Vikings hailed from the Scandinavian landmass (especially Norway, Denmark and Sweden), although they also settled in Greenland. Itinerant and aggressive, their attacks on Europe made them the scourge of the continent for almost 300 years – and even took them as far south as Spain and Portugal. However, for all their reputation as vicious killers, Vikings were also great sailors and explorers – and there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that they crossed the Atlantic and ‘discovered’ the Americas (not least Newfoundland) long before Christopher Columbus.","Unholy 'aftershave' combines the smells of blood, sweat and smoking fires .

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Paul Pogba gave Didier Deschamps' side the lead in their last 16 clash with a late header. Click here to view his goal. Arsene Wenger would have been an interested spectator in Brasilia on Monday. He was, of course, keeping an eye on Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud, who was a surprise starter for the clash against Nigeria. But Wenger, working for French TV in Brazil, would also have been keeping close tabs on Karim Benzema, Mathieu Debuchy and Antoine Griezmann. The trio are targets for the Gunners this season. Newcastle right-back Debuchy is a more realistic target for Wenger, as he continues with his attempts to replace Bacary Sagna. Benzema is a long-term target for Wenger, but looks set to sign a new deal at Real Madrid, while Griezmann will cost big money to lure away from Real Sociedad. Blaise Matuidi has been one of France's stars of Brazil 2014 so far. But how did he get away with his reckless challenge on Ogenyi Onazi that caused the Nigerian to be stretchered off? Star man: France's little wizard Mathieu Valbuena ran the show as 'les bleus' reached the quarter-finals . Tres bien: Coach Didier Deschamps acknowledges his playmaker after France sealed the victory . Engine: Blaise Matuidi, surrounded by three Nigerians, was a livewire in central midfield . Fortunate: Matuidi was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card after a nasty tackle on Ogenyi Onazi . Surely, the French would have been down to 10 men if referee Mike Geiger had the benefit of a TV replay. Efe Ambrose has been a mainstay of Nigeria's defence during the World Cup. And perhaps we'll be hearing more about him next season. His performances have alerted a number of Premier League clubs, including Crystal Palace and Leicester. He currently plays for Scottish champions Celtic. Impressive: Efe Ambrose, of Celtic and Nigeria, was excellent at right-back as Nigeria put up a brave fight . Eyes on the prize: Paul Pogba (left) scored in the 79th minute for France from a corner vs Nigeria . Joseph Yobo made his 10th World Cup appearance in Brasilia, a new Nigerian record. But the centre-half, who spent the back end of last season on loan at Norwich from Fenerbache, won't remember his red-letter day with much fondness as his side crashed out of the tournament and scored an own goal to boot. Yohan Cabaye's brilliant half-volley in the second half that rattled off the Nigerian crossbar was the sixth time France have hit the woodwork during the World Cup - the most of any other team.

"By . Martin Robinson . ITV's unfortunate tradition of missing vital World Cup goals continued last night after its online service stopped working as Brazil's Neymar scored a penalty, furious viewers said. ITV Player's live coverage cut out at least twice in the second half of the host's match with Croatia, including as the tournament favourites went 2-1 up in Sao Paulo. The broadcaster blamed 'unprecedented numbers of users' for the crash - but refused to tell MailOnline how many had been watching. In 2010 ITV was forced to apologise after it missed England's first World Cup goal against the United States, after it accidentally showed a car advert instead. Scroll down for video . On the blink... and you missed it: Viewers complained that they missed Neymar's penalty last night after ITV Player stopped working during the second half of Brazil vs Croatia in Sao Paulo . Tough to take: Fans who have waited four years for the World Cup to start were furious to have missed some of the opening fixture . More than a million watching its HD service saw Glen Johnson's fourth minute throw in - but the game disappeared - and then returned with Steven Gerrard running off celebrating. After last night's problems ITV Player users said the broadcasters problems during the tournament is now as much of a 'World Cup tradition as England losing on penalties'. Responding to a barrage of criticism on Twitter, the service said on its feed: 'We're seeing unprecedented numbers of users during the game. 'We apologise for any inconvenience, we're working hard to resume normal service.' It later added: 'We're so sorry for the disruption tonight. It wasn't planned and we know it came at a crucial time during the match. Apologies again.' Several users vented their frustration on the microblogging site.

"By . Amanda Williams . Hannah Sargent, 29, told the authorities she was a lone parent and claimed thousands between August 2009 and March 2012 . A benefits cheat who stole £27,000 in handouts has been spared jail, despite a furious judge telling her: 'Taxpayers are sick of people like you.' Hannah Sargent, 29, told the authorities she was a single parent and claimed thousands between August 2009 and March 2012. The mother-of-one claimed income support from July 2006 until July 2011 as well as housing, council and child tax benefits. But Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard she was in fact living with a man whom she later married. She admitted two offences of dishonestly failing to notify a change of circumstances, making a false representation to obtain benefits and two counts of fraudulently obtaining tax credits. Judge Paul Glenn said the offending was serious enough to merit custody but that Sargent's  daughter would lose out if she was jailed. Instead she was sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for 18 months, ordered to undertake 180 hours unpaid work and pay £250 costs. During the hearing the judge told the mother that hardworking taxpayers were 'sick and tired of people like you.' Judge Glenn said: 'This was not a trivial amount. 'You did not declare that you were living as husband and wife until March 2012. 'Benefit cheats take away public money which would otherwise be spent on good causes. 'Honest taxpayers are sick and tired of people like you taking their money.' The court heard Sargent, from Chesterton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, notified HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on March 9, 2012 that her partner had moved in with her. But Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard that Sargent (pictured outside court) was in fact living with a man whom she later married . Despite denying that she had been living with him until then, investigators found she had been overpaid a total of £27,165. Prosecutor Joanne Wallbanks said: 'In July 2011, the benefit changed to Jobseeker’s Allowance, until October 2011, when she became employed. 'That benefit would have been dishonest from the outset. 'She also claimed child tax credits between August 2009 and March 2012 and working tax credits from April 2011 to March 2012. During the hearing Judge Paul Glenn told the mother that hardworking taxpayers were 'sick and tired of people like you' 'That would have been fraudulent from the start. And she claimed housing and council tax benefit from August 2009 to 2011. 'She was under an obligation to notify any change of circumstances if she co-habitated or married.' Arif Hussain defending Sargent, who has no previous convictions, said she is voluntarily repaying the money at a rate of £105 a month. After the case Rosemary Phillips, of HMRC, said: 'Sargent lied on numerous occasions to continue to receive benefits she wasn’t entitled to, pocketing money needed to fund public services. 'We recognise it is only a minority exploiting the system but would encourage anyone with information relating to tax credit fraud to call.'","Hannah Sargent, 29, told the authorities that she was a lone parent .

"By . Ray Massey . and Vikki Thomas . More than 11,000 law-breaking cyclists were fined for riding on pavements and running red lights last year, damning new figures reveal today. Statistics show more than 7,000 cyclists were fined for cycling on pavements while over 4,000 were caught jumping red lights and ignoring other road signs and markings. Road safety and motoring groups welcomed the prosecutions over reckless and illegal behaviour. More than 11,000 law-breaking cyclists were  fined for riding on pavements and running red lights last year . They say cyclists are putting lives at risk – including their own - and should face the consequences stressing: ‘Cyclists are not above the law.’ Polling research and film evidence from taxi drivers suggests red-light running is too often the norm rather than the exception. The evidence of reckless and illegal cycling is in sharp contrast to the loud calls of cycling campaign groups who demand crackdowns on motorists and the creation of safer road junctions. And it adds concerns  among motorist that too many cyclists believe the  laws of the land should be rigorously enforced against drivers – but should not apply to them. A hard-core of the most militant cyclists, criticised for their confrontational attitudes including verbal abuse and hitting or kicking cars,  have been dubbed ‘lycra-louts’ because of their tendency to be clad in the stretchy sports material. Alarmingly, some road safety experts admitted privately to Mailonline that  they fear to speak out because of intimidation and protests from hard-line cycling militants and ‘fundamentalists.’ The frequency  with which cyclists are breaking the law emerged  after a series of Information Act requests by the Mailonline to police forces across England and Wales. It found  that most of the offences were committed in London with 3,508 fixed penalty notices issued after cyclists  were caught jumping red lights. A further 6,173 tickets were issued after flouting the cyclists  flouted the law by riding on pavements. Avon and Somerset police recorded a total of 525 cyclists who were fined for cycling on pavements while 177 were issued a ticket for jumping lights and contravening other road signs. Officers in Cambridgeshire caught 48 cyclists cycling on pavements and 337 cyclists were caught ignoring red lights and other signs and markings. These include no entry signs, roundabout signs and box junctions. Each fixed penalty  ticket carries a fine of £50. And  in total, 4,275 tickets were issued across the country for jumping red lights and ignoring other road signs. Some 7,194 were issued to cyclists for riding on pavements. But the actual number may be far higher as not all the forces answered the request for information. The trend of red light-jumping comes despite a rise in the number of cyclists being killed on British roads this year. Last year, 14 cyclists died in London - six in just two weeks. In 2012, 122 cyclists died across the UK. Research by the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM)  shows that nearly six out of ten (57 per cent) cyclists admit to running red lights.with14 per cent doing so regularly or  sometimes. A quarter (24.9 per cent) say they do so ‘rarely’ and one in five (19.1 per cent) doing so ‘once or twice.’ Nearly three quarters(73 per cent) of cyclists admit to riding on the pavement. A YouGov poll revealed that almost a quarter (24 per cent) of cyclists think it is acceptable to go through a red light if they can see the way ahead is clear. Nearly one in five (18 per cent) said they had jumped a traffic light in the past six months. More than 60 per cent of people polled — including non-cyclists — said they thought it was common for cyclists to run a red light. Some 78 per cent said they should be prosecuted for such an offence. Statistics show more than 7,000 cyclists were fined for cycling on pavements (file picture) Scores of cyclists were filmed jumping red lights by hidden cameras set up by London black cab drivers. Their footage showed that just over half of riders  - 194 out of 364 - went through stop signals during the rush hour. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) which has 10,000 members,  recently set up hidden cameras at two ‘average’ crossroads to gather evidence between 7.30am and 8.30am  after a series of ‘near misses and confrontations’ between its members and cyclists.   The unedited film is available on YouTube. Running red lights 1) Metropolitan (London)Police: 3,508 . 2) Cambridgeshire: 337 . 3) Avon and Somerset Police: 177 . 4) Greater Manchester Police: 102 . 5) Hampshire: 57 Cycling on pavements: . 1) Metropolitan (London) Police: 6,173 . 2) Avon and Somerset: 525 . 3) Essex: 106 . 4) Hampshire Constabulary: 102 . 5) Greater Manchester Police: 57 . Source: Freedom of Information requests . LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: ‘We are constantly hearing  from the cycling lobbying groups that cyclists who ride on the pavement, weave in and out of traffic and fail to stop at red lights are a small minority or a small rogue element. This was in stark contrast to what we and most Londoners witness every day.’ The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) said cyclists’ illegal antics were reckless and putting lives at risk – including their own. It welcomed the prosecutions and urged police to do more. IAM policy and research director Neil Greig said: ‘It is putting lives at risk. Cyclists are not above the law. If cyclists want to be taken seriously on the road they must also obey the law and the rules of the road. ‘We welcome the fact that the police are taking action against cyclists who break the law by running thorough red lights or cycling on the pavement in substantial numbers.  They have got to  expect the police to enforce the law if they break it.’ Against a background of cycling groups demanding millions of pounds of new investment to make roads and junctions safer for bicycle users, Mr Greig said:’Cyclists must play their part by behaving responsibly on the road and obeying the law. If they want to be taken seriously they must also behave responsibly towards pedestrians and other road users.’ AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ‘Road safety is a two-way street and the law applies equally to cyclists and motorists. That is the case whether it is a negligent and reckless driver or a negligent and reckless cyclist.’ A cyclist who knocked down a schoolgirl and left her for dead after jumping a red light at 30mph was jailed for a year last month. Philip Benwell, 38, smashed into nine-year-old Leila Crofts as she stepped on to a pedestrian crossing. As she lay unconscious with a fractured skull, he climbed back on his bike and left the scene. The cyclist had been speeding downhill with his ‘head down and bottom raised off the seat’ just as Leila and her au pair reached the crossing. Although the traffic lights were showing red, Benwell failed to stop and he was forced to try and swerve at the last moment when he realised he was about to hit Leila.  But he failed, and crashed into the schoolgirl, who lives in Sandbanks, Dorset. She was thrown into the air and suffered a fractured skull when she landed in the road, spending 14 days in intensive care. Benwell was initially charged with causing grievous bodily harm by ‘wanton and furious cycling’ under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. The charge, which he admitted, was later changed to causing GBH. Judge Peter Johnson said Benwell had been ‘callous and selfish’ when he failed to stop. He told the cyclist that he was totally to blame: ‘You were cycling at high speed. It’s clear that the light must have been red for a few seconds before you went through that crossing. ‘You went through that crossing so you did not have to brake and stop so you could use your momentum to get up the hill on the other side. ‘You are the only one who is to blame. ‘This was an incredibly selfish criminal act.’ Leila, whose father Darren Crofts is a company director, was being taken to the beach for the afternoon in July when she crossed the road at Branksome Chine. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC foundation, said: ‘The rules of the road, and pavement, apply to those on two wheels as much as those on four. Given the relationship between drivers and cyclists is already often strained both groups have a duty to respect the law and hence each other.’ Worryingly a  number of road safety chiefs admitted privately to the Daily Mail that they are frightened of being too critical of cyclists and he cycling lobby  for fear of being  bullied, intimidated or ‘trolled’ – a form of internet cyber-bullying on social network sites like twitter and Facebook – by more militant cycling activists and hard-line ‘lycra louts'. ‘It’s a real concern’, said one.’ There is a real fear of a backlash from the cycling fundamentalists. They don’t like anything that smacks of criticism. You will get trolled. The cycling lobby will be on your back and it can be  quite intimidating.’ Another noted: ’If you say something which the cycling lobby find even mildly critical you will  face a barrage of criticism on Twitter. ’","More than 7,000 cyclists were fined for cycling on pavements .

"By . Martin Robinson . Madeleine McCann's parents said today their belief she could be alive has been 'reinforced' after police failed to find any clues during an eight-day search operation in Portugal. Kate and Gerry McCann said they were . 'very pleased' forensic searches had taken place in . Praia da Luz and it was 'gratifying' to know more will happen over the coming months. It comes as the couple will return to Portugal on Monday to deliver statements to the libel . trial of former Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral, who the McCanns . are suing over claims in his book The Truth Of The Lie. New hope: Gerry and Kate McCann, pictured in the days after Madeleine disappeared, said today the lack of clues found by police in Praia da Luz 'reinforces' their belief she is still alive . Investigation: British police sifting through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann . Amaral claims in his book that the McCann's faked their daughter's abduction to cover up her death in their holiday apartment. Spokesman . Clarence Mitchell said: 'I can confirm that Kate and Gerry are planning . to attend court in Lisbon on Monday when they will give their personal . statements having successfully appealed to do so.' Scotland . Yard yesterday abandoned their search of land close to where Madeleine . vanished in 2007, but said the multi-million-pound . inquiry will soon move into a new phase after negotiations with the . Portuguese authorities. Mr and Mrs McCann said in a statement . today: 'We are very pleased that significant activity has taken place in . Praia da Luz over the last 10 days. 'We . are further encouraged that despite the intensive searches, no trace of . Madeleine has been found and this reinforces our belief that she could . still be alive. 'As . parents of a missing child, we have always wanted all reasonable lines . of inquiry to be followed and it is gratifying to know that a . substantial amount of work will take place over the coming months with . the close co-operation of the British and Portuguese authorities. Specialist officers: A sniffer dog handler from South Wales police and his springer spaniel were flown in to Portugal to help with the search . 'We would like to thank all those involved for their efforts and the members of the public who have come forward with information.' Senior . officers said the searches were the ‘first phase’ of the investigation . into the disappearance of Madeleine, who was three when she went missing . in Praia da Luz in May 2007, and more activity will ‘commence shortly’. This . could include the arrest of a handful of suspects who detectives . suspect may be able to cast fresh light on the notorious case. The . announcement came just hours after graffiti was daubed in large orange . letters on a brick wall opposite one of the search areas. Written in Portuguese, the misspelled message translated as: ‘Maddie’s parents killed her. English police are stupid!’ The . attack was the latest sign of anger among locals at the high-profile . police inquiry, which is taking place as the annual tourist season takes . off. 'English police are stupid!' Graffiti scrawled on a wall near the search overnight as locals turned on the Met . Detectives from Britain and Portugal searched three areas on the edge of the Praia da Luz resort yesterday . British police officers were pictured scouring the scrubland using poles in the second week of the new search, which was abandoned yesterday . New phase: Police also inspected sewers under wasteland minutes from where Madeleine was last seen . Business owners have been joking that the police operation is a new tourist attraction, with many visitors asking for directions to the latest search site. Over the past eight days, officers have undertaken the biggest search undertaken overseas by a team of British police. They have searched to the ‘highest possible standards’ an area of scrubland equal in size to around nine football pitches. This . included checking water pipes, drainage channels and derelict buildings . around the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz on the Algarve. Police . also searched a horseshoe-shaped piece of waste ground that was . specifically identified as an area of interest by the latest inquiry. A . Met spokesman said 41 ‘ground anomalies’ – areas where the earth had . been disturbed – were discovered by aerial surveys and . ground-penetrating radar equipment. These sites, which . included three outside the original area, were then painstakingly . checked by search teams. The spokesman added: ‘At this time no evidence . relating to Madeleine McCann has been identified. ‘However it has given us an essential understanding of the activity on – and people that have used – this piece of land. ‘This . was the first phase of this major investigation, which has been agreed . with the Portuguese following the four International Letters of Request . submitted to date. More activity has been agreed and we expect that to . commence shortly. ‘In addition, further requests are being compiled and will be submitted in due course.’ From above: An aerial image shows the ground where police first started digging in the Madeleine McCann investigation yards from the apartment where she was last seen . The Met launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine’s disappearance in 2011, codenamed Operation Grange. Senior . officers stress that the operation in Portugal mirrors what would take . place in Britain for a murder or high-risk missing person inquiry.

"By . Tara Brady . Ketan Somaia gave the impression he was a successful millionaire by treating a wealthy investor to luxury trips and gifts . A business tycoon who boasted of his close friendship with the billionaire Hinduja brothers is facing years behind bars for fleecing wealthy investors of £12million. Ketan Somaia, dubbed ‘King Con’, from Bayswater in London, wooed his victims with luxury trips on private Learjets, Champagne parties, extravagant dinners and expenses paid trips to Dubai, Kenya and South Africa. The 52-year-old owned an office in Mayfair and a palatial home in the exclusive north London suburb of Hadley Wood - favoured by Arsenal and Spurs footballers - and insisted on serving his guests only cases of vintage Dom Perignon. In reality he was shamelessly exploiting his unwitting victims to get his hands on their millions. Somaia, a former business associate of Tory grandee Cecil Parkinson, managed to extract a total of £13.5million from entrepreneur Murli Mirchandani between June 1999 and May 2000 after promising high returns. Mr Mirchandani - who himself claims to be worth more than £70million - pursued Somaia in the civil court before finally launching a private prosecution. But even after his arrest Somaia continued to live a luxurious lifestyle that ‘most can only dream of’, dining at the five-star Dorchester hotel in Mayfair and the exclusive East India Men’s Club, and sending his teenage daughter to a finishing school in Switzerland. Somaia, who made his fortune in hotels, banking and media, was convicted of nine counts of obtaining money by deception totalling nearly £11.7million after a trial at the Old Bailey. He was acquitted of two counts of obtaining money by deception from Mr Mirchandani amounting to £2.06million. Somaia will be sentenced later this month once a report on his medical condition is prepared. Judge Richard Hone QC told the jurors they would be exempt from jury service for 15 years as a reward for serving on the 10 week-case - which was originally estimated to take a month. He said: ‘This case has been exceptional for a number of reasons - the sums involved, the extraordinary lifestyles, the famous names, the world of international businessmen and the outpouring of 23 million dollars simply relying on the concept of “My word is my bond”.’ All four of the Hinduja brothers who Ketan Somaia, dubbed King Con, claimed to know . Somaia was able to pull off the scams because his victims accepted his personal guarantees at face value. He gave the impression of being a successful businessman with his smooth, charming, impressive and persuasive exterior. The tycoon also swindled several other victims with ‘gobbledygook’ contracts and ‘smoke and mirrors’. Surajit Sen handed him around £1.18million in 1997. And after failing to get any more money out of Mr Mirchandani, Somaia conned Dilip Shah, the husband of one of his distant relatives, out of £120,000. He also owed a total of £8.84million to another businessman, referred to as ‘Mr Bose’, by April 2001. Somaia made the first repayment of £1.18million but failed to pay any more of the money back. Victim Murli Mirchandani leaving the Old Bailey after giving evidence during the trial . He signed a contract stating he would transfer 30 per cent of DHL’s share capital over to Mr Bose. But all he gave his creditor was a certificate which was only worth the paper it was printed on. He claimed he had repaid Mr Bose around £2.95million but later admitted that this was mostly from a £2.06million mansion in Dubai which he had signed over as security for the loan. Somaia bragged that he was a friend of the billionaire Hinduja brothers and owned assets worth £294million in banking and hotels. Mr Mirchandani heard of his business prowess at a cocktail party and was quickly bewitched by Somaia’s offer of a lucrative partnership. Somaia treated him to dinners at Annabel’s nightclub in London and all expenses paid trips to South Africa and Dubai and flaunted his lavish home in Hadley Wood, north London. His scam began with a plea for a short term loan of $865,000 to buy shares in Delphis Bank Mauritius, guaranteeing repayment in four months. Two days later he convinced Mr Mirchandani to hand over £4.42million to buy a ten per cent stake in the bank. In July Mr Mirchandani transferred another £1.47million to buy a stake in another company which Somaia claimed would double in value within three years. The following month Mr Mirchandani thought he was paying $2.775million for a 50 per cent interest in the Diamond Mining Corporation of Liberia, which Somaia claimed would treble in value within nine months. Two weeks later Mr Mirchandani transferred another $3million to Somaia to help purchase a bank in . Tanzania with a guaranteed profit of 20 per cent and full repayment within 120 days at 15 per cent interest. Somaia built up a feeling of ‘fevered excitement’ in his victim with false opportunities of being his business partner, said prosecutor William Boyce QC. A general view of Hadley Wood in north London where Ketan Somaia owned a palatial home (file picture) In October 1999 Somaia invited Mr Mirchandani to a meeting at his office in Brook Street, Mayfair and offered him the chance to invest in a hotel group in South Africa. Mr Mirchandani paid $1.85 million for a 50 per cent interest in the deal but never received any paper work confirming his investment. The duped businessman became increasingly worried about his investments after Somaia asked for two loans of £1million at 15 per cent interest and £800,000 at 18 per cent interest in November 1999. Somaia claimed he was having ‘cash flow problems’ but would personally guarantee the loans. The following month he invited Mr Mirchandani on another ‘no expenses spared’ trip to South Africa in December. By March 2000 Mr Mirchandani was pressing Somaia for repayment but still felt some obligation because of Somaia’s previous generosity. As a result he agreed to give the conman a further loan of one million dollars to be repaid within 30 days. He never received the money back but two months later Somaia again asked for another loan during a trip to Mauritius. Mr Mirchandani agreed to give him another £500,000 on condition everything was repaid by September 2000. He finally launched a private prosecution in the autumn of 2011 while Somaia was in London. Somaia then asked Dilip Shah for ‘emergency funding’ with an return of 25 per cent but Mr Shah could only afford £118,000. Somaia was convicted of nine counts of obtaining money by deception totalling nearly £11.7million after a trial at the Old Bailey . In return he was given ten million shares in Delphis Bank Mauritius but when he tried to cash them in a year later he was told they were worthless. Somaia claimed in his defence that Mr Mirchandani gave him the money knowing the risk it might be lost. His barrister James Woods QC said: ‘Mr Somaia was described as a colossus of the business world who overawed people with flashy charm and gifts. ‘We suggest Murli Mirchandani, rather than the weak man portrayed, is more likely a hard nosed business entrepreneur. It was he who looked at Mr Somaia in order to try and embark upon a business partnership. ‘He was prepared to pay out big money to secure that business relationship. ‘He gambled his money on Ketan Somaia. You win some and you lose some but you take it in your stride. This was no fraud.’ The court heard Mr Mirchandani had lost £23.6m in a business venture in Russia and was attempting to set up a bank in Nigeria when he first met Somaia. Mr Woods said: ‘It explains why Mr Mirchandani was throwing money at Ketan Somaia in the hope of persuading him to take part in that venture.’ Lord Parkinson was chairman of Dolphin Holdings, part of a business empire built up by Somaia, until its collapse in 2001. Somaia, from Bayswater, west London, was found guilty of 10 charges of obtaining money transfers by deception from Mr Mirchandani between 23 June 1999 and 6 May 2000 and one charge of obtaining money transfers by deception from Mr Shah on 10 August 2000.","Ketan Somaia wooed victims with luxury trips and Champagne parties .

"By . Tara Brady . Christopher Weston went on the run to visit his sister after jumping the fence at HMP Kirkham in Lancashire . A violent prisoner hitched a lift after escaping from jail only to find he had got in a car with a policeman, a court has heard. Christopher Weston, who is serving life for attempted murder, went on the run to visit his sister after jumping the fence at HMP Kirkham in Lancashire. He was picked up walking along the M6 motorway and given a lift to Preston Railway Station by the unsuspecting police officer after Weston gave him a false name. Weston, 35, then borrowed the rail fare to Bradford, West Yorkshire, from 'a kindly stranger' at the station, returning the money promptly in the post with a thank you note. He went back to the neighbourhood where he had repeatedly stabbed his former partner Dawn McGarry almost nine years ago. Bradford Crown Court heard he had dressed in black and waited with a knife. However, he was captured the following day at his sister’s address in Bradford. Weston’s escape, after seven weeks at the open prison, came almost exactly 12 months after police mounted a manhunt for him when he absconded from Sudbury Prison in Derbyshire during a Bank Holiday weekend in May 2013. He failed to return to the open prison following his release on temporary license. Weston, then of Bradford Moor, Bradford, carried out his attack on Miss McGarry outside her house on July 24, 2005. He tried to cut her throat and then repeatedly stabbed her. Weston told the police when he was arrested for the stabbing that he wanted to kill Miss McGarry and would try again given another opportunity. He pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was locked up when he appeared before Mr Justice Simon at Leeds Crown Court, who described it as a frenzied attack and labelled him a public danger. Weston appeared by video link from Leeds Prison at Bradford Crown Court and pleaded guilty to escaping from HMP Kirkham. Weston, who is serving a life sentence, pleaded guilty to escaping from HMP Kirkham in May this year . Prosecutor John Bull said he was discovered missing after a roll check on May 27. There was no mention in court of Weston absconding from HMP Sudbury last year, although the police made a public appeal to help catch him. Weston’s lawyer, Maria Temkow, said he was worried about his sister. She was having problems and he was very anxious to see her. His former partner did not know he was in the area and he had no intention of contacting her. He had not used any violence to escape or harm anyone while he was on the run, she said. Weston was now back in a secure jail and his parole status was 'substantially affected', she added. His release date was delayed as he would be unable to return to an open prison to begin his rehabilitation back into the community. Judge Jonathan Rose jailed Weston for 12 months, to run concurrently with his life sentence. The judge said he accepted he had no intention of contacting Miss McGarry or doing her any harm but added that Holme Wood was a close community and she could have found out he was in the area. 'She would have been caused very great fear if she had known about it,' Judge Rose said.","Christopher Weston, 33, was serving life for attempted murder .

"By . Martin Robinson . A science teacher has been sacked after she pretended she had cancer and even swabbed colleagues for DNA to see if they could save her life by donating tissue. Samantha Scrine, 26, today admitted falsely claiming she was dying from  stomach cancer but says she should not be struck off because 'stress' made her believe her bogus illness existed. A Cardiff tribunal heard she was an 'attention seeker' who for eight months convinced colleagues she was dying. Tribunal: Samantha Scrine, 26, was sacked for lying about having cancer but has asked not to be struck off because 'stress' made her believe it was true. A Cardiff tribunal heard she was an 'attention seeker' She also gave them a funeral wish list including songs for the service, a presentation on her life and a credit card to pay for things after she died. Miss Scrine - who was in good physical health - even asked her colleagues to be donors and took DNA swabs from her workmates pretending she needed to find out if their bone marrow matched. She then forged documents from the local hospital thanking her teaching them for providing the DNA samples. Miss Scrine claimed she was undergoing radiotherapy and was too ill to teach and her school then arranged for cover at a cost of £5,500. Her deceit was only revealed when concerned colleagues approached her family who said she was not ill. Presenting officer Louise Price told the tribunal today: 'She told the school she had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer. 'She said she had found a lump in her stomach but there was no treatment due to its location and she wasn't sure how much time she had to live. 'Miss Scrine said she had arranged radiotherapy for outside class time but she started to miss school due to illness. Fantasy: Miss Scrine convinced colleagues at Gowerton Comprehensive School in Swansea, South Wales, that she had cancer for eight months and even encouraged them to take DNA swabs . 'She claimed . the cancer had spread to her hip and texted fellow teachers asking for a . DNA samples to be taken to see if they were a match. 'She . took swabs from a number of teachers and members of their family. Some . of them received a letter from the hospital thanking them for their . swabs.' Miss . Scrine convinced colleagues at Gowerton Comprehensive School in . Swansea, South Wales, that she had cancer for eight months. Battle: The school want her struck off but she denies being dishonest because she had 'medical anxiety' She . invented stories about her fellow hospital patients, claiming she had . befriended a 10-year-old girl who had later died of cancer. A General Teaching Council for Wales hearing was told how she backed up her story by sending thousands of text messages pretending to be her own mother. The school eventually spoke to her actual family - who confirmed she did not have cancer but was suffering from depression. In June last year, she was sacked for 'gross misconduct of an unusual and serious nature'. The hearing in Cardiff was told how teachers at the school claim they will never trust each other again. In a statement one unnamed colleague said they couldn't believe they had been taken in by her 'attention seeking lies'. Miss Scrine claimed she had 'medical anxiety' brought on by stress and genuinely believe she was dying. She claimed she would go to hospital waiting rooms and take pain medication to cope with her symptoms. She admits making false statements, obtaining DNA swabs under false pretences and falsifying documents from Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. She accepts that this constitutes unacceptable professional conduct. She denies acting dishonestly - but could be struck off by the disciplinary panel. The case continues.","Samantha Scrine wants to avoid being struck off because she was stressed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ed Miliband yesterday became the first Labour leader since Neil Kinnock to address the traditional Durham Miners' Gala. His appearance at the event - billed as the largest remaining working class demonstration in the country - has been warmly welcomed by local trade unionists and party activists. But the Conservatives said he was ‘cosying up’ to Labour's left-wing union paymasters who secured the leadership for him. Labour's return: Ed Miliband holds son Daniel as he greets crowds on the balcony of County Hall, Durham . An estimated 100,000 people attended the gala, also known as The Big Meeting. Mr Miliband took to the balcony of the County Hotel as Labour leaders of the past have done for decades, watching some of the 80 or so miners' banners and around 50 brass bands parade past. Afterwards he addressed the large crowd on the old Racecourse, where he hit out at the bankers, Rupert Murdoch and ‘the rip-off’ of Britain's energy companies. He listed some of the Labour heroes who have spoken before him at past galas, including Keir Hardie, Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Barbara Castle. ‘I am proud to follow in their footsteps,’ he said. ‘I am proud to be here today.’ Throng: Mr Miliband speaks to a crowd of around 100,000 trade union and other activists in Durham yesterday . Support: Miliband waves to miners as they head towards the Durham Miners' Gala on the old Racecourse . Tradition: Durham Miners make their way towards the Durham Miners' Gala on the old Racecourse . Afterwards, he denied he had taken an electoral risk. He said: ‘The stakes are so high in this country. ‘If you are someone who is looking for work, whose living standards have been squeezed, or someone worried about the NHS you're not thinking why's Ed Miliband going to the Durham Miners' Gala, you are thinking what can Ed Miliband do for me.’ Mr Kinnock was the last Labour leader to attend in 1989, even though Tony Blair's Sedgefield constituency was part of the Durham Coalfield. The Conservative Party co-chairman Baroness Warsi said that by attending the event, Mr Miliband was cosying up to his ‘militant, left-wing paymasters’. But Mr Miliband said: ‘When you see people marching past as I did from the balcony of that hotel, a march people have been doing for 140 years, I think that it is not just about politics, it is about the strengths of these communities. ‘The idea that the people here are a bunch of militants, as some of my opponents say, is nonsense.’ Support: Labour leader Ed Miliband, carries his son Daniel, three, prior to making his speech . Piggyback: Mr Miliband, carries his son Daniel around the Old Racecourse - usually Durham University's cricket pitch . David Hopper, secretary of the Durham Miners' Gala which organises the event, praised Mr Miliband for venturing into the ‘lion's den’. He has previously branded Labour leaders who declined to come as ‘jokers’ who had insulted the region's heritage. ‘The ghost is buried,’ he said. ‘It was worth waiting 23 years for that type of reaction. ‘I was impressed (with the speech). I was more impressed with the courage he showed in coming. ‘He came onto the gala field, into the lion's den if you like.’ He also disagreed it was an electoral risk for Mr Miliband to come. Gap: Neil Kinnock last attended the working class festival in 1989 . Historic: Harold Wilson, seen speaking at the gala in 1965, was one of the many Labour prime ministers to attend . ‘He is among friends and comrades,’ he said. ‘I don't know what the attendance was yet - many, many thousands of people - and I cannot see how that will have done his chances of getting elected any damage whatsoever.’ Mr Miliband's 11-minute speech was warmly received by a large crowd gathered on the Racecourse - the cricket pitch used by Durham University. He concluded it by vowing to rebuild Britain, saying: ‘We understand our task for the future - to rebuild our country... on the values of the people of Britain: responsibility, community, fairness, equality and justice. ‘That's our mission, that's our task, that's the battle we can win together.’ Mr Miliband was surrounded by well-wishers as he made his way from the stage to the Labour Party tea tent.","Miliband denies taking risk and says he's proud to follow of footsteps former Labour leaders, who prior to 1989, routinely attended Durham Miners' Gala .

"By . Damien Gayle . Christina Aguilera is among the unlikely inclusions in a new list of record releases worth a small fortune to collectors. The What A Girl Wants warbler joins Muse, Gorillaz and Keane in the list of recent releases, most of them on vinyl, which change hands for hundreds of pounds. Aguilera's Back To Basics release from just eight years ago - released alongside CD as a limited edition triple vinyl package - weighs in at £100. Worth a ton: Christina Aguilera's Back to Basics triple vinyl releases now changes hands for as much as £100, according to a new list of valuable modern records compiled by the experts at Record Collector magazine . Record Collector editor Ian McCann . said: 'It's common knowledge that some Beatles records can be worth a . packet, and that you should never throw out original rock albums from . the 1960s and 70s without finding out whether they are valuable. 'But . few people realise that more recent vinyl albums can also be highly . collectable, with fans desperate to obtain copies of albums by the likes . of Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys and Keane as they were only pressed in . very limited numbers because most buyers wanted these albums on CD or as . downloads. 'It's about supply and demand: the print run was low, and demand is now high.' The . list of 51 modern rarities, dubbed 'New Money' by Record Collector . magazine, includes the début Muse album Showbiz, Keane's first album . Hopes And Fears and Demon Days by Gorillaz, also each valued at £100 on . vinyl. Kate . Bush's 2005 album Aerial is another which the list's creator Ian . Shirley - who edits the Rare Record Price Guide - puts at £100. Oddly enough, almost mint copies of The Dreaming, her LP from more than two decades earlier, can be had for as little as £8. Pretty pricey: Muse's debut album Showbiz and Demon Days by Gorillaz also shift for around the £100 mark . Music collectibles lists tend to be dominated by classic early releases or obscure cult acts, but Record Collector's latest list focuses solely on rare releases out since 2000. And it shows that popularity and chart success are no deterrent to the hardcore music collector - it is usually the scarcity of limited edition versions which has added to their value. A box set by Blur called Blur 21, drawing together each of their album releases, now attracts a price of £200 on vinyl. Their Britpop rivals Oasis attract £300 for the 2009 collection of each of their albums, according to the list to be published in the Record Collector's May edition. Among the more esoteric entries is the incidental music from children's show The Clangers, with the 26 copies which came in a knitted sleeve going for around £125. And a 12in single by Jack White called Sixteen Saltines - said to have been the world's first liquid-filled record - is listed at £300. The most expensive item on the list is Bob Dylan's The 50th Anniversary Collection which came out in 2012 and was limited to just 100 copies on four CD-R discs. They were pressed to extend the copyright of the material recorded in 1962 and are estimated to be worth £600. THE 50th ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION (4CD-R, 2012, Son, no cat no) £600 . While most releases covered in this list are vinyl, this 4CD-R set cannot be ignored. It was 'released' in a limited edition of 100 copies to ensure that Sony could renew its copyright of Dylan material – including six versions of Mixed Up Confusion – that was originally recorded in 1962. In other words, they stopped it falling into the public domain. DEATH MAGNETIC (white vinyl box set, US, 2008, Warner Bros 512119-1) £500 . Death Magnetic was the ninth studio album by Metallica. Death Magnetic is the ninth studio album by Metallica, released in 2008 through Warner Bros. Records . SOUNDTRACK FROM THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME (4LP 180g expanded edition, 2008, Rhino/Atlantic/Swan Song 8122799489) £500 . The Song Remains the Same is the soundtrack live album of the concert film of the same name by Led Zeppelin. The album was originally released in October 1976, before being remastered and re-issued in 2007. SIXTEEN SALTINES (12” 2012 Third Man TMR 137) £300 . The only shop selling this beauty on Record Store Day in 2012 was Jack White’s Third Man outlet in Nashville, Tennessee. The fuss is because this 12in is the world’s first liquid-filled record. It’s estimated that only 400 were made. Some have leaked! LP BOX SET  (2009, Big Brother RKIDBOX 58) £300 . What you get in this box set is every album the Gallagher brothers recorded. The box was limited to 1,500 numbered copies and the majority have probably never been removed from their shrink-wrap. BLOOD LUST (LP+7”, 2011, Rise Above RISELP 139) £250 . In just a few short years, Uncle Acid went from nowhere to supporting Black Sabbath on their 2013 world tour. The price for pressings on purple vinyl – with no 7” – is £100, and you can expect to pay around £20 for dark-as-Hades black wax. THE SHUTTERED ROOM (LP, 2011, Trunk RSD 001) £200 . There are just 29 vinyl copies of the Basil Kirchin soundtrack to this classic British horror film in existence, pressed up a few years ago by Trunk Records. The LP has an embossed logo on the cover and hand-stamped artwork plus an insert explaining its origins. OPUS EPONYMOUS (Box set, 2010, Rise Above RISELP 124) £200 . This debut album by a Swedish doom band has been hailed as a classic and put them on the map worldwide, with recent follow-up, Infestissumam (2013), cementing their reputation. There was a mind-boggling number of limited-edition coloured vinyl variants of Opus – as well as a gamut of re-pressings to sate demand. But this is the mother - collectable black vinyl edition in a box that contains a patch and a massive A1-sized poster. There were only 300. BLUR 21 (Box Set, 2012, EMI BLURBOXLP 1) £200 . This box set, released to mark Blur's 21st anniversary, features the band's seven studio albums on heavyweight vinyl, each of the LPs repackaged as a double album except for Leisure, a single album.

"By . Alex Ward . Sometimes a bargain can be too good to be true. But frying pans that appeared online for the price of £0.00 were the exception to the rule after the company selling them gave hundreds away for free. A computer glitch at ProCook, based in Gloucester, led to the pricing blunder for the non-stick Fusion pans which normally sell for £18. Cookware company ProCook gave away 600 frying pans after incorrectly advertising them online for £0.00 . Word about the amazing offer spread quickly online and between last Friday night and Saturday afternoon six hundred customers placed orders, some ordering as many as forty pans. Retailing at £18 each, the multiple orders would have cost ProCook £50,000 to honour but the company decided to send each customer who ordered during the glitch one pan as a gesture of goodwill. Company spokeswoman Sarah Savory-Smith said: ‘We were not legally bound to supply the pans for nothing but we have decided to send one pan to each person who ordered them as a gesture of goodwill. Goodwill: The company sent each customer who ordered the 28cm non-stick frying pan for free . ‘Some people tried to order more than one, in one case there was an order for forty but we are certainly not doing that. ‘We don’t yet know how this error occurred. Suddenly on Friday night the price of these pans went down to zero. Tesco in particular has been badly hit by price glitch mistakes in the past. Just before Christmas last year a glitch at the chain's tills meant . shoppers could buy Terry's Chocolate Oranges for just 29p – a saving of . almost 90 per cent on the list price of £2.75. The mix-up happened because tills couldn't handle two simultaneous . promotions on the chocolates – a three-for-£5 offer and a . buy-one-get-one-free deal. Earlier that year, Tesco suffered yet again for a till blunder in June . 2011, when customers were walking away with 24 cans or bottles of . leading brands of lager for only £4. The promotion was supposed to offer a saving of £4 on two cases of 12 . drinks such as Carling, Fosters and  Budweiser, which normally sell for a . total of £20. But when shoppers reached the till, they were being charged only £4 instead of £16. And Tesco, again, earlier that month was caught out on another beer deal glitch. A deal offering three boxes of various alcoholic drinks for £20 was going through the tills at three for £11. ‘Luckily some of our staff were very vigilant and noticed this quickly on Saturday and were able to put it right. ‘The 28cm Fusion pan is one of our most . popular products and news about this apparent giveaway offer spread . amazingly quickly across the world thanks to various bloggers.’ An online petition of angry customers helped force M&S to honour orders for Panasonic 50 inch 3D plasma televisions after shoppers snapped up the sets for just £199 following a pricing blunder earlier this year. High street giant Next has been left red-faced after listing a pair of sofas worth £1,198 on its website for just £98. Online shoppers were delighted when they discovered the blunder, which reduced the cost of the sofas by £1,100 instead of the intended £100. But the retailer fell back on small print in its terms and conditions which it says allows it to cancel orders before they are dispatched for delivery. Next was quick to spot the error and corrected the price after just a few hours in January this year. Amazon was once blitzed by bargain hunters after it mistakenly priced music album downloads for 29p in 2009. Many customers, tipped off by consumer websites, bought scores of downloads before Amazon realised it was selling entire albums for less than the price of some of its singles. It is understood that more than 30 different albums were priced at 29p for four hours.","ProCook was forced to give away 600 frying pans after a pricing glitch online advertised it for £0.00 .

"By . Bianca London . While many people blame their cellulite on poor diet and lack of exercise, one psychologist thinks it may be to do with repressed anger from childhood . Dreading getting into your bikini this summer because of your lumpy legs? You're not alone. Eighty per cent of women suffer from cellulite - including svelte stars such as Kim Kardashian and Sienna Miller. A host of products and wacky gimmicks - from . detox diets and green tea patches to miracle cellulite melting knickers - are out there which claim to tackle orange peel thighs. But, according to Venezuelan psychologist Martha Sanchez Navarro, it's time to cast aside the magic pants, banish the body brush and book into therapy instead. She believes the condition - which occurs when the strands that connect the . layers of tissue and the fat below the skin gradually harden and . contract - is caused by childhood trauma, not insufficient exercise or poor circulation. She says our emotions find an outlet through physical symptoms and . any childhood stress - such as having too many rules to obey - . suppresses creativity and can cause cellulite later in life. It may all sound rather unlikely, but . Sanchez Navarro isn't the only one who believes our emotions can leave . such a visible mark on us. Natural beauty expert, Alexander . Barani, agrees: 'Our emotional lives certainly play a part in the . physical effects of our bodies. 'The repression of feelings can also . lead to more wrinkles! I encourage all to be more open with your . feelings to prevent these physical symptoms appearing. So, if we are to believe Sanchez Navarro . and Barani, it's time to abandon that British reserve, let it all hang . out and not only will your thighs be smoother, but your face too. While there are plenty of lotions and potions out there to help you beat dimpled skin, they could be a waste of money . Sanchez Navarro isn't the only one with ideas about the origins of cellulite - as the exact causes are not yet fully understood, theories abound. It's commonly thought diet plays a major part: too much fat, salt, carbohydrates and not enough fibre may make you more likely to suffer from fatty lumps and bumps. Some believe hormones may be to blame, as estrogen, insulin, noradrenaline, thyroid hormones and prolactin are part of the cellulite production process. Others say our it's all down to our genes. Two of the main causes of cellulite are believed to be lack of activity and a poor diet containing too much sugar, fat and salt . However, not everyone agrees with the Sanchez Navarro's findings. Dr Wolf, Joint Medical Director at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'There are a number of factors which can contribute to the development of cellulite. 'Until more research is carried out, . women should continue to focus on healthy diet, weight maintenance and . regular exercise regime, and try not to fluctuate any of these factors . too much and keep them consistent' 'These do include weight gain and obesity but that is not to say that all women who are overweight will suffer with cellulite. 'The broad categories of causes are: hormonal, genetic, environmental and lifestyle. Some of these we can obviously change, but others not. 'Poor nutrition or crash dieting can contribute to cellulite on the thighs, buttocks and even the stomach. Smoking has also been found to contribute, while not drinking enough water or maintaining a diet that is too high in salt can also lead to its formation. 'But while stress (particularly when coupled with an irregular, unhealthy diet and  lack of exercise) can be a genuine cause of cellulite, there has not been enough research to support the notion that low levels of creativity, or any kind of emotional strain, can be to blame. 'And until more research is carried out, women should continue to focus on healthy diet, weight maintenance and regular exercise regime, and try not to fluctuate any of these factors too much and keep them consistent.'

Earlier, officers had fired stun grenades and tear gas to block a march by about 200 protesters heading towards the stadium. A stand-off followed with banner-brandishing demonstrators congregating near a police line guarding the route to Maracana. Outnumbered both by security forces and journalists, the protesters chanted 'Fifa, go back to Switzerland' referring to the international soccer's governing organisation.

"By . Kit Holden . Germany has a new hero. The national team may be preparing for their second round clash with Algeria on Monday evening, but back home, the name on everyone’s lips is neither Thomas Mueller, nor Miroslav Klose, nor Phillipp Lahm. The name on everyone’s lips is Howard Webb. The Premier League referee is England’s last surviving representative at this summer’s World Cup. He gained worldwide praise for his outstanding display during Brazil’s victory over Chile on Saturday.  Nowhere has the praise been louder than in Germany. Decisive: Former World Cup final referee Webb spotted Hulk handling the ball and booked him . Outrage: Hulk complains to assistant referee Michael Mullarkey but the English officials got it right . On Monday morning, the German papers were packed full of plaudits for Webb. The 'Tagesspiegel' referred to the former police sergeant as 'The best Englishman', while the 'Berliner Morgenpost' described his performance as 'a shining example to other referees'. 'Bild' went one further, claiming that Webb was a 'chink of light' in the never-ending discussions over poor refereeing decisions. 'Webb is the World Cup’s Super-Referee!' wrote Germany’s biggest newspaper, 'can he not take charge of every single game?' The Munich paper 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' also pointed out the stark contrast between Webb’s performance and those of his contemporaries. 'The English referee is reparing the reputation of his profession. He is correcting the impression of otherwise overwhelmingly average refereeing displays' they told their readers. Handball: Webb indicates why he disallowed Hulk's strike which looked to have given Brazil the lead . Unhappy: Brazil coach Scolari argues with Webb and the fourth official Felix Brych after the decision . In all corners, there was praise for Webb’s correct assessment of a number of difficult decisions, not least the penalty he denied Brazil striker Hulk, having correctly judged that the player had controlled the ball with his upper arm. Webb’s general approach to the game was also remarked upon, with most pointing out that he was reluctant to issue cards, and thereby allowed the game to flow freely. To earn so much respect from the German media was no mean feat for the British referee. Prior to this tournament, his name was a byword in Germany for poor officiating, courtesy of his infamous poor decision at the World Cup Final in 2010. On that day, he failed to send off Dutch midfielder Nigel de Jong, despite the player having planted his studs into the chest of Spain’s Xabi Alonso. Good call: Although on first viewing the goal looked legitimate, Webb rightly spotted Hulk's handball . Ridiculed: Webb was mocked by the German press for only giving a yellow card for this 'tackle' by Nigel de Jong . Now though, Webb’s reputation is restored in Germany. He has 'rehabilitated' himself, as the Sueddeutsche Zeitung put it. Indeed, many are now calling for him to be in charge of this year’s final. 'Webb was cool-headed and courageous,' wrote the Spiegel, 'as a performance, it was the perfect application to referee a second consecutive World Cup Final'. Germany will also be hoping that Webb’s comeback can inspire a similar reaction from their own whistle carrying representative. Rehabilitation: The former policeman's excellent display on Saturday has revived his reputation . The German referee at this tournament is Felix Brych, who achieved infamy last season after granting Bayer Leverkusen a goal, despite the ball having clearly hit the side netting. His nomination for the World Cup was greeted with much derision in the German media. Brych was Webb’s fourth official on Saturday. Perhaps, in the dressing room, he picked up some tips on how to go from laughing stock to refereeing superstar.","Webb disallowed Hulk's goal in Brazil's last-16 match against Chile .

After their wonderful dismantling of Italy on Friday night, the players of Costa Rica stayed locked in their dressing room at Recife's Arena Pernambuco for 45 minutes. Victory had placed them in the second phase of the World Cup with a game to spare, but time still had to be found for prayer. When they finally emerged, it was to the realisation that - for some - lives had changed forever. Back home, Jorge Luis Pinto's team will forever be known as the one that defeated a giant of world football and ensured that another - England - went home from World Cup 2014 early. As their assistant coach the former Manchester City and Derby County striker Paulo Wanchope explained afterwards, many of these players will not fully understand what they have achieved until these finals are over. VIDEO Scroll down for Tricks, flicks and bicycle-kicks in Costa Rica training . Eye-catching: Joel Campbell will return to Arsenal in July after a loan spell at Olympiakos . Against England this week in Belo Horizonte, however, Wanchope does expect the team's star players to understand they are doing more than appearing in a relatively dead rubber at the World Cup. They are auditioning for Barclays Premier League contracts. 'It's a big surprise for the world,' said Wanchope. 'I understand that. The reality is that nobody in the world expected Costa Rica to go through in this group.

The . remarkable thing about Costa Rica's success in Group D is that it has . been fully deserved. These have not been fluke victories. Against Uruguay - who they beat 3-1 - Pinto's team were second best for 45 minutes but swept the South Americans away after half-time. And against Italy they were never inferior in the heat of a Brazilian afternoon. Team spirit: Surprise package Costa Rica could finish top of Group D . Confidence and belief runs through this . team. Footage released after Friday's game shows the Costa Rica players - . still aggrieved at not being awarded a penalty - squaring up to their . Italian counterparts in the tunnel at half-time. That says a lot. Young Joel Campbell, who will return to Arsenal in July after a loan spell at Olympiakos in Greece, summed up his teammates' approach to this tournament. If England are fearing a clean sweep of defeats this week then so they should. 'Football is not decided by what shirt you're wearing,' said the forward. 'With work and effort, you can win against anyone. We always believed we could do this. Of course we did. We were working for this moment and we have achieved. 'You never know what will happen in but we will keep working to do more.' Shock: Costa Rica have won their two games against Uruguay and Italy at World Cup . Of those players who may catch Premier League attention, Campbell is one while goalkeeper Keylor Navas - currently with Levante in Spain - and FC Copenhagen midfielder Christian Bolanos have already stood out. Campbell added: 'We are not thinking about who we get in the last 16. It does not matter to us. We were in a group with three champions of the world and we have shown that we can beat anyone. 'Today is unforgettable, we are part of history. 'Nobody would have put a single dollar on this team qualifying and there you go, we are very happy. It is the best day of my career, obviously. 'It is a problem for Italy if they did not pay attention to us. We trusted in what we were doing. This shows that, yes, you can do things if you work hard.' A point against England on Tuesday would see Costa Rica top Group D and face a last-16 tie against the runner-up from the Group C teams: Colombia, Ivory Coast, Japan and Greece.","Players will be auditioning for contracts when they face England on Tuesday .

"By . Tim Shipman . The publication of the final report from the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War has been delayed for another year because officials are refusing to allow Tony Blair's private messages to George W. Bush to be released. The delay was announced today by inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot in a letter to David Cameron. It means the committee's final judgement will not be delivered until at least a decade after the war. Secret relationship: The publication of the final report from the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War has been delayed for another year because officials are refusing to allow Tony Blair's private messages to George W. Bush to be released . Sir John complains that the inquiry team's ability to publish 'a balanced, fair and accurate' report is being undermined by the refusal of Whitehall officials to let them publish the documents on which their conclusions are based. Intelligence papers relating to MI5, MI6, the listening post GCHQ and the deliberations of the Joint Intelligence Committee are understood to be among the messages being held back. But in his letter, Sir John also makes clear he wants the government to release Mr Blair's private letters to President Bush, which are understood to show that he committed in principle to support a US war in Iraq long before he came clean with the public. He also wants to be able to show the public details of deliberations in Cabinet over the war, which are likely to expose the true nature of the discussion over the legality of the conflict and the degree to which ministers were in the dark about the intelligence case for war. In a letter to Mr Cameron, Sir John says there are unresolved disputes over 'a number of particularly important categories of evidence, including the treatment of discussions in the cabinet and cabinet committees and the UK position in discussions between the prime minister and heads of state or government of other nations.' Sir John explicitly says issues around Mr Blair's evidence 'will need to be resolved'. Facing questions: Tony Blair addressing the Chilcot Iraq Inquiry in January 2010.  Sir John Chilcot wants the government to release Mr Blair's private letters to President Bush . He also refers to the inquiry's desire to publish 'transcripts from a small number of private hearings' - understood to include testimony from intelligence officers. Mr Blair has already discussed his letters widely in his evidence and his spin doctor Alastair Campbell reveals elements of the discussions in his diaries. Yet Cabinet Office officials, led by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his predecessor Lord O'Donnell, have argued that publication of the letters would undermine future candour between leaders if there was a prospect of them being published. Sir John's letter will pile pressure on Mr Blair to grant a one-off exemption to the rules to allow publication of his correspondence with President Bush. Report author: Sir John fears the inquiry team's ability to publish 'a balanced' report is being undermined . Gus O'Donnell told the Chilcot panel that releasing Blair's notes would damage Britain's relations with the US and would not be in the public interest. 'We have attached particular importance to protecting the privacy of the channel between the prime minister and president,' he said. But Sir John has emphasised that the protocols were 'put in place to protect national security, international relations and the personal security of individuals. 'They are not there to prevent embarrassment.' The inquiry held 18 months of public hearings between the end of 2009 and early 2011 and was originally expected to publish by the summer of 2011. But Sir John Chilcot has now revealed that he will not even begin approaching witnesses the report will criticise for their comments before the middle of next year. That means the final report will not be published until the autumn of 2013 and potentially into 2014. It is expected to criticise Mr Blair's use of intelligence about Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction in making the case for war - in particular through the creation of the so-called 'dodgy dossier'. Sir John is on record as saying that Mr Blair's claim that MI6 established 'beyond doubt' that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction was 'not possible to make on the basis of intelligence'. He reveals that the report is expected to exceed one million words in length, though it will also come with a more digestible summary for the public.","Final report may not be published until 2014 .

"By . Jack Doyle . Updated: . 06:36 EST, 3 October 2011 . Change: The move follows lobbying from gay groups . For decades, passport applicants have been required to provide details of their mother and father. But now, after pressure from the gay lobby, they will be given the option of naming ‘parent 1’ and ‘parent 2’. The change, which is due to take place within weeks, has been made following claims the original form was ‘discriminatory’ and failed to include same-sex couples looking after a child. It has led to claims the official travel document is being turned into a ‘PC passport’. Campaigners for family values said the move ‘denigrated’ the roles of parents bringing up children in traditional families. Norman Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘Fathers and mothers are not interchangeable but have quite distinct roles to play in the care and nurture of their children. ‘To speak of “parent 1” and “parent 2” denigrates the place of both fathers and mothers. ‘Much as the equality and diversity social engineers might wish it were otherwise, it still takes a father and a mother to produce a child.’ The Identity and Passport Service insisted it was necessary to incorporate same-sex parents on the form so that accurate information is collected . The decision follows the revelation . last month that details of the holder’s sex could be erased from all . passports to spare transgender people from embarrassment. The proposals are the latest shake-up to established rules for passports. Last month, the Daily Mail revealed that the Government is preparing to introduce passports without details of the holder’s gender. It would spare transgender people and those with both male and female organs from having to tick ‘male’ or ‘female’ boxes. Supporters say it will solve the problem of embarrassing situations at border controls, where people whose sex appears to differ from that in their passport undergo questioning from guards. As the rules stand, everyone must identify themselves as a man or women, even when they are undergoing sex-change therapy. But, following pressure from the Lib Dems, the Home Office has begun a consultation on changing the rules. The . latest shift follows lobbying from gay rights groups, who argue that . the current passport application form fails to recognise same-sex . couples who are both officially registered as a child’s parents. Documents seen by the Daily Mail suggest the change was made as a result of lobbying by the gay rights group Stonewall. The Home Office ‘Diversity Strategy’ states: ‘IPS [the Identity and Passport Service] is working with . Stonewall in response to an issue about having to name a “mother” and . “father” on the passport application form.’ Mr Wells added: ‘Like the Labour administration before it, the Coalition seems to be in Stonewall’s grip. ‘It is high time ministers started to . represent the interests of the country as a whole and not capitulate to . every demand made by a vocal and unrepresentative minority.’ Gay couples are registered as the official parents of any child they adopt. Those who use surrogate mothers must apply to the courts for a ‘parental order’ in order to be recognised as a child’s official parents. Similar changes have been made in recent months to passport application forms in the U.S., outraging traditional family groups and religious conservatives. Officials accepted that the move was made following lobbying from gay rights groups who claimed it was discriminatory. But a spokesman for the Identity and Passport Service insisted it was necessary to incorporate same-sex parents on the form so that accurate information is collected. He said: ‘IPS is planning to amend the application form and associated guidance to deal with same-sex parents applying for a passport on behalf of a child. ‘Currently, the application form provides the relevant boxes of “mother” and “father” to be completed. ‘The new form to be introduced by December 2011 will in addition provide for “parent 1” and “parent 2”. ‘It is essential that any parent provides the necessary information on their status as parents or guardians when applying for a passport on behalf of their child. 'This protects the interests of the child and ensures that IPS is able to issue passports securely and safely to the right person. ‘The passport application form is therefore being updated to incorporate same-sex parents.’ Gay lobbyists and politicians have long claimed that 10 per cent of the population is homosexual. But figures from the Office for National Statistics last week suggest that this is a wild exaggeration. According to the Integrated Household Survey, homosexuals and bisexuals make up only 1.5 per cent of the population. One per cent said they were gay or lesbian, while 0.5 per cent said they were bisexual. More men than women declared themselves homosexual, with 1.3 per cent of men saying they were gay compared with 0.6 per cent of women who described themselves as lesbian. Some 94 per cent said they were heterosexual, 4.3 per cent declined to answer the question or said they did not know, and 0.4 per cent said their sexuality was ‘other’.","Change comes after lobbying from gay rights group .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Apple is expected to launch a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch version of its iPhone 6, with the larger model rivalling the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. While numerous images of the 4.7-inch version have been leaked over the past few weeks, until recently details of the 5.5 inch model have remained a mystery. Now, prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). Scroll down for video . Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone . While the photos themselves aren’t groundbreaking, they suggest Apple is already producing components for the larger-sized phones, according to 9 to 5 Mac who first reported the leak, after Dickson tweeted the images. An image last week, also leaked by Dickson, revealed the two new models side-by-side. These latest photos are the first images of the 5.5-inch version's display part. Foxconn, which manufacturers around 70 per cent of the phone, recently hired 100,000 additional workers in mainland China to help produce the iPhone 6. Both these moves suggest Apple is gearing up for the launch of new iOS devices around the usual September timeframe. The 5.5-inch version of its iPhone 6 is expected to rival the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 (pictured) An image last week, also leaked by Sonny Dickson, revealed the two new iPhone 6 models side-by-side . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). Separate reports have suggested the 5.5-inch model will be released several weeks before the 4.7-inch model, and will be produced in limited numbers. Based on previous leaks, the new set of iPhones will launch in a thinner aluminium body and will include a sapphire crystal display covering for improved strength. Users of Apple's next handset may also be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system. Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung. Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . Both iPhones are also thought to include a higher-resolution display with a pixel ratio of 1704 x 960. They may also include an A8 system-on-a-chip for improved efficiency, performance boosts, and better battery life. Apple also has the iWatch in the pipeline for release this year, which will include more than 10 sensors to take health measurements and other data. Apple has been under pressure to release new products, as investors question whether the company that popularized the smartphone and the tablet computer is still able to innovate following the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. Taiwan's Quanta Computer Inc will start mass production of Apple first smartwatch in July, and the much anticipated timepiece will be revealed in October, it has been claimed. Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen . Tag Heuer, part of luxury goods group LVMH, said on Friday its vice president for sales, Patrick Pruniaux, who had been with the brand for seven years, was leaving on Monday to join Apple - and is expected to work on the iWatch.","Images of LCD panel were leaked by Melbourne-based, Sonny Dickson .

"By . Gavin Mccafferty, Press Association . Ricky Burns was floored seconds into his comeback fight as his hopes of quickly returning to world title level were shattered by defeat by Dejan Zlaticanin. Promoter Eddie Hearn had challenged Burns to send out a statement against the unbeaten Montenegrin but it was a far from positive signal as Zlaticanin secured a split-decision points win, although he appeared a clear winner. Hearn had secured a WBC eliminator in the Scot's first fight since losing his WBO belt to Terence Crawford but it was the visitor who moved closer to fighting champion Omar Figueroa and left Burns facing an uncertain future. Shock: Ricky Burns was knocked down in the first round as he lost to Dejan Zlaticanin . Ouch: Burns recovered from the knockdown but lost on a split decision . Burns was on the floor within 30 seconds when southpaw Zlaticanin, who had knocked out 13 of his previous 18 opponents, caught him with a counter left hook. The two-weight world champion looked shaken as he got up after the eight count and his diminutive opponent kept raining shots in. Burns looked in danger of being stuck on the ropes a couple of times in the early rounds and Zlaticanin's left hook caused the Scot problems throughout the fight, for the vacant WBC International title. The Coatbridge fighter managed to put together some combinations but none troubled the visitor, who generally responded with an intense flurry of punches. Open: Burns was vulnerable to the Montenegrin's left hook and lost for the second successive time . Another left hook had Burns in trouble in the fifth and, just when the 31-year-old excited the Braehead Arena crowd with a decent right hook in the next round, Zlaticanin soon forced him back again. The Montenegrin, fighting outside of the Balkans for the first time, continued to brush off Burns' replies and throw the more dangerous punches despite the Scot looking more steady as the fight progressed and winning several of the later rounds. Zlaticanin was awarded the win by 115-113 on two scorecards with one judge, John King, giving Burns the victory by the same score, but there was no sense of injustice among the home crowd. Backed up: Burns had hoped to set up a world title shot but that looks unlikely now .","Ricky Burns was knocked down in the first round in Glasgow .

"By . Associated Press . A 27-year-old South Carolina man has been charged with involuntary manslaughter more than a year after he hugged a 14-month-old child so tightly that the boy stopped breathing and died. Orangeburg County police took Robert Kemp into custody Tuesday. He was released on $10,000 bond the next day. Kemp is described as a family friend in a news release from Ravenell. An arrest warrant said Kemp killed the child 'by giving him a bear hug, squeezing the victim so tight that the victim stopped breathing as a result.' Horrific: 14-month-old Jaylen Harris allegedly died when the man watching him hugged him so heard he stopped breathing . Killer? Kemp is identified as a family friend of the child's. He initially told police he found Jaylen dead in his crib. It was unclear why police waited a full year to press charges . Jaylen Harris died from asphyxiation, on June 27, 2013, Orangeburg County Chief Deputy Coroner Sean Fogle said. It remained unclear why a year went by before charges were filed. Kemp told deputies he was playing with the child when he started to rub his eyes like he was tired, so he put the toddler in his crib on his back with his bottle, according to an incident report. Kemp said he went to the kitchen to do some chores and realized he hadn't heard the boy in a while. He went back into the bedroom and noticed the toddler on his stomach, unconscious with his hands balled into fists, according to the report. Another person in the home, whose name was blacked out on the report, started CPR, but the boy could not be resuscitated, according to the report. If convicted, Kemp faces up to five years in prison. The sheriff's release didn't say why it took a year to bring charges, and a spokeswoman for the sheriff said in an email no more information would be released. Kemp lives in Columbia, and a woman who identified herself as his mother when she answered the phone offered to give her son a message that was not returned. The boys' family created a website at GiveForward.com and is asking for donations to help cover his funeral costs. 'Baby Jaylen Harris passed away in his sleep of natural causes. He was 14 months old. He was the sweetest, happiest baby you would ever meet. He was a blessing and a joy to this family,' they wrote on the website. A message left at a phone number listed for the baby's mother was not returned. Tragic: Family created a GiveForward.com donation page for Jaylen, which drew thousands of dollars for his funeral, but it was halted prematurely four days before the services .","Robert Kemp of South Carolina was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the June 2013 death of 14-month-old Jaylen Harris .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kayode Oshin has been jailed for 22 years for a bungled drugs shooting in an alleyway in Hounslow two years ago . A gunman who uploaded a rap video onto YouTube boasting about trying to murder a rival with a ‘spray and pray’ machine gun was jailed for 22 years today. Kayode Oshin, 21, attempted to assassinate Yassin Zouaiou with a Mac 10 in a feud over drugs and money in Hounslow, west London, after being enticed into a world of gang culture and crime’, a court heard. Mr Zouaiou survived when the gun jammed - but a single bullet was fired, hitting his brother Mohammed Ali Subhani in the neck. But Oshin then posted a rap video bragging about the shooting on YouTube. The shooting was carried out in an alleyway between North Drive and Kingsley Road, Hounslow, at around 1am on October 6, 2011, the court heard. Oshin and a second man, Junior Tahir-Akinyele, 19, were arrested the next day in a white Mercedes-Benz they had hired for the attack. Jailing Oshin for 22 years and Tahir-Akinyele for 14 years, Judge Timothy Pontius said the pair had been ‘enticed into a world of gang culture and crime’. ‘Oshin you are convicted of attempted murder, your clear intention was that Yassin Zouaiou should die,’ he added. ‘That intention would undoubtedly have been realised were it not for the fact that the mechanism on the gun jammed, releasing only one round. Oshin, 21, set out to murder Yassin Zouaiou with a Mac 10 automatic machine gun in a feud over drugs and money . ‘It’s a matter of good fortune that he was not killed in what would have been a spray of bullets had the weapon been in good working order. ‘The Mac 10 was obtained by you with a specific murder in mind. Junior Tahir-Akinyele was convicted of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm and jailed for 14 years . ‘Tahir-Akinyele you are convicted of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. ‘It was your intention to hurt Mohammed Ali Subhani very badly, an intention that was fulfilled to the extent that really serious injury was caused. ‘You readily and willingly played your part in obtaining the Mac 10.’ The pair, both from Hounslow, are currently serving sentences for a stabbing in Isleworth in November 2011 - Oshin for ten years and Tahir-Akinyele for eight. ‘Both of you have a record for serious violence,’ Judge Pontius said. ‘I have no doubt that the public must be protected from serious harm at your hands. ‘You are both currently serving substantial sentences for the offence in November 2011.’ Oshin was jailed for 22 years for attempted murder; 16 years imprisonment for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and 14 years for wounding with intent, all to run concurrent. Tahir-Akinyele was sentenced to 14 years in a Young Offenders’ Institution for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life with 12 years concurrent for wounding with intent. Detective Constable Iain Bailey, of the Trident Gang Crime Command, said: ‘These violent offenders, who were involved in a gang and drug dispute, resorted to firearms to settle their arguments. Kayode Oshin then uploaded a rap video onto YouTube boasting about trying to murder the rival with a 'spray and pray' machine gun . Junior Tahir-Akinyele also appeared on the video, which was uploaded on to the internet . 'They were then brazen enough to brag about their offending on the internet. ‘Thanks to the work of the Trident Gang Crime Command, with the assistance of Hounslow officers, we were able to gather the necessary evidence to bring about this conviction and prevent further offences.’","Kayode Oshin, 21, attempted to assassinate Yassin Zouaiou with a Mac 10 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A mother fighting cancer cannot hug her three children because her treatment has made her radioactive. Emma Day, 27, has taken  high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer. This meant she had to be placed in isolation at the hospital, with staff banned from going within three metres of her for five days. For three weeks she had to stay at least two metres from the children meaning she had to watch from a distance while her husband, Jon, played with them . However, she says that life has been . even more frustrating since she was allowed home. She must avoid her . six-year-old daughter and one-year-old twins for three more weeks, as . bodily contact could cause them lasting damage. ‘It is very hard because the twins are too young to understand,’ said Mrs Day. ‘My oldest daughter saw a cancer . psychologist who explained to her that my treatment was necessary, and . she understands why, because it’ll make me better. Support: Husband John Day and children at their home in Cheltenham in Gloucestershire . Mrs Day had to take high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer. This was the second time she had fought cancer as she suffered from leukaemia as a child . 'I breast-fed my twins for about five . months after they were born, and I’m not used to being away from them. It’s very hard. I’m missing them so much. ‘I thought it was hard in hospital, . but it is so much harder now because I can see them but I know I cannot . touch them or cuddle them or go near them. ‘I can’t cuddle anybody at the moment, and it’s heartbreaking. ‘I have to navigate around the house while keeping a safe distance from my children. ‘We are a very close family and three . weeks seems like such a long time, but it will be worth it.’ It is Mrs . Day’s second battle with cancer. She overcame leukaemia as a child. Mrs Day (pictured with her husband, Jon, and their eldest daughter on the couple's wedding day) was diagnosed with thyroid cancer after finding a lump in her throat . Fighter: This is the second time that Emma pictured with her husband and daughter on her wedding day has battled cancer, after she was diagnosed with leukaemia as a child . She had now been given the all-clear and can cuddle her children again - she will have another scan in six months time to ensure that the cancer has not returned . Tough: Emma Day must stay at least a metre away from her three children for the next three weeks . She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in January after seeing a doctor for a lump in her throat. She initially thought she had a . swollen gland, but doctors at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital soon . realised the growth was cancerous after an operation to remove half of . the lump. For her particular type of cancer, patients receive radioactive iodine treatment – a form of internal radiotherapy. The treatment involves a radioactive . form of the element called iodine 131, administered as a drink or . capsule, which circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream. Thyroid cancer cells pick up the . iodine wherever they are in the body, and the radiation kills them. Other cells are left unaffected, because only thyroid cells take up the . iodine. She says that being home with her family in Cheltenham - but unable to go near them - is in some ways worse than when she was on her own in hospital . While she was in an isolation unit in Cheltenham General Hospital, staff were not allowed to go within three metres of her for five days . Emma's husband John has now taken a month off work to care for their three children. She said: 'I can't cuddle anybody at the moment, and it's heartbreaking. I have to navigate around the house while keeping a safe distance from my children' The treatment rendered Mrs Day so radioactive that anything she touched in hospital has been thrown away. While the powerful treatment is also dangerous to the patient, the risk from the cancer itself is judged to be greater. The mother of three, from Cheltenham, . said the thought of holding her children in her arms again has given her . the courage to go on. She said that, during her time in . hospital isolation, she received support from dozens of people who . followed her online blog and kept in touch with her via phone. ‘I have had so much support – it’s . amazing,’ she said. ‘Now I just can’t wait to get back to normal and hug . and kiss my children again.’ Radioactive iodine treatment is a type . of internal radiotherapy. The treatment uses a radioactive form of . iodine called iodine 131 (I-131). The radioactive iodine circulates . throughout the body in the bloodstream. Radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy, administered as a capsule or drink . Thyroid cancer cells pick up . the iodine wherever they are in the body. The radiation in the iodine . then kills the cancer cells. Radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment. It doesn't affect other body cells, because only thyroid cells take up the iodine. The treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule. Patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again. The treatment causes the patient to be slightly . radioactive for a few days, so time spent with staff and visitors . is minimal. Sweat and urine also become radioactive, so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once. Pregnant women and . young children will not be allowed to visit. Even 12 weeks after treatment, patients who have had radiactive idodine therapy may set off radiation alarms at airports.","Mother-of-three Emma Day, 27, from Cheltenham, is battling thyroid cancer .

"By . Bianca London . From Instagram to Snapchat, photo sharing apps have taken the digital world by storm. Today everyone can be a photographer as we snap, edit and share our best views with the world. And now, one photographer is taking the photo sharing concept one step further with new site PhotoYOLO designed to deliver photographs from complete strangers to your inbox. Sharing: A new site called PhotoYOLO sends subscribers a photo of a stranger from anywhere in the world every single day . The concept behind the site is simple: . sign up using your email address and every day a random photo will be delivered . to your inbox from somebody that you don't know. The service, set up by travel and lifestyle . photographer, Kaitlyn Reed, is inspired by The Listserve, . a lottery where the winner gets the opportunity to write something and . share it with the world. PhotoYOLO describes itself as: 'One photo a . day in your inbox, from a friend you just haven't met yet.' One day you could receive a photo of a cute kitten from someone in Australia, and the next day you could open your inbox to a snap of the beautiful beaches of Thailand. And one day you could be chosen to send your photo to every single subscriber. Describing her new brainchild, Kaitlyn writes: 'A subscriber is chosen each day to share one photo they've taken with the world. What will you share? Brainchild: Set up by travel and lifestyle photographer, Kaitlyn Reed, the site describes itself as: 'One photo a day in your inbox, from a friend you just haven't met yet' 'I believe that photos can tell stories too, here's your chance to tell yours.' Speaking to MailOnline, Kaitlyn said: 'I launched the project less than a month ago. It started as a fun little project amongst friends, but the subscription list kept growing! 'Being a photographer, I often wished there was something like daily lotto, but for photos. I googled and couldn't find anything out there, so I made it! 'In each PhotoYOLO a website link of the winner's choosing is attached to their photo. Often times it's their blog, projects, but sometimes it's charities.' And the Twittersphere seems to be enjoying the new photo sharing concept. One user wrote: 'So far I'm loving this > ""One photo a day in your inbox, from a friend you just haven't met yet.' Another added: '@gtmcknight AWESOME Photoyolo today!! Thank you! (Costa Rica is awesome, too!).' What will you receive today? One day you could receive a cute animal, and the next a lovely scenic snap from anywhere in the world . While concerns may be raised that the site could go the same way as photo sharing app Snapchat, which saw users sending explicit photos to one another, user Laura Beck says this won't be the case. She writes on Jezebel: 'Well, it could be creepy, but it's well-curated so you're not receiving a photo of a different penis every day. 'Or any penises ever. Not that penises can't be beautiful and artistic. The point is — this is about cool photography, not unclothed penises.' Kaitlyn added: 'I'm putting my trust into this little community I'm creating, so I believe everything has been, and will be tasteful. 'Of course, if it turns into a ChatRoulette, monitoring might have to be enforced…. because nobody wants that in their inbox at work!' Tweet fans: The Twittersphere seems to be enjoying the new photo sharing concept, which could see users receiving all sorts of amazing photography from across the globe on a daily basis . Photo sharing is big business. Snapchat, which launched in late 2011 and lets user send snaps to others for less than ten seconds, has already raised around £40 million in venture capital funding. Over 200 million pictures are shared on the service daily and the company is valued at around £534 million. Instagram, a photo editing and sharing app announced in February that they had 100 million active users, only two and a half years after first launching.","Travel photographer has launched PhotoYOLO site inspired by The Listserve .

But it wasn't until the bullets started flying and homemade bombs exploded outside the apartment where they were staying in the capital of the eastern European country that the Alabama couple discovered just how stressful it could be. Last week, the Bundys, of Montgomery, stayed in an apartment in Kiev a half-mile from Independence Square, the center of violent protests. Scroll Down for Video . Mom and kids in a war zone: Lisa Bundy (right) with her new adopted children (top left across) Nastia, 16, Karina, 14, Max, 11 and 9-year-old was half-a-mile from the protests . New family: David and Lisa Bundy with their three youngest siblings, Karina, 14, Max, 11 and 9-year-old - who are now happily back in Montgomery, Alabama . They listened to gunfire and explosions, and the children played games and tried to sleep as bullets whizzed by their balcony. 'It was a constant boom, boom, boom,' said David Bundy in an interview at the couple's Montgomery home Monday, a day after he returned with three of the children. 'It was three or four explosions every 10 seconds.' The couple had planned to return home together after the last of the four adoptions, that of 16-year-old Nastia, was finalized, but decided it would be best if David Bundy headed home early with the others to escape the violence. He arrived in Montgomery on Sunday night with 14-year-old Karina; 11-year-old Max; and 9-year-old Alla. Lisa Bundy remained behind in Kiev with Nastia. 'The children became afraid of what was going on, and then it became more of a safety issue,' David Bundy said. Home: Max Bundy tries out his new bed and new home in Montgomery, Alabama on Sunday . Bundy, a 47-year-old freelance photographer, and Lisa Bundy, 40, an emergency room physician, began looking at adoption after not having any children of their own. Escape from Ukraine: David Bundy arrives home to Montgomery, Alabama, with three of their newly adopted four children, Max (from left), Alla and Karina. Bundy's wife, Lisa remained in Ukraine until the adoption of their daughter Nastia could be finalized . They first looked at domestic adoptions, but got dismayed by the paperwork and long wait. In the summer of 2013, the couple volunteered with Bridges of Faith, a program that brings orphans from Ukraine to Alabama for a month of cultural enrichment. Through the program, they met Nastia and made plans to adopt her. Later, they met Karina and her siblings and decided their home could handle four children. 'Something felt very right about them being with us,' Bundy said. Bundy said adopting from Ukraine costs about the same as a domestic adoption, but can be challenging as it requires working with lawyers and courts outside of the U.S. The couple arrived in Kiev on Nov. 22 and rented an apartment near Independence Square because it is where restaurants, shops and government agencies are located. Bundy said the protests in the square began about a week before they arrived, but they didn't think anything about them because they were peaceful. 'We had to deal with protesters constantly. It was part of our daily routine,' Bundy said. Gradually, however, the protests turned . into violent clashes with police and the police disappeared from Bundy's . neighborhood. 'The protesters themselves became our police department,' he said.

Bedtime stories with mom and dad: David Bundy with Alla (left) while Lisa plays a game on her iPad with her daughter . Frightening: Karina, 14, Max, 11 and 9-year-old Alla were staying only half-a-mile from the protests as the Ukraine battles to avoid civil war . Despite the violence, government agencies and courts stayed open, and the Bundys were able to complete three of the adoptions. Nastia's was held up by a paperwork problems and a judge's illness, David Bundy said. He recalled a night last week when the family tried to sleep despite repeated explosions. Two of the younger children crawled in bed with Nastia. 'It was Nastia's first opportunity to be a big sister,' he said. David Bundy, who has worked as a photographer for newspapers in Mississippi and Alabama and done freelance work for The Associated Press, ventured out occasionally to take pictures of the violence. On Friday, the whole family went to Independence Square to see the burned buildings and torched cars. They inadvertently walked into the memorial service for a slain protester. Silly: Karina, 14, and Max, 11, play up for the camera in the bathroom in Kiev before they landed in Montgomery on Sunday . 'I wanted to have something sort of as a historical record for our family,' he said. 'It is not just Ukrainian history. It's our family's history.' David Bundy and the three children celebrated their arrival in the United States on Sunday with a pepperoni pizza. Meanwhile, Lisa Bundy and Nastia moved to a safer area on the outskirts of Kiev to wait for her adoption to become final, hopefully on March 3. With an interim government under construction, Bundy worries about delays. He notes the couple would not have been able to adopt Nastia if they had waited until after her 16th birthday. 'We are Nastia's last hope,' he said. Assuming the adoption finishes on time, Lisa Bundy and Nastia will fly home for a delayed Christmas celebration. David Bundy and the other children put up the Christmas tree Monday morning. By that afternoon, Max had already found the closet where their presents were hidden. 'It didn't take 24 hours,' Bundy said. Before heading to Ukraine, the Bundys remodeled their home to accommodate four children and made plans for helping the children learn English and start their American educations. But they still have one little problem to address: They both drive MINI Coopers. 'I love my MINI Cooper. I'm trying to see if there is a way to put a side car on one,' the new dad said.","David and Lisa Bundy were caught up in the chaotic violence in Kiev, Ukraine last week as they prepared to leave with their four adopted children .

"By . Jason Groves . Angela Merkel threw a lifeline to David Cameron last night in his battle to prevent another arch-federalist seizing power at the European Commission. The German Chancellor paid lip service to supporting former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who is her party’s official candidate for the post of commission president. But she also hit out at critics of Mr Cameron in both Berlin and Brussels, saying it was ‘unacceptable’ to ignore the UK’s concerns about Mr Juncker. David Cameron, left, has been thrown a lifeline by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, right, after she told critics of the PM in Berlin and Brussels that it was 'unacceptable' to ignore the UK's concerns about the EU presidency . Her intervention came as speculation mounted that French IMF chief Christine Legarde could yet emerge as a compromise candidate for the job. Mr Cameron has privately branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who ‘cannot solve the problems of the next five years’, and has spent the past fortnight leading frantic diplomatic efforts to block Mr Juncker’s coronation. He is said to have warned Mrs Merkel privately that the UK could quit the EU if Mr Juncker is appointed. 'More confident than ever': Mr Cameron has spent the past fortnight leading frantic diplomatic efforts to block Jean-Claude Juncker's appointment . Mr Juncker, a technocrat who has . powerful allies across the EU, yesterday boasted that he was ‘more . confident than ever that I will be the next Commission president’. But, in a blow to his claim to be the . people’s choice for the job, a major survey found that just eight per . cent of European voters know who he is. Mr Cameron’s all-out bid to block Mr Juncker has sparked anger in both Brussels and Berlin. Germany’s leading magazine Spiegel yesterday launched an astonishing attack on Britain over the Juncker row, saying the UK had ‘for years blackmailed and made a fool of the EU.’ In an extraordinary editorial the magazine said Britain was insular and sullen – and said its opposition to Mr Juncker was ‘undemocratic’, as his centre-right grouping in the European Parliament emerged as the biggest group in last month’ s elections. ‘Britain must choose now if it will stay in Europe,’ it said. ‘The United Kingdom must finally make a choice - it can play by the rules or it can leave the European Union.’ Mrs Merkel hit back yesterday with a speech to the German parliament in which she insisted she would not allow Britain to be isolated on the issue. She told German MPs it was ‘grossly negligent, actually unacceptable, how easily some talk about it not mattering whether Great Britain agrees or not, even whether Great Britain remains a member of the European Union or not. This is anything but irrelevant, unimportant or trivial.’ She said good decisions in Brussels are rarely rushed and added ‘we need time, we have it and so I am using it.’ David Cameron will today act as a Cold War messenger for the United States when he holds face-to-face talks with Vladimir Putin on the crisis in Ukraine. The Prime Minister will deliver a toughly-worded message from Barack Obama, who has refused to meet Mr Putin when world leaders gather in Normandy to commemorate D-Day. Mr Cameron will hold talks with President Obama today following the G7 summit in Brussels, before travelling to France where he will relay the American message directly to President Putin. Mr Obama yesterday accused the Russian leader of reverting to the ‘dark tactics of the 20th century’ in Ukraine. In a blunt warning to President Putin, he added: ‘The days of empires and spheres of influence are over.’ Speaking in Brussels last night, Mr Cameron said Moscow would face ‘continuing isolation’ until it stops trying to destabilise Ukraine. Mrs Merkel is under massive pressure . at home to support Mr Juncker’s bid to replace outgoing Commission chief . Jose-Manuel Barroso. Yesterday she insisted she was ‘trying to ensure that the lead candidate of the European People's Party, Jean-Claude Juncker, receives the qualified majority he needs to become the next president of the European Commission. The entire German government is pushing for this.’ But her comments suggest she does not believe Mr Juncker can command a majority among European leaders. Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Hungary are among a number of EU states said to share Mr Cameron’s concerns about the Luxembourger. Mrs Merkel is reported to have sounded out French President Francois Hollande about nominating Miss Legarde for the Commission job. But French sources suggested Mr Hollande was keen to keep her in place at the IMF. They also pointed out that she is from the opposite political tradition to the socialist French president. Miss Legarde, who will travel to London on IMF business tomorrow, would be a popular candidate in both the UK and Germany. But she is said to harbour ambitions of standing for the French presidency which would be incompatible with taking the top job in Brussels.","German Chancellor hits out at Cameron's critics in Berlin and Brussels .

Having breezed through qualification from one of the World Cup's toughest groups with a game to spare, Louis van Gaal's squad were more than entitled to enjoy a day off in the sun ahead of their last-16 game against Mexico. Robin van Persie and co have arguably been the tournament's most impressive team: thrashing world champions Spain 5-1, beating Australia 3-2 and finally seeing off World Cup surprise package Chile 2-0 to set themselves up for a favourable first knockout round draw. And with incoming Manchester United manager Van Gaal already appearing to be adopting a laid back approach to the time off he gives his players in Brazil, United fans will be hoping that the same happy atmosphere can be replicated when Van Persie returns to Old Trafford with the new manager. Watchful eye: Van Persie plays with his phone while Van Gaal, in the foreground, watches from a distance .

Van Persie appeared to be unhappy under David Moyes - with Rio Ferdinand labelling his transformation under last season's manager going from: 'the star man, our go-to guy, the top scorer, to being almost like a sideshow.' But with Van Gaal replaced Moyes in the Old Trafford hotseat, the Dutch striker, who will return to the side after suspension, should be seen smiling a lot more next season.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . President Barack Obama can't play Angry Birds on his smartphone. No Words With Friends, no Candy Crush, and no Texas Hold'em. And he can blame the NSA. A retired National Security Agency technical director said Thursday that the government spy shop tasked him with custom-fitting a Blackberry for the president. That meant stripping away every built-in feature that a hacker might exploit. 'You try to get rid of any functionality that's not really required,' Richard George told CNN Money. 'Every piece of functionality is an opportunity for the adversary.' So that means the leader of the free world isn't free to while away his hours crushing pigs with catapulting birds, or trying to come up with a 70-point play on a triple-word-score box. Only calls 10 numbers: Obama's Blackberry is stripped down to the bare-bones essentials, and can't ring up any phone that doesn't share his high-level encryption . No fun of any kind: The president's smartphone has no games that a hacker could use as a back-door into his secure communications . Tech-savvy: Obama happily uses an iPad, a MacBook Air and whatever other secure devices his team puts at his fingertips . When Obama came into office, George said, he wanted a way to keep in touch with his closest advisers. And the request presented several frightening problems. 'It just really bothered a lot of people: Nobody wanted to put anything out there that wasn't completely secure,' George explained. The president had a Blackberry during his Senate career and his presidential campaign. Ultimately the NSA's tech experts chose a model that they could customize most easily to leave him with the barest of bare-bones features. What was left when the digital dust settled is a state secret, and the NSA won't even say whether Obama can take pictures or send emails or text messages. But the phone is limited to calling only about 10 numbers, since they belong to aides – and, presumably, family members – whose phones use the same type of encryption. The Wall Street Journal reported this year that the White House Communications Agency was considering a switch to Android, and was testing LG and Samsung phones. Blackberry insisted at the time, however, that 'the U.S. government continues to choose BlackBerry for its unmatched security and cost effectiveness.' 'Other vendors such as Samsung and LG still have a long way to go to catch up to meet the government’s stringent requirements and certifications,' the company said in a March statement. Richard ""Dickie"" George, formerly the technical director of NSA's Information Assurance Directorate, told CNN Money that he was in charge of retrofitting Obama's phone so it wouldn't present a national security risk . The NSA's George said President George W. Bush (L) may have had access to a mobile phone, but it would have been a giant 'brick' like the mock-worthy device sported by Zack Morris on 'Saved by the Bell' (R) Parting is such sweet sorrow: Obama, pictured the day he was sworn in as president in 2009, had to get ri of the smartphone that got him through the presidential campaign . The president reportedly uses an iPad for reading and an encrypted MacBook Air for his daily work. George told CNN that he wasn't sure if presidents before Obama used smartphones, but he hinted that any presidential mobile phones before 2008 were 'like a brick.' If George W. Bush had one, he said, 'I'm betting he didn't know it was five pounds because I'm betting he didn't carry it.' CNN quipped that in the Clinton and Bush years, an aide would have carried it because it 'looked like the one Zack Morris used on the 1990s sitcom, ""Saved by The Bell"".'","The president has to use personal digital devices that the NSA has retrofitted with world-class encryption .
Blackberry leads the field in robust security, but the White House is testing Android devices .
Obama's phone can only call about 10 numbers – phones that can match his for encryption and data protection .

"By . Emily Allen . Updated: . 02:23 EST, 9 December 2011 . A father woke his two children and slit their throats while they desperately tried to fight him off before calling his ex-wife to say: 'I have killed your children'. Jean Francis Say, 62, murdered his . eight-year-old daughter Regina and son Rolls, 10, to 'spite' his estranged wife Adjoua, 44, after he was told he was to be evicted from their three-bedroom flat. Adjoua, who is . known as Antoinette, had moved out with the children six months . previously and Say was no longer entitled to the flat they once shared in Southwark, south east London. Today at the Old Bailey Say, originally from the Ivory Coast, pleaded guilty to the double murders through an interpreter. He is due to be sentenced on Monday afternoon. Victims: Jean Francis Say, 62, murdered his . eight-year-old daughter Regina, left, and son Rolls, 10, right, in February to 'spite' his estranged wife Adjoua . The children, who he had custody of at the time, were playing computer . games before Say knifed them sometime between Saturday, February 12 and the early hours of the following day. He then phoned Adjoua accusing her . of 'defaming him on Facebook' saying 'I have killed your children. I . have killed your children. I have called the police and am waiting for . them.' He called 999 and then redialled her number and told . her: 'Come and get the bodies.' Officers found the retired concierge and part-time football steward . sitting beside the bodies of his children, who had been dead for . several hours. Neighbours claimed officers had been called to the flat, (the block is pictured) on at least one previous occasion after reports of a row between Say and his wife . On being led out of the flat Say pointed to some documents and said: 'This paper is . evidence of why I did it.' The papers related to his eviction. Prosecutor Ed Brown QC in his opening . notes not read to the court said: 'In the early morning of Sunday, . February 13, this defendant killed his own children. 'He took their lives as they lay where they slept. They were quite defenceless. 'It is likely that each of the children . tried to fend off the attack upon them by their father before they were . each quickly overwhelmed and killed by him. 'The dreadful fact is that the defendant took a knife and cut the throat of each child as they lay where they had been sleeping. The evidence suggests that the defendant carried out the killing to spite his estranged wife, the mother of his children.' He said the children had been killed . some time before he made the calls to Adjoua, and Rolls had suffered forceful blows . to the head while he was still alive in addition to knife wounds to his . neck. Crime scene: On being led out of the flat Say pointed to some documents and said: 'This paper is evidence of why I did it.' The papers related to his eviction . Mr Brown said these were enough to cause injuries to his brain. He added: 'There are in addition what . are known as defence wounds that show that Rolls and separately Regina . most likely had struggled against the knife during the defendant’s . attack upon them.' Mr Brown said the killings were a culmination of longstanding marital difficulties born from the violent, jealous and . possessive behaviour of the defendant and from the consequences that . the departure of his wife and children from the home was likely to have . on his own situation. In addition, the prosecutor said . there was a history of domestic violence and Adjoua had moved out some . time before eviction proceedings were started. However, there had not been any child safety concerns, he added. Neighbours claimed officers had been . called to the flat on at least one previous occasion after reports of a . violent row between ‘controlling’ Say and his wife. The couple, both from West Africa, . married in February 1998 in Southwark. But his wife moved to Holloway in . North London with the children six months ago after their marriage . failed.","Jean Francis Say murdered Regina, eight, and Rolls, 10 to 'spite' his estranged wife .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The American flag stolen from the family of a firefighter killed on September 11 has been returned with a note that says: 'I am so sorry. I had no idea.' Melissa Brengel, the sister of Jonathan Ielpi, who died at the World Trade Center, said she found the flag outside her Long Island home when she awoke on Friday morning. It reappeared as mysteriously as it disappeared during the night four days earlier. 'The flag means so much to me and my family and we are so happy and grateful that it was returned and we are able to display it again, although this time it will be put in a proper case and displayed in the house,' Brengel posted on her Facebook page. This American flag, which was given to the family of a firefighter who died on September 11, 2001, was returned on late Thursday or early Friday, four days after it was stolen . 'I don't know who took it or why. I guess they had their reasons. I am just glad that their conscious got the best of them and they did the right thing by returning it,' she added. Brengel said she rarely put the flag up outside the house, only at 'certain times of the year just to remember.' She says the September 11th Families Association gave her the flag after it flew over the World Trade Center ruins. Ielpi, who was 29, phoned his father Lee on the day of the attack to tell him he was en route to the site. He did not make it out of the south tower. Brengel said she rarely put the flag out to hang, only for special occasions at certain times of the year to remember . His father is also a firefighter and is a co-founder of Tribute WTC, which pays homage to the victims of the attack. It is not the first time the insensitive handling of her brother's passing and his memory has caused heartache. Last year Brengel was outraged after the cast member of a reality TV show was depicted in a photo shoot acting flippantly around her brother's memorial. She was watching the Bravo reality TV show ‘Princesses: Long Island’ when she saw one of the cast members began to act imprudently around the statue of the firefighter who was her brother. Firefighter Jonathan Ielpi was 29 when he died in the south tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 . Melissa Brengel is Ielpi's sister. She was given the flag after it flew over the ruins of the World Trade Center . She later said she felt her blood boil: 'It may not be against the law to do it, but it is the most disrespectful and disgusting that I think you can do,' she said. She now hopes the flag thief will hear of its significance, have a change of heart and return it.","Melissa Brengel, sister of a firefighter who died in the south tower, said she found the flag when she awoke on July 4 with a note apologizing for nicking it .

"By . Tom Mctague . and Jason Groves . A Labour MP today likened the American drug giant Pfizer to a 'rapist' for trying to buy its British rival AstraZeneca. Austin Mitchell said David Cameron was refusing to block Pfizer's £63billion bid because he was scared of offending the US. Writing on Twitter, he said: 'Cameron dare not stop Pfizer because he dare not offend the US in any way. Roll up rapists.' Labour MP Austin Mitchell sparked fury after likening US drug giant Pfizer to a 'rapist'. It is not the first time he has caused controversy on Twitter - he previously joked that a female Tory MP should obey her husband . Pfizer chief Ian Read was swamped after leaving the House of Commons yesterday. He was grilled by MPs over his company's proposed takeover of AstraZeneca . Tory Women's Minister Nicky Morgan attacked Mr Mitchell on Twitter for his 'offensive' remark and called on him to 'withdraw your tweet now'. She wrote to the Labour leader to say the 'comments are totally unacceptable'. Her letter read: 'Austin Mitchell must withdraw what he has written immediately and issue a full, unreserved apology. 'As the Leader of the Labour Party I look forward to hearing what action you intend to take in response to this totally unacceptable behaviour.' Outspoken backbencher Nadine Dorries joined a host of MPs in attacking Mr Mitchell's tweet . The new Women's Minister Nicky Morgan was first to attack the Labour MP for his outburst. She said it was time for Labour leader Ed Miliband to suspend him from the party . Tory MPs Nicky Morgan and Nadine Dorries were joined by Government whip Claire Perry in attacking Mr Mitchell's 'rapists' remark . But an unrepentant Mr Mitchell defended his remarks. He said critics were ‘making a mountain out of a molehill’. He confirmed that he had apologised to Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton over his choice of words, but said he stood by the sentiment of his original tweet. He added: ‘I have corrected what I said – I should have referred to rapaciousness, but it’s difficult to express what I feel Pfizer will do to AstraZeneca in 140 characters. ‘I do not feel I merit this pile of abuse I am getting for using a word that is regularly used in other contexts – lots of very respectable, well-to-do people regularly talk about the rape of the countryside. I was doing no different. People are making a mountain out of a molehill.’ His remarks came after he tweeted: 'Naughty me. 'Substute (sic) rapaciousness before any more Physer (sic) defenders weigh in.' A Labour spokesman confirmed Mr Mitchell had apologised to Labour chief whip Rosie Winterton. 'The . chief whip has made clear to Austin Mitchell this tweet was . unacceptable. He has now apologised for what was an obvious error of . judgment.' The veteran Labour MP, who is standing down at the next election, appeared less than wholly repentant in a second tweet posted after his 'rapists' outburst . It is not the first time Mr Mitchell . has sparked anger on Twitter. In 2012 he became embroiled in a sexism . storm after telling the former Tory MP Louise Mensch to obey her . husband. Mr Mitchell said Mrs Mensch had been caught lying about why she quit Parliament after her husband claimed she resigned to avoid being 'killed' at the next election. She had insisted she only resigned to be with her rock star manager husband Peter Mensch, who lives in the US. But Mr Mitchell, who changed his name to Austin Haddock in 2002 to raise awareness of Britain's fishing industry, tweeted: 'Shut up Menschkin. A good wife doesn’t disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesn’t lie about why she quit politics.' David Cameron, speaking here during Prime Minister's Questions in Commons today, was challenged over his refusal to block Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca . He later revealed that he had been told to withdraw the message by his wife and his three daughters. Mr Mitchell's latest Twitter outburst came after a fiery Prime Minister's Questions dominated by the Pfizer takeover bid. Mr Miliband challenged Mr Cameron's 'failure' to protect British jobs and urged him to block it if it was not good for Britain. He said the Prime Minister could offer no reassurances for British jobs, science or investment in the wake of a takeover. But Mr Cameron said, in the final Prime Minister's Questions clash before prorogation, that his Government was getting 'stuck in' to get the best deal for Britain rather than standing on the sidelines opposing a deal outright. Labour party leader Ed Miliband challenged David Cameron to apply a public interest test to the Pfizer bid and dismissed the proposed job guarantees offered to the Prime Minister as 'worthless' Mr Cameron said 'the right thing to do is to get stuck in to seek the best possible guarantees on British jobs, on British investment, and British science'. The PM also accused Mr Miliband of 'putting party politics ahead of the national interest'. He said: 'We discussed this last week and one of the most important things we have learned since last week is you were asked for a meeting with Pfizer - but you said you were too busy political campaigning.' Mr Miliband hit back - claiming he was 'not going to take any lectures' from the Prime Minister. He accused Mr Cameron of 'negotiating with Pfizer over the heads of the board of AstraZeneca'. He added: 'Pfizer doesn't need a PR man, they have the Prime Minister.' Mr Cameron insisted he was not biased in favour of the Pfizer bid. He said he was simply 'getting stuck in' to win guarantees over British jobs. He said: 'I am clear what the British interest is - it is British jobs, British science, British R&D, and we will do everything we can to make those guarantees we have received, and you would have got nothing, as firm as possible.' Mr Miliband warned that the PM's assurances were 'useless'. He demanded to know if he had challenged Pfizer's boss Ian Read over his revelation to MPs that 'there will be job cuts somewhere'. The Labour leader asked Mr Cameron: 'Have you got an assurance these job cuts won't take place in the UK?' Mr Cameron replied: 'We have assurances on the percentage of R&D that will happen here, on investment in Cambridge, on investment in Macclesfield. If you are arguing, ""do we want further assurances?"", yes we do. 'Do we want to make sure those jobs stay here? Yes we do. Do we want more investment in British universities and British science? Yes we do. 'The only difference between us is how do you get those things. I say get stuck in, negotiate hard, fight for Britain. You say stand up, play politics and put that before the national interest.' The exchange came after the Tory Science Minister David Willetts this morning suggested that the Government would like Pfizer to go further in its guarantees to protect British jobs. Asked whether Pfizer's five-year commitment to protect research jobs was enough, Mr Willetts told MP on the Commons Science Select Committtee: 'I would like to see a longer period than that.'","Austin Mitchell accuses Prime Minister of bowing to American interests .

"By . Jason Groves . Barack Obama last night made a plea for Scotland to remain in the UK. In his first intervention in the independence debate, Mr Obama said the US wanted Britain to remain ‘strong, robust, united and effective’. His comments delighted Downing Street insiders, who dubbed the US president ‘Nobama’. Barack Obama jumped into British politics today by calling for a 'No' vote in the independence referendum. He also called for Britain to stay in the EU . While Mr Cameron will openly welcome the President's intervention in the Scottish and EU debates, there is likely to be concern in Downing Street that it will reinforce the impression that the political class are out of touch with ordinary Brits . The pair held bilateral security talks on the fringes of the G7 meeting of world leaders in Brussels today. But in a press conference afterwards, Mr Obama upsetting Scottish nationalists and Tory eurosceptics with his praise for the UK and EU . The PM said his renegotiation of Britain's relationship with Brussels was designed to keep the country in the EU . Mr Obama's - speaking at a joint press conference during the G7 Summit at the European Council in Brussels today - risked diplomatic anger over his insistence that Britain should stay in the EU . The US President also admitted that he was likely to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at tomorrow's D-Day ceremonies . Standing with David Cameron at a G7 . press conference in Brussels, President Obama made it clear that . Washington would prefer to see Scots vote No in September, rather than . face the uncertainty involved in the break-up of one of its closest . allies. He said the UK’s . future was ‘up to the people of Great Britain’ but added: ‘From the . outside, at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well. ‘And, . you know, we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of . the closest allies that we will ever have remains a strong, robust, . united and effective partner. But ultimately these are decisions that . are going to be made by the folks there.’ Mr . Cameron nodded but made no comment as Mr Obama spoke. But a Downing . Street source welcomed the American leader’s remarks, adding: ‘We . certainly agree the UK has been strong, robust, united and effective.’ President Obama and Mr Cameron held a bilateral meeting during the G7 Summit at the European Council today. They were joined by US National Security Adviser Susan Rice (front left) and the UK's Kim Darroch (front right) Mr Cameron met Russian President Vladimir Putin at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris before they travelled to France ahead of the 70th anniversary D-Day commemorations . The Prime Minister's meeting with Mr Putin came after the G7 leaders met in Brussels after refusing to attend a planned conference in Russia . Russia's leader did not appear concerned that he had been rebuked by Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama for his annexation of Crimea . The . intervention from the US president electrified the No campaign in . Scotland. Cross-party group Better Together mocked up a famous poster of . Mr Obama with the word ‘Hope’ replaced by ‘Nope’. Shadow . foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: ‘As a global statesman, . President Obama understands that interdependence is a defining feature . of our modern world and  that building bridges, not putting  up new . barriers, is the challenge  of our generation.’ Scottish . Conservative leader Ruth Davidson described the president’s . intervention as the ‘most internationally significant to date’. ‘He . clearly recognises the strong and effective partnership his country has . with the UK and our many shared achievements through the years,’ she . said. ‘Scotland walks taller, shouts louder and stands stronger on the . world stage because we are part of the United Kingdom.’ Willie . Rennie, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, said the US president had . made a ‘significant contribution to our discussion about our future’. Mr Cameron held private talks after a G7 session dedicated to the global economy and the Ukraine crisis in Brussels today . President . Obama’s words angered some nationalists, but Scottish National Party . leader Alex Salmond, who has never met Mr Obama, last night tried to . play down their significance. Recycling . the US leader’s election campaign slogan, Mr Salmond told BBC Radio . Scotland: ‘So, in summary, I suppose my message to President Obama is . “yes we can” … An independent Scotland will mean that America has two . great friends and allies here rather than one.’ The . strength of President Obama’s comments took Downing Street by surprise . as it is highly unusual for the US leader to intervene in the domestic . affairs of a close ally. Former Labour Foreign Office minister Lord . Malloch-Brown said: ‘Foreign, unsolicited advice is only going to anger . Scots. I’m surprised that he has stepped in.’ ■ Barack . Obama said yesterday he ‘makes no apologies’ for the controversial . release of US Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl in a Taliban prisoner swap. He . said the soldier’s health was deteriorating and added: ‘We were deeply . concerned about it. We saw an opportunity and we seized it.’ By TAMARA COHEN . Scots could treat themselves to fish and chips every day for ten weeks or drink more than 600 cappuccinos a year if they vote ‘no’ to independence, Westminster civil servants claimed yesterday. The items were among a string of incentives to stay in the Union compiled after the Treasury estimated Scots would be £1,400-a-year better off as part of the UK. But nationalists branded the Cabinet Office’s list a ‘patronising gimmick’. Published with pictures of Lego characters on the Scotland Office website, other suggestions included ‘280 hot dogs’ at the Edinburgh Festival, a holiday abroad for two with ‘cash left over for sun cream’ and ‘hugs to celebrate being in the UK’. Senior Tories were privately dismayed by the gaffe, which is a far cry from David Cameron’s emotional appeal to Scots earlier this year that they would lose ‘something very powerful and precious’ if they leave the UK in the independence referendum on September 18. The new row over the tone of the No campaign comes amid criticism that the cross-party Better Together group, headed by former chancellor Alistair Darling, has been too negative. Attempts to highlight the downsides of ending the 300-year Union seem to have backfired. The Yes campaign, which was at 29 per cent in polls last autumn, has crept up to 40 per cent with just over three months to go before the referendum. Twitter users slammed the list of items as ‘absurd’ and said ministers were treating Scottish people ‘like imbeciles’. A spokesman for First Minister Alex Salmond said: ‘This is a new low from the Treasury who should apologise to people across Scotland for this patronising gimmick … they should also say sorry for being caught red-handed trying to cook the books on an independent Scotland’s finances.’ SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie added: ‘This is the kind of patronising attitude to Scotland we have come to expect from the Tory Treasury … The real figures are that £300billion of North Sea tax revenues have flowed from Scotland to the Treasury over the last 40 years … But all we get in return from Westminster is bogus figures and silly nonsense.’","US President says the UK has 'worked pretty well' and should stay together .

"By . Katy Winter . The High Street ‘Knicker Queen’ she was supposed to transform M&S’s lingerie from frumpy mummy-pants into sexy, sleek, and elegant bestsellers. However Janie Schaffer didn't have time to perform the underwear magic she had previously worked for super brand Victoria's Secret as she resigned a mere 3 months into her post as director of lingerie and beauty for the firm in a move that has shocked the fashion world. The 51-year-old designer is now suing Marks and Spencer for an undisclosed figure, said to be ‘well in excess’ in £1 million. The 'knicker queen' Janie Schaffer has worked at some of the  top lingerie brands in the world . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley modelling Marks and Spencer's underwear: Janie believed she would have full artistic control over the lingerie . Ms Schaffer is seeking damages for Victoria's Secret shares she claims she lost out on because M&S were so keen for to start at the soonest possible opportunity. She is also suing for the remainder of her years’ salary, having started the role in January 2013 and quit in April. Shaffer was hired by M&S shortly before the company revealed its pre-tax profits had slumped by £31.5 million the previous year. At the time the company boasted of her ‘stellar retail pedigree’ and saying she ‘completed’ the re-vamped clothing team. And chief executive Marc Bolland’s excitement and confidence seemed well founded. Janie headed up brand Knickerbox in the Eighties and Nineties, before moving to Victoria’s Secret where for five years she created sexually but classy underwear. She and Stephen Schaffer founded Knickerbox together in 1986 and soon became the golden couple of the trade. A ferocious work ethic made Knickerbox an explosive  success . Janie is suing Marks and Spencer's for shares she claims she lost out on by leaving Victoria's Secret, where she worked for 5 years . With a touch of Parisian chic, Janie seemed the master of combining sex appeal with style, and helped launch the Victoria’s secret brand into the stratosphere. The rift with M&S came over an apparent misunderstanding of her role within the company, with Janie believing she would have total creative control over all aspects of the company’s lingerie. A spokesperson for M&S told The Financial Times ‘This matter is in the hands of our lawyers and we have absolutely no further comment to make.’ Born Janie Godber, she started her career at Marks & Spencer as a buyer, aged just 22. Close-knit: Janie Schaffer, centre, with ex-husband Stephen Schaffer and their triplet daughters (l-r) Amber, Madison and Daisy . There she fell for South African-born Stephen Schaffer, a handsome young merchandiser with an infectious entrepreneurial bent. They founded Knickerbox together in . 1986 and soon became the golden couple of the trade. A ferocious work . ethic made Knickerbox an explosive success. Before . launching the business in October 1986 with a single shop on Regent . Street in London, Stephen and Janie had spent six months honing their . business plan, inspired by chains such as Sock  Shop and Tie Rack, which . were at the time  incredibly successful. Immediately, they grabbed attention, . not least in June 1987 when they publicly presented Mrs Thatcher with a . pair of electric blue knickers. By the time they married in 1988, Knickerbox was making annual profits of £6 million. The couple had triplet daughters  by . IVF and, by 29, Janie was the Nineties poster girl for . businesswomen-mothers, with 120 stores across Britain and the Far East . in her empire and raising her girls without the help of a live-in nanny. So . devoted was she to the business  that in June 1993, just three months . after giving birth by caesarean, she returned to work – though she left . at 5.30pm three days a week, determined to be part of family life. Schaffer is happy to stay out of the spotlight these days. After . living a seemingly charmed life making fashion headlines throughout the . Eighties and Nineties, in 2005, at the age of 44, she embarked on a . passionate relationship with Princess Diana’s biographer Andrew Morton . while still married to her Knickerbox co-founder husband, Stephen. The . relationship lasted only months and, soon afterwards, she emigrated to . New York where she has lived discreetly ever since. And in 2006, the . couple once known as the Bonnie and Clyde of the bra world divorced . after 18 years of marriage. Reluctant . though he is to speak about that period, in an interview with The Mail . on Sunday, Stephen made it clear that they have remained good friends . throughout.","Janie Schaffer was taken on by M&S to revamp drooping sales .

Jose Mourinho has invited Frank Lampard to return to Chelsea as his assistant manager after admitting that letting the midfielder go was one of the most difficult acts of his career. The Chelsea boss praised Lampard in the highest terms, saying he was the best all-round midfield player of the past decade. He also insisted the 35-year-old’s move away from Stamford Bridge this summer is merely a ‘little break’,  not the end of his career there. Mourinho hinted that Ashley Cole’s time at the club may not be over, revealing he has yet to talk to the left back about his future. Job for life: Frank Lampard can return to Chelsea any time he wants, says Jose Mourinho . Top dog: Mourinho also described Lampard as the most complete all-round midfielder of the past decade . Cole, 33, is also out of contract but . no official announcement has been made following the player’s comment on . Twitter last month that he was ‘weighing up his options’ and ‘sadly it . does not look like Chelsea will be one of them’. Lampard, . meanwhile, is considering a move to Major League Soccer in the States . after leaving as Chelsea’s all-time record goal-scorer with 11 major . honours, including three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the . Champions League and Europa League. Mourinho . said: ‘You can’t imagine how difficult it was. I think only Frank knows . that, but at the same time I can feel some happiness about the process . because, for sure, he comes back to Chelsea. ‘For . sure. Everybody wants it.

"Malik Bendjelloul died Tuesday in Stockholm . He had suffered depression and took his own life . He won the Oscar in February 2013 for Best Documentary . By . Associated Press . Malik Bendjelloul, the acclaimed Swedish film director behind the Oscar-winning music documentary Searching for Sugar Man has died. He was 36. Police spokeswoman Pia Glenvik told the Associated Press Bendjelloul died in Stockholm late Tuesday, but wouldn't specify the cause of death, saying only that no crime is suspected. On Wednesday his brother told a local Swedish paper that he took his own life. Scroll down for video . Award-winning documentary filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul committed suicide in Sweden this week after a bout with depression. Malik Bendjelloul won the Oscar for best documentary for Searching for Sugar Man in February 2013. Police spokeswoman Pia Glenvik said Bendjelloul died in Stockholm late Tuesday, May 13, 2014 . 'I can confirm that it was suicide and . that he had been depressed for a short period of time,' his brother . Johar Bendjellou told Aftonbladet. 'Life is not always so easy... It's the worst. I don't know how to handle it.' Police would not say where the body was . found. His family have asked for privacy. Searching for Sugar Man, which detailed the life and career of American singer Sixto Rodriguez, won the Oscar for best documentary in 2013. He also won the BAFTA, Director's Guild of America, Producer's Guild of America, Writer's Guild of America and Sundance audience award. Bendjelloul grew up in central and southern Sweden as the child of a painter and a translator. He acted in Swedish TV-series Ebba and Didrik as a child during the 1990s. He studied journalism and media-production at the Linnaeus University of Kalmar in southern Sweden and later worked as a reporter for Swedish public broadcaster SVT. He resigned from that job to travel the world and he got the idea for Searching for Sugar Man during one of his trips. Bendjelloul directed, produced, edited and co-wrote the 2012 film that chronicles two South Africans who set out to find their folk music hero. Swedish director Malik Bendjelloul, left, has died aged 36. Here he is at Sundance with documentary film subject Sixto Rodriguez accepting the World Cinema Audience Award in 2012 . Bendjelloul was widely known for his enthusiasm, kindness and high spirits — so the news Wednesday that he had taken his own life shocked colleagues around the world. 'He made a great film and will be missed,' U.S. documentary film maker Michael Moore wrote on Twitter. British film producer Simon Chinn, who produced 'Searching for Sugar Man,' said he was shocked and deeply saddened by the news of his friend's passing. 'It seems so unbelievable,' Chinn told the AP over the telephone. 'He had everything to live for.' Chinn said he saw Bendjelloul only two weeks ago in London. 'He was so full of life, hope and optimism and happiness, and looking forward to the future and future collaborations,' he said. 'The idea that he is no longer is just too hard to process.' He reached out to Chinn when the film was 90 percent finished, but his main sponsor had withdrawn support, saying the film was lousy. 'He just kind of came in with his bounce of enthusiasm and charm and smiling eyes and I was completely won over by him,' Chinn recalled Wednesday. 'He had found this amazing story and was completely determined to do it justice,' he said. 'The fact that no one else believed in it didn't seem to deter him, he just kind of pursued it with incredible passion and tenacity that I hadn't really ever seen before in a filmmaker.' SVT's culture chief Eva Beckman said his death was incomprehensible. 'One always says it is unbelievable when a young person dies, or when anybody dies, but it is even more unbelievable with Malik,' she said Wednesday. 'Malik was simply such an incredibly alive person.' Beckman also praised Bendjelloul's strong storytelling skills and his willingness to experiment with new formats. 'What really set him apart from everybody else was his passion for storytelling. He was a fantastic storyteller,' she said. ' 'Searching for Sugar Man's' Oscar win led to a career rebirth for Rodriguez, who has been touring major venues in the U.S. and introducing American audiences to the songs he wrote four decades ago. He was performing Tuesday night in Detroit, but his manager said he wouldn't be commenting on Bendjelloul's death.","Malik Bendjelloul died Tuesday in Stockholm .

"By . Ruth Styles . and Olivia Fleming . The Duchess of Cambridge is widely thought to be Britain's most popular royal - but can she compete on a global scale? According to new reports, perhaps not. Denmark's Crown Princess Mary, an Australian native, is the most stylish royal dresser of all; beating the Duchess of Cambridge into second place, a startling new poll has revealed.

The poll, which was conducted by myvouchercodes.co.uk, also found that 67per cent of respondents found Mary's style 'inspiring'. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, Mary's stellar style has several fashion blogs dedicated to tracking her every sartorial move, providing information on what she wears and where to get it. Commoner to royalty: Born in Hobart, the Queen-in-waiting (pictured with husband, Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and two children, Princess Isabella and Prince Christian) is nicknamed Australia's Princess .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Bianca London . She's known and loved for her thrifty approach to dressing and the Duchess of Cambridge kept up her recycling reputation on tour in Australia today by wearing not one, but two dresses we've seen before. First up this morning, Kate ditched the bright hues she has so far worn Down Under, and instead opted for a gorgeous light coffee coloured dress by London-based Serbian fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic as she touched down at Ayers Rock airport, in the Northern Territory. And it's not the first time the Duchess has worn a shift dress in this style - we've seen her in a strikingly similar number by the same designer twice before. Scroll down for video . We've seen that before, too! The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge later headed to Ayers Rock, where Kate wore a £35 Hobbs dress that she purchased in 2012 . Deja vuz: Kate first wore the £35 ensemble in July 2012 as she, Harry and William attended the launch of a project in South-East London that aims to train the next generation of sports coaches - she even wore the same wedges . She first sported a stunning dove grey version of the gown, which reportedly retails for more than £595, in LA on her inaugural tour of America in July 2011, just three months after her wedding to William. She . wore the elegant, knee-length dress again in July 2012 at the Creative . Industries reception at the Royal Academy of Arts in London’s . Piccadilly, where she met with David Cameron. And . heading for desert terrain and 31c to visit the scared Aboriginal site . of Uluru, Kate chose a light brown version of the frock today and looked . immaculate teaming it with patent nude heels. Later in the day, Kate looked the picture of summer in a patterned white and beige Hobbs dress, as she took a walk down Kuniya Walk at the base of Uluru in Ayers Rock with husband William. Kate snapped up the appropriately named 'Wessex' dress, which cost £35, in the sale from High . Street store Hobbs back in 2012. She first wore the ensemble while . trying her hand at some table tennis and football in July 2012 as she, . Harry and William attended the launch of a project in . South-East London that aims to train the next generation of sports . coaches. She even opted for the same beige platform shoes, a footwear . style she covets, and re-wore the £85 Imperia Simple Slingback Espadrille Wedge from Dune - she has the same style in navy blue, too. Simple: The Duchess of Cambridge looked sophisticated in a light coffee colour as she arrived at Ayers Rock airport with the Duke . Double take: Kate - who is famous for recycling outfits - wore a very similar dove grey dress in 2011 in Beverly Hills, LA and in 2012 in London . Touch down: The Royal couple appeared to match their hues once again as they arrived in Uluru . Hot: The pair were met with a very warm 31C as the landed in central Australia and Will appeared to squint from the sunshine . Picture perfect: Later in the day, the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge posed for a snap with Uluru in the background during the . sixteenth day of their official tour to New Zealand and Australia . She loves that dress! The Duchess of Cambridge looks radiant as she poses in front of the Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, in her thrifty dress with Prince William today . Dramatic scenes: The royal couple take in the sights as they walk down Kuniya Walk at the base of Uluru in Ayers Rock, Australia . As for her husband, Will's cream and beige desert ensemble wasn't quite as bold as the real safari garb his father Prince Charles wore when visiting Uluru 31 years ago in March 1983 with Princess Diana. It is not only the third time Kate has chosen to wear a dress in this style, it is also the second time she has worn a dress by designer Roksanda Ilincic during this Royal tour. The . 32-year-old previously wore a bright maize yellow wool crepe dress with . feature white panels by the designer on her arrival in Sydney. Royalty . of the genuine, political and Hollywood variety have all demonstrated . their fondness for Roksanda's idiosyncratic and ever-elegant creations. Princess . Beatrice, Samantha Cameron, Michelle Obama and Tilda Swinton are just . some of the sartorially clued-up women to appreciate her bold . colour-blocking and clean, unfussy lines. Welcome gift: The Duchess of Cambridge is given a necklace during  a Welcome to Country display at Ayers Rock . This isn't the first time that Kate has recycled an outfit during her tour. As she took part in a friendly . race in America's Cup sailing boats on Auckland's Waitemata Harbour last week, she wore a look we've seen not once, but . twice before. The . Duchess donned blue J Brand skinny jeans and a £48 ME + EM striped . Breton-style top with a £79.99 navy Zara jacket and cool Ray Ban . sunglasses. Kate was seen wearing the exact same . look at an event at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in East London in . her role as patron of the charity SportsAid last October, where she . showed off her toned stomach following the birth of Prince George. Avid fans will notice that Kate, . who is well known for recycling her wardrobe staples, wore a very . similar navy outfit at the 2012 Olympics Games when she paid a visit to . the athletes in the Olympic village, too. Today the Duchess left her long brunette hair down for her visit to Uluru, one of the most romantic places in Australia. And she accessorised her simple yet sophisticated look with a small cream clutch bag and dangle drop earrings. WIlliam and Kate arrived at the landmark - also known as Ayers Rock - exactly a week before their third wedding anniversary. Glossy: Kate's brown hair shone in the sunshine as she clutched a small nude bag . Smiles: William and Kate giggle as the Duke holds an Aboriginal spear at the National Indigenous Training Academy . Special place: Princess Diana and Prince Charles also visited Uluru, 31 years ago in March 1983 . Favourite: Kate previously wore a yellow Roksanda Ilincic when she arrived in Sydney . They then took a late afternoon stroll around one of the largest and most sacred sites in the world. Taking a walk around Uluru as it glows red in the afternoon sun is a magical experience and William and Kate had the time for a leisurely look around the base of the rock which rises 348m from the desert floor. The red centre of Australia has turned on a show of green with blooming wildflowers for the royal couple, following recent rains. Due to its size - Uluru or Ayers rock is 9.4km around the base - the Duke and Duchess will only be able to take in part of it, just as Prince William's parents did 31 years ago, although William and Kate are not expected to climb the rock as Charles and Diana Did. Glowing: William and Kate will get to experience Uluru's magical red colour . Instead they saw ancient rock paintings, a sacred waterhole and met the traditional custodians, the Anangu people, and the Duchess was told about the special 'women's place' at the rock's base by respected elder and famous tribal tracker, Barbara Nipper Tjikatu. Barbara had a special gift of paintings on paper made out of wallaby poo droppings to give to the Duchess. Prince William and Kate are seeing Uluru at the most beautiful time of year, when many people come to celebrate anniversaries, propose marriage or just enjoy a glass of champagne in the car park which has a panoramic view of Uluru at the spectacular moment of early evening glory when the sunsets and its red glow peaks. After night fall there is a magnificent blanket of stars overhead, the Milky Way even more visible in the desert away from city lights. William and Kate are expected to spend the evening out in the desert at the luxury camping resort Longitude 101, where they will retire into a cosy and glamorous 'tent' room as the temperature outside drops into the teens. 'It is the most remote place on earth the royal couple will have ever been,' said Ayers Rock Resort communications director, Karena Noble, 'people do come here specially for wedding anniversaries and other meaningful dates. 'Wouldn't it be nice if a baby was conceived here? It really is a special place.'","Kate started day in coffee-coloured Roksanda Ilincic as she touched down at Ayer's Rock airport, in Northern Territory .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Egypt’s military said Saturday that devices it claimed it invented to detect and cure AIDS and hepatitis C need six more months of testing. The army had earlier promised to reveal the technology to the public this coming Monday after making what experts dismissed as an outlandish claim last February. At a news conference then, the head of the army’s Engineering Agency said the military had produced an 'astonishing, miraculous scientific invention' that could detect AIDS, hepatitis and other viruses without taking blood samples and also purify the blood of those suffering from the diseases. The claim caused uproar among scientists and the public, with many pointing out that it had not been properly verified. Still six months away apparently: A device the Egyptian army claims will detect and cure AIDS and Hepatitis - seen here on Egyptian State Television on February 25 - needs more testing, the army said Saturday . It was also lampooned in a famous satirical program that has now been taken off the air. The claim hit a sensitive nerve in Egypt, where Hepatitis C is an epidemic. Some studies estimate that up to 10 percent of 86 million Egyptians have it, making it the country with the highest prevalence in the world. In a press conference held in a military hospital in Cairo Saturday, a military doctor said the devices needed further tests before they could be released to the public. 'Scientific integrity mandates that I delay the start of the public release until the experimentation period is over, to allow for a follow up with patients already using it,' Egypt’s state news agency MENA quoted Maj. Gen. Gamal el-Serafy, director of the Armed Forces Medical Department, as saying. El-Serafy said doctors had already started testing one of the machines, the so-called 'Complete Cure Device', on 80 Hepatitis C patients who were also being treated with medication. Saturday’s news conference notably dropped any mention of the devices as a cure for AIDS, only referring to hepatitis. The army had earlier promised to reveal the technology to the public this coming Monday after making what experts  dismissed as an outlandish claim last February. They have not elaborated on how the device works . The original claim in February raised concerns that the military’s offer of seemingly inconceivable future devices would draw Egypt back into a pattern of broken promises by successive rulers who would frequently announce grand initiatives that failed to meet expectations. Generals working on the project and pro-military media adopted a defensive stance over the matter, insisting that the invention would be released to the public and that any criticism of it was part of a foreign plot to rob Egypt of a major scientific victory. El-Serafy said the armed forces will set up a medical center to treat the viruses in the Suez Canal province of Ismailiya to carry out the tests and declare results.","Egyptian army announced in February they had developed a gun-like device that could detect and cure AIDS and Hepatitis .

"By . Hilary Freeman . New MS drug Tecfidera could be made available on the NHS (stock image) A twice-daily tablet could soon be given to multiple sclerosis patients as an alternative to painful injections. The drug Tecfidera has been licensed in Britain and could be available on the NHS, allowing British patients to join the 35,000 already using the drug in other parts of the world. One neurologist said: ‘This is what MS patients have been waiting for.’ Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) has been shown to reduce the rate of MS relapses by more  than a half and delay disability progression by over 20 per cent in adults with the most common form of the disease – relapsing remitting MS. The drug is a modified version of a treatment that was originally used to treat the skin disease psoriasis. ‘Nobody is sure exactly how it works,’ explains Belinda Weller, consultant neurologist at the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurological Clinic in Edinburgh. ‘It’s a new approach to treating MS which is believed to help  cells in the body defend themselves against the damage caused by MS.’ The cost of Tecfidera is £17,900 a year, similar to existing prescribed treatments. It’s administered as a tablet, taken twice a day with food. The MS Society surveyed more than 1,000 people with relapsing remitting MS in 2010, and  95 per cent of them said they wanted an alternative to injectable therapies. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of the MS Society, says: ‘The fact this drug is now licensed is very good news. ‘Effective as injectable treatments may be, the reality is that regular injections are not an appealing prospect, and many people experience injection- site reactions, which can be unpleasant. ‘We’re expecting NHS advisory bodies to announce their decision on whether the treatment should be freely available in the coming months. ‘This approval is crucial, because without that, access to this medicine will be severely limited and reserved only for  the few who can persuade their local NHS to pay for it.’ Old ways: The most common treatment for MS at the moment is injections . Neurologists are hopeful that Tecfidera will be approved as a first-line therapy. Dr Weller adds: ‘It’s effective, safe and convenient. Many of my patients struggle with injections and some have even refused to  go on to treatment until they could get an oral tablet. They’ve been waiting for this.’ Tracy Beers, 39, a catering  manager from Mortimer, Berkshire, was diagnosed with MS  in 2008 and took part in a trial  for Tecfidera. She says: ‘I felt relieved when  I got my diagnosis as I’d felt so stressed not knowing what was wrong with me. ‘I’d done lots of research when my symptoms started and was worried what it might be. ‘Since being on the drug I have had some relapses but I’ve  managed to carry on a normal life, work full-time and take part in sports. ‘I had some minimal side effects – stomach upsets – but taking  a tablet is preferable to having injections. ‘It’s convenient, especially when going on holiday or visiting friends. I can have a much  more normal life with tablets  than injections.’ She adds: ‘I try to live my life  to the full and feel passionately that MS shouldn’t rule my life.’ About 100,000 people in the  UK have MS, an incurable, progressive condition that involves nerve damage. Three times as many women  as men have MS and the average age of onset is 32. Some 60 people are newly diagnosed each week.","The pill has been shown to reduce the rate of MS relapses by 50 per cent .

"By . Katy Winter . It is the news that could finally stop culinary Insta-spammers in their tracks. A team of scientists has discovered that sharing and consuming an excess of food pictures may actually decrease pleasure in the real thing. It is an unwelcome truth that many of us now celebrate a culinary triumph or top notch restaurant meal not by instantly diving in - but with a photo session. The phrase ‘Tweet before you eat’ has entered common parlance and we no longer flinch when the party at the table next to us begins snapping away at their plate (though we draw the line when they come over to snap ours - true story). However, new research from Brigham Young . University suggests that oversharing and consuming ‘food porn’ on social . media sites such as Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram can make it less . enjoyable to eat. Many people simply can not start eating a meal without ensuring they have shared the experience with friends and followers . Sharing 'food porn' on social media sites such as Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram can make it less enjoyable to eat . Looking at those pictures of perfect eggs Benedict or your friend’s incredible Sunday roast efforts can ruin rather the whet the appetite by making you feel like you have already eaten the food. The study found that overexposure to images of foods increases our sense of satiation (a drop in enjoyment associated with repeated consumption) when we actually eat those same foods. One of the study’s coauthors and BYU professor Ryan Elder explains: ‘In a way, you’re becoming tired of that taste without even eating the food. 'It’s sensory boredom – you’ve kind of moved on. You don’t want that taste experience anymore.’ Published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology, the study recruited 232 people to look at and rate pictures of food. Posting and viewing excessive photos of food on social media sites such as Instagram can decrease our enjoyment of food when we eat it . Looking at those pictures of your  friend's incredible Sunday roast efforts can ruin, rather the whet your appetite, by making you feel like you have already eaten the food . In devastating news to poser foodies everywhere, sharing pictures of your food may actually decrease your pleasure in it . In one of their studies, half of the participants viewed 60 pictures of sweet foods like cake, truffles and chocolates, while the other half looked at 60 pictures of salt foods such as chips, pretzels and French fries. After rating each picture based on how appetising that food appeared, each participant finished the experiment by eating peanuts, a salty food. Participants then rated how much they enjoyed eating the peanuts. In the end, the people who had looked at the salty foods ended up enjoying the peanuts less, even though they never looked at peanuts, just at other salty foods. The researchers say the subjects were satiated on the specific sensory experience of saltiness. If we avoid looking at pictures of salads, we might enjoy them more . Supposedly, looking extensively at pictures of delicious sweet treats can help curb your cravings.... 'No it's OK, I looked at loads of cake pictures earlier!' This food-photo phenomenon could be used to help those trying to reduce cravings . While this could be bad news for those of us who regularly post or look at foodie images online, the findings could actually be of some use to dieters . Those with a serious penchant for a certain naughty food, say ice-cream, may be able to reduce their enjoyment in a Ben & Jerry’s binge by viewing numerous pictures of their weakness food.","Trend for posting 'food porn' photos on social media sites still on rise .

"By . Associated Press . A New York portfolio manager for one of the nation's largest hedge funds has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for his insider trading conviction. Federal Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan cited Michael Steinberg's overall good character at the sentencing on Friday. Steinberg, 42, was convicted in December of five conspiracy and securities fraud charges. He did not speak at sentencing because of a pending appeal. The Manhattan resident was convicted of trading illegally in two technology stocks in 2009. At the time, he worked for the Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC Capital Advisors. Michael Steinberg (right) former SAC Capital portfolio manager leaves Federal Court  after sentencing in, New York today . Prosecutors accused Steinberg of trading . on illegal tips about Dell Inc and Nvidia Corp passed to him by an SAC . analyst, who admitted to swapping confidential information among a group . of analysts at other hedge funds. Steinberg's trading resulted in . illegal profits of $1.82 million, prosecutors said. The case stemmed from a broad crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street. Steinberg's lawyers had asked for no more than two years in prison, while prosecutors had argued for up to six-and-a-hald years. Sullivan also ordered Steinberg to pay a $2 million fine and forfeit $365,142, a sum the government says Steinberg and an SAC analyst were paid from the illegal trading profits. Steinberg (right) was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after being convicted late 2013 on insider trading . Steinberg's lawyers had asked for no more than two years in prison, while prosecutors had argued for up to six and a half years . Dozens of family members and friends attended the sentencing and sent letters to the judge. The letters, Sullivan said, described Steinberg in a positive light that set him apart from other defendants he had sentenced. 'If it were only based on the character of this man, it would be easy, because I do think this is a good man,' he said. 'But I do have to consider the crime here.' Steinberg is one of eight current or former SAC Capital employees to be convicted on insider trading charges. SAC pleaded guilty to fraud charges and has agreed to pay $1.8 billion in criminal and civil settlements. The Stamford, Connecticut-based firm has rebranded itself Point72 Asset Management as it shifts to being a family office managing Cohen's fortune. Sullivan granted Steinberg bail, pending an appeal. Judge Sullivan granted Steinberg (right) bail, pending an appeal . The appeal is expected to focus on Sullivan's not having required the government to prove that Steinberg knew the insider who originally disclosed non-public information had received a benefit for making the disclosure. Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management, and Anthony Chiasson, co-founder of Level Global Investors, are appealing on similar grounds stemming from convictions in a separate trial Sullivan also oversaw. During appellate arguments in Newman and Chiasson's case last month, some judges questioned whether Sullivan's interpretation of the insider trading law was correct. Sullivan on Friday noted the arguments, saying the issue appeared to be 'a closer call than I thought.' Steinberg's sentence was less severe than those of Newman and Chiasson, who in 2013 received terms from Sullivan of four-and-a-half years and six-and-a-half years in prison, respectively. The company was founded by billionaire businessman Steven A. Cohen. Cohen has not been charged criminally, but he faces civil claims.","Michael Steinberg, 42, convicted of five conspiracy and securities fraud charges .

"By . Keith Gladdis . Dirty Larry: Multi-millionaire Larry Goodman is the man behind the company that supplied British supermarkets with horsemeat contaminated burgers . Many of Britain's biggest retailers were forced to pull products from their shelves yesterday as their suppliers were found to be selling beefburgers laced with horse meat. Tesco's were found to contain up to 29 per cent equine DNA, while Asda, Sainsbury's and the Co-op all withdrew frozen burgers as a 'precautionary measure'. Today the Mail reveals that a multi-millionaire beef supplier dubbed ‘Dirty Larry’ is behind the company that supplied British supermarkets with contaminated food. Larry Goodman, 76, is a director of the ABP Food Group which owns the meat processors Silvercrest Foods in Dublin and Dalepak Foods in Hambleton, North Yorkshire. His family owns a sprawling country home on a 700-acre estate in County Louth, Ireland and property around Europe including a share in the London headquarters of Goldman Sachs. But in Ireland, the Goodman name is synonymous with financial malpractice after he dragged the country’s beef industry through the dirt in the 1990s after details of his business links with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq were exposed. Bentley-driving Mr Goodman, an intensely private man, started out as a 15-year-old school drop-out selling sheep guts to butchers in Dundalk, Ireland for use as sausage skin. He made his first fortune after he founded Anglo Irish Beef Processors in 1962 and started selling beef to Muslim countries including Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. But United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq after Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1990 led Iraq to default on millions of pounds of payments to Goodman’s company. Scroll down for video . Off the shelves: Mr Goodman, 76, is a director of the ABP Food Group which owns meat processors which supplied burgers containing horsemeat to Tesco . By August 1990 Goodman had accumulated almost £550million in debts and an emergency session of Ireland’s parliament the Dail was called with politicians thinking one of the country’s most successful businessmen was in crisis. Eventually the banks took a 60 per cent stake in the business and Goodman – a lifetime teetotaller – was allowed to cling on to the rest. But an investigation by Granada TV journalist Susan O’Keefe, now an Irish Labour senator, subsequently revealed serious financial malpractice involving the Goodman International group. That then led to a judicial tribunal in Ireland, known as the Beef Tribunal, which shone a light on the relationship between Goodman and Ireland’s then Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Boss: Larry Goodman is a director of the APB Food Group. Pictured is the ABP foods factory in Leeming Bar, North Yorkshire which is one of the frozen food suppliers identified as using horse meat in burgers . It was during this hearing that Goodman – one of Ireland’s richest men with a fortune believed to be worth around £600million – became dubbed ‘Dirty Larry’ by the Irish media. For many, it is simply a matter of economics. While calling the vet to put down a lame or surplus horse can cost . in excess of £200, abattoirs will gladly pay £300 for an unwanted . animal. As a result, 8,118 horses and ponies were slaughtered in Britain in . 2011, to be sent to the continent to be sold as gourmet meat. Nothing is wasted, with their skins going into the leather trade, while any off-cuts will be used as dog food. Most will be former pets their owners cannot care for or riding . school mounts that can no longer pay their way because they are too old . to work. But according to Ben Martin, a campaigner for charity Animal Aid, . in 2011 ‘1,127 were thoroughbreds discarded by the racing industry’, . which ‘overproduces horses each year’. The number of British horses ending their days in the . slaughterhouse has doubled since 2008, a little-known consequence of the . recession. Mr Martin said around 10,000 horses and ponies are now . believed to be slaughtered in Britain each year. ‘With belt-tightening following the recession, it is often luxuries . such as horses that face the chop,’ he said. ‘It makes sense they would . end up in slaughterhouses rather than paying a vet a  fee or trying to . sell them on. ‘The real scandal behind the horse slaughter figures is that the . volume of horses being produced for the pet and horse racing industries . is unregulated and out of control.’ Permitted methods of slaughter include shooting with a bullet, or . stunning with a penetrative bolt followed by immediate bleeding. There are two major abattoirs that take horses in Britain, but they are not keen on publicising it. Several thousand live horses are believed to be sent to the . continent for slaughter. Customers in France, Belgium and Italy like . horse meat. Small amounts are also eaten in Spain, Portugal, Holland and . Romania. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said almost all British . horse meat is exported. ‘It is legal to slaughter and sell horse meat in . the UK, provided it is from an approved abattoir and the meat must . carry the stamp declaring it is fit for human consumption,’ he added. It emerged that after winning an election in 1987 Haughey had agreed to underwrite a multi-million pound beef contract Goodman had secured with Iraq. The agreement meant the Irish government had effectively provided Goodman with an insurance that meant the taxpayer would foot the bill if Iraq reneged on its payments. At the time Iraq was embroiled in a bitter war with its neighbour Iran. The policy was later cancelled. Despite the findings of the tribunal Goodman was never charged with any wrongdoing. Less than five years after he was bailed out Goodman was able to buy his business back from the banks for £30million. The beef baron’s processing company, Irish Food Processors, has not published accounts since 2001 when it recorded a turnover of £720million. His companies now have contracts with fast food chains and supermarkets including Tesco, Burger King, Asda and Sainsbury’s. Now the company is under investigation again by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland amid suspicions that it may have received contaminated meat from unchecked sources. Silvercrest Foods yesterday said it was withdrawing 10million beef patties from stores across Ireland and the United Kingdom. The ABP Food Group yesterday said it had despatched its own auditors to two of its suppliers to conduct spot checks on their products. In a statement it said: ‘We take this matter extremely seriously and apologise for the understandable concern this issue has caused. ‘ABP Food Group companies have never knowingly bought, handled or supplied equine meat products and we acknowledge the understandable concern created as a result of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland’s DNA frozen beef burger test results.’ It also said it was introducing a new testing regime for its meat products which will include DNA analysis. In the Irish parliament yesterday Sinn Féin agriculture spokesman Martin Ferris demanded to know the names of the companies in Spain and the Netherlands which are believed to have supplied contaminated products. The Irish minister for agriculture Simon Coveney said any companies involved in the production of beef burgers containing horse meat would be named. He said: ‘If there are inappropriate linkages here, we will highlight those.’ A spokesman for Mr Goodman said he would not be making a personal statement on the horse meat issue.","Larry Goodman, 76, is a director of the ABP Food Group .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A hedge fund manager has plunked down the most money ever paid in the U.S. for a residential property to land a massive seaside estate in the Hamptons. The East Hampton property was bought by Jana Partners hedge fund manager Barry Rosenstein for a staggering $147million smashed the previous record of $120million paid for a Greenwich, Connecticut home only two weeks ago. A pond, formal gardens and a private beach are included on the 18-acre property sold without a broker, according to the New York Post. Mogul: Jana partners hedge fun manager Barry Rosenstein has been identified as the buyer of the record property . Summer home?: The massive estate sits on a private beach, has a pong and gardens . Jerry Seinfeld and many other power brokers are among the financier’s newest neighbors, according to the paper. It was sold privately to help the owner avoid paying commission to a broker, sources told the paper. The massive estate was the dream home of Christopher H. Browne, the former managing director of the Tweedy, Browne Company investment firm – he died December 2009 at age 62 from a heart attack. Browne left the home to architect Andrew Gordon, his partner of 10 years, sources said. The will was contested by a dozen of the deceased investment guru’s relatives, but Gordon remained in the home after reaching a settlement three years after Browne’s death. The old record holder: Copper Beech Farm, in Greenwich, Connecticut . Lavish: The home was sold for $120million only two weeks ago . Also on the water: The massive estate sits on the Long Island Sound about 30 miles northeast of New York City . Gordon was battling cancer at the time and died last September at age 52, the paper said. The property then reverted back to Browne’s family, and they immediately put it on the market. It was sold to an unidentified person in a direct transaction that avoided paying hefty broker commissions. ‘Somehow, someone got the inside track. All the brokers are crestfallen,’ said another person. The previous record sale for a residential property was of the Copper Beech Farm, in Greenwich, for $120million.

Outpouring: Thousands of Jersey City residents lined the streets to see the procession of Santiago's cakset to the church . Grand display: Mayor Fulop led the procession from the funeral home to the church and gave the eulogy at the ceremony . 'Melvin Santiago was everything we would want in a police officer. He was hard working and conscientious, good and courageous, strong and considerate,' Fulop said. 'To quote the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., ""It was not how these officers died that made them heroes; it is how they lived.""' Fulop referenced an essay Santiago's brother Alex wrote this week titled 'My Hero'. 'Well Alex, Melvin is also my hero and I'm quite certain he's also the hero of quite a few people in this church,' Fulop said. Fulop led the procession of more than a thousand police officers from McLaughlin funeral home to the church. Hundreds of residents lined the streets to see Santiago's casket, draped with a flag that flew over the ruins of the World Trade Center, make its way to the church. Santiago's death has sparked tensions in the divided New Jersey community and led to threats of violence from the Bloods gang, who vowed to get revenge for Santiago's killer's death.

In the aftermath of the shooting, tensions between police and Campbell's community have been risen after the mayor ordered a large makeshift memorial to Campbell torn down overnight. However, his defiant family put it back up again. After Campbell's death, his widow Angelique Campbell told News 12 New Jersey that he should have killed more officers if they were planning to shoot him. She later apologized for these comments, however, and added that her husband had recently fallen back into drug addiction and 'got back with the wrong crowd.' 'Both . families are hurt. Let this cop be laid to rest peacefully. Let . Lawrence be put to rest peacefully. That's it,' Angelique Campbell told . The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'There's no back-and-forth. I don't want to argue with no cops, I don't . want to fight with no cops. I just want to put him in the ground, he's . gone, that's it.' The funeral today was held just two days after local authorities received threats of vengeance from the Bloods gang. A senior law enforcement official told The New York Post the gang had threatened to 'kill a Jersey City cop and not stop until the National Guard is called out.' An . internal Port Authority advisory, obtained by The Post, read: 'New . Jersey State Police has received credible information from the Jersey . City Police Department about specific threats toward Jersey City police . officers and law enforcement. 'The United Blood Nation may take retaliatory action against police officers.' It is not known whether Campbell was a member of the gang. A . law enforcement source also told the paper a statewide alert had been . issued following three shootings involving police in the city. It seems that local authorities are taking the threat seriously since Santiago's wake was heavily patrolled by police officers armed with firearms and even a tank. At the wake, current MayorFulop honored Santiago by promoting him to the rank of detective . and awarding him a Medal of Honor. Melvin Santiago was everything we would want in a police officer. He was hard working and conscientious, good and courageous, strong and considerate. To quote the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., ""It was not how these officers died that made them heroes; it is how they lived. Melvin had always wanted to be a police officer. I've been told that as a boy he'd travel with his uncle to the precinct to learn about the Jersey City Police Department. From family and friends, we've learned that Melvin kept that dream alive in his heart and worked diligently in high school and his years in college to qualify as a police officer. And, when the time came to serve, he repeatedly requested to serve in the West District so that he could guard the community which was his home, which was his family. He was assigned to the West. Captain Mike Kelly describes Melvin as squared away in his work and manner, intent upon learning, and always trying to be better. Mike told me how Melvin would just watch the older guys, watch and learn, that he wanted to bring pride to the West, and bring honor the profession of law enforcement. Kelly would try to encourage Melvin to relax and smile. I personally think that the ""Eagles"" cap that Melvin wore to work put Mike a bit off. In the year since Melvin came on the West, he participated in patrols and police work, he chased down perpetrators and arrested them, he was on the front lines of the district and handled everything that came his way. And whether it was neighbors' yelling, domestic disputes, or the threat of gun violence, Melvin was intent upon good prevailing over evil, protecting the vulnerable, and order maintained in our community. Melvin represented the best of that thin blue line which protects and defends civilized society from the indiscriminate violence which human beings are capable of. Melvin understood that serving as a police officer is dangerous, but he also knew that it was the highest calling of service. And as Melvin's family knows, it was not only his willingness to make the supreme sacrifice, but his daily commitment to service, his quiet, dogged determination to be a force for good, and to give the protection of the law to the entire community -- including those who would tear it down. Melvin never excused himself from the standards that he was commanded to enforce. The self-discipline and principled behavior, which Melvin always showed, is what makes a police officer so unique, and it is also what makes the brother and sisterhood that is law enforcement so sacred. While we ask you to protect and serve us all, we also ask you to hold yourselves to the highest standards, on the job and also in your private lives. This was a part of his service which Melvin approached with a determination which was exceptional even among police officers. This morning, in this sacred place, we as a community express our eternal gratitude for the life and legacy of Melvin Santiago, and that of all law enforcement. Last week when Alex wrote an essay about his brother, he expressed his gratitude in the title, ""My hero."" Well Alex, Melvin is also my hero and I'm quite certain he's also the hero of quite a few people in this church. As every police officer will honor his memory each time they don the uniform, let all of us take a moment deepen our appreciation for Melvin's life and sacrifice. Let us also consider our larger struggle to carve out a space of order and security in this world for ourselves and our families. Melvin's service and sacrifice are a special part of that struggle, and in light of his courage, let us return to it with a renewed determination and commitment which meets his high standards. May eternal rest grant unto Melvin, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and all of the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen.","Jersey City police officer Melvin Santiago, 23, was killed in the line of duty Sunday by 27-year-old Lawrence Campbell .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Ed Miliband will today pledge that his Labour Party manifesto will be even more radical than Michael Foot’s. He will declare that he wants to go further than both Tony Blair’s New Labour and the ‘Old’ Labour personified by the likes of Mr Foot, Ken Livingstone and Tony Benn. Mr Miliband will argue that the challenges facing Britain are so serious that only sweeping changes will do. Radical move? Ed Miliband vows to go even further with sweeping changes than his predecessors such as Michael Foot (left), whose far-left manifesto was famously dubbed 'the longest suicide note in history' Mr Foot’s far-Left 1983 manifesto called for mass nationalisation of industry, new taxes on the rich and unilateral nuclear disarmament. It was famously dubbed the ‘longest suicide note in history’ by one of the party’s own MPs. But in a speech to Labour’s National Policy Forum in Milton Keynes, Mr Miliband will say: ‘We have moved on from New Labour. 'And we are not going back to Old Labour. 'Instead, our programme for government is more radical and more ambitious in the change we seek, crafted for the age we are living in and the challenges we face.’ Labour activists will lay the groundwork for Mr Miliband’s manifesto at the forum, with policy proposals set to include a return to nationalisation and higher taxes on the rich, with a 50p top rate and ‘mansion tax’ widely expected. Mr Miliband will say Labour needs to ‘fundamentally reshape our economy’ in order to tackle ‘inequality and unfairness’. Condemned: Miliband took a swipe at Tony Blair's government for not doing enough to eliminate inequality . In a swipe at Mr Blair’s New Labour, he will say: ‘We did great things in government. But we did not do enough to reduce inequality, or eliminate the problem of low pay, or build an economy that will work for the next generation. 'And the reason is that we did not do enough to change the fundamentals of the economy.’ Mr Miliband will also warn activists that Labour cannot return immediately return to the free-spending ways of the past because of the need to tackle the country’s huge budget deficit it ran up when the party was last in office. And in comments that are likely to provoke further concern among business leaders, he will reiterate his commitment to major interventions in markets that he believes to be failing the general public. Mr Miliband will say Labour is ‘moving on from a time when rising inequality was just a fact of life – or when we acted as if there is nothing we could do about markets that aren’t fair or aren’t working’. He will claim that more can indeed be done, by forcing businesses to pay a higher minimum wage and imposing a price freeze on energy firms. Mr Miliband will also promise to build 200,000 new homes a year, curb the use of zero-hours contracts and abolish the spare-room subsidy – known by its critics as the bedroom tax.","Labour leader vows to go further than all predecessors with new strategy .

"By . Associated Press . Billionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein has donated $12.3 million to restore the home of Confederate General Robert E. Lee on the grounds of Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. The columned home, originally built as a monument to George Washington between 1802 and 1818, will be restored to its historical appearance in 1860, before the start of the U.S. Civil War. Rubenstein, Carlyle Group co-founder and history buff, said the site crowns the most sacred land in America but needed major repairs. Scroll down for video . Historical: The historic Arlington House at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia was originally built as a monument to George Washington overlooking the nation's capital and was later home to Confederate General Robert E. Lee . Donor: Philanthropist David Rubenstein (center), pictured with Park Ranger and project manager, Brandon Bies (right) is donating $12.3 million to restore Arlington House in Virginia . The money he donated to National Park . Foundation will also go toward fixing the grounds and slave quarters, and overhauling the site's museum exhibits. 'The goal is to remind people of American history,' Rubenstein said. 'I think when you're restoring history, you should remind people of the good and the bad.' Arlington House, as it is known, was built by Washington's step grandson, George Washington Parke Custis and his slaves on a hilltop overlooking the new capital city and the Potomac River. Lee later married into the family, and it became his family's plantation estate. After Lee resigned from the Union army and joined the Confederacy, Union troops captured the estate during the Civil War and made it their military headquarters to defend Washington from Virginia. Graffiti from Civil War soldiers is still visible in the mansion's attic. After the war, the area became a . community for emancipated slaves, and Union troops began burying their . war dead on the grounds, in part to prevent Lee from returning. It . eventually became Arlington National Cemetery, the burial site for many . soldiers as well as President John F. Kennedy. Casualties were first buried there in 1864, after the United States Soldier's Cemetery in Washington, D.C. and the Alexandria Cemetery in Alexandria, Virginia, were full. Dilapidated: Some of the ceilings inside Arlington House leak the climate control system is so unstable some artwork can't be displayed . Tourist spot: More than 650,000 tourists visit Arlington House and walk through its rooms every year . Donation: Philanthropist David Rubenstein pictured inside the historic Arlington House at Arlington National Cemetery . Overhaul: David Rubenstein's $12.3 million donation will also be used to overhaul the museum's exhibits and fix the interiors of Arlington House . The . 200-year-old house and grounds symbolize the nation's reconciliation . after the Civil War, said National Park Service Director Jonathan . Jarvis, but it is in poor condition. The . roof leaks inside, and the climate control system is so unstable some . artwork can't be displayed. Decorative paint on the building's facade is . peeling away. Exhibits in a . nearby museum building haven't been updated in 30 years. The needs are . part of an $11 billion backlog on maintenance across the national parks. 'We frankly do not get enough appropriations on an annual basis to take care of these places,' so private support is critical, Jarvis said. Commander: Robert E. Lee (1807-1870), Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate armies during the Civil War, pictured in undated photo . Still, the home is the most visited historic house in the national park system. It receives about 650,000 visitors each year, and between one and two million people visit the grounds, park officials said. 'As you can imagine, that's fantastic but it also leads to a certain level of wear and tear,' said Project Mangaer Brandon Bies. Some restoration planning has already begun or will be designed starting later this year. Much of the work will be completed in late 2015 through 2016. Plans call for scaffolding to be built around the brick-and-stucco house for artisan painters to restore the decorative design that looks like marble. Interior systems will be replaced. Slave quarters will be completely restored, along with the grounds. Art and decorative features brought centuries ago from Washington's Mount Vernon estate and from Lee's West Point office will be conserved. Even Lee's plumbing system that provided early flush toilets inside when such contraptions were extremely rare in the 19th century will be restored. The work may require the house to close for a short time during periods of low visitation in the late fall and winter, but other parts of the site will remain open. 'It's an extraordinary site,' Rubenstein said, 'and I think all Americans will benefit from having it restored.' Rubenstein's gift complements President Barack Obama's Centennial Initiative to invest in National Park Service sites as a way to mark the agency's 100th anniversary in 2016, according to the NPS. Historical monument: The historic Arlington House mansion (top) is on the grounds of the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia . 1. It was built as a monument to honor President George Washington, modeled after the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, Greece, by his step grandson George Washington Parke Custis and his slaves. 2. Robert E. Lee married into the Custis family, and Arlington House became his family estate from 1831 to 1861. This was where Lee wrote his resignation from the U.S. Army to join the Confederacy. 3. Selina Gray, a slave, was left in charge to care for Arlington House and its heirlooms from the Washington family when the Lee family evacuated. When Union soldiers took over the site, Gray confronted soldiers over stolen objects and convinced a commander to safeguard the house and family treasures. 4. The home's builder was also an artist. His 200-year-old frescos have been preserved on the walls, and he painted a large mural of George Washington at the Battle of Monmouth that remains in the house. 5. President John F. Kennedy made an unannounced visit to Arlington House in March 1963 and marveled at the hilltop view overlooking the nation's capital. That visit led to Jacqueline Kennedy's decision to have her husband buried below the house with a similar view from Arlington National Cemetery, despite family wishes to have him buried in Massachusetts.","David Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity firm Carlyle Group LP and philanthropist, donated the money .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman whose sister was killed by a drunk driver, ran over a cyclist while chasing her boyfriend at nearly 70mph after a drunken row. Emma Egan leapt behind the wheel when Liam Dent drove off after dumping her. But the 26-year-old lost control as she tailgated him at 69mph in a 40mph limit. Emma Egan has been jailed for for four years after admitting causing death by dangerous driving . She smashed into father-of-two Eric Codling, 55, catapulting him from his bicycle and killing him instantly. Egan, whose sister had been killed by a drink-driver eight years previously, wept as she was jailed for four years at Sheffield Crown Court. The beauty therapist, who admitted causing death by dangerous driving, is likely to serve two years in prison before being released. Mr Codling’s widow, Karen, said of the sentence: ‘It is disgusting. This is not justice. Is Eric’s life only worth four years? ‘I know nothing will bring Eric back, but... to only serve two years for killing somebody just doesn’t make sense. ‘Why is what she did any different to murder? We don’t feel there has been any justice.’ The court heard that Egan, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was over the drink-drive limit when she chased Mr Dent through Sheffield after he ended their relationship in November last year. Emma Egan smashed into father-of-two Eric Codling, pictured, 55, catapulting him from his bicycle and killing him instantly . After crashing into Mr Codling, she stopped briefly before driving off in her Vauxhall Astra. When police found her at Mr Dent’s home in the city, Egan was wailing incoherently, rocking in her seat and shaking. She then fell to the floor and vomited. Egan told the officers: ‘Oh God, what have I done? I’m so sorry.’ Alan Taylor, for Egan, said she was ‘profoundly sorry for her actions leading to the tragedy’. She had been in a state of emotional turmoil over the ending of her relationship with Mr Dent. ‘She must bear the heavy burden of guilt for the rest of her life,’ Mr Taylor said. ‘Not a day will go by when she will not remember the pain and anguish she has caused.’ Mrs Codling, 50, from Sheffield, said the fact Egan’s sister was knocked down and killed by a drink-driver ‘added insult to injury’. That driver was also jailed for four years and Mrs Codling said: ‘Egan’s own mum at the time said a four-year sentence for the driver who killed her daughter was an outrage, and she is right – it is.’ In a victim impact statement read out in court before Egan was sentenced, Mr Codling’s 13-year-old daughter Grace described how the death of her father had affected her and her nine-year-old sister Eve. Eric Codling with his wife Karen and their daughters Grace, 12, and Eve, nine . ‘I miss him being here, I miss everything about him,’ Grace said. ‘I feel angry. I think it’s horrible someone could do it.’ She said she wept for her father, while Eve ‘does not talk to anyone’. Mrs Codling told of her husband’s love for his daughters and how he had years before nursed her through cancer treatment. ‘We all miss him terribly – I lost my soulmate, my lover, my everything,’ she said. ‘My girls lost their cuddles and hugs. We are all bereft.’ She said she takes her daughters to their father’s grave every week. ‘We speak to him as though he is standing there with us as that’s all we have left now. ‘I loved him so much and he loved me and his girls so much. It’s just not fair it has happened.’ Sentencing Egan, who was also banned from driving for six years, Judge Julian Goose said: ‘No order or sentence will bring back the life of the deceased. ‘Death by dangerous driving is aggravated in your case by the fact that at the time you were over the [drink-drive] limit and were in pursuit of another vehicle while travelling at excessive speed.’","Emma Egan got behind the wheel when her boyfriend dumped her .

"By . Associated Press . As he sat in a crippled airliner, Ron May braced his head between his legs and prayed for his wife, who was seven months' pregnant with their first child. Everyone on the jet feared they were about to die. That was back on July 19, 1989, when May was a passenger aboard United Flight 232. The DC-10 was traveling from Denver to Chicago when it lost all hydraulic power after the rear engine exploded. The crew used the remaining two engines to steer a winding course to Sioux City, where the massive plane crash-landed, cartwheeling down the runway and bursting into flames before breaking apart in a cornfield. Of the 296 people on board, 184 survived. Most couldn't believe it. 'We're upside down and I'm alive,' May, now a 55-year-old Chicago pastor, recalled of the landing. 'Everything was chaos.' Survivor Ron May, 55, braced his head between his legs and prayed for his wife, who was seven months' pregnant with their first child while on board . Never forget: from left, Sioux City Fire Chief Bob Hamilton (retired), 185th commander Col. Dennis Swanstrom (retired), United Airlines Head Flight Attendant Jan Brown (retired), and United Airlines pilot Capt. Al Haynes speak during a panel discussion about the crash on Friday . Survivor:  Jan Brown, the lead flight attendant on Flight 232, has led an unsuccessful campaign to get the Federal Aviation Administration to end the practice of allowing children under the age of 2 to travel on a parent's lap without a ticketed seat because of a child that died in the crash . Catastrophe: In this July 19, 1989 file photo guardsman Dennis Nielsen carries passenger Spencer Bailey away from the wreckage of United Airlines Flight 232 . A quarter of a century later, the flight is considered one of the most impressive life-saving efforts in aviation history. At the time, Capt. Al Haynes was hailed in much the same way as US Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger, who safely ditched his Airbus A320 into the Hudson River in New York in 2009. The legacy of the crash lives on. It changed the way planes were designed, ensuring more backup systems to prevent the kind of catastrophic hydraulic failure that made Flight 232 almost impossible to control. It also drew attention to the need for emergency preparedness. And the efforts of the crew were remembered in movies and books. This weekend, survivors will gather for 25th anniversary memorial events at the Mid America Museum of Aviation and Transportation in Sioux City. Still, some of the safety changes sought by survivors have not happened. Jan Brown, the lead flight attendant on Flight 232, has led an unsuccessful campaign to get the Federal Aviation Administration to end the practice of allowing children under the age of 2 to travel on a parent's lap without a ticketed seat. She is haunted by the memory of a 22-month-old lap child who died in the crash. 'It's heart-wrenching after 25 years,' said Brown, now 73. 'How truly pathetic that you can still take a lap child, the most vulnerable of our population, and risk flying with them on our lap.' Before she left her role as chair of the National Transportation Safety Board earlier this year, Deborah Hersman lamented that the rules for lap children had not been changed since the crash. In a statement, an FAA spokeswoman said the agency recommends that parents secure infants in seats, but said that if they are forced to buy an extra ticket, parents may eschew flying for driving, which could be more dangerous. According to data on the U.S. Department of Transportation website, there have been no preventable infant deaths on planes in 17 years. The terror on Flight 232 unfolded over more than 40 minutes. At about 3:15 p.m., an engine on the DC-10 aircraft exploded and chunks of metal ripped apart all three of the jet's hydraulic systems. The plane lost all hydraulic fluid, shutting down the systems that controlled the plane's altitude and direction.

Al Haynes and flight Attendant Susan White Callender hold hands after a news conference about the plane crash . Crash: Search crews walk past the wreckage of the United Airlines flight 232 20 July 1989 in Sioux City, after its crash at Sioux City Airport . Haynes sought to steer using the two remaining engines. He was aided by instructional pilot Dennis Fitch, who just happened to be traveling on the flight as a passenger. Fitch sat on the floor of the cockpit. The crew knew the plane was in grave danger. 'The potential was that we could all go straight down,' Brown said. Haynes navigated toward Sioux City. According to the recordings from the cockpit, he said to the crew: 'We're not gonna make the runway, fellas. We're gonna have to ditch this son of a (expletive) and hope for the best.' As the pilots tried to bring the plane down at the Sioux City airport, the right wing plowed into the ground, sending the jet into a cartwheel and tearing it apart as it skidded across the pavement into a cornfield. 'It was complete chaos. Bodies thrown about the plane. Others were thrown from their chairs. There was smoke and fire and debris,' said Jerry Schemmel, 54, of Littleton, Colorado. Crash site: The plane crash killed 112 people . Ruins: Search crews investigate the wreckage of the United Airlines flight 232 20 July 1989 in Sioux City after the crash . Debris: A cranes lift the tail section of United Airlines Flight 232 onto a truck in this July 2 1989 file photo . Survivors struggled to get out of the wreckage, emerging into the cool green Iowa cornfield. Schemmel tried to help people out and then went back in for a baby he heard crying. The crash, captured on video and viewed in news broadcasts, was the subject of extensive review. An analysis by the NTSB found that the airline failed to detect a crack in a fan disk in one of the engines during an inspection process, which ultimately led to the engine failure. Soon after, DC-10 planes were modified with a shut-off valve to prevent the loss of all hydraulic fluid in future. The emergency response in Sioux City was also as a model for other cities to match. County authorities had disaster plans in place and had drilled for such situations. They quickly mobilized huge numbers of medical and rescue personnel, bringing in ambulances from more than 28 agencies across a 60-mile radius. For survivors, the legacy of the crash is complicated, given the many lives lost. Schemmel said he will attend the memorial services this weekend, but then hopes to finally put Flight 232 behind him. 'I think as much as anything, it will be good for my family. Our son, who is 15, is going to come along,' he said. 'After this weekend, it will be a chapter we can close.'

"By . Andrew  Pierce . The quotation, painted in bright yellow, is emblazoned in the window of Ashers, an unassuming bakery shop in Newtownabbey, a Protestant enclave on the outskirts of Belfast. ‘Come along inside. We’ll see if teas and buns can make the world a better place.’ For 22 years Ashers, set up by husband and wife Colin and Karen McArthur, has been true to that cheerful sentiment from children’s classic The Wind In The Willows. In the fiercely sectarian district where the bakery operates, the McArthurs are proud to serve Catholics and Protestants. But in the past two weeks, they have been at the centre of an extraordinary row, which has been raised at Prime Minister’s Questions and debated on radio talk-shows as far afield as Australia and the U.S. Row: Daniel McArthur, 24, manager of Ashers Bakery, and wife Amy, insist they never meant to cause offence by refusing to bake the cake . The bakery’s name is derived from Asher who, in the Book Of Genesis, is one of the 12 sons of Jacob and forebear of one of the tribes of Israel. It was predicted that Asher’s ‘food would be rich’ and he ‘would provide delicacies fit for a king’. The Biblical reference is an indication of Mr and Mrs McArthur’s Christian faith: both are devout Presbyterians. And that’s the root of the row. Their difficulties began when they took an order for an iced cake for Andrew Muir, a former mayor of North Down, for a municipal gathering in support of the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia. The specifications were for images of Bert and Ernie (puppets from television show Sesame Street), the logo of Queerspace, a gay rights campaign group, and the slogan: Support Gay Marriage. Ever since the McArthurs rejected the order on the basis that same-sex marriage is against their Christian faith, they have been subjected to a torrent of abuse on social networking forums. The Equalities Commission, Northern Ireland (ECNI), funded by the British taxpayer, is now threatening to prosecute them and is demanding compensation for the would-be customers. In response, a national fighting fund for Ashers has been launched by the Christian Institute, which has received almost 6,000 messages of support. The bakers are far from alone in opposing same-sex marriage in Ulster — legalising gay marriage has been rejected three times by the Northern Ireland assembly. The dispute has echoes of Christian couple Peter and Hazelmary Ball, who refused to give two gay men a double bedroom in their guesthouse in Cornwall. The Supreme Court eventually ruled the rights of the couple outweighed the Christian conscience of the Balls. Baroness Hale, deputy president of the Court, declared: ‘We should be slow to accept’ the rights of Christians to discriminate against gays. But last month, Lady Hale suggested her initial judgment might have been wrong, refused to make an order for costs against the Balls, and floated the idea of inserting a ‘Christian conscience clause’ into the equality legislation passed by the last Labour government. Despite this, the ECNI is pressing ahead with its action against the bakers, alleging they are ‘acting unlawfully . . . under the 2006 Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in the provision of goods and services on the grounds of sexual orientation’. But is this politically motivated? Last year, the commission threatened a printing company because it declined to have anything to do with the launch of a gay magazine, of which more later. The McArthurs, whose family have been bakers for a century, have received hundreds of messages of support from across the globe. Specifications: The initial request for the 'Support Gay Marriage' cake was to have Sesame Street puppets arm-in-arm . In the family’s only interview, Daniel McArthur, 24, the eldest of three sons — who runs the business because his parents are semi-retired — insists they never set out to cause any offence. ‘My mum took the order when the customer came into one of the shops knowing it would be problematic. As she did not want to embarrass the customer, she said nothing,’ he explains. ‘After the shop closed, we talked about it as a family, weighing up what our conscience told us against the risk our response might get some public attention. ‘As we don’t believe in gay marriage, and did not want to be associated with a politicised campaign, mum phoned the customer to explain politely that we could not accept the order, and would be returning his deposit. ‘She explained how we have turned down orders when they involved swear-words, nudity, or images that go against our faith. ‘We never thought we could be prosecuted for our beliefs. We are not discriminating against gay people. Our church’s definition of marriage is clear: it’s a covenant between a man and a woman, a 6,000-year-old tradition, which is ordained by God. Sexual activity outside marriage is a sin.’ Daniel does not look or sound like a religious fanatic. At university, he was friendly with gay students and says his family have homosexual acquaintances. ‘We have gay customers. We are happy to serve them,’ he says. This week, the family made me very welcome, knowing I’m gay and in a civil partnership. ‘I have no problem in you coming into our home,’ Daniel told me. ‘We are just unwilling to endorse gay marriage.’ Daniel, wife Amy, 25, and one-year-old daughter Robyn, live in Ballyclare, which has Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Plymouth Brethren and Catholic churches. William McCrea, the local Democratic Unionist MP, a noted gospel singer, was one of nine of the province’s 13 Westminster MPs who voted against gay marriage. Daniel has a degree in aeronautical engineering from Queen’s University, Belfast, but joined the business as it was expanding, and runs the commercial side. There are six outlets, including a factory. He met Amy, now pregnant with their second child, on a religious mission with the poor in the Philippines. The family are members of the Trinity Reformed Presbyterian Church and talked over the cake order with its elders and minister. ‘They told us we were making the right decision,’ says Daniel. So do their staff share their views? ‘Out of 62 staff, five are churchgoing Christians,’ he says. ‘Most had no idea about our faith.’ Daniel is bemused by the legal threat. ‘The commission talks about discrimination on the grounds of disability, race and sexuality, but never against people’s Christian beliefs. Why?’ ‘In its letter, they found us guilty without giving us any chance to put our side across. What sort of justice is that? I am sorry for any distress we have caused but we are staying true to our beliefs. We pray that God will give us the strength to fight this.’ Beliefs: The bakery, which was set up 22 years ago, is located in a Protestant enclave of Belfast . While they have been buoyed by messages of support, there have been critical and abusive messages on the company’s Facebook page. One man wrote: ‘Absolutely unjustified and disgusting . . . I know hundreds of people who will deliberately go out of their way to avoid your products.’ Another added: ‘Disgusting attitude of ignorance and bigotry.’ But others rallied to their cause. In a letter to a local paper, the News Letter, Brian Stuckey, from Denver, Colorado, wrote about an identical case in his home city. ‘Ashers bakery deserves the unstinting support of Northern Ireland for its commitment to Christian principles,’ he said. There was a similar divergence of views among shoppers outside the Ashers stores, where queues form daily for their soda bread. Douglas Addis, a pensioner, says: ‘While some will say they are being old-fashioned, it’s not their views which count but those of the Lord.’ Alison Cornelius, whose sister is gay, says: ‘I know many Christians who are gay. It is terrible that the bakery is being discriminatory against gay couples.’ But Maureen Longstaff says: ‘Our church pastor says if you go into a pub the management has a right to refuse to serve you. What’s the difference?’ An hour’s drive away in Armagh, Nick Williamson, 29, had his own run-in with the Equality Commission last year. His printing company Bluefiremedia was approached by the editor of a gay magazine for a quote to publish their first edition. ‘They gave me a link to their website which contained a number of explicit images,’ says Nick. ‘I am a Christian, and did not feel I could provide the quotation.’ There was a complaint to the ECNI but Nick stood firm. ‘I don’t think Christians are given a fair deal from equality laws. Our rights and faith are trampled on. It’s time we stood up to the bullying.’ In the end, the commission dropped its threat of legal action. This week, it refused to discuss the Ashers case, although it said in a statement: ‘The ECNI provides assistance to people who complain they have suffered unlawful discrimination. The commission has granted assistance to the complainant and will consider any response before taking any further action.’ While Ulster’s politicians have voted against same-sex marriage, the ECNI is in favour. Its website states: ‘The commission supports the introduction of legislation permitting same-sex marriage . . . with sufficient safeguards for religious organisations.’ But not, it seems, for small Christian bakeries.","Family bakery Ashers operates in a Protestant enclave of Belfast .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . With her marriage crumbling, and embroiled in a furious argument with her husband over breakfast, Julie Evans grabbed the nearest weapon to hand. And yesterday the 45-year-old found herself in court admitting assault with a piece of toast... and a smear of butter for good measure. The court heard how she grabbed a handful of Clover and rubbed it over her husband James during the breakfast bust-up after he told her he wanted a divorce. Julie Evans (left), 45, arriving at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court and (right) now ex-husband James Evans, 50 . Things turned ugly as the husband and . wife of 15 years continued their clash amid the foodstuffs, after which . Mr Evans was left with a bleeding ear that needed 13 stitches, the court . heard. Describing the . fracas which took place last July at their home in Drybrook, . Gloucestershire, Evans told the court: ‘He came down to breakfast and . said “I want a divorce. Get out of this f****** house.” ‘That did annoy me and I did throw toast at him. I did put butter in his face.’ She added: ‘I went to wash the butter off my hands and he came to put butter on my face. I pushed him back. ‘He . grabbed me around the throat. I grabbed a cup to defend myself and . eventually he let me go and I fell on the floor. He noticed his ear was . bleeding.’ Evans, who has since divorced her husband, also admitted pouring water on him as he slept the previous day. Telling . his version of events to Cheltenham magistrates’ court, Mr Evans, a . 40-year-old project manager, said: ‘I came into the kitchen and said . “good morning”. ‘She threw . the toast at me. I laughed so she grabbed a handful of butter and . smeared it all over my face. I tried to rub the butter on her back to . make her laugh. I tried to make it playful. Evans appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court (pictured) where she was fined £300 for the assault . ‘I went to get the butter out of my hair when she grabbed me by the throat.’ Mr . Evans said he put his hand under his wife’s chin to make her let go. He . said he thought she was tugging his hair but could not tell because he . has multiple sclerosis which affects his sense of touch. At this point the couple’s 14-year-old daughter entered the kitchen, and Mr Evans noticed blood on the floor. ‘My ear was flapping in the wind. It was in two halves,’ Mr Evans said. ‘I don’t know how it got like that. I can’t remember.’ Evans . admitted two charges of common assault for pouring water on her husband . and for the breakfast attack, but was cleared of actual bodily harm to . his ear. She was told to pay £300 in fines, as well as £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Magistrate . Chris Summers said: ‘There was growing tension in this relationship. This culminated in a fracas. Ms Evans’s response to Mr Evans’s . aggression was  in self-defence.’","Julie Evans, 45, of Drybrook, Gloucestershire admitted breakfast bust-up .

"By . Richard Spillett . A toddler who suffered a fatal wound to the head was unlawfully killed, a coroner has concluded, despite no-one being charged over her death. An inquest into the death of Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe, who was 21 months old when she died, heard she was subjected to a non-accidental 'blunt force trauma'. Police arrested Summer’s mother Victoria Rogers, 27, stepfather Craig Sharp, 34, and grandmother Susan Rogers, 58, on suspicion of murder after her death because all three had cared for the toddler during the period when experts said she must have been hit. Tragic: Summer Rogers-Ratcliffe was 21 months when she died of a blunt force head injury that caused her brain to bleed in February 2012. But two-and-a-half years later, no one has been charged with her death . Family: The court heard Summer, pictured with mother Victoria Rogers, came from a loving family who had no contact with social services. But a coroner has now ruled she was 'unlawfully killed' The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided no-one could be prosecuted over her death because it could not be established whether it was her mother, stepfather or maternal grandmother who was looking after her at the time she was injured. At the end of an inquest today, Assistant Deputy Coroner Oliver Longstaff said the non-accidental nature of the injury had been established not merely on the 'balance of probabilities', but also 'beyond reasonable doubt', as is necessary to secure a conviction in the criminal courts. He said: 'In my view, and to the criminal standard of proof, I am satisfied that whatever the state of mind of the perpetrator of the act that caused Summer's ultimately fatal injury, it would have been obvious to that perpetrator that Summer was being subjected to forces far in excess of anything she might have been expected to withstand, and which were overwhelmingly likely to cause her very significant injury. 'I accordingly will record a conclusion that Summer was unlawfully killed.' Detective Constable Richard Peckett had told the inquest in Bradford that Summer's mother, Victoria Rogers, had been arrested on suspicion of murder during the investigation into her daughter's death, along with her grandmother Susan Rogers and her mother's partner Craig Sharp. Mystery: Summer's mother Victoria Rogers (right) was arrested on suspicion of murder after medical records showed the toddler's injuries could not have been inflicted by accident but was later released without charge . Confusion: Her stepfather Craig Sharpe (pictured with Summer) and her maternal grandmother were also arrested and then released because the CPS could not determine who had been looking after the 21-month-old . He said West Yorkshire Police submitted a file to the CPS but there was no prosecution. The detective said this was because all three of those arrested had looked after Summer at her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire at some time in the early morning of February 27, 2012, but pathologists were unable to pin-point exactly when the injuries were sustained. Mr Longstaff also concluded there was no evidence Summer had been subjected to regular neglect or abuse. He said: 'The childcare arrangements that were in place for her meant that she was regularly cared for in three distinct family environments, in each of which it appears to me she was lovingly and appropriately looked after. 'The event that led to her death was, I find, an extraordinary and horrific one-off event that could not have been predicted.' The court was told how Summer was a normal, healthy child in a family with no involvement with social services.

"By . James Tozer . A top conductor honoured by the Queen for his services to children’s choirs appeared in court alongside his wife  yesterday jointly charged with raping a former pupil. Michael Brewer, who was awarded an OBE and took part in the BBC series Last Choir Standing, is also accused of indecently assaulting the girl during his time at a  prestigious music school. Yesterday the 67-year-old appeared in the dock alongside his wife Hilary, who also faces charges of rape and indecent assault against the same ex-pupil. Trial: Police arrested Michael Brewer, left, and his wife Hilary, both pictured leaving court, after a former pupil of the prestigious Chetham's School of Music made accusations they had raped and sexually abused her . Afterwards Brewer said he would be . ‘strenuously denying’ the charges, which date back more than 30 years . and follow a historic sexual abuse investigation. He faces trial over one count of rape . and six counts of indecent assaults on the girl when she was aged . between 13 and 18. His wife, also 67, faces one count of rape and one of . indecent assault. The charges date to a time when Brewer was director of music at Chetham’s School in Manchester. He subsequently co-founded the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain, . serving as its musical director until he was suspended following his . arrest. At work: Director of National Youth Choirs of Great Britain Mike Brewer OBE conducts choir members taking part in the Norfolk High Schools Choir Festival .

Acclaimed: Michael Brewer OBE was director of music at Chetham's School in Manchester for 20 years and has also directed the World Youth Choir, among a list of high-profile events . The couple arrived and left . Manchester Magistrates’ Court separately yesterday as they made their . first appearance over the charges. After District Judge Jonathan Taaffe . was told the charges against the pair were ‘inextricably linked’, they . were asked to stand in the dock together. Mrs Brewer spoke only to give her full name, date of birth and an address in Rossendale, Lancashire. Accusations: The allegations of historic sexual abuse centre upon a girl who was a former student at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester, pictured . Her husband then gave his details, . providing the court with an address in Selly Oak, Birmingham. No pleas . were taken and the couple were told to attend Manchester Crown Court for . a preliminary hearing later this month. Existing bail conditions which include requiring Brewer not to have any unsupervised contact with under-18s were maintained. After being told they were free to leave, Brewer told the Daily Mail: ‘I’m strenuously denying these charges.’ According to Greater Manchester .

Andy Hooper supplied six pictures to feature on the special set of Commonwealth Games stamps. The photos were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations . Hooper, who is a four-time winner of the Sports Photographer of the Year award, has nearly 20 years' experience of photographing major sporting events for the Daily Mail all around the world. Based at the Mail’s headquarters in London, he spoke of his delight at being given the commission to provide the photographs. He said: ‘I was approached by  the Royal Mail and asked if I could supply six pictures to feature on the special set of stamps. ‘They were then submitted to Dutch artist Nanette Hoogslag, who used them as the basis of her illustrations. ‘When I saw the end result I was naturally delighted and very honoured to be involved in this project.’ The Royal Mail stamps, which feature athletes swimming, cycling, playing tennis, running and playing netball, go on sale today . The only major sticking point in the exercise was disguising the identities of the sportsmen and woman involved in the six different sports recognised on the stamps. The photographer explained: ‘One of the stipulations was that you are not allowed to show any living person on a stamp, so it went against the grain that the images were not sharp. ‘However, the photographs I supplied obviously were but then the illustrator got to work on them to ensure we worked within the guidelines.’ Seal of approval: The work of Daily Mail sports photographer Andy Hooper features on the souvenir stamps . Unfortunately the Mail cameraman will not be involved when the spectacle begins next week. He said: ‘Having just returned from the World Cup finals in Brazil, and then, the Open golf tournament, I have family holiday commitments in place. ‘But I will be there in spirit, if nothing else.’ Last year he added another prestigious award to his collection when he triumphed at The Press Photographer's Year awards.His excellent picture of rider Laura Collett jumping a Stonehedge-themed obstacle on horse Natterjack at the Barbury International Horse Trials scooped first prize in the 'Sports Features' category. Hooper was also commended in the 'Sports Specialist folio of the Year' category for his shot of Olympic and Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius face-to-face with a cheetah on a game reserve in his native South Africa.

"By . Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor . Lord Hill has been nominated  to be the UK's next European Commissioner . A millionaire Tory peer is in line for a £25,000 pay-off from the taxpayer after being plucked from obscurity by David Cameron to become Britain’s new man in Brussels. Lord Hill of Oareford was handed the £210,000-a-year job as Britain’s next EU Commissioner this week as part of the Prime Minister’s reshuffle. The former Leader of the House of Lords has proved a controversial choice, with observers saying he lacks the profile needed to secure a top post in the Commission - and critics saying his past as a senior lobbyist raises questions about his suitability. Although Lord Hill is moving from one well-paid taxpayer-funded job to another, Government rules mean he automatically qualifies for a tax-free ‘golden goodbye’ payment worth £25,259. A string of other ministers leaving the Government also qualify for pay-offs, totalling almost £180,000 following Mr Cameron’s wide-ranging reshuffle. The final total will be well over £200,000 when payments to their advisers are included. The payments result from rules that mean ministers and their special advisers are entitled to three months’ ‘redundancy’ pay when they lose their jobs – even if they asked to go. Critics described the payments as a waste of money – and urged wealthy ministers to hand them back. Dia Chakravarty, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be astonished to find their hard-earned cash is being wasted on golden goodbyes to ex-ministers, particularly at a time when the government keeps talking about wanting to make savings in the public sector.’ Labour MP John Mann said: ‘None of them should get anything, in particular Lord Hill who is going to a hugely salaried job in Europe. They should do what the rest of the country is doing and tighten their belts. In many cases these payments are rewards for failure. ‘The honourable thing to do would be not to take a penny. Then the whole system should be scrapped to prevent a repeat.’ Mr Cameron’s reshuffle led to the biggest clear out of ministers since the election. Some 15 former ministers, some of them extremely wealthy, are entitled to tax-free payments to cushion the blow of losing office. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve is entitled to £23,943 after being booted out. Cabinet casualties Owen Paterson and David Jones will each receive £17,206. Baronet Sir George Young, who quit his post as Chief Whip voluntarily, is one of eight senior Tories entitled to payments of £8,250 each. Others include Kenneth Clarke, former Science Minister David Willetts and former Commons leader Andrew Lansley, who is already being lined up by Mr Cameron for a top job with the United Nations. The new European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker greeted David Cameron with a high five yesterday . The row follows controversy over revelations that Mr Cameron is to hand knighthoods to a number of ministers who agreed to go quietly. Former Foreign Office minister Hugh Robertson, former international development minister Alan Duncan and former solicitor general Oliver Heald are all expected to receive knighthoods. Mr Clarke, 74, will be made a Companion of Honour – one of Britain’s most prestigious honours. The Cabinet Office said ministers were entitled to pay-offs under legislation dating back to 1991. The payments are made automatically. A spokesman said it was ‘a matter for individuals’ whether they want to waive the payments or donate them to good causes. The rules mean ministers are entitled to a payment equal to three months of their ministerial salary when they leave office.","Lord leader Lord Hill of Oareford nominated as the UK's EU Commissioner .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . ‘Hoylake, blown upon by mighty winds, breeder of mighty champions,’ wrote the legendary golf writer Bernard Darwin, who happened to be the grandson of Charles Darwin. And he was right - the evolution of Open winners at this venue is easy to trace: to lift the Claret Jug here you must be a true links great. From J.H. Taylor to Bobby Jones, Peter Thomson and the greatest of them all, Tiger Woods, Hoylake does indeed breed mighty champions. Breeding ground: The Open produces winners and to lift the Claret Jug, you must be a true links great . Will he? The bookies have priced up all the contenders and Sportsmail have assessed the best to back . VIDEO Tiger ready to roar once more . So look no further than golf’s big beasts in the field this week. That doesn’t mean to say that having a major championship already in the bag is a must for the eventual winner this week - it sure helps, but this is a course where legends can be made. One man who has already claimed a spot among the game’s pantheon is Tiger Woods. The 14-time major champion returns to the scene of his most emotional triumph, having won here just two months after the death of his father in 2006. Woods is bullish and claims only victory here will do – he won a US Open on a broken leg after all - but in his second tournament after major back surgery, surely this is a step to far for even a superman like Woods. Still, 22-1 is the most tempting price of all this week. Resist if you dare… . Woods showed how to conquer Hoylake in 2006 – avoid the fairway bunkers at all costs and putt like a demon. In with a shout: 14-time major champion Tiger Woods claims only victory in the Open will do . Memories: Woods won in Liverpool just two months after the death of his father in 2006 . Those taking the bold approach off the tee could be punished by Darwin’s mighty winds and find themselves caught in the traps or in the thick rough found at every Open venue. The greens here are large for a links and fairly flat – a dead-eyed putter could clean up. That is why defending champion Phil Mickelson (25-1), who has not putted well since his crowning glory at Muirfield last summer, and world No 1 Adam Scott (14-1) could fall just short. Scott looks focused and ready to add to his Masters victory last year, but the flat stick remains his one weakness. Of the favourites, Henrik Stenson looks the best bet. The hulking Swede also has a slight weakness in his putting but is the best ballstriker in the world right now. It surely is only a matter of time before he wins his first major. Stenson’s Open record is mightily impressive after three top three finishes in his last five appearances, including a near miss at Muirfield last year. Best bet: Henrik Stenson is a good shout of the favourites for the Open despite his putting weakness . Eyes on the ball: Stenson's Open record is impressive after top three finishes in his last five . Confident: Stenson is the best ballstriker in the world right now ahead of the Open start . Given that he destroyed the field in the last major contested in one of the game’s all-time great performances, Martin Kaymer is outstanding value at 25-1. The German has two majors under his belt and showed at Pinehurst last month that his is the coolest putting stroke out there from any distance. Kaymer also won the previous big event he entered, the Players Championship in May, so is the game’s in-form player along with Justin Rose. Rose (14-1) has claimed the Quicken Loans Invitational and Scottish Open titles in successive weeks on either side of the pond. The Englishman’s win in Aberdeen was his first on a links course since bursting on to the scene with a fourth at Birkdale as a teenager in 1998, too. Swing: Martin Kaymer is outstanding value given he destroyed the field in a tremendous performance peviously . Contender: English hitter Justin Rose's Quicken Loans Invitational and Scottish Open titles were impressive . Stuck? Rose is an in-form player and claimed titles in successive weeks on either side of the pond . VIDEO Rose looking to complete Open hat-trick . THREE TO WIN . Adam Scott (AUS) — 14/1Blew good chances to win in 2012 and 2013 but surely destined to hold the Claret Jug one day. Those watching him in practice believe this could be his time. Henrik Stenson (SWE) — 14/1It was this time last year that the personable Swede went on his all-conquering run. Fearless under pressure and likes the course. Graeme McDowell (NI) — 28/1First-round leader the last time The Open was at Hoylake and has all the tools to be leading after 72 holes. THREE FOR E/W (FINISH IN TOP FIVE) Mikko Ilonen (FIN) — 12/1May be the most underrated player on the European Tour. Won Amateur Championship at Hoylake in 2000. Shane Lowry (IRE) — 20/1The eyes of good putters tend to light up when they see the smooth greens at Royal Liverpool. Lowry can putt with the best of them. Jordan SpietH (US) — 10/1Given how many top 10s the 20-year-old  compiles, he has to represent decent value. The Texan should prosper on these putting surfaces. But surely three wins on the bounce is . too much for anyone other than Woods in his prime, so the Hampshire man . may have peaked just a little too soon. Kaymer’s form, however, is too . good to ignore. It was also difficult to look past Jordan Spieth’s assertion that he could one day break Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18 major championships, despite the fact that the 20-year-old Texan has yet to win a single one of golf’s four big tournaments. But this kid is special, as he showed is so nearly becoming the youngest ever Masters champion in April. He also has good links experience from his days as a junior, can hit the ball low under the wind and has a magic short game. At 33-1, Spieth is one to watch. Another man impossible to ignore is Rory McIlroy. If everything clicks, the Northern Irishman could blow away the field like one of the gales that often howl in here from the Wirral Estuary. But if the wind does pick up, there are huge question marks over McIlroy’s game. His bizarre Friday funks also mean McIlroy’s form is too erratic to risk a price of 16-1. One man heading under the radar this week is Ian Poulter (80-1). His Open form is heading in exactly the right direction after top 10s in the last two years, including a dramatic late charge at Muirfield last summer. As Ryder Cups have proven, there is no . better putter under pressure than Poulter. He has been worried by a . painful wrist this week, but remember the old adage: beware the injured . golfer. Under the radar: Ian Poulter's Open form is heading in the right direction after top 10s in the last two years . The only thing hurting Graeme McDowell (25-1) recently is his failure to add to his US Open title from Pebble Beach in 2010. The 34-year-old grew up on links golf in Portrush and came very close to the Claret Jug two summers ago just up the road from here at Royal Lytham. A springtime break and his recent marriage have left McDowell happy with life and he looks to be approaching his prime as a golfer. Oh, and he’s also deadly on the greens. Any of these men would be a worthy successor to Woods as champion at Hoylake. Oh, and what price was Tiger, again? Course: Royal Liverpool Golf Club, par 72, 7,312 yards.

"By . Mike Dawes . Luke McCormick, 30, who was jailed in 2008 for killing two brothers while twice over the legal drink-drive limit, has been made captain at Plymouth Argyle . Plymouth Argyle is facing a fans backlash after appointing disgraced goalkeeper Luke McCormick, who killed two brothers while twice over the legal drink-drive limit, as the new club captain. McCormick was jailed for seven years and four months in 2008 after killing Aaron Peak, ten, and his brother Ben, eight, on the M6 motorway near Keele. The goalkeeper rejoined Plymouth in May 2013 after a short spell at Oxford. The 30-year-old, who was driving at 97mph, had downed beer and Sambuca shots at a former team-mate's wedding before driving his car. He was jailed after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, as well as charge of drink-driving. But now officials at the club have given the goalkeeper a second chance, by offering him the prestigious captaincy of the club. The goalkeeper has been publicly backed by the club and its manager, despite fans taking to Twitter to vent their anger. Former teammate Guy Branston said: 'I think Luke McCormick will be a . fantastic club captain, and shouldn’t be disregarded just because of a . mistake he made in his past. 'Take . away what he did - and served time for - and bring it back to the here . and now, and he deserves the accolade of being club captain. 'I spoke to Luke in detail about what happened and about being in prison, and I think he is an asset to the football club. 'I . obviously don’t agree with what he did as drinking and driving is . disgusting, but he has served his time and is trying to move on with his . life.' McCormick, who was released from prison in 2012, played for Plymouth Argyle for eight years before his contract was terminated due to the crash. He returned to the club this summer, saying he had 'a point to prove' in the wake of the incident. He said: 'I’m hungrier than I’ve ever been. I feel like I have got a point to prove, which I didn’t necessarily have as much last time I was here. The footballer, pictured here at his court case, said he had 'a point to prove' following his return to the League Two club this summer . 'I owe this club for giving me the chance and I’ve got a lot to repay the fans for, and I’m determined to make this a success.' But although have backed McCormick, some fans criticised the move on social networking sites. Jamie Hawkins commented: 'Plymouth Argyle remaining classy as ever' and Jamie Chown said: 'Luke McCormick backed as Plymouth Argyle club captain... JOKE!!!!!!"". The crash, which took place on the M6 near Keele services, killed Aaron Peak, 10, pictured left and his brother Ben, 8, second from right. Their father Philip, now 43, also pictured with the boys' mother Amanda, was injured in the incident . Another . using the handle @NorthernMisery said: 'Plays for Plymouth. After . killing two kids. F****** disgraceful.' The . fatal incident took place in June 2008 when McCormick, who had slept . for just two hours before driving, fell asleep at the wheel of his Range . Rover. His car - which was travelling at 97mph on the 70mph motorway - hit the Peak family's Toyota and killed the two boys. Their father Philip, now 43, who was taking his family to Silverstone when the crash took place, suffered 'horrific' injuries. After the player was jailed, mother Amanda Peak said: 'Our sons will never experience the things Luke has had. 'Phil will carry the scars of the incident for life. We will both carry the emotional scars forever.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Luke McCormick jailed in 2008 after killing Aaron Peak and brother Ben .

Arsene Wenger and Arsenal fans are clearly delighted with the £10million purchase of Mathieu Debuchy as a replacement for Bacary Sagna, who headed to Manchester City once his contract expired. But the domino effect means Newcastle United can be satisfied with a smooth bit of transfer business themselves that, statistically, looks even shrewder. Daryl Janmaat arriving on Tyneside for £5m after a fine season with Feyenoord and impressive World Cup with Holland is something the Magpies can crow about. VIDEO Scroll down for Newcastle's new signing Janmaat scores a great goal for Feyenoord . New signing: Arsenal unveil defender Mathieu Debuchy after completing deal for former Newcastle defender . Based on a comparison using data analysed by Squawka, Janmaat comes out better than Debuchy in a number of areas. For example, the Dutchman defeats the Frenchman in both total score and defence score for the 2013/14 season. These scores are produced by an advanced algorithm that evaluates the outcome of every recorded on-ball action, such as passing, tackling, and chances created (as detailed by Opta). Janmaat scores 23.38 points overall, compared to Debuchy’s 14.69 points, while defensive scores are 9.87 to 8.99 in favour of the new Newcastle right-back. Janmaat played 2,644 domestic minutes, while Debuchy appeared a similar 2,491 minutes. Moving on: Bacary Sagna left Arsenal at the end of his contract and will be at Manchester City next season . Janmaat completed 38.20 passes per match at 82 per cent success rate, while Debuchy made 25.14 passes with 73 per cent success. Janmaat also had five assists to three. Debuchy shaded tackles per game (2.45 to 2.20) and was a clear winner in interceptions per game (2.38 to 1.47) but committed more fouls (1.41 to 0.83). A quite understandable argument could be made that Debuchy was performing in the Premier League for a team who occasionally struggled, while Janmaat was turning out in the weaker Eredivisie for a side who finished second. Upgrade: New Newcastle signing Daryl Janmaat poses for photo after joining . VIDEO Newcastle fill Debuchy hole with Janmaat . And it is true that when their respective World Cup performances are assessed the numbers are closer and in some cases favour Debuchy. Janmaat remains the better attacking presence with a score of 6.58 points to 4.34 points, however. Strong at the back: Debuchy looked good at the back for France . Impressive tournament: Janmaat played well for Holland in Brazil . It remains to be seen how he adopts to the pace and physicality of the Premier League, and Wenger will know the premium paid for Debuchy is because of his English experience.

Brailsford, the Team Sky boss, felt that Porte was measuring himself against his best form and failing to take into account that he was returning from illness. ‘Dave said, “Relax. We’re behind you, we support you, you have the talent”. Since then I’ve been more professional than I’ve ever been,’ said the Tasmanian. Brailsford, who has won the past two Tours with different riders, Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, is now eyeing a third with Porte, who replaced the injured Froome as leader. ‘It’s easy being a No 2,’ said Brailsford. ‘It’s like being the consigliere in the Mafia. They are brilliant No 2s but can they step up? It is quite a lonely place when you look up and see no one above you.’ Describing Porte as ‘a little terrier’, Brailsford said the 29-year-old is thriving in his new role, adding: ‘When we think about Tassie (Tasmanian) sports stars there is a certain character trait. They are battlers, vocal. You know they will fight to the end. He is one of those.’ A place on the podium beckons but Porte said he believed Vincenzo Nibali, the Italian in the yellow jersey who has a 2min 23sec lead, is beatable and that Froome urged him to believe that. ‘The last thing Chris said to me was, “You can have these guys — believe that”,’ said Porte. ‘Sometimes Chris has more belief in me than I do.’ Another big name dropped out yesterday with Switzerland’s Fabian Cancellara announcing his withdrawal to prepare for September’s Road World Championships in Spain.

Two things if you’re Antony Fowler, England’s brilliant boxing prospect for Commonwealth Games gold who deliberately miss-spells his first name and is fighting to make a claim to his second. For Fowler, it’s a hefty challenge – his cousin was a footballer of some renown for Liverpool. ‘They call Robbie “God” around Liverpool,’ says Fowler. ‘I’m my own man, though. Robbie is Robbie. He made his name being a brilliant footballer. I want to make mine even bigger by being a brilliant boxer.’ He’s made a solid start. He’s the Liverpool middleweight identified by Lee Pullen, one of Britain’s finest coaches, as ‘the complete package’, a workhorse in the gym with the kick of a donkey in his right hand. Glove affair: Antony Fowler will represent England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . God: Antony wants to step out of cousin and former Liverpool striker Robbie's shadow . ‘Not many . amateurs knock people out like Antony,’ Pullen says. Some 46 of his 130 . wins have come early, an excellent ratio in the world of big gloves and . padded heads, and Carl Froch told him he has the makings of a future . world champion. Fowler . has a technician’s touch, a quick mouth and a pragmatist’s mind, a man . who spells his name as ‘Anthony’ on Twitter because ‘that’s how people . will search for it on Google and in boxing you have to be noticed’. That . time could come for the 23-year-old in the next fortnight when he laces . up his gloves at the Glasgow Games. ‘As . a kid I was always in Robbie’s shadow,’ Fowler says. ‘I’d love to one . day be bigger than him. I’m not being disrespectful when I say that . because he was such a big player and he’s my cousin. I see him every few . months and I’m a Liverpool fan. ‘We’re . all proud of him, and his dad, Robert, my uncle, was a huge influence . on me as a young fighter. My uncle gave me the same attitude he gave . Robbie – never think you’re good enough, always try harder.  That’s why I . want to be bigger than Robbie. Never accept being second best.‘I was in his shadow as a kid. 'People . said, “He’s Robbie Fowler’s cousin”, rather than seeing me as my own . person. I used to have “Fowler” on the back of my Liverpool shirt as a . kid, but that was because it’s my name. ‘Like . I say, I have nothing but respect for him, but I’ve done everything . myself. No-one has given me a penny and I’ve never asked for one. It’s . the way I want to do it and my way is working pretty well right now.’ Fate: Antony Fowler started his boxing career after a chance visit to a gym, aged 11 . True Brit: Fowler won bronze at last year¿s world championships and is a two-time, two-weight national champ . Fowler’s . boxing story started 12 years ago when the shy 11-year-old wanted to . understand the fuss stirred up by one of his classmates. ‘I liked athletics and football,’ he says. ‘I was a striker but had two left feet. ‘There . was a lad in my class who was a boxer and he always used to talk about . it. One day, when I was about 11, he said to come down the gym so I did, . just for something to do. ‘I . went down there and he would ask if I wanted a spar. I was quite scared . so I’d just say, “No I’m happy hitting the bag”. Then one day I sparred . him and as soon as I hit him I dropped him. ‘It was probably my third trip to the gym. The other lad had been there six years - he didn’t come back. ‘There . was an old fella at the gym, dead now, God rest his soul, called Jim . Harper. He always used to say, “You’re the best we’ve ever seen”. I . didn’t believe him, but he’d say, “You’ll box for England one day”.’ Hard hitter: 46 of Antony Fowler's 130 career wins have come by way of knockout . High praise: Carl Froch has told Antony Fowler he has the makings of a champion . Fowler . boxed for England within two years. He has since won a bronze medal at . last year’s world championships and is a two-time, two-weight national . champion. His . eyes are fixed on Glasgow and in the back of his mind is the Olympics . in two years, where he hopes to make up for lost time. ‘I should have . gone to 2012 and I would have won a medal,’ he says. ‘I broke my nose just before qualifying and didn’t end up going. Fred Evans went and won silver. ‘I . know I can beat Fred. But that’s in the past. I can’t say what will . happen in the future but I will work harder than anyone in this sport . for my future. ‘When . I sparred with Carl Froch, I took his shots and landed some too. I know . what I can do. I want that gold at the Commonwealths, then I want one . at the Olympics. Then I’ll go to the pros and knock people out. I want a . world title.’ It’s a tall list and a big shadow. These Games will go some way to showing how far Fowler can go in tackling both.

A New Zealand father-of-two who died on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 sent an email to his wife a day prior to his departure telling her that he was 'looking forward' to seeing his children when he returned home. British-born Kiwi Rob Ayley, 29, was preparing to fly home aboard Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 when he sent the email to his wife, Sharlene, telling her to expect his arrival on Saturday if 'we don't talk before hand.' It would be the final contact Mr Ayley would have with his family, including his two sons Seth, 4, and Taylor, 2. He had been away for a month visiting Rottweiler breeders in Europe - a breed of dog he loved. 'I'm just looking forward to seeing the boys and Sharlene. It's been a long, long journey,' he said in an email, the Dominion Post reported. 'We've seen the world's greatest Rottweilers, we have established contacts, and made life-long friends,' the email stated. 'But now I'm just ready to come home. I hope all is well, if we don't talk before hand, I will see you on Saturday.' The family, who had prayed that Mr Ayley had not board the flight, released a statement shortly after learning of his death that described him as 'passionate about life.'

Roger Federer’s parents Lynette and Robert have watched him play 77 matches at Wimbledon — not always from their vantage point yesterday, inside the Royal Box — but his victory over Colombian Santiago Giraldo was as simple as any. World No 35 Giraldo has never been to the third round of a Grand Slam. When his chance came around he found himself staring across the net at the greatest player ever to wield a racquet in an arena where Federer is adored. Balanced: Roger Federer took just 81 minutes to beat Santiago Giraldo . Tennis royalty: Roger Federer's mother Lynette watches him, sat next to Pippa Middleton in the box . The seven-time champion sniffed out his opponent’s nerves and broke him after seven minutes at the first opportunity  — 1hr14mins later he broke him again to seal a 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 victory. Giraldo’s compatriot Alejandro Falla could have supplied a few words of warning if solicited beforehand. Federer has beaten him seven times. Federer has beaten more opponents than anyone playing the game. As he ages and his bones begin to creak he finds new ways to win. He opts to serve and volley with increasing regularity and it is wondrous to watch. A host of sporting celebrities joined Federer’s parents in the Royal Box. Sachin Tendulkar, David Beckham and Matthew Pinsent stood to applaud his greatness as he departed Centre Court, signing the obligatory giant tennis balls on his way. If Federer, at 32, was to become the first man in history to win an eighth Wimbledon title, it would surely be an achievement to match any other in all of sport. Delight: Federer was keen to avoid another early exit from SW19 . Disappointment: Santiago Giraldo failed to trouble Federer on saturday . The Swiss has yet to drop a set this year and has looked as comfortable as any of the big four in making it to the second week. He also overcame the mental obstacle of advancing past the second round, where he suffered a shock exit at the hands of Sergiy Stakhovsky last year. ‘I’m very pleased to get through because I’m aware of the danger of certain players on grass,’ said Federer. ‘I’ve been able to get it done here many times before but not always as we saw last time. ‘I’m maintaining a good level of play, physically I’m in good shape — a few niggling things but nothing that worries me — I’m playing aggressively and serving well.’ In the fourth round, Federer faces Spaniard Tommy Robredo who beat him at the same stage in last year’s US Open.

Mirka gave birth to boys, Leo and Lenny, in May to join their five year old girls, Myla Rose and Charlene Riva. ‘I’ve been kept very busy off the court this week,’ said Federer. ‘But I’m really enjoying myself. It’s nice to have that distraction and spend time with the family. ‘We’ll have a family day and maybe go for a walk somewhere. ‘I am practising in the morning as usual and then we’ll spend the day together.’ He will be back on the grass at SW19 for a 78th bite at the cherry tomorrow.","Parents watch on as seven-time champion dispatches Santiago Giraldo .

Not since the International Olympic Committee banned British cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan, have sporting officials been such party-poopers. For FIFA have ordered Formula One world championship leader Nico Rosberg to remove an image of the World Cup trophy from his helmet. Rosberg tweeted earlier in the week that he was planning to wear the design at this weekend's grand prix at Hockenheim in homage to the victory of the German football team. A piece of harmless fun? No, the serious business of, err, business did not permit such fripperies. New look: Nico Rosberg poses with his updated helmet at Thursday's pre-race press conference . 'FIFA is obliged to take action against any unauthorised reproduction of its intellectual property in a commercial context,' said a FIFA spokesman, augustly. 'If FIFA allowed infringements of its intellectual property, it would risk losing its legal right and title to such works. 'An example of the strength of FIFA's intellectual property assets is reflected by recent research in seven key global markets where the FIFA World Cup trophy recorded an average recognition level of 83 per cent. 'These levels are significantly higher than any other sporting trophies. As a result, we cannot allow a commercially branded helmet to feature the FIFA World Cup trophy as this would jeopardise the rights of our commercial affiliates.' Smiles better: The world championship leader spent much of Thursday posing with his helmet . VIDEO Rosberg signs Mercedes extension . This rebuke prompted Rosberg into a swift redesign that replaced the trophy on top of the helmet with a large gold star. Rosberg, who grew up in Monaco and recently had his bone fides as a German jocularly questioned by Hamilton, watched Germany's World Cup final win against Argentina at his parents' house. Of the helmet controversy, he said: 'The decision was a surprise, but I understand. The big star cannot be taken away. It is ours.' FIFA may be killjoys, but their response is not dissimilar from the one that could be expected of comparable sporting bodies. Indeed, Formula One would have acted just as swiftly had its commercial rights been compromised. Tribute: Schumacher's wife Corinna took out a page of the German Grand Prix programme to thank fans .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nigel Farage today defended himself from claims he is one of Europe’s laziest politicians, insisting he works hard and deserves a lunchtime pint. The UKIP leader hit back after figures revealed his party rarely turns up to votes, committees or debates in Brussels. But Mr Farage said he was not elected to ‘go native’ and there was little point UKIP taking part in European Parliament votes which it stood no chance of winning. Pint: UKIP leader Nigel Farage denied he was lazy but worked 18-hour days and deserved a lunchtime drink . Official figures show UKIP’s 11 MEPs miss a third of all votes, twice the average across Europe. However Mr Farage said his party – which has seen a surge in support in recent months – was not expected to attend more often. He said: ‘My voters did not vote for me to go native.They didn’t vote for me to move to Brussels, they voted for me to campaign to get out of the European Union and that’s what I’m going to go on doing.' And he defended being regularly seen drinking in pubs instead of taking part in debates. Absent: UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall attends just 46 per cent of votes . ‘I’ll tell you something. I work an 18 hour day most days and I think I’m entitled at lunchtime to a pint,' he told ITV’s Daybreak. UKIP is predicted to win the most votes in next year’s European Parliament elections, despite David Cameron’s attempts to bolster Tory support with the promise of an in-out referendum by 2017. Mr Farage said that there was little point in UKIP taking part in votes in Brussels because they were outnumbered by pro-European politicians from across the EU. ‘When I do [vote] normally it will be 500 in favour and 15 against. We are not going to win. ‘We’re not going to stop legislation as UKIP in the European Parliament and the Tories that you talk about that are eurosceptics, yes, they have moved to Brussels. ‘They live in Brussels, they are there five days a week, how many other MEPs can you name? Very few people know their MEPs, that’s because they live in Brussels.’ Among British political parties, the Tories attend 80.4 per cent of votes, Labour 82.7 per cent and the Greens 84.8 per cent, the Daily Mirror said. The Lib Dems are the hardest working UK party in Brussels, attending 87 per cent of votes. Mr Farage is ranked fifth in the league table of MEPs with the worse attendance record, while deputy leader Paul Nuttal is fourth, after voting just 46 per cent of the time. Figures also show UKIP MEPs attend just 30 per cent of European Parliament committees . Mr Nuttall has turned up to only two of 56 meetings of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee since June 2010. Mr Farage attended only just one of 42 Fisheries Committee meetings in the three years to January 2013. He has since resigned. Votes: The Lib Dems are the hardest working British party in the European Parliament, turning up for 87 per cent of votes . Labour MP Grahame Morris said: ‘These figures prove Mr Farage is no Churchill — he's the leader of Europe's laziest party.’ Labour MEP leader Glenis Willmott told the Mirror: ‘They claim to be protecting British interests, but when decisions are made in committees, UKIP are nowhere to be seen. When crucial votes are taken, Nigel Farage leaves the chamber. Where's the British interest in that?’","UK Independence Party's 11 MEPs miss a third of votes in Parliament .

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . The Formula One circus has parked up at the home of the World Cup winners for round 10 of the championship, and you can follow all the action from today's qualifying session at Hockenheim. Host commentator . That's four poles in five grands prix for Rosberg. He waves to the crowd on his way back to the pits. Hamilton will start 15th for tomorrow's race with Esteban Gutierrez serving a penalty for crashing into Pastor Maldonado at the British Grand Prix. German GP Grid: 1 Rosberg; 2 Bottas; 3 Massa; 4 Magnussen; 5 Ricciardo; 6 Vettel; 7 Alonso; 8 Kvyat; 9 Hulkenberg; 10 Perez . The German didn't improve on his time, but it doesn't matter as Bottas only gets to within two tenths. Neverthless, an impressive run from the Williams driver. Massa starts his final run, and he sets a PB in the opening sector, but is still a tenth down on Rosberg. His second sector is strong, too, but the Brazilian is now a couple of tenths slower than the German. He completes his lap with a 1:17.0, and improves on his time but is only third. Vettel goes 4th fastest, but he is one second slower than Rosberg. Magnussen is up next followed by Ricciardo, Alonso, Kvyat, Hulkenberg and Perez. Rosberg lights up the timesheets with a 1:16.540. That's a very strong time from the German. How will the Williams drivers respond? Bottas is through first and he is a mighty seven tenths slower than Rosberg, and what of Massa? He is third, seven tenths off the pace, too. Perez is fighting to keep his Force India in a straight line, and he posts a rather disappointing 1:19.3. Indeed that is his worst of the entire session so far. And it is the Force India of Sergio Perez who is the first driver to take to the track. A dejected Button on traffic in qualifying: 'It doesn't matter. We did not get through and that is the main thing. I had a different balance on the last run, so not great. I have struggled all weekend. It has not been a easy weekend, but hey.' A disappointing day for the Brits then with Button KO'd from Q2. He complained about traffic through Turn 13, but it doesn't look as though the McLaren man was really held up. But he doesn't do it on that run, and it looks as though he will start only 11th for tomorrow's grand prix. How disappointing for the Finn. Raikkonen takes to the track bidding to get into the top-10 shootout, but he needs to find three tenths in the final sector to do it... Rosberg heads the field from Bottas, Vettel, Magnussen, Massa, Alonso, Ricciardo, Kvyat, Button and Hulkenberg. Raikkonen heading out here unless he can improve on his time; he's four tenths slower than Ferrari team-mate Alonso. But what a time that is from Bottas. He goes almost one second quicker than Hulkenberg, but here comes Rosberg and he is some two tenths faster than the Williams man. Seven times posted so far with eight minutes remaining of the session. And home favourite Nico Hulkenberg in his Force India is the first driver to take to the circuit. He posts a 1:18.270. Mercedes have confirmed that Hamilton suffered a right-front brake disc failure. Replays of that Hamilton accident showed him immediately taking his hands off the steering wheel. His inside front locked up, Mercedes rotated and smashed into the tyre barrier at around 160mph. It certainly looked like a brake failure on his Mercedes. Sutil is the big-name casualty in that first session. Hamilton's time was good enough for 12th, but he will start 16th in tomorrow's race. Not what he needed after a hat-trick of disappointing qualifying sessions. Maldonado, Sutil, Gutierrez, Kobayashi and Chilton occupy the bottom six places with three minutes left. And on the supersoft tyres, Rosberg heads to the top of the timesheets after his two earlier errors. The German is over half-a-second quicker than Bottas. The session is back underway and Rosberg is the first to take to the circuit. We've got a little over six minutes left. This is the first time Hamilton hasn't made Q3 since the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix. Hamilton locked his front brakes, but it looked as though something broke on his Mercedes. He certainly seemed a little bit shaken. Rosberg meanwhile, has work to do when the session re-starts. Big crash for Hamilton. He loses the rear end of his Mercedes under braking and crashes into the tyre barrier. The Briton reports he is OK over the team radio, but he heads off in the medical car rubbing his knees. And Rosberg makes another mistake down at Turn 2. The World Championship leader is struggling here. Meanwhile, it is confirmed that Ericsson won't be leaving the garage; a torrid weekend for Catheram. That's a strong lap from the ever-impressive Valtteri Bottas who goes almost half a second faster than Hamilton. Rosberg yet to post a competitive time. Normal order is restored as Lewis Hamilton goes over six tenths quicker than Magnussen. A big lock up for Rosberg, he runs wide, and he is forced to abort his lap. But Austrian Grand Prix pole-sitter Felipe Massa heads to the top of the lap charts before he is usurped by Kevin Magnussen. The Dane posts a time of 1:19.379; only seven lap times posted so far. We have got 12 minutes left. Four minutes of the 18-minute opening session gone, and it is Jenson Button in his McLaren who tops the timesheets at the present time. A quiet start to today's qualifying session so far. And the Marussia of Jules Bianchi is the first driver out on track. Hydraulic failure on Marcus Ericsson's Caterham meanwhile, means it is unlikely he will make it out of the garage. Qualifying has been Hamilton's achilles heel in recent times. He locked up on his final run in Canada, spun in Austria, and aborted his last lap at Silverstone. How will the Briton respond today? * Lewis Hamilton's win in the British Grand Prix was the 27th of his Formula One career, equalling the feat of Sir Jackie Stewart. Nigel Mansell is the most successful Briton with 31 victories. * Hamilton now has 61 podiums to his name (1st: 27; 2nd: 18; 3rd: 16). One more will equal David Coulthard's British record of 62. * Nico Rosberg's run of 17 consecutive results in the points ended at Silverstone, with the German retiring for the first time since the Chinese Grand Prix in April 2013.* Mercedes have won eight of the nine races this season. Only five teams have scored more in a single campaign - Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Benetton and Williams. * Valtteri Bottas is the first Williams driver in nine years to score back-to-back podiums, with Nick Heidfeld the last to achieve the feat in May 2005. You have to go back to 2003, and Juan Pablo Montoya, for three or more in a row. * Ferrari and McLaren have now gone 23 and 28 races without a win respectively. * Up until last year Schumacher had been the only German name to have won the German Grand Prix, with Michael a four-time winner in 1995, 2002, 2004 and 2006, and brother Ralf a victor in 2001. Sebastian Vettel added his name to the German roll of honour last year. * Only three circuits have hosted the German Grand Prix: Hockenheim (33), the Nurburgring (27, including races at the Nordschleife and current GP circuit) and a sole event at Berlin's Avus circuit in 1959. * Ernst Christ, a one-time assistant timekeeper, is credited with the idea of building a circuit in his home town, Hockenheim. With support from the mayor and the local council, the first motorbike race was held at the circuit, then known as the Kurpfalzring, on May 25, 1932. * A major layout revision in 1938 created the fast Hockenheim loop that would remain fundamentally unchanged until the end of 2001. A 62million euro (£52million) rebuild in time for the 2002 race gave the circuit its current form and increased spectator capacity from 83,000 to 120,000. * Ferrari have an impressive German Grand Prix record with a mighty 21 victories, well ahead of nine wins for Williams and eight for McLaren . Germany can boast the reigning World Champion in Sebastian Vettel and in Rosberg the man whom leads the drivers' standings, but the turnout for this weekend's race has been poor. Stark contrast to Silverstone where stands were packed for all three days... The air temperature is 32 degrees, and track temperature is over 50 degrees for today's qualifying session... the hottest of the year so far. Not since the International Olympic Committee banned British cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan, have sporting officials been such party-poopers. I got married to my beautiful girlfriend Vivian in Monaco last week and it was a wonderful experience. I wasn't sure if I would feel anxious about the occasion, but it was such a pleasure. Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna has written a personal note thanking Formula One fans for their support following the seven-time world champion's skiing accident. JONATHAN McEVOY: The two protagonists for the world championship, Hamilton and Rosberg, were more keen to play on their friendship than play up their animosity. But it is Rosberg who holds the psychological edge heading into qualifying after topping the timesheets in this morning's final practice session... and by some margin, too. The German was over six tenths quicker than Hamilton with Fernando Alonso the best of the rest in his Ferrari. Good afternoon, petrol heads and welcome to our live coverage of qualifying for the German Grand Prix. Nico Rosberg arrives at his home race four points ahead of team-mate Lewis Hamilton after suffering his first DNF of the season at Silverstone. But his track record in Germany isn't good; he's never finished on the podium here - his best result was 4th back in 2009. Hamilton in contrast, has been victorious on two occasions, in 2008 and 2011. And he starts this weekend as the bookmakers' favourite to complete a hat-trick of wins in Germany tomorrow.","Hamilton suffered brake failure in opening session and crashed at 165mph .

"By . Amanda Williams . A new study has revealed Japanese women's diets - rich in raw fish and green tea - are helping them to live considerably longer than British women . If you are searching for the key to a long and healthy life, it seems Japanese women may have the answer. A new study has revealed their diets rich in raw fish and green tea are helping them to live considerably longer than British women. Eschewing the Western staples of dairy and bread sees Japanese women live to the ripe old age of 86.4 years on average, much more than British women who live to just 82.7 years. Research by the Office for National statistics found that there could be 'potential for further increases' in life expectancy for women in the UK, if they adopted the lifestyle of their Asian counterparts, The Times reports. The Japanese diet is rich in wholegrains, vegetables and soy - and Japanese women consume around 25 per cent fewer calories than British women. They eat on average three servings of fish a week, with smaller, daintier portions. It is believed that using chopsticks also slows down the eating process, giving the body time to realise what has been consumed, and therefore eat less. According to the league table, Japanese men have an average life expectancy of 79.9 - not too dissimilar to that of British men, who live on average to 78.9. The figures were revealed in an international compendium of data published by the ONS. It compares figures on population, education and economy. It is believed that using chopsticks also slows down the eating process, giving the body time to realise what has been consumed, and therefore eat less . The benefits of green tea have been long extolled  - but new research has also found it can also be good for your mind. Scientists claim green tea enhances several cognitive functions, in particular our working memory. The new findings suggest that green tea could be used to treat dementia and other psychiatric disorders. Experts from the University of Basel, found that green tea extract increases the brain's effective connectivity, noting significant improvements in working memory tasks after people had consumed it.","Eschewing dairy and bread sees Japanese women live to average of 86.4 .

"By . Jenny Hope Medical Correspondent . Risk: Being a 'social' smoker puts you three times more at risk of dying from heart disease, doctors have warned . Being a ‘social’ smoker puts you three times more at risk of dying from heart disease, warn doctors. Just one cigarette a day can triple the risk compared with people who never smoked, says the British Heart Foundation (BHF). They say the research should be a warning to the 1.1million ‘part time’ smokers in the UK who are ‘fooling themselves’ over their health. Researchers found smoking between one and four cigarettes a day significantly increased the rate of heart disease, and deaths from all causes. Lung cancer rates also went up in women who were smoking at least one cigarette a day, says the research commissioned by the charity to mark No Smoking Day next week. Yet only a quarter of part-time smokers are worried about harming their health despite getting through an average 37 cigarettes a week. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the BHF, said Britain’s 1.1million part-time smokers are fooling themselves if they think the health risks don’t apply to them. He said ‘This research shows that many part-time and social smokers are still smoking enough every week to put their lives on the line. We need people to face-up the deadly risk they’re taking from social or part-time smoking. ‘There is no safe level for smoking - the evidence is unequivocal - and I was surprised at the effect. ‘Most of the research has been done on heavier smokers but when you look for the data it’s there.’ The research, carried out by world leading smoking expert Professor Robert West of University College London, is the first to look at the myths surrounding non-daily smoking. Costly: An average part-time smoker spends almost £800 on cigarettes every year . The BHF estimate there are 1.1 million part-time or social smokers in the UK who give a range of excuses for smoking despite not reaching for a cigarette every day. More than one in three believe it’s a stress-buster while almost one in five find it helps them socialise, says the study of 3,525 non-daily smokers. Just one in seven part-time smokers say they feel addicted to cigarettes, compared to more than one in three (38per cent) daily smokers. Stub it out: Those wanting to quit smoking can get free professional advice through the NHS . Despite the increased risk of lung cancer, heart disease and stroke from passive smoking, less than one in six (15per cent) of part-time smokers expressed concern about smoking harming their family. An average part-time smoker spends almost £800 on cigarettes every year. Professor West said: ‘The truth is that everyone who smokes can benefit from stopping - even if they don’t smoke every day. ‘The science of stopping tells us that there is no single method that works for everyone but there are things that will make lasting success more likely. ‘That includes getting free . professional advice from a trained stop-smoking advisor through the . NHS.’ Jenny Hall, 28, a market researcher from London, has been a . part-time smoker since she was 13-years-old. She . said ‘Some weeks I smoke two or three cigarettes a day but I can go . also for a whole week without lighting up at all. I don’t smoke at home . as it tends to be centred mostly on social arrangements. ‘I’ve . never felt like I smoke enough to worry about the impact on my health . and I’ve always told myself that I’ll give up at some point in the . future when I’m pregnant. ‘It . surprised me to hear about the heart health risk as I’ve always linked . smoking to cancer and that’s not something I worry about right now. The . research has definitely made me think twice about how much I smoke.’ Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said ‘Smoking is a . major cause of premature death, with one in two smokers dying . prematurely from smoking related diseases. It is extremely worrying that . people still underestimate the harm it can cause to their health - even . if you are only smoking a few cigarettes a day. ‘The first day without cigarettes is often the hardest, which is why on No Smoking Day we are giving smokers thinking about quitting support and motivation through ‘One Day Quit’, to help them through their first 24 hours smokefree.'

"By . Sean Poulter . Drivers who struggle to reverse into tight spaces need worry no more for Bosch has developed an app that will take over the entire process. The automatic parking system involves installing 12 sensors into a car which scan the road and park up, without any bumps or scrapes. So sophisticated is the technology that the driver can run the parking process from the side of the road using an app on their smartphone. Scroll down for videos . The app that parks your car: Bosch's automatic parking system involves installing 12 sensors into a car which scan the road and park a car directed by an app without any bumps or scrapes . It is thought the system will be particularly useful in Britain and Europe, where parking spaces in supermarkets, offices and public multi-storeys are notoriously tight. The automatic parking assist system was unveiled by German electronics company at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The system is the latest evidence to show that drivers will increasingly become passengers as computers take over the business of getting from A to B. In a separate development, Samsung has unveiled a new app involving its Gear smartwatch, which can communicate with and control some aspects of BMW’s new i3 electric car. Bosch Chairman Werner Struth has said he believes driverless cars will be a reality but they will arrive gradually, with this driver assistance technology marking the first step. Some car manufacturers already offer parking assist, where an on-board computer and sensors take over the process of steering while the driver pushes the brake and accelerator. However, the new Bosch design goes one step further to take over the entire process. Demonstrating the technology, Fred Sejalon, engineering manager at Bosch, said: ‘The vehicle is fitted with 12 ultra-sonic sensors and when the driver wishes to park they just have to enable the system and sensors start scanning the environment. ‘If a suitable parking space is found the driver can either stay in the vehicle or step out and, using their smartphone, let the vehicle do the rest. The system controls vehicle speed and the steering wheel and gear shift.’ The technology, which will be available next year, will also help drivers from wandering out of their lane on the motorway. The system will be pre-installed in new cars by a range of manufacturers, who have not yet been named. In theory, it may also be possible to add it to older cars, providing they have an on-board computer that allows control of the steering and gears. Samsung has unveiled a new app involving its Gear smartwatch (pictured), which can communicate with and control some aspects of BMW's new i3 electric car . Mr Sejalon said: ‘This is good for everybody, especially for parking in a traffic situation or anybody who doesn’t feel comfortable parallel or perpendicular parking, especially when the visibility is limited. ‘There is a lot of hype about autonomous driving and that is a stepping stone in that direction.’ The company is already working on the next advance in the technology, which will allow drivers to drop their car at the entrance of a car park. It will then negotiate its way through the building to find a spare space. This system - dubbed valet parking – would also allow the motorist to retrieve the vehicle by starting it up remotely with a smartphone. Bosch also unveiled technology to brake a car if it detects a pedestrian or an obstacle in the road. The automatic emergency breaking system uses a sensor mounted behind the windscreen to sense dangers in the path of the car, and halt if the driver fails to.

The automatic emergency breaking system uses a sensor mounted behind the windscreen to sense dangers in the path of the car, and halt if the driver fails to brake . Xavier Zhu, a technical manager at Bosch, said: ‘The sensors works in the manner of the human eye.‘There is a camera that sees what the driver sees but can measure the distance of any obstacle, be it pedestrians or obstacles in the road, and can give a signal to the brakes to engage if the driver is not paying attention.’ This technology will come pre-installed in cars and the reaction time can be adjusted according to manufacturer specifications.

Samsung has developed an App that works with its smartphones and the Galaxy Gear smartwatch that can connect to the car’s controls. The smartwatch screen will show the status of the BMW i3’s battery charge and current drivable range, check that the doors are locked and provide alerts about the need for a service. Users can also remotely regulate the temperature of their BMW i3’s interior before getting in the car by using the touchscreen on a Samsung phone or a voice command.","Bosch unveiled its parking app at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . From drinking urine to nose picking, there have long been gruesome-sounding 'remedies' with supposed health benefits. But would you go as far as eating a sausage containing bacteria from baby poo? Spanish researchers believe this could be another way to get 'healthy bacteria' in the body. Bacteria often found in probiotics - Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium - are found in abundance in baby poo, say Spanish researchers . They say that baby stools are an abundant source of probiotics that boost gut health - and that sausages containing it could become a health food. This is because many types of sausages - including pepperoni and salami - are made with the aid of bacterial fermentation, the website LiveScience reports. The bacteria is either naturally occurring in the raw meat or added to the meat in the manufacturing process. More and more evidence is showing that gut bacteria plays a crucial role in our health. Changes to gut bacteria, that result in an imbalance between 'friendly' and 'unfriendly' bacteria, are associated with cancer, diabetes and . inflammatory bowel disease. And earlier this year, researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Ageing, in California, found that  having the right balance of gut bacteria could be the secret to a long life. Probiotics are live bacteria which, when consumed, are thought to colonise the stomach with bugs that help digestion. Their beneficial effects are not wholly proven, although there is increasing evidence they might help with a range of problems, including diarrhoea and food allergies. Scientists cultured this bacteria and used it to ferment the Spanish sausage fuet (file picture). They found this sausage contained enough probiotics to have health-giving benefits . This includes research showing that the bacteria in the gut may 'communicate' with the brain, improving mental health and behaviour in conditions such as anxiety, and possibly even autism and Asperger's syndrome. As a result, the probtiocs industry - which revolves largely around yogurt and supplements - is booming. In an attempt to find other ways to incorporate probiotics into diet, Spanish researchers theroised that probiotic bacteria could also be used in fermented sausages. Live Science contributor Charles Q Choi reports that 'for probiotic bacteria to work, they . must survive the acids in the digestive tract. As such, the researchers . focused on microbes found alive in human faeces'. Probiotics most commonly contain the bacteria Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium - and these are found in high levels in baby poo. More and more evidence is showing that gut bacteria plays a crucial role in our health, from how long we live to our state of mind . So the researchers, led by Anna Jofré, a food . microbiologist at Catalonia's Institute of Food and Agricultural . Research, in Girona, Spain, took stool samples from the nappies of 43 babies aged up to six months old. They then used bacteria cultured from the stools to make type of fermented sausage called 'fuet', which is similar to chorizo. They also made sausages using commercial probiotic strains of bacteria - but the only sausage with enough 'good' microbes to have any beneficial effect on gut health was that made from the baby poo. Even better, the researchers, who findings are reported in the journal Meat Science, say their creations tasted as a traditional fuet would. 'We ate them, and they tasted very good,' Jofré told LiveScience .","Bacteria found in probiotics - Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium - are also found in abundance in baby poo .

"By . Chris Brooke . For many long-haul travellers, it is the nightmare scenario. You are just settling down for a nap or to read when a young child in the row behind starts screaming or kicking the seat, and doesn’t stop. Now a budget airline has come up with a solution for passengers who find their journey spoilt by crying babies and toddlers’ tantrums – by introducing child-free zones. Adults only: The airline has promised soft light and no disruptions in their Quiet Zone, that only allows 12-year-olds and over to sit there (file picture) But selecting a seat in the ‘quiet zone’, which will also have softer lighting, costs up to £22 extra. The idea, which is likely to anger . parents as well as appeal to child-free travellers, is being marketed by . AirAsia’s no-frills long-haul carrier AirAsia X. The first seven rows in the economy . cabin are off-limits to children under 12 on flights from Kuala Lumpur . in Malaysia to Australia, China, Japan and some other destinations. The airline, which uses the slogan . ‘Now everyone can fly’, said the section on its fleet of Airbus A330s, . which is separated from the rest of economy by a set of toilets and a . curtain, now offers a ‘more relaxing cabin atmosphere’. Passengers . booking in this section must pay between £8 and £22 extra. The airline is owned by Malaysian . entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, the owner and chairman of Premiership . football club Queens Park Rangers, who since buying AirAsia in 2001 has . transformed it from a loss-making business into Asia’s largest budget . airline. Promise of peace: The seats, highlighted in blue, promise to be free from children . Air Asia launched the seats last week on flights from Kuala Lumper to Australia, China and Japan . Chief executive Azran Osman-Rani said the idea ‘allows our . guests to have a more pleasant and peaceful journey with minimal noise . and less disturbance.’ He added: ‘The airline is not banning . kids from travelling, but instead, is enhancing the array of product . offerings on board to suit its guests’ individual needs and . preferences.’ There are no immediate signs of UK airlines bringing in a similar system, however. Easyjet said: ‘We don’t have any plans . for anything like this. 'We have just changed over to a system of . fully-allocated seating so customers can choose where they want to sit . and don’t plan any more changes.’ British Airways said: ‘We welcome families in all our cabins and have no plans to offer child-free zones.’ Virgin Atlantic also said it had ‘no plans’ to follow Air Asia’s lead. A poll by the Tripadvisor website last . year found that over a third of Britons would be prepared to pay extra . for their flights if they did not have to sit near children. Another . survey found 53 per cent supported child-free flights. Last year Malaysia Airlines created a child-free zone on the upper deck of the new Airbus A380 on some of its long-haul flights.","Passengers will pay between £8 and £22 for 'Quiet Zone'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . They are a staple at sports games, an American favourite and, many people would argue, a delicious guilty pleasure. But what REALLY goes into a hotdog - and if you saw how it was made, would you be put off for life? These gruesome images show a hotdog production plant - and the various stages of manufacturing aren't pretty. Scroll down for video . Recorded for the How It's Made programme on the Discovery Channel, they show the dregs of pork, beef and chicken being ground together, reduced quite literally to a pulp and then re-formed into a dog. As the programme explains, hotdogs are made from trimmings of meat left over after cutting steaks and pork chips. These are ground in the same way as hamburger meat, pushing the cuts of meat through metal plates so it resembles mince. The processed chicken trimmings - which resemble clay - are then added to the mix, along with salt, starch and flavourings. Once water is sprayed into that vat, the images become even more stomach churning, resembling ice cream or mud. Corn . syrup is added for a touch of sweetness before the mixture is pureed to . a 'fine emulsion,' producing the stomach-churning image below. Air is then vaccumed out of the mix before it is pumped into cellulose casings. Even at this stage, hotdogs are fast food. As the programme explains, it takes just 35 seconds to make enough hotdogs to span a football field twice. In one shift at the factory, a staggering 2.5 million hotdogs will be produced. But the real question - how do they get that more-ish flavour? A liquid 'smoke shower' before they are baked - followed by a good dousing of salty water before they are packaged. Hungry?","Gruesome images show stages of manufacturing at a hotdog factory .

"By . Jason Groves . Anna Soubry said of Ukip supporters: 'Some have prejudices, some are frankly racist, but there are many who just don't know the argument' A senior Tory sparked a fresh row about immigration yesterday after branding some of her own constituents 'racist' for raising concerns about it. Defence minister Anna Soubry, who is tipped for promotion to the Cabinet, said many voters were ignorant about its 'hugely important' benefits – while others were 'frankly racist'. UKIP last night seized on the remarks as evidence that senior Tories still fail to understand public anger over the issue. Miss Soubry's comments came as Chancellor George Osborne suggested David Cameron would fail to keep his pledge to cut net immigration to the 'tens of thousands' because of the difficulty of controlling the numbers arriving from Europe. She added to doubts about whether the target would be hit – but called on the Tory leadership to be more positive about the benefits of immigration, claiming migrants come to Britain 'overwhelmingly to work – they do not come here to scrounge'. Miss Soubry, who is defending a majority of just 389 in her hyper-marginal constituency in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'When you make the case with people who come and see me in my constituency surgery who say, ""I'm really worried about immigration"" you say really, why? 'This is Broxtowe. We don't have a problem with immigrants. When you explain that to them, they get it. Not all of them – some people have prejudices, some people are frankly racist, but there are many who just don't know the argument.' Her comments carry echoes of the row during the last election, when former PM Gordon Brown was forced to apologise to Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy after being caught on a microphone branding her a 'bigoted woman'. UKIP supporters wave to drivers as they wait for leader Nigel Farage to arrive in South Ockenden, Essex, last week . Ms Soubry was forced to apologise to Nigel Farage for an attack on live TV . Anna Soubry’s intervention comes just months after she was forced to apologise to Nigel Farage for an attack on live TV. The former TV presenter said the UKIP leader ‘looks like somebody has put their finger up his bottom and he really rather likes it’ during an appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Miss Soubry, who was selected for David Cameron’s controversial A-list of  candidates before the last election, is no stranger to controversy. While campaigning, she said she was ‘ashamed’ to live in Nottingham because of its high crime rate. Despite this, she seized the marginal seat of Broxtowe, in Nottinghamshire, from Labour with a majority of just 389. Miss Soubry’s no-nonsense style has won admirers in government and  seen her rise swiftly through the ranks. But it has also led to a number of controversies. Following her appointment as a health minister in 2012 she indicated she backed assisted suicide for the terminally ill. And she also hit the headlines for suggesting the poor are more likely to be obese because of an ‘abundance of bad food’ in their homes. UKIP MEP Louise Bours last night called Miss Soubry's remarks 'appallingly arrogant', adding: 'The political establishment has tried to close down debate about immigration for years by branding people racists for raising legitimate concerns. 'Just when you think a genuine, moderate debate about immigration is getting underway a Tory minister starts calling her own constituents racist. UKIP MEP Louise Bours last night called Miss Soubry's remarks 'appallingly arrogant' 'It is such a terrible, superior attitude to say to your own voters that if you don't agree with me, you're a racist.' Labour MP John Mann said Miss Soubry was out of touch with voters' concerns about immigration. The MP for Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, said: 'The vast majority of people in Nottinghamshire who raise concerns about immigration are neither racist nor bigoted. 'Their concern is about jobs, pay and pressure on public services.' Miss Soubry acknowledged concerns about the impact of mass immigration on public services such as schools and hospitals in some parts of the country, but said the problem was overblown. 'There are far fewer immigrants claiming benefit than there are people who have been born and bred in our country. That's the debate we need to have,' she said. Mr Osborne yesterday appeared to admit defeat on Mr Cameron's pre-election pledge to cut net immigration to less than 100,000 by next year. He said the 'ambition' remained in place, but suggested it could only be achieved by negotiating a deal to curb EU immigration after the next election. Meanwhile, former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said the party was likely to block Tory proposals for tightening immigration rules – thought to include restrictions on employing cheaper foreign workers and provision to deport jobless Europeans after six months.","Defence minister Anna Soubry said voters were 'ignorant' about immigration .

"By . Sophie Borland . The research showed that women who did night shifts for less than 30 years were no more at risk of breast cancer than anyone else . Women who work night shifts for 30 years are twice as likely to get breast cancer, scientists claimed yesterday. The researchers believe artificial lighting at night interferes with chemicals in the body, and this process can trigger the growth of tumours. The Canadian team studied the careers of 1,134 women with breast cancer and compared them with 1,179 who had never been diagnosed with the illness. Around a third of the women had done . night shifts at some point during their lives working in roles such as . nursing, flight crew, hotel receptionists and in hotels. The . academics then divided all the women into three groups depending on how . many years they had worked nights – up to 14, 15 to 29 and 30 or more. The . findings, published on the British Medical Journal’s website, showed . that women who did night shifts for less than 30 years were no more at . risk of breast cancer than anyone else. But if they did them for more than 30 years they were twice as likely to develop the disease. Although . many people work under strip lighting at all hours of the day, the . scientists think it is only artificial light at night that triggers . cancer growth because it upsets the body’s natural sleep cycles and . hormone rhythms. They think artificial lighting suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that can prevent cancer. This then leads to over-production of the hormone oestrogen, which is known to trigger cancer. A number of previous studies have linked shift work to breast cancer. But many were carried out on nurses, leaving researchers unsure as to whether only hospital workers were susceptible or if women in other jobs were also at risk. But this study suggests that the risk of developing breast cancer has more to do with the number of years on night shifts rather than the type of job itself. The Canadian researchers said being exposed to artificial lights on night shifts triggers cancer growth because it upsets the body's natural sleep cycles and hormone rhythms . Co-author Dr Kristan Aronson, of Queen’s . University, Kingston, Ontario, said further work was needed to . understand exactly what in night shifts is triggering the cancer. Once this is known, offices, hospitals and other workplaces could be adapted to help reduce the risk to women. The report states: ‘As shift work is necessary for many occupations, understanding which specific shift patterns increase breast cancer risk, and how night shift work influences the pathway to breast cancer, is needed for the development of healthy workplace policy.’ In 2009, 37 Danish women were compensated by their government after developing breast cancer on night shifts. Denmark is the only country in the world where breast cancer resulting from shift work is recognised as an industrial injury. In Denmark, women have been compensated by their government after developing breast cancer on night shifts . Lawyers say it would be difficult for women here to pursue similar claims and they would have to prove their employer had failed to protect them. Despite the evidence, many academics remain unconvinced that night shifts cause breast cancer. Dr Jane Green, an expert in the study of diseases at the University of Oxford, said: ‘The finding of an increased risk of breast cancer in women with a long history of shift work adds to similar results from some previous studies, but does not change the existing consensus. ‘While there is some evidence to associate increased risk of breast cancer with very long-term shift work, the evidence is not yet sufficient to be sure and certainly not sufficient to give a public health message about working shifts.’","Artificial light interferes with body's chemicals and can trigger tumours .

"By . Chris Pleasance . South Korean troops have exchanged fire with a runaway soldier who was surrounded in a forest after he killed five comrades and wounded three others near his North Korea border outpost. One platoon leader was wounded when the . sergeant, identified only by his surname Yim, threw a grenade and shot at closing in on him. Now officers have brought in the man's parents to persuade him to surrender, a defence official said. A Defence Ministry spokesman said the 22-year-old sergeant, identified only by his surname Yim, shot himself in the side of his abdomen but failed to kill himself . A platoon leader was wounded trying to approach the man, named only as Yim, after he threw grenades . Troops had surrounded Yim in a forest about four miles from the border outpost and threw him a mobile phone so he could talk to his father . Villagers . in a nearby area were warned not to leave their houses. The village . head, Jang Seok-kwon, said that he heard gunshots ring out about 10 . times on Sunday. Defense official Kim Min-seok said Sunday . at a televised briefing that all the wounded were expected to survive, . although two were injured seriously. Yim, who was scheduled to be discharged . from the military in September, fired at fellow soldiers with his . standard-issue K2 assault rifle before fleeing with the weapon. A Defense Ministry spokesman said it wasn't clear how much ammunition Yim had. Park Cheol-yong, the head of Madal village, near the army division where the gunfire took place, said he warned villagers to stay in their houses. Park Jin-soo, a pastor at a church in the village, said that Sunday services would take place as usual despite the tension over the missing soldier and the shooting. It was not clear what triggered the rampage and there was no indication that North Korea, South Korea's bitter rival, was involved . Yim's parents also used a loudspeaker to try to persuade him to surrender . Residents from the local village had been told to stay in their houses while soldiers tried to talk to Yim . Thousands of troops from the rival Koreas are squared off along the world's most heavily armed border. There was no indication that North Korea was involved. But tensions between the two countries have been high recently, with North Korea staging a series of missile and artillery drills and threatening South Korea's leader. The Koreas have also traded fire along their disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea. South Korea has repeatedly vowed to respond with strength if provoked by the North. Shootings have happened along the border before. In 2011, a 19-year-old marine corporal went on a shooting rampage at a Gwanghwa Island base, just south of the maritime border with North Korea. Military investigators later said that corporal was angry about being shunned and slighted and showed signs of mental illness before the shooting. In 2005, a soldier tossed a hand grenade and opened fire at a front-line army unit in a rampage that killed eight colleagues and injured several others. Yim was due to complete his nearly two years of mandatory military service in September, according to defence officials . Initial personality tests last April put him within a group of soldiers who needed special attention and were unfit for frontline duty, a Defence Ministry official said . A Defence Ministry spokesman said two of the wounded were in a serious condition, but added that all three were expected to survive (pictured, soldiers from Yim's outpost) Pfc. Kim Dong-min told investigators he was enraged at superiors who verbally abused him. All able-bodied South Korean men must serve about two years in the military under a conscription system aimed at countering aggression from North Korea. The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war as the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. soldiers are stationed in South Korea as a deterrent against North Korean aggression.","Solider, identified only as Yim, went on shooting spree late last night .

"By . Nina Golgowski . A Georgia mother says it was a pair of 9 and 10-year-old neighborhood boys who ran to her rescue and instructed her how to perform CPR on her two-month-old son after hearing her desperate cries for help. When Susanna Rohm’s son Isaiah abruptly stopped breathing on Monday afternoon she was sitting home alone and in her panic lost her cell phone, and as she immediately felt, any chance of calling 911. 'I was sitting in the living room with the baby and I noticed that he was off that day. He seemed kind of non-responsive to my smile. Something didn't feel right. At that point I put my finger under his nose and realized he was not breathing,' she told 11alive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heroes: Rocky Hurt, 9, and Ethan Wilson, 10, were playing football outside their Georgia home on Monday when they heard Susanna Rohm's desperate cries for help . Panic: Mrs Rohm, seen holding her two-month-old son, realized her baby had stopped breathing and in her panic lost her cell phone to call 911 herself . Not having a land line she carried her baby outside while screaming for anyone to call 911. Across the street in Marietta was 9-year-old Rocky Hurt and 10-year-old Ethan Wilson tossing a football. Though the woman’s cry initially scared the boys, they obeyed before going one more step further. 'I said even if it's a burglar we still need to help because it's the right thing to do,' recalled Rocky. As Ethan called police and waited on the ambulance outside, Mrs Rohm said Rocky raced inside to her, a boy she had never met before, and realizing what was wrong directed her on what to do. Instructors: The two boys say they not only called 911 for the woman but rushed over to instruct her on how to deliver CPR to the infant after seeing a how-to poster at school . 'I told her to push on the baby's chest five to 10 times with only two fingers, tilt back the baby's head, plug the baby's nose and breathe into the baby's mouth,' said Rocky. 'He said it so confidently that I just listened to him right away,' the mother said. Seconds later, the baby started streaming. 'He screamed but I told her that that's a good sign because the baby's breathing,' Rocky said. An ambulance arrived moments later with Ethan guiding them in. Recognition: After a few seconds the baby began breathing again, saving its life according to the mother but deserving no more than a thanks according to the boys . 'If the little boy hadn't shown me how to do the compressions right here ... my baby would not be alive right now,' she told Fox News Atlanta. 'And I am incredibly grateful.' The boys say they learned CPR after memorizing the steps seen on a poster hung in their elementary school's cafeteria. 'We just wanted to know if case it happened, but we never knew we'd have to do that,' said Ethan. 'We didn't care if we were on the news,' said Rocky. 'We just cared about saving the baby.' Mrs Rohm says Isaiah later spent two nights in a hospital while diagnosed with sleep apnea.

"By . Jason Groves . Ed Miliband is making 'unforced errors' that are leaving Labour 'in difficulty', a senior MP warned last night. Tom Watson, who was Labour's deputy chairman until last year, said Mr Miliband's controversial decision to pose for pictures holding a copy of the Sun newspaper last week was a 'serious mistake' that had damaged the party, particularly on Merseyside. He hit out at the Labour leaders aides, saying that members of the Shadow cabinet were 'worried' about the performance of the team paid to advise him, following a series of recent errors, such as failing to identify the Labour leader while campaigning in the town, and having embarrassing photographs taken while trying to eat a bacon sandwich. Tom Watson MP has said Labour leader Ed Miliband is making 'unforced errors' that are leaving the party 'in difficulty' Mr Miliband, who boasted of standing up to Rupert Murdoch during the phone-hacking scandal, attempted to mend fences with the media mogul in the run-up to the next election by posing with a World Cup souvenir edition of the Sun newspaper. He was forced to apologise for the decision less than 24 hours later following a ferocious backlash from his own MPs, shadow ministers and activists, and the resignation of a councillor in Liverpool where many people still boycott the newspaper in protest at its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott also criticised the decision – and said Mr Miliband should take responsibility for it himself. He told Sky News: 'I wouldn't do it, right, but the leader has to make a judgement about many things. His judgement was, on balance, to do what he did. No doubt advisers give advice, but you can't keep blaming advisers. Labour leader Ed Miliband eats a bacon sandwich at New Covent Garden flower market in London . 'At the end of the day, the leader must make a judgement, and he'll be judged on his judgements. I wouldn't have done it.' But Mr Watson said Mr Miliband's media advisers were making 'elementary blunders' and should be sacked unless they can 'lift their game'. He told BBC Radio Five's Pienaar's Politics show that the Labour leader was 'very badly advised' to pose for the Sun picture. 'It was his ultimate responsibility to do it but I just cannot believe that the paper ended up his office and someone ended up taking a photograph of him and it ended up of the internet,' he said. 'The people around Ed, you know, they're not Civil Servants. They are very powerful political people. They carry a lot of power in the Labour Party. 'A lot of Labour Party members raise funds to pay their very good salaries. And to make such elementary blunders like this - in the week that the Hillsborough inquests were taking place - I think is a problem and I'm sure there will be a lot of Shadow Cabinet members who are sort of holding their counsel on this but they are worried about the way Ed's office operates. 'They've either got to sort of lift their games or move on and get people who can do the job, in my view.'","Tom Watson said holding a copy of the Sun was a .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Reuters Reporter . A study out Monday says that 47 percent of newborns have flat spots on their heads. Called positional plagiocephaly, the frequency of the position has quickly increased just as another more dangerous problem in babies, sudden infant death syndrome, has decreased. A Canadian study released today from Pediatrics indicates that reducing SIDS may come with the cost of flattened spots on a baby's head. Plagiocephaly: On the left, a child with flat head syndrome. The condition is now seen in some form in 47 percent of babies, a study has found. The picture on the left shows a child post treatment . The bones of newborns are soft and if . they tend to lie in the same position all the time, the bones can . flatten in the skull on whatever side is most frequently in contact with . surfaces. A 1992 guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics urged parents to keep their newborns on their backs to prevent SIDS. Since then, the unforeseen and mysterious child deaths have decreased by 50 percent. Meanwhile, the flat spots have been on the rise. Before and after treatment: Guidelines urging parents to lay babies on their backs to prevent SIDS may have increased likelihood of flat spots . Common: The results surprised researchers because previous studies had found far few instances of the malformation . According to the study out of Calgary’s Mount Royal University, nearly half of 440 babies studied between 7 to 12 weeks of age had the condition. 'That was pretty surprising. I didn't anticipate that it would be that high,' the study's lead author Aliyah Mawji, an assistant professor of nursing, told the Canadian Broadcasting Company. Of the babies found to exhibit flat head syndrome, the study found that 78 percent had a mild form, while 19 percent of cases were classified as moderate and the remaining 3 percent were severe. Well over half of cases of plagiocephaly--63 percent--occurred on the right side of the head. Expensive: To treat flat head syndrome, some parents turn to head bands like the DOC band, which can cost upwards of $3,000 . Although not thought to be medically dangerous, the flattened head shape can become permanent, researchers said - which can have psychological implications for kids as they grow up. 'This is super common,' said Dr. Lisa Stellwagen, a neonatologist from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, who has also studied the condition . 'With the Back To Sleep (SIDS campaign) and the overuse of car seats, and people not holding their babies like they used to, we've sort of rediscovered this problem with infants' head shapes,' Stellwagen, who wasn't involved in the new study, told Reuters Health. That campaign was 'enormously successful,' Stellwagen said - and the new findings do not mean parents should stop following that advice. Once of prevention: Experts still warn parents to always keep babies on their backs while sleeping but now suggest holding the baby more to prevent plagiocephaly . But there are steps they can take - such as holding their baby as often as possible and having 'tummy time' when the baby is awake and supervised - to limit skull deformations, she added. Prior studies suggested that anywhere from 3 percent to 61 percent of babies have a flat spot on their head, Mawji and her colleagues noted. Some research has tied plagiocephaly to delayed crawling or rolling over, but babies tend to catch up by 18 months, Mawji said - so it's the potential for being bullied as a child that's more of a concern. She said the deformation can be corrected with a helmet - but those typically cost $1,000 to $3,000, so they should only be a 'last resort.' Babies should always sleep on their backs, but increased supervised 'tummy time' is a suggested prevention for flat head syndrome . For young babies, treatment for a flat spot looks a lot like prevention, researchers said. 'You want to vary the side of the head that you're putting your infant to sleep on,' Mawji told Reuters Health. 'If their head automatically turns to the right … what you need to do the next night is turn their head to the left.' Like Stellwagen, Mawji recommended parents keep their baby out of a car seat when they're not driving. She also said they should alternate the hand they hold the baby in while feeding. Parents might not notice a small head deformation because they get used to how their baby looks, Stellwagen said, so it's important for doctors to take a close look at the skull at early well-child visits.","Plagiocephaly, or flat spots on the head, are now found in nearly half of infants .

"By . Sean Poulter . Only seven per cent of Britons would pay more than a tenner for wine - and women are more frugal than men . Most Britons refuse to pay more than £6 for a bottle of wine while only one in three can name a single grape variety, it is claimed. The shift to cheap plonk has brought claims that Britain, which imports more wine than any other nation, is effectively dumbing down as a wine nation. Some 80 per cent of all wine sold in the UK sells for less than £6, which leaves very little profit for the producers once tax – at 60 per cent - and shipping is taken out of the equation. Today, just 7 per cent of us are prepared to part with more than £10 for a bottle of wine, according to research by drinks specialist Harpers. The research found that a third cannot name a single grape type and only four per cent can name more than 10. Overall, women were far less knowledgeable than men. It might be assumed that the reason most people opt for cheap wine is a result of a five year cost of living squeeze, coupled with confusion and ignorance about what tastes good. However, there is some research to suggest that a nation raised on big brands like Jacobs Creek, Blue Nun and Piat D’Or genuinely prefer the taste of cheaper wines rather than exclusive expensive vintages. A study found that eight in ten people in blind taste tests preferred a bottle of wine costing £4.99 over a £19.99 option which was made from the same grapes. Six in ten thought the £4.99 version was just so delicious that it must be the more expensive of the two, according to research by the London Wine Academy. Data was gathered from 20,000 enthusiasts attending courses with the Academy over the last 20 years. On average, 80per cent preferred the taste of cheaper, commercial Aspen Chardonnay from South East Australia, which costs some £4.99 from Majestic Wine. They put it ahead of the more expensive, small-volume Gerard Thomas St. Aubin 1er Cru from Burgundy, France, which is £19.99 at Waitrose and Majestic. Two thirds of us cannot name a single grape variety and 80 per cent of wine sold goes for under £6 . The academy said the amateur’s perception of a good wine is based on the notion of ‘smoothness’. As a result, it says it is hardly surprising that most prefer cheaper wine from warm climates which are soft, due to lower acidity, round, due to higher alcohol, and display simple, pure-fruit characteristics. Getting young consumers to understand the nuances of wine flavours is the industry’s biggest challenge, according to the Harpers researchers. More than half of the 18- to 24-year-olds interviewed in its survey said they normally only buy wine if it is on promotion. Jeremy Rockett, marketing director at Spanish-owned distributor Gonzalez Byass, believes many are simply confused by wine and the way it is sold. ‘You go into a supermarket and there’s a wall of products that all look broadly the same,’ he said. Sainsbury's, Asda and Tesco are the most popular among wine-buyers, thanks to the special offers . ‘There are 900 glass bottles of similar size and shape, but different countries, different grape types – many you’ve never heard of – all with different prices . Where do you start as a young person? It’s really, really hard.’ James Burston, business development director at PLB – Britain’s largest independently owned wine distributor, said the industry needs to make wine less intimidating. He said: ‘The UK wine market is going through a period of seismic change. There will be casualties, and there may well be consolidation and collaboration.’ Mr Burston said cider had managed to change its image and generate a surge in sales by adopting more modern packaging and marketing, such as suggesting it is served over ice. ‘Cider became more accessible and suddenly the whole category exploded back into life, from entry level through to premium and niche,’ he said.","80 per cent of all wine sold in the UK sells for less than £6 .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Smart phones are more sophisticated than ever, yet the batteries that power them have remained relatively archaic – until now. Scientists at the University of Illinois have managed to develop the most powerful microbatteries ever created, making them almost 1000 times stronger than existing lithium batteries and paving the way for smartphones that could be charged in just one second. ‘This is a whole new way to think about batteries,’ said lead researcher William King. Superpower: The next generation of microbatteries developed by the University of Illinois (pictured) could revolutionise mobile phone use . The new batteries owe their high performance to their internal three-dimensional microstructure. Like all batteries, they have two key components the anode (minus side) and cathode (plus side). Building on a novel fast-charging cathode design, scientists have developed a matching anode and then developed a new way to integrate the two components at the microscale to make a complete battery with superior performance. With so much power, the batteries could enable sensors or radio signals that broadcast 30 times farther, or devices 30 times smaller. The batteries are rechargeable and can charge 1,000 times faster than competing technologies. In theory a credit-card-thin phone could be charged in less than a second. 'A battery can deliver far more power than anybody ever thought', he said. 'In recent decades, electronics have gotten small. 'The thinking parts of computers have gotten small. 'And the battery has lagged far behind. 'This is a microtechnology that could change all of that. 'Now the power source is as high-performance as the rest of it.’ Until recently, users have had to choose between power and energy. For applications that need a lot of power, like broadcasting a radio signal over a long distance, capacitors can release energy very quickly but can only store a small amount. For applications that need a lot of energy, like playing a radio for a long time, fuel cells and batteries can hold a lot of energy but they take a long term to recharge. ‘There’s [always been] a sacrifice,’ said James Pikul, a graduate student and first author of the paper. ‘If you want high energy you can’t get high power; if you want high power it’s very difficult to get high energy. 'But for very interesting applications, especially modern applications, you really need both. 'That’s what our batteries are starting to do. ‘We’re really pushing into an area in the energy storage design space that is not currently available with technologies today.’ Daily routine: Because of their poor battery power, modern mobiles regularly need recharging . The new microbatteries offer both power and energy, and by tweaking the structure slightly, the researchers can fine tune them so there is a better compromise between power and energy scale. Scientists sat they owe their high performance to their internal three-dimensional microstructure. Like all batteries, they have two key components, the anode (minus side) and cathode (plus side). Mobile phone batteries are a frequent cause for anger because of their relatively short battery life . Building on a new fast-charging cathode design by Professor Paul Braun’s group, King and Pikul have developed a matching anode and a new way to integrate the two components at the microscale to make a complete battery with superior performance. With so much power, the batteries could enable sensors or radio signals to broadcast 30 times farther, or devices 30 times smaller. The batteries are rechargeable and can charge 1,000 times faster than competing technologies. In theory, a credit-card-thin phone could be charged in less than a second. In addition to consumer electronics, medical devices, lasers, sensors and other applications could see leaps forward in technology with such power sources available. ‘Any kind of electronic device is limited by the size of the battery – until now,’ King said. 'Consider personal medical devices and implants, where the battery is an enormous brick, and it’s connected to itty-bitty electronics and tiny wires. Now the battery is also tiny.’ The researchers are now looking into integrating their batteries with other electronics components, as well as the manufacturability of them at a low cost. ‘We can now think outside of the box,’ Pikul said. ‘It’s a new enabling technology. It’s not a progressive improvement over previous technologies; it breaks the normal paradigms of energy sources. 'It’s allowing us to do different, new things.’","Batteries have lagged behind mobile phone technology - until now .

"By . Jason Groves . David Cameron has ordered Tory fundraisers to build a £30 million election warchest to keep Ed Miliband out of power. Tory chiefs have been told they need to raise £100,000 a day between now and the election to pay for what is set to be the most expensive campaign for years. Insiders say the demanding target is being achieved as entrepreneurs alarmed by Ed Miliband’s anti-business rhetoric reach for their chequebooks. David Cameron has ordered Tory fundraisers to build a £30million election warchest to keep Ed Miliband out of power. It means Tory chiefs will need to raise £100,000 a day between now and the election . A senior Tory source said: ‘We’ve been told we need to raise £100,000 every day – including weekends. It’s a huge target but we’re confident we can hit it. ‘Our message to our donors is quite simple - don’t risk letting Labour back in. ‘We tell them to think of their donation as an insurance policy against Ed Miliband becoming Prime Minister.’ The source said Labour would ‘never raise this amount from the unions – or anyone else’. Election spending for each party is capped at about £20 million in the year running up to the general election. In the last campaign the Conservatives spent £16.7 million – around £3 million short of the limit. Insiders say entrepreneurs alarmed by Ed Miliband's anti-business rhetoric are reaching for their chequebooks . The new target shows the Tories are determined to max out their spending this time. But it also suggests they may want to pay off their £2 million debts and start amassing funds to pay for a potential snap election if next May’s vote results in another hung parliament. The first signs of the new Tory drive came in official figures for party fundraising in the first quarter of this year. The Conservatives raised £6.6 million in this period, compared to £4.4 million for Labour, £1 million for the Liberal Democrats and just under £500,000 for Ukip. The Tory effort comes as Labour faces a funding crisis. The party is already more than £12 million in debt and is unlikely to be able to rely on soft loans from the beleaguered Co-op Bank to keep it afloat. The GMB union has said it will cut £1 million from its automatic affiliation fees following Ed Miliband’s decision to reform Labour’s links with the unions. Affiliation fees are also likely to fall from the other main unions, including Unite, which bankrolls the party. The shortfall will force Mr Miliband to go cap-in-hand to union barons, such as Unite’s Len McCluskey, in the hope of getting top-up donations from their political funds. Mr Miliband’s anti-business rhetoric has seen donations from entrepreneurs all but dry up compared to the New Labour years. Union donations now account for around £80 per cent of Labour’s total.","PM has ordered Tory fundraisers to build £30million election warchest .

A final dress rehearsal for the opening ceremony allowed some 10,000 performers to fine-tune their spectacular routines in front of a full house at the Olympic Stadium last night. But it also gave the spectators some essential training in how to cope with another breath-taking aspect of the Games - the queues. With less than two days to go until the London Olympics are officially opened by Danny Boyle's extravaganza, it seems fans are going to have plenty of time to chat about it afterwards.

A fire alert at Canary Wharf station . on the Jubilee Line during the rush hour caused the evacuation of one of . London's busiest Underground stations. Meanwhile, cable theft caused misery to rail commuters both north and south of the Capital. The Central Line will be a crucial link between the West End of London and the Olympic Park in Stratford .

The actual opening ceremony which will officially open the Games is on Friday evening . But in the main the contents of the three hour multi-million pound extravaganza is still a complete mystery. This was despite some spoilsports trying to post footage of the ceremony rehearsals on YouTube last night. Two videos - one entitled 'Olympic 2012 opening . ceremony snapshot from rehearsal' and the other 'Olympic Opening . Ceremony Rehearsal' - were taken down on copyright grounds by the International Olympic Committee. One aspect of the ceremony that is . most definitely still a secret is who will light the Olympic cauldron. The latest rumour is that David Beckham will light it with a flaming . football. The football star, 37, wasn't giving . anything away yesterday however. He said: 'I'm playing a small part in . the opening ceremony, which I am excited about. 'I'd love to tell you the details but I can't. It's exciting, it's going to be good. 'I am honoured to be involved because, obviously, I was involved in the start process with this seven years ago.' Much sought after: Beckham flies back to London to urge Prime Minister David Cameron to help tackle malnutrition against young children all over the world . Just hours earlier, Beckham was in action for an MLS All-Stars team against Chelsea in a pre-season friendly in Chester, Pennsylvania . Though one bookmaker today stopped taking bets on Sir Roger Bannister to be chosen for the honour after a flurry of interest. William Hill said that 98 per cent of bets in this market today were on the running legend - who was the first to run a mile in under four minutes in 1954 - and his odds were cut from 6/1 to evens. A spokesman for the bookmakers said: 'Just a week ago we were 33/1 for Sir Roger; although he was an amazing sportsman we felt that his connection was not Olympic enough. 'If he does win, an awful lot of punters will be running, perhaps not four minute miles, down to their betting shops to pick up their winnings.'

LOCOG chief executive Paul Deighton wasn't giving the game away either, but he said the choice was 'easy'. Mr . Deighton, who sat on the panel which made the selection, told BBC Radio . 4’s Today programme: 'It was surprising how we reached unanimity pretty . quickly. 'I think when everyone sees our choice last night they will understand why we made it.' Tickets are still available for the opening ceremony - but only for those with deep pockets. Category AA seats are on offer for £2,012 with a limited number of Category A tickets available for £1,600, on the official ticket website. LOCOG also admitted that spectators who bought £995 tickets after July 17 are not guaranteed a clear view of all the ceremony.

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton was left to rue the one that got away after falling further adrift of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in this season's Formula One title scrap. A blistering start and stunning first lap in the Austrian Grand Prix only made Hamilton further regret what transpired during qualifying. Mistakes in the final session resulted in Hamilton failing to set a time and starting from ninth on the grid at the Red Bull Ring. Team game: Lewis Hamilton is 29 points adrift of Nico Rosberg after finishing behind his team-mate in Austria . Winners: Mercedes celebrated their sixth one-two finish of the campaign at the Austrian Grand Prix . Come the end of lap one Hamilton had made up five places and had the leading trio of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, along with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in his sights. When the chequered flag dropped 70 laps later, clever strategy from Mercedes had allowed Rosberg and Hamilton to claim a sixth one-two in eight races this year, with Bottas third ahead of Massa. Hamilton, though, is now 29 points adrift of Rosberg heading into his home race of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in a fortnight. 'I got one of the best starts I've ever had really and positioned the car in the correct places,' said Hamilton. Thumbs up: Hamilton has vowed to bounce back at the British Grand Prix in a fortnight's time . 'It would have been great if I'd started where perhaps I should have started this weekend, so after what happened in qualifying it was all about damage limitation for me. 'I'm as happy as I can be with a P2 finish. I had the pace in the car all weekend, but I wasn't able to capitalise on that so second place from a bad weekend is pretty good. 'The strategy worked really well for me to get into second position, then I tried to start pushing Nico, but he didn't make any mistakes and I didn't have the chance to overtake. 'To get another one-two, though, is just incredible.' With the British Grand Prix on the horizon, a race Hamilton has not won since 2008, the 29-year-old said: 'Next race is in Silverstone and all the positive energy from my home fans that goes with that. 'It will be a special time, and I'll be going all out for the win.' Shake on it: Hamilton congratulates Rosberg on his third win of the campaign on Sunday . For Rosberg, in extending his advantage over Hamilton, his third win this season and sixth of his career was mission accomplished. 'Twenty-nine points is a nice gap, but it's still so early in the season,' said Rosberg. 'I really like to concentrate on each weekend, taking it step by step and every weekend my aim is to extend the championship lead, which I managed to do this weekend.' Behind the leading quartet Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was fifth ahead of Force India's Sergio Perez, McLaren's Kevin Magnussen and Daniel Ricciardo in his Red Bull. As for Ricciardo's team-mate Sebastian Vettel, the reigning quadruple champion was forced to retire for the third time this season, as many as in the previous three years combined. Jenson Button could only manage 11th for McLaren, whilst Marussia's Max Chilton was 17th.

"By . Ryan Gorman . neglectful nanny: Police say Kristen Jones left two young children locked inside a car on a hot day with the windows up . An Oregon nanny locked a two-month-old girl and a three-year-old boy in a car on a 90-degree day while she went tanning, authorities said. Police arrested Kristin Jones, 23, of Portland, when concerned people called 911 last month after seeing the children inside the car drenched in sweat and crying for help. The windows were left closed, officials said. Jones initially tried to claim the children’s mother was in the van with them, but eventually recanted her tale and said she lied out of fear, according to KOIN. The neglectful nanny pleaded not guilty Friday to multiple charges. A witness who called 911 directed police to the suffering children when he arrived May 15 at 2.41 p.m., according to court documents reviewed by the station. The nanny walked out of Sunblaze Tanning just as the officer was able to remove one of the children from the sweltering vehicle, police said. The boy was ‘soaked in sweat’ and ‘the officer felt the heat radiating from (the child) through his bulletproof vest,’ authorities said. She removed the young girl and everyone involved headed back into the tanning salon where she was soon arrested. Her neighbors were shocked at the allegations. Busy day: Jones is said to have gone tanning at this Portland salon while the children nearly baked to death inside the vehicle . Arraignment: Jones pleaded not guilty Friday to several charges brought against her for the callous crimes . ‘That’s bad, it just shows you don’t care,’ said Randy Haynes. ‘That’s very selfish… you don’t leave kids in the car. They’re not animals, you don’t leave animals in the car either.’ ‘That is somebody’s kid, why would you leave somebody in a car?’ Asked Sheila Drubecq. 'I can’t believe that happened.’ The case eerily echoes that of a Georgia father whose toddler son was found dead while locked inside a car with the windows up on a 91-degree day. Authorities have not yet determined if that incident was an accident or if murder charges will be brought against the man. Jones was arraigned Friday on two counts each of first-degree criminal mistreatment, recklessly endangering another, and first-degree child neglect. She was also handed one charge of driving on a suspended license. The accused abuser is due back in court August 15.","Kristin Jones is accused of locking the children in the vehicle last month while she went to a tanning salon .

"By . Nick Pisa . This is Laghat, a nine-year-old Italian racehorse who has won an incredible 19 times - despite being blind. Laghat, whose name means 'kick', was born with a fungal infection in both his eyes which left him virtually unable to see. But he has stunned his jockey owner and punters by overcoming the disability to win nearly 100,000 euros in prize money. 'Sixth sense': Blind racehorse Laghat, who has won 19 races and nearly 100,000 euros in prize money, with his jockey owner Federico De Paola . Born natural: Despite his blindness, Laghat somehow manages to steer clear of his competitors and picks up speed as he nears the finishing line . His success has won him an army of admirers on Facebook since his winning streak became widely known. Based in San Rossore near Pisa, where former prime minister Tony Blair used to go on his holidays. Laghat is owned and trained by jockey Federico De Paola and shares his stable with a fellow horse jokingly described as 'his girlfriend'. His owner has no idea how he manages to steer clear of other horses when he competes and even kicks in with an extra burst off speed as he nears the finishing line. Connection: Federico says he and Laghat are very close and almost share their own language . Federico said today: 'It's amazing. I really don't know how he does it. He had a fungal infection in his eyes when he was born and it has left him virtually blind. He can make out shadows but that's about it. 'I only entered him for the races because I thought it would be some exercise for him, but I was amazed when he won and he has kept on winning. 'He has won 19 races and some of them have been important ones - in one race he won the 25,000-euro top prize. 'He has a sixth sense which tells him . where to put his legs - when we approach the finish line it's him who . gives me the signal and gives me that extra burst of speed. 'We . have never had a crash with any of the other horses in any of the races . we have been in and sometimes there can be as many as 16 in a field. I . have never had a horse like this before in my time as a jockey and an . owner.' 'Phenomenal intelligence': Laghat can only make out shadows, but has never had a crash in his career . He added: 'His intelligence is phenomenal and after every race, Laghat comes towards me bowing his head for an affectionate hug. 'We have become very close, it's as if we have our own language. He has his own stable and shares it with another horse who is his partner.' Mr De Paola added: 'I take him on the gallop near the stables every morning and it is a fantastic sensation to ride him. 'He has another big race coming up in a few days and we are training hard for this one and of course we hope to win it.' It is not clear what regulations are in place in Italy with regard to blind horses competing. But as most horses wear blinkers in races around the world to restrict . their field of vision and reduce any potential distractions, it appears . that Laghat's limited visibility is not a safety issue. Laghat's success story is at odds with Irish greyhound Jack Sprat who never won any race he entered until it was discovered last year that he was blind. Jack was entered for several races last year after he hit speeds of 40mph in training, but despite his owner's high hopes he came last every time and it was later discovered he had not been able to see the hare because of his blindness.","Laghat has powered to victory in 19 races despite disability from birth .

"By . Sam Webb . This is the moment police officers surfed Facebook and a sex website while a man in their care died in a cell just metres away from them. Lloyd Butler, 39, died of a cardiac arrest while being detained at Stechford police station in the West Midlands on August 4 2010, an inquest decided   yesterday. The CCTV footage shows the officers responsible for him gathered around a computer while they were supposed to be keeping a constant   watch on him. Scroll down for video . 'Unacceptable': Police officers surfed Facebook and a sex website while a man in their care had died in a cell just metres away from them . A report published by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) highlighted an alarming number of mistakes and 'unacceptable behaviour' by   officers in the tragic case. It also said custody sergeant Mark Albutt faked records to make it appear officers were checking on Mr Butler more often than they did. The review was published after an inquest saw footage showing officers laughing, joking and swearing. The jury was also told that PC Dean Woodcock made personal phonecalls, and officers surfed inappropriate websites, including one where 'women were offering sex'. Father-of-two Lloyd Butler, 39, from Birmingham, died after having a heart attack in his cell in August 2010 . IPCC Associate Commissioner Guido Liguori, who published the report, said: 'The indifferent treatment of Mr Butler by officers and staff of West   Midlands Police showed a disregard for both the stated procedures of detention and also for human decency. 'The care given to Mr Butler fell well short of what was expected from when he was arrested to the moment he sadly died. 'Instead of taking Mr Butler to hospital officers kept him in a police cell and instead of helping him, PC Woodcock and DEO Wall mocked him. 'In addition to the failure to care properly for Mr Butler, this was a worrying case highlighted by the findings from our investigation that PS Albutt   deliberately recorded incorrect information in the custody record and failed to adequately monitor Mr Butler, PC Woodcock preferring instead to surf   the internet and make personal calls. 'Such actions are not what I would expect to see from the police officers and staff.' Mr Butler collapsed at the police station after being arrested for appearing to be drunk and incapable. Delivering the verdict that Mr Butler's cardiac arrest had been caused by underlying alcohol problems the jury said the risk assessment was inadequate. They also said 15-minute visits were not carried out on time and a nurse was late to attend to him. The chairman said: 'On his arrival at custody, Mr Butler wasn't capable and, according to policies in place he should not have been detained in   custody, he should have been taken to hospital. 'It is the findings of the jury that, had Mr Butler been on a monitor in A&E at the time of his heart attack, the probability is that he more likely   would have survived.' PC Woodcock, who arrested Mr Butler and was later tasked with monitoring him, was found guilty of misconduct and had to undergo further training and development. Sgt Albutt was found guilty of gross misconduct and handed a final written warning. Police check on Lloyd Butler, 39, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and incapable on August 4, 2010 . Mr Butler collapsed at the police station after being arrested for appearing to be drunk and incapable . Lloyd's devastated mother, Janet, said her son would still be alive if West Midlands Police officers had 'done their job'. Speaking outside the court, she added: 'I hate to think another family has to suffer the way we did and still are - it affects you for the rest of your   life. 'I was satisfied with the inquest process because it brought out the truth - the truth about West Midlands Police and the officers who dealt with my   son. PC Dean Woodcock (pictured outside Birmingham Coroners Court) made personal telephone calls on the station's landline and his mobile phone, it was claimed . 'Their behaviour was an absolute disgrace. They failed Lloyd miserably in their duty of care to him and I feel they assisted in his death. 'It's very clear from the evidence we've seen over the last ten days that officers were not carrying out procedures. 'If they had, my son would still be alive today.' Birmingham coroner Louise Hunt said a 'change of culture' was needed in the force as she prepared to submit her report to prevent future deaths. She added: 'I remain concerned essentially about the conduct in custody suites. 'I appreciate a custody suite is a very difficult environment to work in but you have very vulnerable people coming in.' More CCTV played at the inquest showed officers dragging Mr Butler out of a police van by his legs, staggering around his cell and hitting his head   against the wall. Responding to the inquest verdict and the IPCC report, assistant chief constable Gary Cann said: 'The jury at Birmingham Coroner's Court has found   officers failed to carry out an adequate risk assessment when arresting Mr Butler, placing him in custody instead of taking him to hospital. 'They also found that, once in custody, proper checks were not adequately carried out and visits were not maintained on schedule. 'We do not underestimate the impact the death of Lloyd Butler has had on his family and friends and the force extends its sincere condolences. 'On behalf of the force, I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to Lloyd Butler's family.'","Lloyd Butler, 39, died after having a heart attack in his cell in August 2010 .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The Boy Scouts of America will accept openly gay youths starting New Year's Day, marking a historic shift that spells major changes to policies on tentmates and showers. Yet despite their be-prepared approach, BSA leaders are rooting for the change to be a non-event, comparable to another New Year's Day in 2000 when widespread fears of digital-clock chaos to start the new millennium proved unfounded. ‘My hope is there will be the same effect this Jan. 1 as the Y2K scare,’ said Brad Haddock, a BSA national executive board member who chairs the policy implementation committee. ‘It's business as usual, nothing happens and we move forward.’ Historic change: The Boy Scouts of America will accept openly gay youths starting on New Year's Day following a vote in May . Some churches are dropping their sponsorship of Scout units because of the new policy and some families are switching to a new conservative alternative called Trail Life USA. But massive defections haven't materialized and most major sponsors, including the Roman Catholic and Mormon churches, are maintaining ties. ‘There hasn't been a whole lot of fallout,’ said Haddock, a lawyer from Wichita, Kan. ‘If a church said they wouldn't work with us, we'd have a church right down the street say, `We'll take the troop.'‘ . The new inclusive policy was approved in May, with support from 60 per cent of the 1,400 voting members of the BSA's National Council. The vote followed acrimonious nationwide debate, and was accompanied by an announcement that the BSA would continue to exclude openly gay adults from leadership positions. Under the new membership policy, youths can no longer be barred from the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts or coed Venturers program solely on the basis of sexual orientation. However, gay Scouts will face some limitations. ‘Any sexual conduct, whether heterosexual or homosexual, by youth of Scouting age is contrary to the virtues of Scouting,’ says one BSA document. ‘No member may use Scouting to promote or advance any social or political position or agenda, including on the matter of sexual orientation.’ Trying to anticipate potential friction, the BSA has distributed extensive explanations and question-and-answer documents related to the policy. Under the BSA’s rules, a Scout could not march in uniform in a gay-pride parade or engage in advocacy, promotion, or the distribution of information of a sexual nature. A frequently-asked-questions document anticipates that some objections might surface from parents - or Scouts themselves - in cases where a unit includes an openly gay boy. Restrictions: Under the BSA¿s rules, a Scout could not march in uniform in a gay-pride parade or engage in advocacy . Regarding shower and toilet facilities, the BSA says it is encouraging units to provide greater individual privacy, including moving away from the tradition of group showers. ‘The adult leaders have the discretion to arrange private showering times and locations,’ the BSA says. Sleeping arrangements also are addressed, with specific decisions left to unit leaders. ‘If a Scout or parent of a Scout makes a request to not tent with another Scout, their wishes should be honored,’ says the BSA. Haddock says ‘isolated pockets’ of problems are likely to surface, but overall he expects adult leaders will have the skills to defuse potential conflicts. There are about 1 million adult leaders and 2.6 million youth members in Scouting in the U.S. Of the roughly 110,000 Scout units, 70 per cent are sponsored by religious organizations, including several conservative denominations that had long supported the BSA's exclusion of gay youth and gay adults. National movement: There are about 1 million adult leaders and 2.6 million youth members in Scouting in the U.S. Among the major sponsors, the Southern Baptist Convention made clear its disappointment with the new youth policy, but left the decision on whether to cut ties up to local churches. An SBC spokesman, Sing Oldham, said it was not known how many churches have done so. The biggest sponsor of Scout units - the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - commended the BSA for a ‘thoughtful, good-faith effort’ to address a challenging issue, and said it would stay engaged in Scouting. Keeping an open mind: Bill Helfand, the scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 55 in Houston, said he'd never considered sexual orientation when accepting members . John Gailey of the Utah National Parks Council, the nation's largest council, said its youth membership had increased from 74,148 in December 2012 to 75,863 this month. Like the Mormons, the Roman Catholic Church has generally accepted the new policy. Many parishes will continue to sponsor Scout units, though a few have considered cutting ties. The National Catholic Committee on Scouting posted a question-and-answer document on its website, delving into the intersection of Scouting policy and Catholic teaching. ‘The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that individuals who disclose a same-sex attraction are to be treated with the same dignity due all human beings ... and also teaches that engaging in sexual activity outside of marriage is always immoral,’ says the Q-and-A, concluding that the new BSA policy does not contradict Catholic teaching. The ultimate decision on whether parishes would maintain or cut ties with the BSA was left to individual bishops. Several expressed cautious support for continuing in Scouting. ‘As the new policy currently stands, I see no reason to prohibit our parishes from sponsoring Boy Scout troops,’ said Rev. Kevin Rhoades, bishop of Indiana's Fort Wayne-South Bend diocese. ‘At the same time, it is critical that we be vigilant on how this new policy is interpreted and implemented.’ One likely target of such scrutiny will be former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, scheduled to take over in the spring as the BSA's next president. As leader of the Pentagon, Gates helped change the military's ‘Don't Ask, Don't Tell’ policy banning openly gay soldiers, and gay-rights groups hope he will try to end the BSA's ban on gay adult leaders. The new youth policy was approved during a BSA meeting in May in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Grapevine, near the Scouts' national headquarters in Irving, Texas. Bigotry: A protestor is pictured April 6 2000, in Washington, DC, as Boy Scouts of America were on trial against gay Scoutmaster James Dale . Texas has a long heritage of Scouting, with tens of thousands of youth members and many families claiming generations of Eagle Scouts. Among them is Gov. Rick Perry, who achieved Scouting's highest rank growing up in the small town of Paint Creek. The membership debate was closely followed by local Scouts on both sides; some carried signs and held rallies outside the meeting place. But in subsequent months, the debate has quieted. Bill Helfand, scoutmaster of Troop 55 in Houston, said membership in his troop has remained steady at about 225 boys. ‘We never considered sexual orientation, and I don't think many troops really did,’ Helfand said. ‘I don't know whether we had Scouts who are homosexual. I don't inquire ... It's not a matter of concern.’ Opting out: Former Boy Scout and Scoutmaster Ron Orr is signing up local units for a new conservative alternative to the Boy Scouts of America called Trail Life USA . Helfand said the membership debate, while closely covered in the media, did not extend into his meetings with leaders and parents, besides occasional discussion of the policy at camp-outs. He says he hasn't talked to any Scout about his sexual orientation and doesn't intend to. ‘I know that this is something that people felt was a momentous turning point for Scouting,’ Helfand said. ‘Everybody I know has made Scouting available to every boy who wants it, and that's what we continue to do.’ However, some Texas parents and leaders have decided to switch to Trail Life USA, an alternative which declares itself ‘a Christian adventure, character, and leadership program for young men.’ Among them is Ron Orr, a business consultant from the Fort Worth area who is signing up local units for the group. So far, he said he has 25 groups ‘pre-chartered’ for a January 1 launch date in the territory covered by the BSA's Circle Ten and Longhorn councils. That's modest compared to the 39,000 Scouts served by the Circle Ten council alone. Orr is part of a family with four generations of Eagle Scouts. His older son recently earned his Eagle rank and his younger son was on the verge of doing likewise. But Orr said he could not stand by after the policy change. ‘As Christians, from a scriptural basis, we love all folks, but the scripture is very clear that being homosexual is a sin,’ Orr said. ‘We've got to be able to hold a strong line and set a consistent example for our young men.’ Orr said his decision to cut ties with the BSA rested in part on the Scout Oath, which includes the admonition to remain ‘morally straight.’ Scott Scarborough of Lubbock, Texas, is helping Orr recruit Trail Life members in the Texas Panhandle, a mostly rural, conservative region. Scarborough said he offered to let his 14-year-old son stay in Boy Scouts and achieve his Eagle rank, but the boy elected to join him in Trail Life. Orr and Scarborough said they didn't consider themselves rivals to the Boy Scouts, though they've chosen a different path. ‘Our tradition comes out of Boy Scouts,’ Scarborough said. ‘We'll never not honor that heritage.’","Under the new policy, youth members cannot be barred from Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts or coed Venturers because they're gay .

"By . Mark Prigg . An Oklahoma company has created a protective blanket that developers say could give children a better chance of surviving debris from a tornado - or bullets from a 9 mm handgun. The Bodyguard Blanket, made by ProTecht, is a bulletproof pad designed to protect students during disasters at school. The 5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack-like straps that allow users to put it on, and then duck and cover. Scroll down for video . The Bodyguard Blanket can protect students from tornado debris or bullets during school disasters. The blanket is made of Dyneema, a high-density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than Kevlar. Normally used by U.S. soldiers while in battle, it is qual to or exceeds the protection used by police departments. The firm claims the Bodyguard blanket provides bullet resistant protection against 90% of all weapons that have been used in school shootings in the United States. It has been classified to protect against various projectiles, including 9 mm and .22-caliber bullets. Steve Walker developed the pad, The Oklahoman reported. Walker started on the idea after a massive tornado struck last year in Moore, killing 24 people including seven children inside an elementary school that didn't have a tornado shelter. 'We're trying to stop that blunt-force trauma when that rubble is falling down on a child, for instance,' said Walker, a podiatrist from Edmond. He gave a sketch of the protective blanket to Stan Schone, an inventor and one of his patients, during an appointment. The two form half of the executive team at ProTecht. The others are Jeff Quinn and Jay Hanan. Hanan is an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Oklahoma State University-Tulsa. He introduced the team to Dyneema, a high-density plastic used for ballistic armor that is lighter than Kevlar. The new material also protects against nails, shards of metal and other sharp objects. 'Instead of bending over and hoping for the best, they're afforded an extra layer of protection,' Schone said. The 5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack-like straps that allow users to put it on, and then duck and cover. The new material also protects against nails, shards of metal and other sharp objects. At $1,000 per blanket, he and others with the company say buying one per student would be less expensive than building tornado shelters.'By no means would we ever say that this is more protective,' Walker said. 'But when you have budget constraints, this might be a viable alternative.' The blankets can be stored in classrooms until needed . ProTecht took a finished blanket to a shooting range and had it subjected to a National Institute of Justice Class 3A test, which is used to test body armor for police units. The classification implies protection against various projectiles, including 9 mm and .22-caliber bullets. It passed, Schone said. The blanket has been in production for about 10 months, and the team started marketing it about a week ago, he said.","5/16-inch thick rectangle features backpack straps to keep it in place .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Hollywood star Harold Ramis has died aged 69 after a long illness. Ramis was one of Tinseltown's most successful filmmakers in the 1980’s and 90’s – starring in 'Ghostbusters' and writing credits on classics such as ‘Animal House,’ ‘Caddyshack,’ ‘National Lampoon’s Vacation,’ ‘Stripes,’ ‘Groundhog Day’ and ‘Analyze This.’ The Chicago native died from complications of autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis – which swells the blood vessels - surrounded by family just before 1.00am, his wife Erica told the Chicago Tribune. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Loss of a legend: Harold Ramis wrote and directed 'Caddyshack' and 'Stripes,' and had writing credits in 'Meatballs' and 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' to name a few . Ramis’ health began going downhill in 2010 when complications of the autoimmune disease arose from an infection. The condition was so severe he had to learn how to walk all over again, a family spokesperson told the paper. He never fully recovered, and finally lost his battle with the disease. Tributes began pouring in from all around Hollywood as the industry reeled from his death. 'Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my brilliant, gifted, funny friend, co-writer/performer and teacher Harold Ramis. May he now get the answers he was always seeking,' Dan Akroyd said. 'Sad to hear my friend Harold Ramis passed away. A brilliant, funny, actor and director. A wonderful husband and dad. Big loss to us all,' tweeted Billy Crystal. In memorial: The small tribute left for Harold Ramis outside the Tribeca fire house where the 'Ghostbusters' movie was filmed . 'Was honored to have gotten to work . with Harold Ramis, the Buddha of Comedy. Brilliant, humble, radiant. We've lost an icon,' tweeted Rainn Wilson. Ramis recently directed several episodes of NBC's 'The Office,' Wilson co-starred in the show as the neurotic Dwight Schrute. 'Harold Ramis. Funny, gracious, kind hearted. A joy to have known you,' tweeted 'Office' star Steve Carell. The beloved filmmaker was known for his over the top comedies with an uncommon touch. His . off-beat, but cerebral and self-aware characters brought tears of . laughter and sadness to millions. His movies are the soundtrack to many . childhoods that eventually grew into happy hours. Ramis' first major film was the raucous 1978 John Belushi comedy 'Animal . House,' which made the latter a household name and still inspires jokes . among college students decades later. His final major directorial job: Ramis pictured on the set of 'Year One' with actors Jack Black (center) and Michael Cera (left) Shot to fame: Ramis rose to stardom as Dr Spengler in 'Ghostbusters' while alongside (left to right) Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray . Belushi was one of three future Hollywood stars Ramis worked with in the 1970's at Second City - Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd were also lighting rooms up with their humor as Ramis played the willing straight man. 'I stopped being the zany... I learned that my thing was lobbing in great lines here and there, which would score big and keep me there on the stage,' Ramis told the Tribune years ago. That theme continued for the rest of his acting career, as he spent it either writing the punchlines for others, directing or playing the straight man. His first acting role came in 'Stripes,' a movie he wrote for Murray. But he shot to stardom starring as the geeky, science-obsessed Dr. Egon Spengler in both 'Ghostbusters' movies. Ramis never had more than bit parts after his run as Spengler was through, but his film writing legacy spans generations. 'Harold Ramis was a brilliant, shining example for every comedy writer hoping to achieve excellence the field.  He will be sorely missed,' Seth MacFarlane tweeted. 'If . you're my age and got into comedy, Harold Ramis was one of the reasons. Life is fast and over too soon,' tweeted Zach Braff. Stars of his movies also shared their grief. 'Very, very sad to hear that Harold Ramis has died. He was a lovely man and I loved working with him. RIP,' tweeted Eliazbeth Hurley, she starred in the Ramis-written 2000 film 'Bedazzled.' 'No no not Harold Ramis. Worked for him years ago. He was the real deal. Growing up, his work changed my life. He will be missed,' tweeted John Favreau. He wrote and directed 1980's 'Caddyshack,' cementing both he and Mrray's place in Hollywood. They would make several more films together. 'In 1993 Harold Ramis called me & told me his 2 rules of directing comedy: '1. Hire Bill Murray 2. Turn on camera,' filmmaker Dan Mirvish tweeted upon hearing of Ramis' death. Ramis' seemingly struck gold with every film script he churned out, from 'Meatballs' to 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' which launched a string of sequels and Chevy Chase's film career. The parade of hits continued with 'Caddyshack 2,' the critically acclaimed 'Groundhog Day,' 'Analyze This' and sequel 'Analyze That.' His last acting role came as the . father to Seth Rogen's character in 2009's 'Knocked Up.' Rogen has often . said Ramis is one of the reasons he began doing comedy. 'His . work is the reason why so many of us got into comedy,' 'Knocked Up' director Judd Apatow told the Tribune. 'We grew up on 'Second City TV' and 'Ghostbusters,' 'Vacation,' 'Animal House,' 'Stripes,' 'Meatballs,' he literally made every single one of our favorite movies.' How many will always remember him: Ramis as Dr Spengler on the set of 'Ghostbusters' Millions of people who have never met Ramis are also saddened by the loss of the iconic filmmaker. 'It's always so strange when someone you watched and loved and who influenced you so much when you were a kid passes away. RIP Harold Ramis,' tweeted Mitch Silpa. 'I'm actually for-real crying about Harold Ramis. My god, when the next Ghostbuster goes, I'm going to need a day off work to recover,' tweeted astronaut Heather Archuleta. The success and acclaim never changed him though, Second City founder Bernie Sahlens told the Tribune before his death. Sahlens had known him since 1969. 'He's the least changed by success of anyone I know in terms of sense of humor, of humility, sense of self,' said his former mentor. 'He's had enormous success relatively, but none of it has gone to his head in any way.' That human touch is why millions flocked to his movies, stars lined up to act in his films and why many will likely wake up in the morning wishing Monday was Groundhog Day.

"By . Matt Blake . Updated: . 12:04 EST, 7 March 2012 . When Jessica Sayers dumped her boyfriend Luke after he groped her, she soon fell for the shy charm of new love Connor. But little did she know that not only were both boys the same person, but each was in fact a character played by cruel 'himposter' Gemma Barker. Today, 48 hours after Barker was jailed for two-and-a-half years, brave Miss Sayers told of her heartbreak at finding out she had been hoodwinked by the girl she thought was her friend. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Jessica, who has waived her right to anonymity, . told how both Luke and Connor dressed differently, spoke differently, . behaved differently - even kissed differently. Scroll down for video . Heartbreak: Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Jessica Sayers told how both Luke and Connor dressed differently, spoke differently, behaved differently - even kissed differently . 'Everything about them was completely different,' the traumatised teenager, now 18, said. 'It was like they were two different people - even when we kissed.' Barker, 20, duped Jessica and another girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, their parents and police by wearing baggy clothes, hats and speaking in a deeper voice. Even . when one of her alter egos was arrested, it wasn't until police gave . her a male strip search that they realised 'he' was in fact a girl. 'Nobody knows what it is like when the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with is not real. Gemma ruined my childhood and no little girl should have to go through what I did,' added Jessica in a separate interview with The Sun. Actor: Jessica said Barker's (pictured) acting was so good, she could have won an Oscar . Barker's deception was complex and forensically  planned. She first became friends with Jessica as herself after they . met at a Halloween party in 2009. During days out and sleepovers Gemma . learned Jessica and her other victim's tastes in boys. She spent hours creating fake profiles of boys on social networking sites before approaching the girls. Then, posing as a boy called Aaron . Lampard she contacted Jessica on MSN Messenger. Through the social . networking service, she introduced her to Luke Jones, another of her . alter egos. It was as Aaron that she duped the unidentified girl. Jessica and Luke first met in person on a park bench under cover of darkness. 'I only ever saw below his eyes. He covered the rest with a hood,' Jessica said. ‘He said he didn’t want to show his face because he was very shy. And why wouldn’t I believe that? 'Gemma was very clever. She never studied drama but I did and I couldn't do such a convincing male voice.' She added to The Sun: 'She could have won an Oscar for her performance.' The couple met once a week for about four months until the relationship fell apart when 'Luke' attempted to grope Jessica. ‘I felt not ready to do anything at 15. At 15 you are just a child and I didn’t think you should do anything sexual.’ Having told ‘Luke’ she didn’t want to see him anymore, Jessica was contacted on MSN by Connor McCormack, also Gemma, saying he was a friend of Luke. When Gemma told her she thought Connor would make a good boyfriend, Jessica agreed to meet up. Violation: When the police finally revealed the truth, Jessica said she felt 'dirty' and 'disgusting' Connor was completely different to . Luke, she said. Connor said he from a wealthy family and . that his father worked for Simon Cowell. She . described Luke as 'like a chav' who wrote messages to her in . 'text-speak'. ‘Luke was shy in person,' she said. He didn’t want to look . at me but was more than happy to have hourly conversations on the phone . at night. ‘But Connor was very shy. He never wanted to talk. He didn’t want to do anything.’ Jessica soon fell in love with Connor. ‘All . my friends at school said, “Oh, your boyfriend is really fit,”’ she . said. ‘And I was like, thanks. Nobody had any reason to believe he was not a . boy.’ Barkers web of deceit began to unravel in May 2009 when she, as Connor, stayed the night with Jessica. Deceit: Miss Barker with Hollyoaks star Kieron Richardson. The court heard how she suffers from autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, commonly known as ADHD . ‘That was the first time anything ever . happened sexually. But I was never ever allowed to touch him in any way . at all. He never let me. At 15 or 16 you are never going to question . why. ‘After it happened he fell asleep and I stayed awake the whole night. I couldn’t sleep at all.’ She then decided to lift Luke’s hat as he slept to take a better look at the face she had never properly seen. Deceit: Gemma Barker spent hours creating fake profiles of boys on social networking sites . To her horror, the face she saw was . that of Aaron Lampard, who she knew was dating a friend of hers. ‘I felt shocked. I didn’t know what I could do. I knew nobody would believe me. And that’s what happened. Nobody believed me.’ Three . weeks later, Jessica went to the police to report the person who had . pretended to be both Connor and Aaron, still not realising it was . Barker. Barker was arrested in a park while dressed as Aaron. But it wasn’t until police conducted a strip search that they learned the disturbing truth. Jessica said: ‘If CID, who are trained, aren’t able to recognise that (he was a girl), then how is a 15 year old girl supposed to know?’ When the police finally revealed the truth to Jessica, she said she felt ‘dirty’ and ‘disgusting’. ‘I felt shocked at first and then really angry. I felt deceived that the person that I loved was not actually real. ‘It didn’t sink in until a few months later when I realised no matter what I did, what I thought or what I said, he was never coming back. ‘I was like he had just died. That was the only way I could cope with it.' Barker was jailed for two and a half years on Monday after admitting two counts . of sexual assault and one of fraud. The offences took place between . November 23 2009 and May 10 2010. She received 30-month terms for the sexual assaults and three months for the fraud, the sentences to be concurrent.

Further north the weather has been too . cool in the likes of New England and New York for a full-blown Brood II . emergence, but it isn’t expected to be too far away. Cicadas are expected to emerge from the ground in the billions in the next couple of weeks as soil temperature reaches 64 degrees Fahrenheit. For weeks, bug-watchers have been posting their sightings (and soil temperature readings) to websites such as Cooley's Magicicada.org and RadioLab's Cicada Tracker. The emergence of the insects has been slower than expected due to this spring's cool temperatures in northern states, reports NBCNews. Cicadas invasion: The insects have been spotted everywhere from Virginia to Massachusetts . Radiolab's online trader is documenting sightings of cicadas up and down the East Coast . In order to bring the soil up to 64 . degrees F, air temperatures have to get significantly higher than that . on a consistent basis. The . insects are harmless. They do not bite or sting, and will not harm crops or other animals. Lots of people will not even see them, though they could certainly hear their mating call, which was once recorded at 94 decibels. And the insects can even be transformed into a high protein, low-carb meal. The magicicadas are only after sex. After . a few weeks up singing their loud mating call up in the trees, they . will die and their offspring will go underground, not to return until . 2030. Since 1996, this group of one-inch bugs, has been a few feet underground, sucking on tree roots and biding their time. They will emerge only when the ground temperature reaches precisely 64F. The cicadas have been living underground for 17 years and will emerge when the ground temperature hits 64F . The cicadas, seen here in North Carolina, shed their shells and spread their wings before finding a mate . The recipe book by Jenna Jadin, below, can be found here. The recipes include: . Cicada dumplings . El chirper tacos . Cica-delicious pizza . Sizzling chili cicadas . Southern cicada tartlets . Banana cicada bread . Chocolate chip trillers . Cicada-rhubarb piece . And, Ms Jadin's favourite, chocolate covered cicadas . 'This particular brood is extremely large', pest controller Billy Tesh told NBC, who saw a swarm at a farm in Stokes County. 'I've never seen so many in one location in my life. They were on almost every blade of grass.' A recipe book by scientist Jenna Jadin advocates collecting the creatures for food - though not without consulting a doctor first, and not if you suffer from a nut or shellfish allergy. She told WUSA9 that about 8pm to 9pm is the prime time for cicada gathering. 'You're going to look at the low-lying shrubs on the ground,' she said. 'You're probably going to need a lot because they're great.' Ms Jardin, who wrote the book during her PhD at the University of Maryland and now works for the U.S. department of agriculture, advised grabbing the magicicadas off bushes and putting them into a paper bag or basket. 'Newly hatched cicadas, called tenerals, are considered best for eating because their shells have not hardened,' says the book. 'They should be blanched (for 4-5 minutes) soon after collection and before you eat them! 'Not only will this make their insides solidify a bit, but it will get rid of any soil bacteria that is living on or in them. You can then cook with them immediately, or freeze them.' The insects are expected to arrive in . such numbers that people from North Carolina to Connecticut will be . outnumbered roughly 600-to-1. 'It's just an amazing accomplishment,' May Berenbaum, a University of Illinois entomologist, told the Associated Press. 'How can anyone not be impressed?' There are ordinary cicadas that come out every year around the world, but these are different. This year's group of nagicicadas is known as Brood II and has begun to emerge on the East Coast of the States . The insects do not sting or bite and pose no threat to humans or crops . They are called magicicadas - as in magic - and are red-eyed. And they are seen only in the eastern half of the United States. There are 15 U.S. broods that emerge . every 13 or 17 years. Last year the swarm affected only a small . area, mostly around the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, West Virginia . and Tennessee. Next year, it is the turn of Iowa into Illinois and Missouri; and Louisiana and Mississippi. Brood . II is one of the bigger groups. Several experts say that they don't . know how many cicadas are lurking underground but that 30billion seems . like a sensible estimate. At the Smithsonian Institution, researcher Gary Hevel said it could be closer to a trillion. If 30billion magicicadas were lined up head to tail, they would reach the moon and back. 'There will be some places where it's wall-to-wall cicadas,' says University of Maryland entomologist Mike Raupp. Strength . in numbers is the key to cicada survival: There are so many of them . that the birds can't possibly eat them all, and those that are left over . are free to multiply, he says. Some . scientists think the magicicadas come out in the odd 13 and 17-year . cycles so that predators cannot match the timing and be waiting for them . in huge numbers. Another theory is that the unusual cycles ensure that different broods don't compete with each other. And there's the mystery of just how these bugs know it has been 17 years and is time to come out, instead of 15 or 16 years. 'These guys have evolved several mathematically clever tricks,' Raupp says. 'These guys are geniuses with little tiny brains.' While they stay underground, the bugs . aren't asleep. As some of the world's longest-lived insects, they go . through different growth stages and molt four times before ever getting . to the surface. They . feed on a tree fluid called xylem. Then they surface, where they molt, . leaving behind a crusty brown shell, and grow a half-inch bigger. As six-year-old Samantha Fields shows, the cicadas are harmless . Samantha has already encountered her first magicicada - and scientists say there could be between 30billion and a trillion of the insects waiting to surface . The timing of when they first come out depends purely on ground temperature. That means early May for southern areas and late May or even June for northern areas. The males come out first as nymphs, which are essentially wingless and silent juveniles, then climb on to tree branches and molt one last time, becoming adult winged cicadas. They perch on tree branches and sing, individually or in a chorus. Then when a female comes close, the males change their song, they do a dance and mate, Raupp explained. The males keep mating and eventually the female lays 600 or so eggs on the tip of a branch. The offspring then dive-bomb out of the trees, bounce off the ground and eventually burrow into the earth, he says. 'It's a treacherous, precarious life,' Raupp says. 'But somehow they make it work.'","Cicadas have begun to surface across the East Coast of the U.S.

The McCanns' daughter, Madeleine, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007, from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. The toddler, who lived in Rothley with her family, had been left in the rented apartment at the seaside Ocean Club resort, along with her twin siblings, Sean and Amelie. During the half-hour service, led by Rothley's Anglican vicar Rob Gladstone, Mrs McCann gave a reading adapted from the words of a song. 'Here we are again, and more significantly, here you are again,' she told those present. 'Having your support has made a huge difference, so thank you.' Speech: During the ceremony, Mrs McCann gave a reading adapted from the words of a song. 'Here we are again, and more significantly, here you are again,' she said.

Above, tributes to the missing children . Speaking after his wife, Mr McCann added: 'I would just like to echo what Kate said and thank you all for coming to support us over the past seven years.' Mr McCann also expressed his family's gratitude that the Metropolitan . Police team investigating Madeleine's disappearance has now moved on to a . 'very active' phase in its inquiry. 'They . are chipping away and obviously there is new evidence so we are going . to continue to hope that we will get a happy outcome,' he said. Speaking . before the service, Mrs McCann's uncle, Brian Kennedy, 75, said all . four churches in the village had provided tremendous support to the . family.

She had been left in the apartment with her twin siblings . Possible sighting: A street in the Praia Da Luz resort where an Irish holiday maker and his wife claim they saw a mystery person with a child at about the same time as Madeleine McCann disappeared in May 2007 . The retired headmaster, who also lives in Rothley, said locals had also been extremely supportive. Asked . how he felt on the anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, he told . the Press Association: 'Much the same as I was seven years ago - . hopeful. 'But, as Kate always says, we would just like to know something. The worst part is not knowing where Madeleine is.' Speaking . earlier this week, Mrs McCann revealed that she privately returns to . the Portuguese resort where her daughter disappeared to 'walk those . streets' and 'look for answers'. Search: Speaking earlier this week, Mrs McCann (pictured with her husband, Gerry) revealed that she privately returns to the Portuguese resort where Madeleine disappeared to 'walk those streets' and 'look for answers' She told the BBC that she returns quietly to Praia da Luz at least once or twice a year to feel close to her eldest daughter, who would now be 10 years old. Mrs McCann's comments came as she backed a revamped alert system, known as Child Rescue Alerts, which is triggered when missing children are kidnapped or their lives are at risk. 'When a child is abducted, families are devastated and entire communities are torn apart,' she said. 'The agony of not knowing where your child is is almost impossible to imagine.' She urged members of the public to sign up for system, which will be overhauled later this month.","Kate and Gerry McCann attended open-air prayer service in Rothley today .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The arrest of a US diplomat accused of being a CIA spy was linked to the Boston bombing, sources revealed today. Russian security officials reported on Tuesday that they had briefly detained Ryan Fogle in Moscow for allegedly trying to recruit a Russian intelligence officer. Today sources revealed the man Mr Fogle . was trying to ‘recruit’ was an FSB agent who specialised in Islamic . extremism in Russia and may even have travelled to the region where the . bombing suspects came from. Lure: Sources today said that Ryan Fogle, right, was seeking to lure into treachery an FSB agent who had knowledge of Russian intelligence operations on suspected Boston terrorist Tamerlan Tsarnaev,  left . It is thought that he was part of a . team who went to Dagestan and provided intelligence to the United States . about an extremist threat in 2011. Fogle, a third secretary at the U.S. Embassy, who was carrying special technical equipment, disguises, . written instructions and a large sum of money. Fogle was later handed . over to U.S. Embassy officials. This morning the Russian foreign . ministry today issued a formal protest to American ambassador Michael . McFaul who was summoned to explain the alleged espionage mission of one . of his diplomats. As he left after the brief session . with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, the envoy waved to . reporters but refused to comment. Relations: U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul walks outside as he leaves the Russian Foreign Ministry headquarters in Moscow. He was summoned to explain the alleged espionage mission of one of his diplomats . The Ministry hit out at 'provocative . acts in the spirit of the Cold War' and has ordered the expulsion of . Fogle, arrested wearing a blond wig under his baseball cap. 'This does not contribute to the . further process of building mutual trust between Russia and the United . States and bringing our relations to a qualitatively new level,' warned . Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin. But it was becoming clearer today . that the US was seeking to lure into treachery an FSB agent who had . knowledge of Russian intelligence operations on suspected Boston . terrorist Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who lived in America but had travelled to . Dagastan where he was believed to have met Islamic extremists. Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . Just call me James... blond? Russian intelligence services parade the 'CIA spy', named as Ryan Christopher Fogle, for cameras on Monday . The FSB had earlier warned the FBI about his potential extremist links. In material released by the FSB, it . is clear the Americans had phone numbers for one or more Russian . intelligence agents involved in anti-terrorism work in the Caucasus. They obtained these during trip involving FBI agents to Dagestan in search of intelligence on Tamerlan's trip. 'After the first call he refused to . meet, but this man called again and insisted on a meeting,' said a . recording of a FSB officer addressing three US diplomats who came to . collect the alleged CIA agent from FSB headquarters. 'At first we did not believe it was . happening, because recently the FSB has been actively helping to . investigate the Boston blasts, and was also providing some other . information about threats to US national security'. Today Kommersant newspaper said: 'It . is likely that during the trip in April the US side obtained the phone . numbers of Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.' 'Clearly, they then decided to use it . to have personal contacts with anti-terror agents, given that the . exchange of information in the form of question and answers between . special services is not always quick and smooth,' it said. Russia has not named the target of . the US co-operation, and it is not known whether the agent has faced any . problems or even arrest over the US interest in him. Fogle apparently hinted at an initial . payment of $100,000 followed up a salary of up to $1 million a year . plus bonuses if the Russian intelligence official handed over secrets to . the CIA. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei . Lavrov said he had opted not to bring up the case at talks with US . Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday in Sweden. 'I decided that talking about it would . be superfluous, since it is already made public and everyone already . understands everything,' he said. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help  change one's appearance,' according to the FSB . Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine . Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia . Fogle was the first American diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in Russia in about a decade. While relations between the two countries have been strained, officials in both Washington and Moscow sought to play down the incident. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said. A letter in Russian which Fogle . carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big . fish. Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you . $100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and . co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to . answer certain questions. ‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’ The recruit is instructed to use an . internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for . staying in touch with us’. The incident is the biggest spy . scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other . Russians in the US in 2010. The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US . intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees . of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’ Many details remained shrouded in . mystery last night. It is not known whether the target was part of the . sting operation or if they have been arrested. Russia’s haste to make the news public . could mean either that the attempt was so audacious that it shocked . leaders, or that hardliners have seized on it to stop a move towards . detente with the US. Yesterday Patty Fogle, the diplomat’s mother, refused to comment at her home in St Louis, Missouri.","U.S. diplomat named as Ryan Christopher Fogle was arrested on Monday .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The Home Office’s third attempt to deport a drug-dealing asylum seeker who claims he is gay has been put on hold because he is suing them for thousands of pounds in damages. Felix Wamala, a 43-year-old Ugandan, arrived in Britain illegally as long ago as 1995 and has so far beaten off every attempt to remove him. He says that he left Uganda because he was persecuted for his sexuality and that he fears for his life if he returns. While awaiting deportation to his native Ugandam Felix Wamala was held here  Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre in Uxbridge, Middlesex . He said: ‘I don’t consider myself any different from anyone else in Uganda who is gay. ‘The ones who are there, maybe they have found a way of living but most people are in hiding. ‘I don’t know that many people in Uganda who can shelter me and I cannot even see myself passing the airport security.’ Wamala claims that he was manhandled by the private security firm who were tasked with putting him on a flight back to his homeland. He was finally thrown out of Britain in 1999, after being handed a seven-year jail term for a hard drugs offence. But, within weeks, he had re-entered the country and was not spotted again until 2006. The inside of Colnbrook Immigration Reception Centre near Heathrow, which holds up to 360 immigration detainees whose removal from the UK is imminent . In 2010 he was convicted of shoplifting and the Home Secretary again signed a deportation order. Despite publicly funded trips to the High Court and the Court of Appeal, his attempts to stay in the country on asylum and human rights grounds were condemned as ‘totally without merit’ by a series of judges. However, it today emerged that Wamala is suing the Home Office and private firm, Reliance Escorts, for substantial damages, claiming ‘excessive force’ was used in an abortive attempt to put him on a Uganda-bound flight on Christmas Eve 2011 from Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre near Heathrow airport. Mrs Justice Patterson said the Home Office had agreed not to deport him pending the outcome of his compensation claim. The High Court heard that no less than four private escorts were assigned to accompany Wamala to the airport. Wamala claims that he was subjected to ‘force and threats of force’ to get him on board the Qatar Airways flight. Once on board, he informed cabin crew that he was being unlawfully removed against his will and, when he asked to speak to the plane’s captain, Wamala says he was assaulted and injured. The judge said: “His removal was aborted. He was carried back to the escort van when he says that he was dropped. “He has suffered from a back injury, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression subsequently”. He also says that his claims about being gay have been ignored because he cannot provide the concrete proof about his homosexuality that the Home Office is demanding. In a preliminary ruling which boosted Wamala’s compensation hopes, the judge said that he had earlier been told he would be on an Egypt Air flight and - although the ultimate destination was the same, Uganda - no removal directions had been issued for the Qatar flight. She added that, quite apart from factual disputes about what actually happened at the airport, ‘questions arose’ as to whether there was any lawful power to load or offload Wamala onto the Qatar flight. Although it was arguable that the escorts had ‘lawful authority’ to use reasonable force against Wamala that would have to be considered at a full trial. A date for the full hearing of Wamala’s damages claim against the Home Office and Reliance Task Management has yet to be set.","Felix Wamala arrived in the UK illegally as long ago as 1995 fleeing Uganda .

Earlier this month Wiseman, another U.S. astronaut Steve Swanson, and German astronaut Alexander Gerst, showed off their microgravity football skills by performing impressive bicycle kicks, spins and somersaults while kicking a ball. Wiseman, from Baltimore, Maryland, has taken over the mantle of incredible ISS social media posts from Commander Chris Hadfield, who posted on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to a large following of people around the world. Hadfield, a keen musician, was even filmed performing David Bowie's Space Oddity in low gravity and performed a duet with Canadian band Barenaked Ladies via a video feed from space.

"By . Hugo Gye . It is said that most babies look a bit like Winston Churchill - and that maxim certainly applies to Prince George, according to his doting uncle Harry. The older prince, who is on a tour of South America, told a reporter that his nephew's 'big chubby cheeks' gave him a resemblance to the wartime Prime Minister. George, who will celebrate his first birthday next month, is perhaps the best-known baby in the world - but he still has some way to go before he can match the stature of Churchill. Doppelgangers: Prince George and Winston Churchill are the spitting images of each other, says Prince Harry . Dignified: But George has some way to go if he is to match the achievements of Churchill . Harry, 29, made the light-hearted comments during a reception in Chile's capital Santiago, where he was attending an event to celebrate the official birthday of his grandmother, the Queen. The reception was hosted by British ambassador Fiona Clouder, and attended by local dignitaries from business, the arts and politics. Radio presenter Virginia Araya said that she had asked Harry about his nephew during the event. 'I asked him what George was like,' she said. 'He said: ""He's growing up, he is walking and he has big, chubby cheeks. He looks like a young Winston Churchill.""' Temper: Like Churchill, George can show flashes of an outspoken temperament . Quip: Prince Harry made his comments during an event at the British embassy in Chile . Harry's comments yesterday came a day after he received a wedding proposal from a woman with the same surname as his sister-in-law, Kate Middleton. According to the Telegraph, TV reporter Bernardita Middleton confronted the prince on the streets of Santiago while wearing a tiara and said to him: 'I am a Middleton, like Princess Kate. I be your next wife Harry.' Before arriving in Chile, Harry visited Brazil, where he watched England's final World Cup match against Costa Rica. He also helped a family living in the slums of Valparaiso to enjoy the football by mending their television just in time for Brazil's second-round clash with Chile.","Prince Harry compared his brother's son to the wartime Prime Minister .

"By . Claudia  Joseph . I’m standing in Top Shop as jostling customers browse for handbags and flick through rails of summer dresses. They are not looking at me, but I am watching them. In fact, I am photographing them, taking video clips and wiring them back to the office. I make a call without lifting a finger. I send a discreet email. But I attract no attention because the camera, the screen and the phone are virtually invisible. They are just a tiny component of my high-tech glasses. I am looking at the future and the people around me are oblivious. The long-awaited but controversial Google Glass has arrived in Britain, and I am testing what it can do – and not just in terms of making calls or capturing high-quality snaps to show my friends. I am also seeing how it stretches long-cherished ideas of privacy to breaking point. And beyond. Scroll down for video . 'Okay Glass': Claudia Joseph manages to prowl London's streets, banks and cinemas wearing Google Glass virtually undetected, filming and taking pictures as she goes . Today we are fearful of terrorists, alert for paedophiles and edgy about the all-consuming surveillance of major corporations and the state. We have never been so conscious of snooping and spying. Yet I have been in the law courts, loitered outside a primary school, queued for changing rooms, snooped around a bank – and with one exception only, my strange new glasses have provoked not so much as a glance of enquiry. The attractions of immediate communication and instant imagery are powerful; human knowledge is expanding at an unimaginable rate. But from smartphones to drones the size of insects, the pace of electronic change is now so overwhelming that experts predict a reshaping of society itself – a dystopian world in which our thoughts and movements are forever available to close family and strangers alike. A world with no private space. Google Glass is at the forefront of this revolution – futuristic technology that has burst out of the laboratory and gone on sale. The price, £1,000, is stiff but like most new technology will probably fall. A voice-activated cross between a smartphone and a pair of spectacles, it can take photos and videos, make phone and video calls, surf the internet, send emails, listen to music and update your diary, all while you barely twitch a muscle. Happy snapper: Claudia is able to film while waiting in line at a cash point on London's Oxford Circus . Welcome to Britain: The privacy-invading Goggle glasses have now arrived in the UK at a price of £1,000 . At their new Kings Cross headquarters, Google staff show me how to use the  new device. Key to its operation is the screen, a tiny translucent prism suspended above the right eye. You swipe on the side of the frame to  activate it and dictate commands starting with the words: ‘Okay Glass.’ Everything is saved on a timeline, . which is found by swiping forwards and backwards. To go back to the . menu, you scroll downwards. The  battery lasts about a day, or 45 . minutes for non-stop video recording. I’m . a little nervous wearing them for the first time, but no one takes a . second glance as I take the tube to Oxford Circus, in London’s West End. There is nothing obviously private on . view in Top Shop. But what about the changing rooms? Would my fellow . shoppers be uneasy at the recording device perched on my nose? Apparently not. I am unchallenged – it’s a good job this isn’t an open changing room, like at the gym. What about more sensitive locations? Would bank staff spot me if I tried to film inside a branch where . security is supposedly tight? First I film a cashpoint queue outside . HSBC, then I go inside. They seem oblivious. ‘Can I help you?’ they ask, . before guiding me to the tills. So much for security. Surely . there would be more vigilance at a primary school – the sort of place . where parents have found themselves banned from filming their  own . children at sports days. I sit outside the entrance and watch through . the glasses as the children arrive. I am barely noticed. My . local cinema pays no attention when I catch a screening of the newly . released Jersey Boys. Wearing the glasses, I buy a ticket, sit down and . decide to film the opening credits. At . least Google Glass is visible, unlike the tiny surveillance cameras now . available online, although the time will come when high-tech specs are . indistinguishable from any other pair of glasses. In fact, the time will . come when almost anything could contain a recording device. Pin-ned down: Google Glass is so discreet no one notices, allowing Claudia to capture images of people using the cash machine unchallenged . Taking the credit: No questions were raised when Claudia wore the Google Glass to a screening at her local cinema, so she could record the opening credits undiscovered . I take matters a step further, and . visit a magistrates’ court, choosing a seat in the public gallery. The . rules here are draconian: there must be no pictures or filming or . recording. So I keep Google Glass switched off. But magistrates, . lawyers, clerks and ushers pay no attention to my headwear. Only . the Royal Courts of Justice were on the ball. The metal detector in the . foyer fails to pick up Google Glass. But as I begin to walk in, a guard . turns to me and says: ‘Is that a camera? You will have to leave those . here, if you want to go in.’ I am bang to rights – for once. Google . claims the glasses bring people the technology they need ‘without . distracting them from the world around them’. Glass has been featured in .

Shafi Ahmed, a surgeon at the Royal London Hospital, . broadcast live video of him operating to 13,000 medical students using . Google’s specs. But they are also thought to be behind the footage of One Direction’s Zayn Malik apparently lighting up a joint. In America, some shops and cafes have banned the device, while critics have branded wearers ‘glassholes’. Google has released an etiquette guide . stating, rather obviously, that ‘standing alone in the corner of a room . staring at people while recording them through Glass is not going to . win you any friends’. 'Take them off': Although the Courts of Justice metal detector failed to recognise the glasses, officials were quick to spot the camera . ‘We designed Glass with privacy in mind,’ says a Google spokeswoman.‘The fact that Glass is worn above . the eyes and the screen lights up when it is activated clearly signals . it is in use and makes it a fairly lousy surveillance device. 'There are other ways to record people such as pin cameras. Glass isn’t one of them.’ She is right.

At a more basic level, cloud technology can already let friends,  family – and hackers – know where you are and what you’re up to. And while it is heartening to know we can be tracked and rescued by mobile phone signals, it also means we are never truly alone. Odd behaviour, curious facial expressions, stray looks – these are increasingly captured and broadcast in myriad forums, from Facebook to YouTube. Imagine that five-fold – or 25-fold. And we already spy on those closest to us. Forty-four per cent of spouses now secretly check each other’s text messages, according to Oxford University research, behaviour that would once have been seen as a serious breach of privacy. Neuroscientist Professor Susan Greenfield warns that human identity itself is under threat as electronic devices cause changes in the brain’s microcellular structure. ‘It’s pretty clear that the screen-based, two-dimensional world that so many teenagers – and a growing number of adults – choose to inhabit is producing changes in behaviour. Attention spans are shorter, personal communication skills are reduced and there’s a marked reduction in the ability to think abstractly,’ she has said. And that can affect even our closest relationships. ‘Google Glass raises the spectre of society’s loss of privacy, since you never know when someone might be videotaping or recording you,’ says Benita Roth, professor of sociology at Binghamton University, New York. ‘A huge concern is the lack of  control people have over their own persona, as your online identity becomes an agglomeration of people you know, products you have bought and websites you have visited, leaving a digital trail followed by data-hungry corporations.’ In Dave Eggers’s recent bestseller The Circle, his characters’ every move is videoed and streamed live. Only the toilet cubicle is spared the camera’s all-seeing eye. Is his fiction so far from the future we now face?

"Andy Murray begins Wimbledon defence against David Goffin . Virginia Wade criticised Murray's appointment of Amelie Mauresmo . Murray will play first on Centre Court, at 1pm . By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Andy Murray was forced to defend the decision to appoint Amelie Mauresmo as his coach after negative comments from fellow British Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade. On the eve of beginning his title defence, Murray extolled the virtues of Ivan Lendl’s replacement, dismissing Wade’s observations that he was ‘messing with everyone’ in making the appointment and that Mauresmo was ‘mentally fragile’. Asked if he was disappointed with another British tennis icon offering such criticism he replied: ‘No, she’s done it a few times before with me. It doesn’t surprise me.’ No problem: Andy Murraym who hit the All England Club practice courts on Sunday, has defended his appointment of Amelie Mauresmo . Hitting out: Wimbledon legend Virginia Wade has been critical of Murray's decision to hire Mauresmo . Wade has expressed disapproval of Murray’s on-court demeanour in the past. As for her opinion of Mauresmo, she was probably expressing a view that others share but have been afraid to voice. The bottom line is that only Murray can judge if the French former world No 1 is the right person to work with him, and he emphasised that the initial phase of their relationship had gone well. ‘She struggled with nerves and conquered them later in her career,’ he said. ‘Someone like that can help more than  someone who hasn’t had those issues. You can talk about her accomplishments — she was No 1 in the world, she won multiple Grand Slams, she had a creative game style. She’s very easy to communicate with and she’s firm. Those are the reasons I wanted to give it a shot.’ Happy days: British No 1 Murray was looking in relaxed spirits ahead of his Wimbledon title defence . Up and away: Murray puts in some practice on his serve during his session on Sunday . Keeping up appearances: Murray impressed with some keepy uppies during his practice session . On the ball: Mauresmo looks on as Murray returns during his practice session . Murray said he did not know how he would feel stepping on court to face Belgium’s world No 104 David Goffin as he tries to avoid the fate of Lleyton Hewitt, who in 2003 was the last men’s defending champion to go out in the first round. ‘I haven’t spoken to Lleyton,’ said Murray. ‘The only person I’ve spoken to about it is  Amelie, but I’m aware that when I walk on court there’s going to be pressure. That’s why when I woke up there were butterflies, but that’s a good thing.’ The traditional champion’s Sunday press conference was not a particularly straight-forward affair, and Murray studiously avoided being drawn by the now-customary attempt to goad him into saying something controversial about the England football team. Such associated pressures aside, it is potentially a very awkward match as Goffin is better than his ranking suggests. He has a decent game for grass and can lift his game against better opponents.The 23-year-old Belgian was in confident mood as he contemplated inflicting more misery on our sporting nation. High hopes: Belgium's David Goffin is hoping to provide an early upset when he takes on Murray on Centre Court . ‘I saw England is out of the World Cup, I saw that England lost to New Zealand at rugby — so maybe in tennis it will be the same,’ he said. ‘It’s the first time I’ve played on Centre Court and it will be an honour to open the tournament. I played against Novak Djokovic at Roland Garros last year and played Roger Federer there. I’ve played Tomas Berdych at the US Open. ‘Usually, I use the pressure and the emotion to play a good match and hope it will be the same against Andy.’ Goffin also sees an omen in what was achieved 12 months ago by fellow Liege resident Steve Darcis, who beat Rafael Nadal in the first round. All begins again: Murray will be bedding to successfully defend the Wimbledon title he memorably won last year against Novak Djokovic . ‘He had that small chance and he took it. Maybe I can do the same this year against Andy,’ said Goffin. ‘Myself and Steve speak a lot although we haven’t spoken about my draw yet. We’ll do that tonight. ‘What he did gives me encouragement. If he can do it then why can’t I? If I have a small opportunity and Andy is a little bit tight you never know. I have nothing to lose. I have been at 42 in the world; my goal is to get back in the top 50 this year.’ The women’s champion, Marion Bartoli, was also back at Wimbledon — a year after Mauresmo helped coach her to the title. ‘Everyone brings a little one or two per cent to the table,’ said Bartoli. ‘Amelie gave me the extra confidence boost that I really needed.’ Bartoli, who admitted that a legacy of her tennis career is that she now struggles to lift her right arm due to shoulder damage, explained: ‘Sometimes just knowing I could win was what I was lacking. Amelie makes you feel very comfortable in a difficult situation.’ If Murray gets off to a slow start against Goffin, that is exactly the place where he may find himself.","Andy Murray begins Wimbledon defence against David Goffin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A trucker was driving through Illinois last week when he says a police officer sped past him going way above the speed limit - while chatting on his cellphone. Brian Miner decided to take the law into his own hands and honked his horn repeatedly, prompting the officer to pull over. In a video posted to YouTube by Miner, the officer undergoes an amazing transformation once he realizes he's being filmed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pulled over: The officer approached Miner's truck to ask him why he honked his horn at him and forced him to pull over . None too pleased at being pulled over by Miner, the officer is confrontational and resorts to outright lies when Miner questions him on his actions. 'You pulled me over with your horn, I don't know what that was about,' says the officer. 'Because you were speeding and had your cellphone in your hand,' replies Miner. 'Police officers can actually use technology when we're driving,' the officer responds, stretching the truth somewhat. 'Oh, so you guys are above the law?' the trucker asks. The officer asks Miner for his license and the officer questions him on how fast he was driving. 'You passed me! Are you above the speed limit as well?' says Miner, adding that the officer was going well above 70mph, the speed limit. Cop on camera: When he realizes he's being filmed, the officer retracts a previous statement about police being allowed to use technology while driving and says in fact, he doesn't remember using his phone at all . Playing nice: The officer says he won't write Miner a ticket for unlawful use of horn and tells him to 'enjoy that violation-free MCS inspection' The officer tells Miner he's going to write him a ticket for 'unlawful use of horn.' That's . when Miner lets the officer know that he's being recorded. And . strangely, when the officer begins to try and recover the situation. He claims that he was traveling at 70mph and then tells Miner he's decided not to write him a ticket. 'I didn't want to hurt your record,' he says. He then says he's done an inspection on the trucks and that Miner has no violations, 'which will look good to your company.' Turning the tables: Miner ends the video by turning the camera on himself and saying, 'And that's what happens when they know you're recording.' He even offers to put away Miner's registration papers before speaking to Miner, man to man. 'Honestly, I wasn't paying attention to my speed,' says the officer. He also now says he doesn't remember having his phone on him and that it is not OK for him to be on his phone while driving. 'We're all out here sharing the same road. You should be held accountable to the same standards I am.' 'Enjoy that violation-free MCS inspection,' the officer says, telling Miner to 'take care.' Miner turns the camera on himself.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Autumn Pasquale's 16-year-old killer pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter today after admitting he strangled and choked the Clayton Middle School student to death last October. Justin Robinson was 15 when he was arrested alongside his brother Donte, then 17, in Clayton, New Jersey, just days after the 12-year-old girl went missing in 2012. Robinson was 'voluntarily waved to adult court' during his hearing on Wednesday morning and pleaded guilty to Judge Walter Marshall Jr, NJ.com reported. Autumn Pasquale was brutally murdered in October in her hometown of Clayton, New Jersey, . Clues: Justin Robinson 'liked' the Facebook page set up to find Autumn despite allegedly knowing she was already dead . The teenager now faces up to 17 years . in prison for the crime, 85 per cent of which must be completed before . he's eligible for parole. His brother Donte also faces charges but today's hearing only focused on Justin, who will be sentenced in September. Autumn Pasquale's body was found in a recycling bin on an abandoned property next door to the brothers' home. She was found just days after she went missing in October and the brothers were arrested within hours of her body being located. Police believe the teens lured 12-year-old 'tomboy' Autumn to their home under the pretense of trading bike parts and killed her. An autopsy concluded she had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of sexual assault. Just three months after her killing, Autumn's parents began fighting over the money that community members donated to help ease . the financial burdens of their daughter's tragic death. Guilty: Justin (pictured left) plead guilty today to choking Autumn last October. His brother Dante Robinson (pictured right) is also being charged with the murder . Evidence? Authorities did not confirm the bike was the one belonging to Autumn, but it matched the description of the white BMX she was seen riding Saturday afternoon before she disappeared . Evidence: An investigator loads a BMX bicycle into a police van after it was removed from the house where the body of Autumn Pasquale was found . The divorced parents, Jennifer Cornwell and Anthony Pasquale, were squabbling over $100,000 in memorial donations. Heartbroken . members of the community in Clayton donated the money - first to secure . a reward when Autumn went missing on October 20, and later to pay for . funeral expenses after her body was found stuffed in a recycling bin at a . neighbor's house. Autumn's . mother Jennifer filed a lawsuit against her ex-husband Anthony in . February after he removed her name from the memorial fund bank account, . which had about $85,000 remaining. She . asked a judge to give her half the money and order Anthony Pasquale to . stop making decisions about Autumn's grave site and headstone without . her. Autumn's . disappearance in October brought together the southern New Jersey town . where she lived and - briefly - reunited her parents who had been . separated since  2002. Ms . Cornwell, said her ex-husband took Cornwell’s name off the memorial . fund bank account that they had agreed to control together to pay for . their daughter’s funeral, legal expenses and help with the college . education for their two surviving children. Devastated: Autumn's mother and father, Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell, said their daughter was treated 'like a piece of trash' Life cut short: Authorities found some of Autumn¿s belongings in the teens' house including the white BMX bike she was last seen riding when she left her West High Street home in the New Jersey town . Autumn Pasquale's mother Jennifer Cornwell and father Anthony Pasquale seen after her muder . She also says her ex-husband had refused to consult her on what the girl’s headstone should say. Ms Cornwell asked a judge to split the memorial fund so that each parent could have partial control and to bar Mr Pasquale from completing the headstone design without Ms Cornwell’s input. Court filings lay out acrimony between the girls’ parents: Cornwell moved out in 2002 when her children were 4, 3, and 1 years old. Though the parents legally had joint custody, they spent most of their time living with their father. The couple were divorced in 2005, seven years after they married. Grim discovery: Gloucester County prosecutors found the body of Autumn Pasquale in a bin just blocks from her house . Cornwell says her ex-husband did not inform her that their middle daughter was missing until two hours after police were called on October 20. Pasquale says his ex-wife picked up items left at a funeral home by mourners without his permission. She contends he said it would be OK. He also says she was wrong to withhold money from a fundraiser from the fund. She says the money - a $15,500 check plus unspecified cash - is in a safe-deposit box where she placed it after learning she no longer had control of the bank account. OCTOBER 20, 2012: Autumn Pasquale, who was a week away from her 13th birthday, was last seen riding her BMX bicycle, leaving her home in Clayton, New Jersey. Authorities – from the Gloucester County police to the FBI – joined the search. Her father, Tony Pasquale, told NBC News at the time that the disappearance was ‘not like her'. OCTOBER 21: Hundreds of people gathered at a local church to hand out flyers and form search parties for the freckled blonde. OCTOBER 22: Hundreds more join search efforts for Autumn, spanning into Delaware and New York. After sunset, worried friends and family held a candlelit vigil to pray for her safe return. Not long after the vigil ended, authorities said that they discovered her 5ft2in body dumped in a recycling container five blocks from her home. OCTOBER 23: A press conference was held in the afternoon to say that two brothers, aged 15 and 17, had been arrested for Autumn’s murder. Authorities also said that the brother’s mother, spotting a suspicious post on Facebook, turned them into police. AUGUST 7, 2013: Justin Robinson, now 16, pleads guilty to aggravated manslaughter. He will be sentenced in September.","Justin Robinson faces 17 years in prison for Autumn Pasquale's death but will be sentenced in September .

"By . Meghan Keneally . It appears Kris Humphries has struck a deal to auction off the engagement ring that he gave to Kim Kardashian during their ill-fated romance, MailOnline has learned. The NBA star is said to be selling the Lorraine Schwartz ring that he gave to Kardashian at an upcoming Christie's auction in New York. The ring is expected to sell for between $300,000 and $500,000- which is less than a quarter of the price that the ring was said to have cost originally. Bling: Kim's former 20-carat sparkler was used by Humphries to propose to Kim back in May 2011 . Return: Kim returned her former engagement ring to Kris following their divorce . Same cut: The seller of the ring is known only as 'a gentleman' but the description exactly matches the ring Humphries gave Kim Kardashian (pictured left and right) before their 72-day marriage . An 'impressive' ring made by Lorraine Schwartz, a designer and Kardashian family friend, is featured as part of the upcoming October 15 auction titled 'Bright and Beautiful'. Humphries has not publicly stated that he is selling his ex's ring, and the owner of the item is only listed as the 'property of a gentleman', but the dimensions of the sparkler are the exact same as that of the ring that once belonged to Kardashian. It is made up of a 16.21-carat rectangular cut diamond which is then flanked by a 1.80-carat diamond on either side. All told, that adds up to just under 20-carats which is very close to the descriptions of Kardashian's ring, as it was said to be just over 20-carats. Showing off: Kim proudly displayed the ring that Humphries paid for. It ended up going to him in the divorce because he argued that their marriage was a sham and she did not deserve to keep the ring as a result . Sold: Earlier this month, Kim's bling was finally sold at auction for a cool $749,000 . Pictures of the ring show that the ring listed at Christie's and the bauble that the reality star flaunted following their May 18, 2011 engagement and the entirety of their 72-day marriage are a perfect match. Though the discrepancies in the carat size are slight, the gap between what Humphries was said to have paid for the ring and its current estimate is much wider. When Humphries popped the question after a whirlwind six-month romance, the ring was said to cost $2million. A family friend of the Kardashians said that Humphries reportedly 'got a great deal' by working with jeweller Lorraine Schwartz, who had designed for the Kardashian clan for years. Happier times: The two have since moved past their 72-day marriage, and their annulment proceedings actually lasted longer than their wedded union . Because of the estimate of the Christie's jewellery experts, it appears that he paid far less for the ring than reported at the time. The bad publicity following the Humphries-Kardashian divorce that lasted longer than their marriage may have had an effect on the sale. Christie's press representative Gabriel Ford told MailOnline that their team of experts 'estimate on what they deem it worth at this time (of the auction)'. The auction house also specified that a portion of the ring’s sale will be donated to charity by the owner, though the name of the charity has not been announced nor has the percentage of the sale price. New man: Kardashian is now dating Kanye West, and the pair's daughter North was born on June 15 .","A 16 carat ring matching the description of Kardashian's engagement ring is being anonymously auctioned by Christies .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron is now less popular with voters than the Tory party, a new poll shows for the first time. There has been a ‘noticeable shift’ against the Prime Minister in recent months, according to polling by former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft. The Tory party has also been damaged by recent rows over gay marriage and Europe, with only one in four voters now believing Mr Cameron’s party is united. Popularity: Voters are now feel more favourable towards the Tories than David Cameron personally, reversing a long-term trend that saw the Prime Minister outpoll his party . Months of Tory in-fighting has hit the party’s reputation with voters while also tarnishing Mr Cameron’s own standing. Strategists had argued that the Prime Minister was more popular with the public than the Conservative party as a whole. It was seen as a key rebuttal to those in the Tory party who calling for a change in direction or even a change in leader. But . the polling shows that 22 per cent of those questioned said they were . more favourably disposed towards the Conservative Party as a whole while . only 18 per cent were more positive about Mr Cameron. Lord Ashcroft said it was the first . time this had happened in his polling. He blamed the Tory setbacks on . the party putting people off by ‘talking amongst ourselves’ about . peripheral issues like Europe and gay marriage rather than focusing on . voters' core priorities. He . issued a warning to the party's leadership that there was ‘no time to . waste’, and said it was vital for Chancellor George Osborne's spending . review later this month to show that Tories are doing what the public . want from them. In . particular the Tories have lost ground on key issues like crime, . immigration, welfare reform and the economy over the early months of . this year. Overall, 37 per . cent of those questioned said they would vote Labour, 27 per cent . Conservative, 15 per cent the UK Independence Party and 9 per cent . Liberal Democrat. Switch: Voters are now more favourable towards the Tory party generally than David Cameron, polling by Lord Ashcroft shows although the Labour party received the best reaction . Words: Pollsters asked were asked which words they most associated with the three party leaders here . It gives Ed Miliband's party a comfortable 10-point lead, but Lord Ashcroft noted that this was ‘not much of a score for an opposition party expecting to sweep to power in 23 months' time’. Mr Miliband was hugely out-polled by the Labour party, by 38 per cent to just 10 per cent. A majority still said they would prefer to have Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband in Downing Street, and the Prime Minister and Chancellor retained their lead over Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls as the best team to manage the economy. A Labour candidate in a key target seat has criticised the party's leadership. Sharon Taylor, hoping to over-turn a 3,500 Tory majority in Stevenage, complained that under Tony Blair in 1997 the party was able to capture 'a very broad electorate'. Speaking at a meeting of the Blairite think tank Progress, she said the party had to do more to explain what it would do in government. 'We’ve got to both oppose and . propose an alternative.' The leader of Stevenage Council also questioned the party's economic strategy with shadow chancellor Ed Balls. She added: 'We’ve let the Tories and others get away with blaming Labour for the economic crisis, and we urgently need to counter that.' The Government's lead over Labour on the economy widened by several points if Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was named in the question as one of a three-man team alongside Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne. Writing on the ConservativeHome website, Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The Prime Minister's Europe speech (in January) was supposed to clear the decks and allow us to talk about the things we were elected to do. So much for all that. ‘My poll shows the last six months to have been a missed opportunity to make progress on all the things that will determine who wins in 2015... This is the price we have paid for spending half a year talking amongst ourselves.’ For the Tories, the first half of the year was ‘a time of stagnation that we could hardly afford’, said the Tory peer, adding: ‘The spending review later this month makes it all the more necessary to show we are doing what people expect of us. There is no more time to waste.’ Voters were asked whicvh words and phrases they associated with the three party leaders. Mr Cameron was branded 'out of touch' but also a leader who 'stands up for Britain'. Mr Miliband is seen predominantly as 'weak' and 'out of his depth', while Mr Clegg is 'weak', 'out of his depth', and 'out of touch'. The poll found that only 28 per cent of voters see the Conservatives as ‘united’, against 48 per cent for Labour. Some 38 per cent trusted Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to manage the economy, compared with 33 per cent for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls. But 40 per cent trusted Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and Mr Clegg with the economy, against 26 per cent for the Labour team, suggesting that Lib Dem influence on the coalition's economic policy is welcomed by voters. Of those questioned, 24 per cent said they were satisfied with the job Mr Cameron is doing as PM, and a further 33 per cent say they are dissatisfied but would prefer to have him in Downing Street than Mr Miliband. Only 30 per cent would rather see the Labour leader in Number 10. Some 40 per cent said they expect a Labour government after the next election, while 29 per cent forecast a Conservative government, 13 per cent another Conservative-Lib Dem coalition and 18 per cent a Labour-Lib Dem pact. Some 2,060 adults were interviewed online and 1,007 by telephone between May 31 and June 2.","18% are favourable about Prime Minister compared to 22% for Tory party .

"By . Paul Sims . Updated: . 14:31 EST, 2 December 2011 . Two toddlers had to be treated in hospital after being mistakenly served industrial cleaning fluid instead of water at a restaurant. One-year-old Daniel Martin began coughing violently after gulping from a beaker in the incident at a Toby Carvery. His parents Phil and Claire Martin raised the alarm after they sipped the drink and found it tasted of bleach. Rushed to hospital: Daniel Martin, pictured with his mother Claire, began coughing violently after gulping from a beaker which contained industrial cleaning fluid . The child’s cup had been accidentally filled with a chemical used to clean pipes, which had been left in an unmarked jug and was picked up by the waiting staff. Daniel was taken to hospital after the discovery and was treated for chemical burns to his mouth and throat. The family had been visiting friends Stuart and Diane  Watkinson, whose daughter Sophie, 16 months, also drank from a  contaminated cup and needed  hospital treatment. Both families are now demanding a guarantee from the dining chain that the mix-up can never  be repeated. Last night, Mrs Martin, 37, a welfare adviser, described how she and her tram driver husband, Stuart, 35, had been at the table with  Daniel and sister Rebekah, four. ‘When Daniel began to cough we were encouraging him to sip more water, which was obviously just making it worse,’ said Mrs Martin, from Bury. ‘At the same time, Stuart and myself took the lids off the  children’s cups. I put it to my mouth and immediately it smelt like bleach. Blunder: Staff at this Toby Carvery near Sheffield mixed up pipe cleaning fluid and water. Fortunately it had been diluted so more serious injury was avoided . ‘The barmaid came and said: “I’m really sorry, we’ve used the pipe fluid”. I didn’t believe her at first. ‘The manager called the ambulance and gave us a bottle of the cleaner to show us and to show to the doctors. ‘We had to wait several hours for the poisons unit to run the tests. ‘The fluid in the pipes had been diluted. The doctors told us that if it was neat, it would be strong enough to dissolve tissue in the body.’ The accident happened at a Toby Carvery in Ecclesall Road South, Sheffield. Mr Watkinson said that when he took a sip of the water Sophie had been drinking he ‘couldn’t believe it’. Claire and Phil Martin were shocked when baby Daniel, pictured centre next to his sister Rebekah, was fed bleach by Toby Carvery staff . ‘To know my child had drunk such a dangerous substance through no fault of her own made me absolutely furious. ‘A moment’s carelessness could have devastated our lives. It just doesn’t bear thinking about how things could have turned out.’ Kathryn Baines, a public liability solicitor at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘It beggars belief that this hazardous liquid was, as we understand it, left in a water jug without any warning or hazard signs to identify it. Pipe cleaner is a highly dangerous substance, especially if consumed, and this basic error in health and safety procedures could have had utterly devastating consequences.’ The restaurant chain, owned by leisure group Mitchells and  Butlers, said staff have been retrained in cleaning practices  following the incident in May. A spokesman said: ‘We can confirm Toby Carvery has admitted liability and are currently in  correspondence with Mr and Mrs  Martin’s solicitors. The safety and well-being of our customers is our primary concern.’","One-year-olds Daniel Martin and Sophie Watkinson rushed to hospital with injuries to mouth and throat .

"By . David Kent . Look away now, England fans.  As if Thursday's night's result wasn't bad enough, Bloomberg Sports have now claimed Roy Hodgson's side have only a measly 13 per cent chance of progressing from Group D. England are relying on Italy to beat both Costa Rica and Uruguay if they are to stand any hope of qualifying for the knockout phase of the World Cup; but their chances of doing so stand at only 12.9 per cent, according to the world's leaders in sports analytics technology. Italy, who beat England in their Group D clash on Saturday, have a healthy 86 per cent chance of making the last 16 while Costa Rica, whom the Italians face later on Friday, have a 1 in 2 hope of progressing to the latter stages of the competition. Not all white on the night: Steven Gerrard and Co are facing World Cup elimination after Thursday night's defeat . Table: England are facing an uphill challenge to progress to the last 16 after losing both of their games so far . VIDEO Hodgson needs Italian miracle . Uruguay, with a fit and firing Luis Suarez to call upon following his brace against the Three Lions, have a 47 per cent hope of progressing from Group D. Meanwhile, former England winger Chris Waddle was among those to hit out at England's lacklustre display. The former England winger turned on the culture of the Premier League after watching the Three Lions fall to the brink of World Cup exit. Focussing on the impact he feels the Premier League - and its foreign players - has on the side he won 62 caps for, he said: 'I'm not angry, I'm just fed up of talking about the same old problems. 'I'll tell you what the biggest problem is when you think about it all - the Premier League. They have a product which they sell around the world. It's entertaining but it's doing our players no good whatsoever. King of the castle: Luis Suarez celebrates with his Uruguay team-mates at the final whistle . Dejection: England fans are dealt yet more heartache after watching their team slump to a successive defeat . 'This (England) is a Premier League side playing tonight which is meant to be the best league in the world. You're not telling me all those Uruguayan players would get in many teams around the world, apart from (Luis) Suarez who was only 75 per cent fit. (Edinson) Cavani possibly. Apart from that, who else is there?' The former Sheffield Wendesday man went on to add that he feels it is players like two-goal Suarez who makes the Premier League what it is. ""We go on banging the drum that we've got this and that.. Do you know what makes the Premier League exciting? Players like Luis Suarez - the foreign players,' he said. Back of the net: Liverpool's Suarez scores the decisive goal in Uruguay's 2-1 victory over England . 'We hype our players up massively like we always do, say we've got this and that. 'Look at their (Uruguay's) back four tonight. The kid at centre-half (Jose Maria Giminez) he's played two games for Atletico Madrid, he's not had a cap, but they know how to win games. 'The difference between Premier League football and international football is how to win a football match. It's not about picking your star players, he plays for Liverpool, he plays for Man U, it's about getting a balance in the side to get a result and we never, ever do.'","Three Lions facing World Cup exit after miserable 2-1 defeat on Thursday .

"By . Jim Mcbeth . Gott im Himmel! The country’s most famous war comic has crossed to the other side. Unthinkable as it may be to generations of readers, Commando For Action And Adventure – better known as Commando comics – has been in the hands of the enemy for a month. A legion of fans, including British troops in Afghanistan, will be shell-shocked to learn that the comic is being printed in Germany. Shock: Commando comics, which tell tales of British derring-do in the Second World War, are now being printed in Germany . Popular: The patriotic content of the comics has not stopped them moving outside Britain to be printed . Hugely popular: The publication has been printed in the UK for the last 52 years . But the good news is that ownership of . the last war comic of its kind in Britain is still firmly in Allied . hands – at the Dundee headquarters of D C Thomson. Hugely popular since it first appeared in 1961, the publication has been printed in the UK for the past 52 years. But the publisher, which is also . renowned for the Beano and the Dandy, has taken a ‘commercial’ decision . to place responsibility for printing in the hands of the old enemy. A . spokesman for the firm said: ‘Commando is still a D C Thomson . publication. ‘Since the beginning of May, Commando . has been printed by St Ives Management Services Ltd at the plant of . their sub-contractor GGP Media, in Germany.’ D C Thomson promised that Commando . readers will continue to receive ‘the same top-quality product with rich . illustrations and exciting storylines’. GGP Media is based in Possneck, . Thuringia – near where the revolutionary Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter . jets were being built in an underground weapons factory in the Second . World War. But the switch to a new printing plant . in ‘enemy territory’ is unlikely to diminish the appeal of an iconic . publication which has entranced generations of schoolboys – and more . than a few of their fathers. More than 4,600 editions of Commando . have been published and  at the peak of its popularity, in  the 1970s, . it had a circulation  of 750,000. Today it is available in a digital . format but ‘hard copies’ of the four comics published every fortnight . are still read by nearly 10,000 military buffs. In the early years, all . of Commando stories were devoted to the Second World War, presenting . gripping if simplistic tales of grizzled British ‘Tommies’ facing down . dastardly Germans or cruel, crazed Japanese. Legendary illustrators such as Gordon . Livingstone, Ian Kennedy and Ken Barr used a variety of artistic styles . and a rich colour palette in the 64-page ‘novels’ to portray British and . Commonwealth soldiers at war. Headquarters: The office building of leading comic books publisher D.C. Thomson in Dundee . Plant: But D.C. Thomson, which received a royal visit this month, is not printing Commando in-house . In more recent times, the comic has . extended its range to include a  variety of conflicts such as Korea, the . Cold War, the Spanish Civil War and the Falklands conflict. But the . most popular war comic of its kind has always stuck to the same . characteristic motifs of courage, patriotism, noble actions – and making . a refreshing cup of tea while in the face of danger. The comics are hugely popular in . countries such as Finland and Norway, and have been published in several . languages, including Hindi. They are also popular with the . soldiers of today.

FIFA is investigating a remarkable bust-up at the World Cup after claims Chile striker Mauricio Pinilla was punched by Brazil's communications director Rodrigo Paiva at half-time during Saturday's match. Paiva, a well-known figure in Brazilian football, has admitted to shoving Pinilla but said that he only did so in self-defence. Ouch? Mauricio Pinilla involved in FIFA investigation after claiming to be hit by Brazil's communications director . Bad boy? Rodrigo Paiva has been accused of punching Pinilla at half-time of Saturday's Brazil vs Chile match . Scuffle: Paiva's alleged punch on Pinilla was sparked by Fred's (left) slap to Gary Medel's (right) head . Fight: Fred (left) and Medel (right) argued over the incident at the end of the first-half in their last 16 game . A FIFA spokeswoman told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro: 'We can confirm there has been an incident and the disciplinary committee is currently analysing the matter.' The disciplinary panel is believed to have access to video footage and pictures of the incident in Belo Horizonte. A scuffle broke out as the teams headed to the dressing rooms in the Mineirao Stadium, sparked by Brazil striker Fred slapping Chile striker Gary Medel on the back of the head as they walked off the pitch. Brazil media said Paiva and Chile assistant boss Sebastian Beccacece were involved in a confrontation which ended in the Brazil official punching Pinilla. Paiva told Brazilian reporters there was widespread pushing between the two squads, and said: ""It was not just me. Pinilla came towards me and I just defended myself. I reacted by pushing him."" Pinilla, who plays for Italian side Cagliari, came off the bench and nearly won the match for Chile but his shot in the last seconds of the match struck the cross-bar. The striker was then one of three Chile players to miss penalties in the shoot-out which Brazil won 3-2 to go through to the quarter-finals.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Have you ever written a comment, or Facebook status, before deciding not to post it? According to new Facebook research, 70 per cent of us do this regularly. The study found that men are more likely to 'self-censor' their social network posts, compared to women, and this is especially the case if they have a lot of male friends. More surprising, however, is the reason why the site knows this information - because it can track what you type, even if you never post it. A Facebook data scientist studied the HTML code of 3.7 million profiles to discover 71% of users regularly type comments and statuses before deciding not to post them. The study, also found men are more likely to abandon a post on the social network site, than women . Data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking code in the HTML form element of each page. This form element is made up of HTML code that controls the boxes Facebook users type in to, including the status update box. Each time characters are entered into . one of these boxes, scientists can track the changes in the HTML code. The researchers were also able to track typing in the comment box on . statuses, photos and other posts. To be clear, Facebook can’t track the . exact keys pressed, and it doesn’t monitor keystrokes. This means the . code doesn’t reveal what is being typed. However, Facebook can track when . characters and words are typed, how many are typed, and if the typed . characters are deleted or abandoned. For the study ‘Self-censorship on Facebook’, data scientist Adam Kramer who works for the social network, and student Sauvik Das, studied the profiles of 3.7 millions users by tracking the HTML form element of each page. This element is made up of HTML code that controls the boxes Facebook users type in to, including the status update box.

This means the code doesn’t reveal what is being typed. However, Facebook can track when characters and words are typed, how many are typed, and if the typed characters are deleted or abandoned. For the purposes of the study, a self-censored updated was classed as entry into either of the boxes of more than five characters that was typed but not posted for at least 10 minutes. The study found that 71 per cent of the sample users typed out a post but never submitted it, and on average this worked out at 4.52 abandoned statuses and 3.2 abandoned comments. Data scientists can determine that a status or comment has been typed by tracking the HTML form element of each page. This element is made up of HTML code that controls the boxes Facebook users type in to, including the status update box, pictured. Facebook can't see the exact characters being typed, just the amount . Kramer and Das spent 17 days looking at 3.7 million profiles to track these ‘aborted status updates, posts on other people’s timelines, and comments on others’ posts.’ From their findings, they were also able to establish that male users self-censored more posts than females.They also censored their posts more among groups of male friends. This chart shows the number of censored posts and comments. A self-censored update was an entry of more than five characters that was typed but not posted . However, men and women were found to censor the same number of comments on other people’s posts. According to the study, Facebook users that have a wide range, and ‘diverse set of friends in fewer distinct communities’ self-censor less than people with more ‘homogenous’ friendship groups. The researchers concluded that while 71 per cent of users did last-minute self-censor at least once, they suspect, all users employ last-minute self-censorship on Facebook at some point. 'The remaining 29 per cent of users in our sample likely didn’t have a chance to self-censor over the short duration of the study,' said the researchers. 'Surprisingly, however, we found that relative rates of self-censorship were quite high: 33 per cent of all potential posts written by our sample users were censored, and 13 per cent of all comments. 'The decision to self-censor also seems to be driven by two simple principles: People censor more when their audience is hard to define, and people censor more when they relevance or topicality of a ‘space’ is narrower.’'","A Facebook data scientist studied the profiles of 3.7 million users .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Nine out of ten Britons would feel stressed if their mobile phone battery ran out, research shows (file image) A dead battery in a smartphone would cause stress for more than nine out of 10 Britons, a new survey has found. According to the research, carried out by smartphone add-on maker mophie, 92 per cent of British people would feel stressed if the battery in their smartphone ran out, highlighting the increasing dependence we place on technology. The survey found that the number one issue for smartphone owners without battery power is the inability to make or receive calls, with 59 per cent citing this as the biggest issue. The research also found that beyond stress, a range of negative emotions would be brought on in users if their battery ran out. 61 per cent said they would become frustrated, with 25 per cent saying they would feel panicked. Kevin Malinowski, a spokesman for . mophie, which makes Juice Pack and other power boosts for mobiles, said: 'Millions of people rely on their smartphones daily to . stay in touch with loved ones and do work on the move. 'But all of these activities hinge on a single factor: having enough juice to keep the phones running.' The results also emphasised the reliance we place on smartphones, with almost half of those surveyed saying that if their mobile phone died they would only be able to remember three phone numbers at best. Such is the reliance that more than 70 per cent said they would give up having pudding after a meal or watching TV in order to have a fully charged smartphone for a month. However, the survey also found that the impact of smartphones on daily life goes beyond just emotion, with 81 per cent saying that their smartphone dying led them to have a negative experience. These ranged from missing an important call to making a friend or loved one angry and not being able to access needed information. Research by mophie, a smartphone case maker, also revealed 61 per cent of people would get frustrated and 25 per cent would panic if their battery died (file photo) The findings come just days after a new report found that many young people in the UK have felt at some point that they are addicted to the internet. In order to combat this addiction, which was acknowledged by more than 39 per cnet of those asked, experts have suggest people should resist the urge of taking their devices to bed, and try to have set unplugged periods during the week.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Google has started to remove search results, following last month's 'right to be forgotten' ruling. Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which led to the tech giant being bombarded with requests. Searches for people’s names now include a message at the bottom of the results page that says results ‘may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’. This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched for, and is not an indicator that the specific person has requested links be deleted. Google has started to remove search results, following last month's 'right to be forgotten' ruling. Users now see a message that reads results 'may have been removed' (pictured). This warning appears on all results, regardless of the name that has been searched, and is not an indicator they have requested links be deleted . A Google spokesman told MailOnline: ‘This week, we’re starting to take action on the removals requests that we’ve received. ‘This is a new process for us. Each request has to be assessed individually and we’re working as quickly as possible to get through the queue. ‘We’ll continue to work with data protection authorities and others as we implement this ruling.’ Last . month’s decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which . affects 500 million citizens, requires that search services remove . information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' - and . failure to do so can result in fines. European . citizens can submit take-down requests directly to internet companies . rather than to local authorities or publishers under the ruling. If a . search engine elects not to remove the link, a person can seek redress . from the courts. Last month's decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union requires that search services remove information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' and failure to do so can result in fines. The ruling was made by the European Union Court of Justice, pictured . Under the European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This particularly relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data.’ The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. Last month, a MailOnline investigation uncovered that a man convicted of possessing child pornography, a misbehaving politician seeking re-election and a doctor with bad reviews, were among the flood of people who contacted Google demanding that their internet histories be deleted. Legal experts have commented that the criteria for determining which take-down requests are legitimate, is not completely clear from the EU court’s decision. Google has therefore had to painstakingly sort through the requests and last week sent notifications to people who requested a removal, asking them to bear with the search engine. It began removing the first results under the European data law yesterday, and plans on ramping up the speed of the process when it is sure that the systems put in place are effective. Google is starting its work now to show good faith in complying with the ruling, which it did not greet with enthusiasm last month. Following the ruling, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told the company’s annual shareholder meeting: 'There's many open questions.’ 'A simple way of understanding what happened here is that you have a collision between a right to be forgotten and a right to know. From Google's perspective that's a balance. 'Google believes having looked at the decision, which is binding, that the balance that was struck was wrong.’ The company is now keen to be transparent about the modification of its search results, which is why it is showing the message: ‘Your results may have been modified under data protection law in Europe,’ for all name search results, expect for celebrities. This is so that notices do not appear next to certain individuals, but the notice could evolve over time. Google is also notifying people who made ‘right to be forgotten’ requests that have been turned down, as well as those where more information is required. The tech giant is not new to notice-and-takedown removals, to do with defamation, for example. It also has experience dealing with take-down requests in its YouTube video website, which has a process to remove uploads that infringe copyrights. But the ruling marks an entirely new process for search engines. Google is the dominant search engine in Europe, commanding about 93 per cent of the market, according to StatCounter global statistics. Microsoft Corp's Bing has 2.4 per cent and Yahoo Inc has 1.7 per cent. A spokesman for Microsoft's Bing told MailOnline: 'We’re currently working on a special process for residents of the European Union to request blocks of specific privacy-related search results on Bing in response to searches on their names. 'Given the many questions that have been raised about how the recent ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union should be implemented, developing an appropriate system is taking us some time.  We’ll be providing additional information about making requests soon.'","Move follows Court of Justice of the European Union's ruling last month .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Jesus is the most important person history, according to a new internet search programme that ranks Napoleon second and Mohammed third. The software, developed in the US, scours the internet for opinions expressed about famous people and uses a special algorithm to predict how important they will remain 200 years after their death. And it has thrown up some unusual and potentially embarrassing results with Prime Minister David Cameron all the way down in 1,483rd place. Jesus is the most famous person in history according to a software programme that scours the internet to rank people's importance . The highest ranked Briton on the list is William Shakespeare in fourth place, who comes above US presidents Abraham Lincoln (fifth) and George Washington (sixth). Adolf Hitler is ranked at number seven, Aristotle at eight, while Alexander the Great at nine and another US president Thomas Jefferson help make up the top 10. Kings and Queens of England rank highly with Henry VIII in 11th place, Elizabeth I in 13th, Queen Victoria in 16th and Charles I in 39th, although Oliver Cromwell, the leader of the short-lived Commonwealth of England following the civil war, is not far behind at number 50. Surprisingly Nelson Mandela ranks only 356th well below President Barack Obama at 111th and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 271st. Lasting impression: William Shakespeare was in fourth place while Napoleon was deemed the second most important person in history . Steven Skiena, professor of computer science at Stony Brook University, in New York and one of the people behind the programme said the algorithm can also be used to measure social changes, notably the importance of women in society. He told the Sunday Times: 'We can prove that women have required substantially greater achievement levels than men - equivalent to around four IQ points - to get noticed for posterity'. Mozart is the highest ranking musician on the list at 24th, Beethoven follows in 27th and Bach in 48th. Queen Elizabeth I was the highest ranking woman in 13th place, just two behind her father Henry VIII . Madonna, at 121st trumps Bob Dylan (130th) and John Lennon (162nd), however Elvis reigns as the most famous pop musician in 69th. Winston Churchill in 37th place is well beaten by Theodore Roosevelt in 23rd place and even by George W Bush who is one place ahead in 36th.

"By . Paul Thompson . Revelations: A book written by Amanda Knox 'will shock you the core', according to the lawyer . A book written by Amanda Knox 'will shock you the core', according to the lawyer who set up her $4m publishing deal. Robert Barnett insisted the autobiography 'Waiting to be Heard' will still be published next month despite an Italian court ordering a re-trial for Knox. The decision by Italy's highest court to overturn the 25 year old's acquittal for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher will also have no effect on her first TV interview to be broadcast on April 30th. Barnett said Knox's book about her arrest, trial and eventual release from jail in Italy is 'very parents nightmare.' He hinted that the book will contain major revelations that will help sway public opinion in favour of Knox. He said:'People will see when Amanda Knox goes public with her interview with Diane Sawyer on ABC [on April 30] that she is mature beyond her years. 'She is extremely smart. She has taken a set of experiences that are almost impossible to imagine and learned from them and marched through them with incredible dignity and respect. 'What she went through is in some ways every parent's nightmare, if not every person's nightmare. She was caught up in a set of terrible circumstances that were not her doing and lost 4½ years of her young life to an inappropriate and improper conviction. Retrial: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle on Sunday . 'While people know the story of the trial, they don't know the personal story, the family's story, the prison story and, believe it or not, the legal story.' Decision: Knox is to face a retrial over the  2007 murder of Meredith Kercher . He added to The Hollywood Reporter:'Aspects of that revealed in the book will shock you to the core.' Barnett helped negotiate an estimated $4m advance for 25 year old Knox following her return to her home in Seattle, Washington, from prison in Perugia, Italy. The Washington DC based lawyer has previously negotiated book deals for former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary. Yesterday Amanda Knox collapsed and had to be . supported by her boyfriend when she was told she would face a . retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher. The . American was at home with her family in Seattle when she received a . phone call at 2am telling her an Italian court had quashed her acquittal . for the killing. She . was shattered by the news, and turned to her lover James Terrano in an . attempt to 'keep positive' despite the new development. Knox, . 25, will not voluntarily return to Italy to stand trial, and is . unlikely to be extradited by her native U.S. - she will therefore . probably be tried in absentia. The colour ran from her face as she heard the news,' a source told the Sun. Her lawyer phoned her family home in . the early hours of the morning after she had gathered relatives and . friends together to wait for confirmation of the court's decision. Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four . years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds . DNA evidence was flawed . 'She hugged James and then the rest of the family,' the source said. 'They are trying to keep positive but it is hard.' Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year. Judges . accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case, quashing the . acquittal of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, . 29. In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, . who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared, were . told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old . British student. Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her . home town of Seattle, cannot be compelled by Italian law to . appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at . all. er lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said: . ‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial. Her home is in . Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’ Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder . He added that the decision to order a . new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he . said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’ Within minutes of the ruling, Knox . issued a statement condemning it. The girl known worldwide by her . self-awarded nickname 'Foxy Knoxy' said: ‘It was painful to receive the . news that the Italian supreme court decided to send my case back for . revision when the prosecution’s theory of my involvement in Meredith’s . murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and . unfair. ‘I believe that any questions as to my innocence must be examined by an objective investigation and a capable prosecution. ‘The prosecution responsible for the . many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for . Raffaele’s sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith’s . family.’","Knox was comforted by boyfriend James Terrano after news of retrial .

"Tragic: Daylan Walker, pictured, fell to his death from the Dorchester, Massachusetts facility Wednesday morning . A two-year-old boy has tragically died after he fell off the roof of his day care center. Police aren't releasing many details about Daylan Walker's tragic death at the Dorchester, Massachusetts facility Wednesday morning, but Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson confirmed the child fell to his death. 'Unfortunately, it sounds like the child was at some point left unattended,' Jackson, who visited the scene, told the Boston Globe. 'Sadly, part of our future is gone today.' The child appeared to have 'suffered fatal trauma after falling from a building,' a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said. His distraught mother Leonella Rivera said she dropped the boy at the center before heading to work. She said the day care texted her a picture of her son, showing he was happy, at around 9 a.m., but just 15 minutes later she received a call from police saying he was dead. Rivera is furious her son was left unsupervised long enough to make his way to the roof. 'He's been going to that daycare for two weeks and a half. How a 2-year-old baby got out of her house on the first floor and reached the roof, how? This is not fair,' she told 7News. 'Nothing like that should be done to any mother. My son was just a baby, was just growing up. I want justice for my son, I want justice.' Rivera, who has no other children, went on: 'This death of my son cannot just stay like that, we need to find out what really happened.' Jackson told 7News that investigators believe Daylan wandered out of his first floor day care center and walked up four flights of stairs before pushing through a heavy door onto the roof. That's when he apparently tumbled off. Scroll down for video . Furious: His distraught mother Leonella Rivera, pictured, is outraged that her son was left alone . High: The child reportedly fell from the top of the four story building, pictured, after climbing the stairs from the first floor . Jackson is demanding to know why the toddler was left alone and how he was able to push through the door. After Daylan's death, the city's Inspectional Services Department issued a violation report that found the door leading to the roof must be 'manually slammed shut to engage panic hardware.' A company called Urban Edge owns the building the day care center is housed in but the owner didn't comment on the violation. 'We're deeply saddened by the tragedy and are cooperating with all the authorities,' said Christal Kornegay, the company's president and chief executive officer, told the Globe. 'This is a nightmare,' the child's grandmother, Lucrecia Rivera, 42, told the newspaper in Spanish through an interpreter. She sobbed as she recalled how the little boy cried before he was dropped off at the center Wednesday morning and told her that he did not want to be left there. 'My only grandson, the light of this house,' she said. 'Where was I to save you from all these dangers? ... I would have rather died myself instead of him.' Scene: Boston Police Superintendent in Chief William G. Gross, who was at the scene, said police arrived just before 10 a.m. and found the boy lying on the pavement behind the building, pictured . Police have not confirmed whether the child fell from the roof or a window as the investigation is still ongoing, though all the windows were closed. They have also not confirmed there is even a daycare in the building, though one is registered and licensed to that address. Boston Police Superintendent in Chief William G. Gross, who was at the scene, said police arrived just before 10 a.m. and found the boy lying on the pavement behind the building. The child was immediately taken to Boston Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. A woman who lives near the Dorchester building described the horror scene Wednesday morning. Shanitqua Steele, 23, said she was coming home from dropping her 2-year-old son off at school when she heard sirens and saw neighbors crowding around. She saw a toddler lying face down at the base of the apartment. When emergency responders arrived, they turned him over. She said he didn't move but his eyes were open. 'I was like, ""Oh, god, this is a baby, he still has a diaper on,""' she told the Globe. The licensed day care center with a capacity of six children is run by Marisol Rondon-Ramos, according to the state Executive Office of Education's website. The woman was described as a 'very responsible person' and 'a very nice lady,' by people who know her.","Police aren't releasing many details about Daylan Walker's tragic death at the Dorchester, Massachusetts facility Wednesday morning .

"By . Sam Webb . Protestors supporting Russia's intervention in Crimea have clashed with police at rallies across the Ukraine, as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met in Paris in another bid to calm tensions. In Donetsk, pro-Moscow protesters stormed the railway station and were blocking trains to Kiev and Lviv. At a demonstration in Kharkiv today there were banners urging 'Russia -Save us', and pleading for a referendum on joining Moscow. Scroll down for video .

Tension: A woman and a child walk past a line of police officers while a rally takes place in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv . Statement: Pro-Russian Ukrainians in Kharkiv outline their feelings on Russia's actions in the Ukraine . Russia today set out demands for a . diplomatic resolution to the crisis in Ukraine, saying the former Soviet . republic should be unified in a federation allowing wide autonomy to . its various regions. After a brief call on French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Kerry sat down with Lavrov at the residence of the Russian ambassador to France to go over Moscow's response to a U.S. plan to de-escalate the situation as Russian troops continue to mass along the Ukrainian border. The men said nothing of substance as they shook hands, although after Kerry ended the photo op by thanking assembled journalists, Lavrov cryptically added, in English, 'Good luck, and good night'. Appearing on Russian television ahead of his talks with Kerry, Lavrov rejected suspicions that the deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops near Ukraine is a sign Moscow plans to invade the country following its annexation of the strategic Crimean peninsula. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, shakes hands with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov before the start of their meeting . The two men met at the Russian Ambassador's residence about the situation in Ukraine/ Kerry traveled to Paris for a last minute meeting with Lavrov . 'We have absolutely no intention of, or interest in, crossing Ukraine's borders,' Lavrov said. Russia says the troops near the border are there for military exercises and that they have no plans to invade, but U.S. and European officials say the numbers and locations of the troops suggest something more than exercises. And, despite the Russian assurances, U.S., European and Ukrainian officials are deeply concerned about the buildup, which they fear could be a prelude to an invasion or intimidation to compel Kiev to accept Moscow's demands. In his interview, Lavrov made clear that Moscow believes a federation is the only way to guarantee Ukraine's stability and neutrality. 'We can't see any other way to ensure the stable development of Ukraine but to sign a federal agreement,' Lavrov said, adding that he understood the United States was open to the idea. Message: Pro-Russian activists stand atop an old tank outside a museum in Donetsk .

U.S, European and Ukrainian officials are deeply concerned about the Russian military buildup on Ukraine's borders. Pictured, pro-Russian activists rally in Kharkiv . Under Russia: Demonstrators carry a large Russian flag as they rally in Donetsk today . U.S. officials have been coy about their position on a federation and insist that any changes to Ukraine's governing structure must be acceptable to the Ukrainians. Ukrainian officials are wary of decentralising power, fearing that pro-Russia regions would hamper its western aspirations and potentially split the country apart. However, they are exploring political reforms that could grant more authority to local governments. The plan that Kerry and Lavrov are discussing covers Ukrainian political and constitutional reforms as well as the disarmament of irregular forces, international monitors to protect minority rights and direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine, according to U.S. officials, who say it has backing of Ukraine's government. Kerry and Lavrov have met several times in person and spoken by phone almost daily since the crisis began but have not yet been able to agree on a way forward. Pictured, the unrest in Donetsk . Kerry and Lavrov have met several times in person and spoken by phone almost daily since the crisis began but have not yet been able to agree on a way forward. The pair met last week in The Hague, where Kerry presented Lavrov with the proposal, which was a response to ideas Lavrov gave him at a March 10 meeting in London. Sunday's meeting follows an hour long phone call Friday between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin in which Obama urged Putin to withdraw his troops from the border with Ukraine. The Russian leader, who initiated the call, asserted that Ukraine's government is allowing extremists to intimidate ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking civilians with impunity - something Ukraine insists is not happening. That call did little to reassure U.S. officials that Russia is not planning to invade Ukraine after its annexation of Crimea that the west has condemned as illegal and a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Lavrov rejected suspicions that the deployment of tens of thousands of Russian troops near Ukraine is a sign Moscow plans to invade the country . Movement: Pro-Russian protesters carry Russian flags as they march to block a main railway station in Donetsk . The United States and Europe have imposed sanctions on senior Russian officials in response, sparking reciprocal moves from Moscow. In the interview with Russian television, Lavrov called the sanctions a 'dead-end' strategy that would not achieve results and accused the west of hypocrisy. He said it was inconsistent for the west to refuse to recognize Crimea's annexation, which followed a referendum on joining Russia that was overwhelmingly approved, while at the same time accepting the new government in Kiev, which was formed after the pro-Moscow president fled the country. 'If they are willing to accept the first event as legitimate, then surely they are obliged to acknowledge the second,' Lavrov told Russia's Channel One television. Belief: A woman protestors clutches religious iconography as she marches under the Russian flag . The two sides remain far apart, a situation underscored by the fact that the White House and the Kremlin offered starkly different summaries of the Obama-Putin call, which occurred while Obama was traveling in Saudi Arabia. White House officials described the call as 'frank and direct' and said Obama had urged Putin to offer a written response to a diplomatic resolution to the Ukraine crisis that the U.S. has presented. He urged Moscow to scale back its troop buildup on the border with Ukraine, which has prompted concerns in Kiev and Washington about a possible Russian invasion in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin, on the other hand, said Putin had drawn Obama's attention to a 'rampage of extremists' in Ukraine and suggested 'possible steps by the international community to help stabilise the situation' in Ukraine.","Demonstrators showed their allegiance at protests in Donetsk and Kharkiv .

"By . Richard Spillett . This was the scene after a brazen gang of thieves blew up a cash machine in the middle of the night. The cashpoint outside a Costcutter shop in a Texaco petrol station in the St George area of Bristol was blown apart at around 3am this morning. It comes just weeks after another machine was targeted in the city, leaving £10 notes scattered across the floor. A cash machine in a Texaco petrol station forecourt in Bristol was blown up overnight . Police at the scene this morning. Officers say it too early to tell whether the raid is linked to a similar theft earlier this year . The explosion happened just yards from the garage's petrol pumps . John Roach, 71, who lives next to the petrol station says he was shocked thieves could set off explosives so close to large amounts of fuel. He said: 'I was asleep at the time and heard the huge bang. It woke me up obviously and I thought it sounded like a bomb. 'Then I thought it could have been a car accident so I looked out the window. There was a motorbike revving but no accident so I went back to sleep. 'This morning I was told it was a sort of bomb. It's a bit worrying for us as we are only the second house up from the garage.' Neighbours reported hearing a huge bang before seeing a motorbike speeding off after the 3am raid . The petrol station was closed at the time of the incident and police say no money was taken . Two canisters were left amid the mangled debris which littered the forecourt this morning . Police say the garage was closed at the time and theives did not manage to get any money out of the machine. In April, another cash machine in the town was attacked, with thieves in that raid making off with money. Officers say they are still investigating whether the two raids were carried out by the same people and it was 'too early' to link them. A spokesman for the Avon and Somerset force said: 'We are investigating an attempted theft at a service station on Bell Hill Road in Bristol at around 3.10am this morning. 'On arrival at the scene, police found an ATM machine had been damaged during the incident. An investigation has begun to establish what happened.'","Cash machine in Bristol blown apart in early hours of this morning .

"By . Emma Innes . Professor Andrew Jotischky claims fashionable celebrity diets - such as the 5:2 diet followed by Beyoncé - are very similar to the eating habits of monks in the Middle Ages . Fashionable fasting diets used by celebrities were actually invented by monks and hermits in the Middle Ages, it has been revealed. There is a direct link between the 5:2 and DODO diets followed by stars such as Beyoncé and Benedict Cumberbatch and the spiritual eating habits devised hundreds of years ago to cleanse the mind and body. Andrew Jotischky, Medieval History Professor at Lancaster University, is the author of ‘A Hermit’s Cookbook’ which has recipes from the Middle Ages including stew and bread soup. The monks’ healthy, simple diet and their fasting habits are almost exactly the same as today’s celebrity weight loss plans, says the professor. The idea behind the 5:2 diet is to eat normally for five days, while fasting on the other two days. It is suggested that the dieter limits themself to 500 calories for two non-consecutive days a week. However, they are given a free reign on their choice of food for the other five days. Some studies suggest fasting once or twice a week can also protect the brain against illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease. The DODO - or Day On Day Off diet - follows a similar theory. The lecturer in Lancaster University’s History Department has produced a detailed look at fasting and diet in the Middle Ages. He believes the way the monks found, prepared and ate their food contains lessons that can - and are - being used in modern life. Professor Jotischky said: ‘Hermits went out and found their food in the wild or grew it themselves. ‘In that respect they were very similar to some of today’s chefs, like Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who use the same approach to prepare their dishes. He says the monks' healthy, simple diet and their fasting habits are almost exactly the same as today's celebrity weight loss plans. Benedict Cumberbatch is also thought to follow the 5:2 diet . ‘And of course, fasting played a major part in their lives. For them it was a spiritual act rather than a way to lose weight, but it made them very aware of the nature of food and eating. ‘As we have seen with recent dieting fads, we still look at fasting as a way of cleansing and improving our minds and our bodies. ‘There are great similarities between the hermits’ and monks’ diets and today’s current trendy weight-loss regimes. Modern day hermit? Professor Jotischky says that hermits foraged for food in the wild or grew it themselves - much like some of today's chefs such as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall . ‘The way they ate has a very modern dimension, and the superiority of home-grown and locally picked food is an argument they would have been very familiar with. ‘They would also be familiar with the debate over concerns over “food miles”. Monks and hermits gathered their food from nature. ‘They also recognised the virtue of a diet of simple food that needed little or no preparation.’","Professor Andrew Jotischky says there's a link between the 5:2 and DODO diets and eating habits devised hundreds of years ago to cleanse the mind .

"By . Chris Hastings, Arts Correspondent . Ruled out: Les Dawson was nominated for an OBE twice, but never made the cut . He was one of the nation’s best-loved comics – but although Les Dawson was shortlisted twice for an OBE, he was snubbed both times. Until now his closest family were unaware of the recommendations. And it seems Dawson’s relationship with a married woman may have been what gave the powers-that-be pause for thought. Cabinet Office files requested by The Mail on Sunday show that the Blankety Blank host was recommended to receive the honour first in the Birthday Honours List of  1987 and then again in the New  Year Honours List of 1989. The official records are partly redacted and do not explain why Dawson – famous for his gurning and mother-in-law jokes – was not honoured on either occasion. But in 1987, the star’s colourful and very public love life produced  a string of lurid headlines that may have prompted politicians or civil servants to have second thoughts. His popularity at the time was unquestionable. Dawson’s jokes were enjoyed by TV audiences of millions, and Prince Philip was one of his biggest fans. He was also a tireless fundraiser, garnering more than £1 million for showbusiness and cancer charities. Yet a Freedom of Information request by this newspaper has revealed that officials still turned him down. In 1987, a year after losing his beloved first wife Margaret to cancer, the then father of three was hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons. He started to date barmaid Tracy Roper, who was not only 17 years  his junior but also married. A second woman then stepped forward  to publicly identify herself as another ‘secret lover’. Tracy was to become Dawson’s second wife, but at the time, news of the relationship sparked a media frenzy. Second wife: Les tied the knot in 1989 with Tracy Roper, a barmaid 17 years his junior who was initially married . Tracy’s then husband Richard accused Dawson of ‘stealing his wife’. Dawson’s family last night said they had been unaware of the recommendations until contacted by The Mail on Sunday. Tracy, now 64, said: ‘I know he didn’t know anything about this and there was no question of him ever having turned it down. ‘He was always thrilled when other people were honoured and I think he would have adored it. To be honest I was amazed he didn’t get an honour and it may have been something he felt strongly about. But if he did, he never said anything about it.’ Tracy said she did not think the short-lived publicity about his private life should have ruled him out but she said it was difficult to ‘understand how these people think’. ‘He would . have been absolutely thrilled even just to have been considered. He was . very a humble man and never talked about awards' - Les Dawson's daughter Pamela . His daughter Pamela by his first marriage said: ‘I wasn’t even aware Dad had even been in the running for this and I must admit it has brought a big smile to my face. He would have been absolutely thrilled even just to have been considered. He was very a humble man and never talked about awards.’ His personal politics were unlikely to have ruled him out from the honour because he was known as a supporter of the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Dawson’s curmudgeonly TV persona, which frequently saw him dressed in drag, belied the fact that he was a well-read intellectual and gifted pianist. He had a lifelong passion for the English language and wrote 16 books. His personal library amounted to more than 4,000 books and Dawson loved the work of Anthony Trollope, persuading a friend, playwright Alan Plater, to adapt The Barchester Chronicles for the BBC. Dawson married Tracy in 1989 and the couple had a daughter, Charlotte, before his untimely death at the age of 62 in 1993. He was honoured with a memorial service at Westminster Abbey the following year and, 15 years after his death, a bronze statue was unveiled in his home town of Lytham St Annes in Lancashire. A Cabinet Office spokesman  last night declined to provide further information about the recommendations.","Until now the comic's closest family were unaware of recommendations .

"By . Bianca London . Forget an Hermes Birkin or Mulberry Alexa, flamboyant artist Grayson Perry's arm candy of choice is far more daring. The English artist and CBE, known for his ceramic vases and cross-dressing, was spotted on Channel 4's Liberty of London documentary carrying his beloved 'Scrotal Sac'. The tote was designed by Grayson himself in the shape of a scrotum, before being moulded into a handbag by leather craftsman Andy Bates. World's oddest handbag? Grayson Perry has been sporting the 'Scrotal Sac' around London in recent months . The bag, which has toured Europe with Grayson, was made as a gift by Andy Bates from Hexham after he and Grayson met in 2008. Speaking to MailOnline about the intriguing design, which also has a frontal 'appendage' with a bell at its end, Andy said: 'I received an email from Grayson to which was attached a particular drawing; a drawing which was the potter's design for the 'Scrotal Sac'. I took a deep breath and the process of making began. Detail: A bell, supplied by Grayson, was added to the end of the appendage, which Andy says he gave a 'ceremonial and celebratory jingle of completion' 'It took months to construct the bag. 'Firstly I had to carve a wooden former and then soak hand-dyed, bark-tanned calfskin in water so that it became malleable and could be moulded around the oaken testicles, a technique which is centuries old. 'Upholstery nails had been driven in so that the details of the ""pimples"" could be brought out. 'The two halves of the bag were shaped then hand-stitched together using waxed, linen thread. 'Finally, . a bell, which had been supplied by Grayson himself, was added to the . end of the appendage and given a ceremonial and celebratory jingle of . completion.' The bag was dispatched to Grayson and he reportedly loved it. The 'Scrotal Sac' has since become a fixture on the arm of Grayson when in role as his alter ego, Clare. 'I . received enormous interest in the ""Scrotal Sac"" from around the world . but have mysteriously declined to make a second,' said Andy, who has . been shortlisted for the Craft Skills Awards 2013 and has been . commissioned by Bloomsbury to write the definitive book about leather.

The airline published a picture captioned 'congrats team #USA!', accompanied by a picture spelling out the 2-1 victory. To represent the two U.S. goals - scored by Clint Dempsey and John Brooks - the airline used an image of the Statue of Liberty. And to depict Ghana it used a picture of a giraffe, which Twitter users were quick to point out do not live in the country at all. Blunder: The airline attempted to celebrate the U.S. World Cup win over Ghana by tweeting this image - which was attacked for being 'ignorant' About turn: After being informed that there are no giraffes in Ghana, the airline deleted its tweet and apologised . 'Shaking my head': Users attacked the 'ignorant' airline for assuming the African country was full of giraffes . Fact check: Some helpful tweeters suggested more appropriate choices to depict Ghana . 'Ignorant' Delta was relentlessly mocked for the blunder, with one tweeter pointing out that 'checking Wikipedia for three seconds' would have made clear that giraffes are not native to Ghana. The offending tweet was swiftly deleted from Delta's account, and followed by an apology. The company - which runs flights to Ghana - said: 'We're sorry for our choice of photo in our previous tweet. Best of luck to all teams.' Ribbed: Tweeters hurled mocking messages at the airline - which operates flights to Ghana . The social media blunder followed a rare victory over Ghana for the U.S. - which has twice been knocked out of the World Cup by the African side. Clint Dempsey set a national record by scoring after just 32 seconds - the fastest an American has ever scored a World Cup goal. The U.S. and Germany are now level-pegging at the top of Group G with one win each, while Ghana and Portugal are at the bottom. Ghana dominated much the rest of the game, making a total of 21 shots, but only scored one goal when Andre Ayew leveled in the 82nd minute. Just four minutes later, Brooks - a 21-year-old who came on at halftime because Matt Besler was injured — scored off a corner from Graham Zusi. It was the first time an American sub had ever scored in the World Cup. Dempsey's goal made him the first U.S. player to score in three different World Cups and was the fastest ever scored by an American in the tournament. Dempsey's goal showed the kind of technical flair seldom seen from a squad that typically scores through set pieces. Brooks' game winner came in the waning minutes as the Americans were desperately trying to survive waves of attacks from Ghana. DaMarcus . Beasley, who became the first American to play in four World Cups, . started the buildup to Dempsey's goal with a pass to Jermaine Jones, who . fed it to Dempsey inside the penalty area. With . a nifty move to split defenders John Boye and Sulley Muntari, Dempsey . sent the left-footed shot past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey, where the ball . bounced off the post and in. That was quick: Clint Dempsey scored 32 seconds into the U.S. World Cup team's game against Ghana on Monday . Speed run: Dempsey, pictured, scored his opening goal in just 32 seconds . Party time: U.S. soccer fans in Brazil cheer in the moments leading up to Monday's game . U.S.A.: Beating Ghana was a welcome revenge for the U.S. team, after Ghana has knocked the Americans out of the last two World Cups . Already ahead after the game had barely started, the Americans looked well on their way to erasing eight years of frustration caused by Ghana. Ghana regrouped at halftime and the U.S. looked punchless on the attack after losing striker Jozy Altidore to an apparent hamstring injury in the 21st minute. Ghana applied relentless pressure on U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard and finally drew even when captain Asamoah Gyan flicked a backheel pass to Ayew, who used the outside of his left foot for a powerful shot. Ghana was still pressing for a winner Brooks delivered the header. He appeared shocked to have scored, raising his hands to his head before falling to the ground to be mobbed by his teammates. Meanwhile, fans across the U.S. - and across the globe - are celebrating the win over the team that dashed their World Cup hopes in the previous two tournaments. Super fan: Former Secretary of State - and noted sports fan - Condoleezza Rice also has her own jersey . Special message: President Barack Obama posted a video on Twitter prior to Monday's game wishing the team luck . Vice President Joe Biden was on hand at the stadium in Natal to cheer on the U.S. team. The vice president even had his own jersey made, with the name '@VP' stitched into the back above the number 14. Earlier in the day, President Barack Obama 'tweeted' a video of himself giving some words of encouragment to the U.S. team. 'Go team USA,' the president says in the video. 'Show the world what we're made of.'","The company attempted to tweet celebration of 2-1 U.S. victory .

"By . Dan Bloom . World football's top 25 officials have had their salaries doubled after a new ethics committee promised to stamp out their bonuses, an investigation has claimed. It is alleged that Fifa - which faces corruption claims over the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar - also offered to pay its executive committee in wads of cash through a Swiss bank account. The claims today, revealed in a cache of millions of documents leaked to The Sunday Times, are the latest in a growing litany against the governing body of world football. Bumper pay: The 25 members of Fifa's top governing body have had their salaries doubled, it was reported today. Pictured: The executive committee (Exco) during a general assembly at its headquarters in Switzerland . The executive committee led by President Sepp Blatter, Exco for short, is Fifa's most powerful body and numbers 25 top officials from the football world. Britain's representative Jim Boyce is one of Exco's seven vice presidents and has already said he would support a rerun of the 2022 vote if corruption allegations are proven. The revelations come just four months after Fifa promised to clean up allegations of corruption by scrapping bonuses to its committee. A new audit and compliance body was formed in July 2012 and its chief, Domenico Scala, said in February that executives had agreed to scrap the bonuses because they could encourage unethical behaviour. He said Exco was an 'oversight and decision-making body... not responsible for sales,' adding: 'We don’t want to provide a bonus to people overseeing the operations.' But according to the report today in . The Sunday Times, each of the 25 members' salaries has risen from . £59,000 to £118,000 this year after the bonuses - reputedly worth . £44,000 a year - were scrapped. Timing: The revelations during the current World Cup in Brazil come as Fifa President Sepp Blatter - the head of Exco - is firmly in the public eye. Pictured: Blatter (right) watching his home team, Switzerland . Mounting anger: Brazilians have protested in Rio de Janiero over the huge cost of staging the World Cup . June 1, 2014: £3m in 'corrupt' payments . The Sunday Times revealed it had been handed 'millions' of documents which exposed how a top Qatari football official, 65-year-old Mohammed Bin Hammam (right), handed officials £3million worth of cash and global junkets to help secure the 2022 World Cup. MPs called for Qatar to be stripped of the tournament amid an investigation. Qatar hit back, saying it 'always upheld the highest standard of ethics and integrity' and that Bin Hammam 'played no official or unofficial role in Qatar’s 2022 Bid Committee'. June 8: Secret gas deal talks . The newspaper revealed more files detailing how Bin Hammam fixed meetings with the Qatari royal family for at least seven key members of Exco, including Sepp Blatter. Two secret meetings were brokered between Qatari royals and an aide to Thailand's serving Fifa member to discuss a gas deal in the critical final months before the 2022 ballot, it was reported. June 15: Fifa 'ignored high terror risk' Further revelations alleged that Qatar had been deemed at the highest risk of a terrorist attack of any of the 2022 host nations. The documents added to questions over how a nation with scorching summer heat and little footballing tradition won the World Cup. An unnamed Exco member told the newspaper the salary 'doubled to take account of the dropping of the bonus.' The newspaper alleged Exco members enjoy generous expenses - including stays in a £200-a-night hotel in Rio de Janiero during the Brazil World Cup and more than £400 a day in generous expenses. Leaked documents also claimed Exco members were allowed to take their salaries in envelopes full of cash at Fifa's headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. The timing of the revelations, during the current World Cup in Brazil, is devastating for Mr Blatter as he remains firmly in the public eye. Brazilian authorities are already fighting unrest in large cities including Rio de Janiero over the huge amount spent on the tournament - and the vast profits for Fifa - in a country with extreme poverty. The governing body of world football is highly secretive about the salaries it pays its top officials. Accounts list the total of payments to Fifa's 'key management personnel', which includes not only the 25 Exco members but also directors and other top staff. This figure was £21.3million last year - a rise of £1.6million in a year since 2012. The pay of Fifa President Sepp Blatter and the other 24 members of Exco is now set by a compensation committee led by Mr Scala. Earlier this month the chairman of the Britain's parliamentary committee for Culture, Media and Sport said Fifa needed a complete overhaul. In a BBC interview earlier this month, John Whittingdale said an inquiry three years ago into the 2022 World Cup bidding process had received several allegations of 'potential corrupt payments'. 'Those were swept aside by Fifa, they weren't properly investigated, and that was three years ago,' he said. 'I don't think anybody is going to be that amazed to learned that the bid process is corrupted. It isn't sufficient just to have a rerun of a vote by a small number of people who conduct the vote in secret and are unaccountable. 'There needs to be a complete reform of Fifa.' A spokesman from Fifa told MailOnline that football's governing body was not in a position to comment prior to Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert's reached his conclusions based on an investigation report due at the end of next month. She said  Fifa 'does not comment on allegations', but added: 'Each year Fifa publishes its financial report in line with International Financial Reporting standards on our website. 'Furthermore, Fifa has established an independent Audit and Compliance Committee, as well as a remuneration committee that includes two independent persons namely the chairman of the Audit and Compliance Committee Domenico Scala as well Jean-Pierre Pedrazzini of Egon Zehnder, which defines and approves compensation and salaries of Fifa staff and the executive members.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Activist: Sylvia Pankhurst, pictured in 1932, was a prominent suffragette . The home of political activist and suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst has been transformed into a block of million-pound flats. The women's rights campaigner, whose mother Emmeline and sister Christabel were also prominent votes-for-women campaigners, moved to Vine Cottage  in Woodford Green, Essex in the 1920s. However, she quickly renamed the building Red Cottage in honour of her radical, left-wing politics. But the now-unrecognisable area has been transformed into a block of 14 luxury apartments, which are expected to sell for between £500,000 and £1million each. Miss Pankhurst lived in the home with her boyfriend Silvio Corio, an Italian anarchist who was fleeing the rise of fascism in Italy. The pair - who scandalised local society by never marrying - sheltered their political allies during their nine-year stay at the address. She was one of the most prominent and politically active members of the Women's Social and Political Union, nicknamed the suffragettes. Miss Pankhurst arrested at a protest in 1906 and jailed after she refused to pay a fine. Along with many other women demanding the vote, she was sent to prison and force fed while on hunger strike - but lived to see women included in the voting franchise, which first happened in 1918. She was living in Red Cottage when Parliament passed a 1928 Act giving all women in the United Kingdom the right to vote once they turned 21, which put them on equal footing with men. All that remains from her time there is a sculpture which Mr Corio made in protest at Mussolini attacking Ethiopia. Political movement: Miss Pankhurst, along with her mother Emmeline and sister Christabel, was part of the suffragette movement, which famously encouraged members to chain themselves to the railings of Buckingham Palace . Then: Red Cottage, pictured above in the 1920s, a haven for those who shared Pankhurst's politics . Now: Newly-constructed Highbeam House is made up of 14 two- and three-bedroom flats . The new development, Highbeam House, is made up of 14 apartments, which has two to three bedrooms each. Property company Galliard Homes has restored the sculpture, which now stands outside Highbeam House as part of the new development. David Galman, sales director at Galliard Homes, said: 'Sylvia Pankhurst was an important champion of women’s rights and civil rights in general. 'Her ""Red Cottage"" home was a haven for political refugees and a place where civil rights were promoted. 'When . her home was demolished in 1939 her famous “tea shop” gardens were . destroyed and the leafy and tranquil ambience of the site was lost. Luxurious: The new interiors belie the socialist connections of the development . Pricey: The flats are expected to sell for between £500,000 and £1million each . Grounds: The homes back on to gardens which were once used by Miss Pankhurst to sell tea to raise money for the suffragettes . 'With . the creation of Highbeam House we have returned the site to its . original roots - having just one property, rather than four - on the . land. 'This . has also enabled us to recreate a magnificent single rear garden, which . are perfect for people who love gardens but don’t want the hassle of . maintaining it themselves. 'Potential . purchasers can visit the dressed show-apartment and landscaped gardens . to experience the quality of the development and we hope that some . visitors will appreciate the significant history of the site and the . civil rights work of Sylvia Pankhurst'. Red Cottage itself was pulled down in the 1930s, and four separate houses were later built on the land, before being demolished in turn and replaced with Highbeam House. The political campaign to win women the vote began in the late 1800s, and picked up pace around the turn of the century. The movement began peacefully, with the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies - also known as the suffragists - formed in 1897, led by by Millicent Fawcett. The group lobbied Parliament, and gained some support within the Establishment but overall met with limited success. Protest: Suffragette Emily Davison was killed by the King's horse after running out in front of it in 1913 . The issue became much more pressing in 1903 when Emmeline Pankhurt's suffragettes entered the political landscapes. The group was much more hardline, and would heckle politicians, attack the police and make very public protests - such as chaining themselves to the railings outside Buckingham Palace. One of the most recognisable moments in the group's campaign came when Emily Davison ran out in from of the King's horse during the 1913 Derby. She was trampled by the animal and died. The suffragettes suspended their campaigning when the First World War broke out in 1914. While men were away fighting, women manned the factories at home and, by the time the conflict ended, the public had become much more amenable to granting women votes. At first, only certain women - over-30s, university graduates and property owners - could vote when the franchise was extended in 1918. But in 1928 the  Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act won them full suffrage.","Suffragette and campaigner once lived in Woodford Green, Essex .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A flea-infested rabbit who was found dumped in a cardboard box after his owner's benefits had allegedly been cut could now have an incurable disease - even though it would have cost just £20 to prevent it. The abandoned bunny was dumped among a pile of rubbish and old clothes near Queen's Park tube, north London, in a box which said 'My owner’s benefit has been cut'. The five-year-old straggly rabbit had horribly-matted fur, a bad infection in his floppy ears and was in such a bad state that the finder thought he was a guinea pig. The pet rabbit, Kieren, was found dumped in a cardboard box near Queen's Park tube, north London . The box, found among a pile of old clothes and rubbish, said: 'Please help me, I'm 5yrs (My owner benefit has been cut)' The flea-infested rabbit had matted fur and a bad infection in his ears when he was found earlier this week. It is now feared Kieren could have myxomatosis - an incurable but preventable condition spread by fleas . He also had overgrown nails measuring at least two inches - described by an animal welfare worker as the longest rabbit nails she had ever seen. But there are now fears the little bunny could have myxomatosis, an incurable but preventable disease spread by fleas. Gillian Notton, the animal welfare worker at Mayhew Animal Home, where Kieren was taken for treatment, said an annual flea . vaccination - which could have prevented his condition - costs around £20. A parasite treatment, which can be given every three months to rabbits prone to fleas, is just £8. But once a rabbit has contracted the condition, it is unlikely they will survive longer than 14 days. She . said: 'I have never seen nails as bad. They were at least two inches . long and were curling around. Kieren's nails were at least two inches long, meaning he had not been living in the right environment. If he was, the nails would have been worn down, an animal welfare expert said . 'It shows he was not in the right . environment because his nails were just not being worn down.' Hay bale used for food and bedding - £2 per week . Pellets used for food - around £5 per week . Annual flea vaccination - £20 . Emergency parasite treatment - £8 . Ms Notton said Kieren had been eating and moving around since being treated at the centre but was now undergoing treatment for his puffy eyes - a sign of the deadly disease. She said: 'Kieren is eating and moving around, but we now believe he has myxomatosis. 'He is having treatment for his eyes but, if it is what we think it is, he will not have a very good prognosis. 'It's just frustrating because everything Kieren has is preventable. 'A rabbit does not cost much to treat and there are many charitable organisations which would help someone on benefits if they couldn't afford to give them the right vaccinations. 'When he was found, the woman thought it might have been a guinea pig because of the way he looked.' Ms Notton said rabbits mainly feast on hay which can be bought for just a few pounds from a pet shop. She said that, along with a bag of pellets costing around £10, would feed a normal-sized rabbit for a few weeks. Samantha Saunders, a vet at the centre, said: 'The frustrating thing about cases like poor Kieren is that there are many outlets out there that are available that offers low cost preventative measures and his suffering could have easily been avoided.' If Kieren becomes well enough to leave the survery, the vet will look for a new home for the little bunny.","The bunny, nicknamed Kieren, found near Queen's Park tube, north London .

The one-metre in diameter giant metal nest was built by a red-billed Blue Magpie couple on one arm of the pylon due to a lack of trees in the nearby area.

However, the market management office was afraid that debris falling from the nest may hurt pedestrians below and contracted the local power grid company and a local zoo to come and help. The power company initially sent one worker up carrying basket on their back, but the nest proved to be too large and heavy and another worker went to help. During the removal of the nest, the magpie couple kept pecking the intruding workers as there were a number of chicks in the nest. The chicks were sent to Fuzhou Birds Forest Zoo where they will be reared by keepers before being released back into the wild.

"Sebastian Bendou, 36, stabbed and battered his housemate Christophe Borgye in 2009 . A man who murdered his housemate and buried him in a tomb in their garden has finally confessed to the crime four years later, after his guilty conscience became too much bear. Sebastian Bendou, 36, stabbed and battered his housemate Christophe Borgye in 2009 along with an accomplice in a brutal pre-planned attack after a row over money. He then hid his body in a homemade brick tomb topped with concrete in the garden of the house in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. The pair thought they had got away with murder after police treated the victim’s disappearance as a routine missing persons inquiry and assumed he had returned to his native France. But hotel worker Bendou could not live with the 'strain' of his guilt and in May last year suddenly travelled 200 miles from his new home in Dumfries, Scotland back to the town. He called police from a phone box and told them: 'This is too much for my mind.' The next day he led officers to the house where the body of airline steward Borgye still lay. Officers broke open the tomb inside a shed to find it contained a low brick wall used to hide the corpse with three separate layers of concrete placed over the body to bury it. A claw hammer and two knives were found next the body wrapped in a duvet and tarpaulin. It emerged Bendou - also a Frenchman - had later claimed he was under the influence of his accomplice who convinced him Borgye was a French spy. Bendou was found guilty of murder.  His guilty plea to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility was rejected by the prosecution. He will be sentenced later. Father of three Dominik Kocher, 35, from New Abbey in Dumfries, Scotland, who planned the killing was found guilty at an earlier hearing and jailed for life with a minimum recommendation he serve 23 years. Chester Crown Court was told Mr Borgye (pictured) who worked as a flight attendant for Ryanair was originally from Ronchin in France but had moved to the UK in 2007 due to his job . He and Dominik Kocher, who masterminded the murder, then hid his body in a homemade brick tomb topped with concrete in the garden of the house in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire . Chester Crown Court was told Mr Borgye worked as a flight attendant for Ryanair and was originally from Ronchin in France but had moved to the UK in 2007 due to his job. He initially lived in Liverpool with Bendou and another man before all three moved to Ellesmere Port where Kocher lived with his wife and children. The men came to an arrangement where they would pay their wages into the back account of Kocher who then managed their financial affairs. But when Mr Borgye said he planned to move to Belgium  - and so the money would not be paid into Kocher’s account - he bought a number of items from builders merchants including concrete, bricks and limestone chipping, and also a set of three knives from a supermarket. The unsuspecting victim was later lured into a specially prepared ‘kill room’ where tarpaulin had been laid on the floor and the killers wore blue plastic overshoes on their feet. After the killers had left the property, the new tenants were told not to go into the outbuilding as the landlord used it to store personal property. Pictured is the sack in which the victim's body was discovered . During the attack Borgye was stabbed twice and hit with the claw end of the hammer eight times with massive force. His body was dumped in the back of the shed and encased in the tomb. The victim was reported missing to police by a work colleague in May 2009 but enquiries at the time led officers and his family to believe he had left the country. Bendou carried on living at the house until August 2012 when he and Kocher moved to Scotland. The new tenants were told not to go into the outbuilding as the landlord used it to store personal property. He eventually went to police fearing Kocher was about to 'eliminate' him. In a statement he initially said he killed the victim in self defence. He said he was 'very scared' and added: 'I’m confessing now because I felt it was too much for my mind and I want some peace.' At the trial Bendou said he had been 'indoctrinated' by Kocher’s story that Mr Borgye was a secret agent sent by 'the Americans' to ensure his wife was deported to France where she had tax issues. Bendou added: 'Christophe was in his bedroom and Dominik called him down. Dominik put the knife into his neck. I took the hammer and I struck him three times in the head. I was manipulated by Dominik. I was like a puppet.' Talking of his life in Scotland he added: 'I was frightened for my life. My conscience said to me you’ve got to give yourself in now.' Police search the home at Hylton Court in Ellesmere Port where Sebastian Bendou murdered Christophe Borgye . Officers broke open the tomb inside a shed to find it contained a low brick wall used to hide the corpse with three separate layers of concrete placed over the body to bury it . Bendou was initially sectioned under the Mental Health Act but was later deemed fit to stand trial. An appeal is currently ongoing as whether Kocher’s 23 year sentence is 'too lenient.' Det Insp Gwyn Dodd from Cheshire Police revealed forensic archeologists, entomologists, cement experts, pathologists, psychiatrists, translators and financial investigators had helped with the investigation. He added: 'Kocher was the dominant force and had a controlling influence. He was instrumental in the cover up of the murder and leading people, including his family, into believing Christophe had simply moved away. 'But the strain of their secret in the end proved too much for Bendou.' Richard Riley, Senior Crown Prosecutor with the CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said: 'Bendou led us to the grisly tomb of Christophe Borgye and is now facing the consequences of his role in this tragedy. 'Mr Borgye, Kocher and Bendou were all friends yet Kocher seemed to exert some strange influence over the others that we have never managed to get to the bottom of. 'Borgye and Bendou had their wages paid into Kocher’s account and, in return, he seems to have managed their affairs. 'We may never know the reason why Bendou and Kocher killed Mr Borgye on that fateful day - the picture is too murky. 'But it seems likely that money was at the heart of it. Kocher bought knives in the days leading up to the killing and tarpaulin, bricks and cement. We’ve always maintained these were used in the killing and to then bury the body. 'This murder was planned, brutally executed and extensively covered up.' Manuel Wagner, 26, also from New Abbey in Dumfries, Scotland, was found not guilty of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial at an earlier hearing.","Sebastian Bendou, 36, killed housemate Christophe Borgye in 2009 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Imagine getting directions that didn’t just stop at the street location, but showed you exactly where to go inside a building. That’s the thinking behind Google’s Project Tango, a 3D-mapping service that was announced for phones back in February. And now the company has revealed a $1,000 (£600) tablet prototype that uses the same technology. Scroll down for video . Google has announced that its secretive, but innovative, Project Tango will be making its way to protoype tablets in the coming months. Illustration pictured. The technology uses 3D scanning sensors, similar to Microsoft's Kinect, to create whole maps of interior locations . Project Tango, headed by Motorola’s ATAP division, has been developed in secret behind the scenes. The current prototype is a 5-inch phone containing customised hardware and software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while simultaneously creating a map of the environment. These sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time. It then combines that data into a single 3D model of the space around the user. The technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person's home simply by walking around the table. Directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else. Project Tango could also be used by the visually-impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places. Or, when shopping, the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on. Google also highlights some of the gaming aspects, such as playing hide-and-seek with a virtual character. Its goal is to use 3D scanning technology, akin to that in Microsoft’s Kinect sensor, to create 3D maps of an environment. This means that a person’s phone or tablet, for instance, could produce highly detailed interior maps of buildings, rooms and houses. The technology has a number of proposed uses. For example, it could be used to measure the dimensions of a home for furniture shopping, or it could allow for interactive games of hide-and-seek. This latest 7-inch tablet, employing the same scanning technology used in the Project Tango phones, will run Android 4.4 KitKat. The device maps the world in 3D through the use of two cameras, one on the front that can see 120 degrees, and a 4MP camera on the rear. A motion tracking camera on the back also helps the mapping process, in addition to an integrated depth sensor. Aside from the innovative 3D sensors in the device, the tablet will also have a 1080p display. Inside it is powered by NVIDIA’s quad-core Tegra K1 chip, and it has 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Development kits of the device are available to pre-order through Google for $1,024 (£610), with the Wall Street Journal reporting there will be about 4,000 prototype tablets available this month. The process wlll be similar to how Google Glass was rolled out to a select few ‘beta testers’ last year. Project Tango can be used by a handset to automatically build a 3D map of anywhere the user is, allowing for far better indoor navigation. This could, for example, allow someone to get directions to an exact desk within a building or find the right shelf a product is located on in a shop . ‘The goal . of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding . of space and motion,’ said Johnny Lee from the ATAP-Project Tango Team. ‘Our . team has been working with universities, research labs, and industrial . partners spanning nine countries around the world to build on the last . decade of research in robotics and computer vision, concentrating that . technology into a unique mobile device. ‘We . are putting early prototypes into the hands of developers that can . imagine the possibilities and help bring those ideas into reality.’ Project Tango was first announced for phones back in Feburary, but is now being rolled out to about 4,000 prototype tablets for early adopters this month. The process for getting one of the development kit laptops is likely to be similar to how Google Glass was rolled out last year .","California-based Google has revealed the next step in its Project Tango .

"By . Ted Thornhill . It’s often possible to deduce what sort of personality and career someone has from the clothes they wear - and it turns out that facial hair also provides clues about a person’s lifestyle and job. A new study shows that men often sculpt their facial follicles to create an image that matches their career and their outlook on life. The research was compiled by analysing 470 influential men, their different career paths and the fuzz that gets the vote. Hair we go: Academics (left) prefer a clean-shaven look, but not as much as the kings of the boardroom (right) They’ve divided the nation’s men into six types - Mr Hipster, King of the Boardroom, The Academic, Sporting Stubble, Wordsmiths and The Everyman – and found that the length of facial hair each prefers varies remarkably. The hipsters - musicians, actors and those in the advertising world – tend to neglect their razor blades. The report, by Remington – called the FH100 Index (that’s facial hair 100) – found that 63 per cent of men working in the advertising industry chose to wear some form of facial hair – a beard, moustache or goatee. The 'Beckham effect' is alive in the sporting world (left) while writers much prefer a follicle-free face (right) Influential: Former footballer David Beckham often sports a beard . With actors, beards prove enormously popular. Eighty per cent of the top grossing actors of the past year either stepped out in the lime light with a beard or stubble during the last awards season. Facial hair gets a chorus of approval from musicians, too, with 70 per cent of those in the charts opting for some degree of facial fuzz. The smooth operators in the boardroom, meanwhile, prefer a clean shave, with 76 per cent of CEOs in UK companies banishing the stubble on a daily basis and just 24 per cent braving a beard or some level of facial growth. The Everyman is more likely to stay hair-free on his face (left) while hipsters normally opt for a beard (right) Academics tend to prefer a clean-shaven look, too, with 73 per cent of our top professors choosing to keep their visages follicle-free and 63 per cent of men with the highest IQs opting for the same style. Wordsmiths, such as authors and journalists, and the everymen, such as office workers or skilled labourers, also shun beards. Eighty per cent of our top selling authors of the past year choose a clean shave and only 20 per cent opted for a beard, while 56 per cent of our everymen take to the razor instead of the beard trimmer.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A California woman is suing a reality TV show after nearly severing a finger when her hand was taped to a sledgehammer and smashed into a counter. Courtney Muro is taking legal action against the DIY Network and Bathroom Crashers host Matt Muenster over claims she was injured during filming in July 2012. Ms Muro, from Sacramento, said that she had been helping a friend whose home was due to appear in the show when she was hurt. Legal action: Matt Muenster, who hosts Bathroom Crashers, is being sued by a woman who was injured during filming . With her right hand bleeding, Ms Muro claims that she was asked to sign a standard waiver of liability with her left hand. During an appearance in Sacramento County Court on Tuesday, Ms Muro accused the show and network of negligence. According to court documents seen by Kron 4: 'Bathroom Crashers host Matt Muenster wrapped the duct-tape around her hand to attach the sledgehammer. 'Plaintiff proceeded to swing the sledgehammer toward the counter. The impact partially severed her right index finger under the weight of the hammer against a broken piece of counter top.' The counter broke the skin and muscle in Ms Muro's finger, causing her to go 'into shock at the sight of her exposed tendon'. Claims: Courtney Muro alleged that she was made to sign a waiver form after she had been injured . It was only after she had been injured that the producer noticed she hadn't signed the waiver of liability. 'While plaintiff continued to suffer in shock and the bleeding from her right hand, plaintiff then signed the waiver of liability while using her left hand,' Court News reported. Ms Muro is suing for emotional distress and claims Muenster should have taken better care of her during filming.","Courtney Muro was helping friend who was appearing on reality show .
