"By . Sacha Clayton . Katarina Johnson-Thompson has vowed to end her injury nightmare and make up for lost time next year after a niggling foot injury spoiled her summer. The heptathlete was ready to make a huge impression on the world stage after securing a personal best of 6,682 points in July – a world-leading-score in 2014. But she never got the chance to turn that blistering form into medals, sustaining a 'stress reaction' in her foot which forced her to sit on the sidelines for eight weeks. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Johnson-Thompson discuss her Sainsbury's ambassador role . Time to shine: Katarina Johnson-Thompson wants to take next summer by storm after recent injuries . Injury nightmare: Johnson-Thompson's summer was interrupted by a niggling foot injury . In that time Glasgow's Commonwealth Games and the European Championships have come and gone – and the 21-year-old admits 2015 can't come soon enough. 'Everything's fine, it's been okay since day two (of the injury), I haven't felt anything so I don't feel like an injured athlete, which is annoying,' said Johnson-Thompson, who was speaking at the 2014 Sainsbury's School Games in Manchester. 'It was just the worst time possible – if it was the start of the year I could have recovered from it and just plodded on with my season, but it was over two major championships which is the annoying thing. 'I think it will help me next to year to train harder and come back with a vengeance. I think everything was going too well in a sense and when I'm back on the track, it'll help me to grasp every opportunity. Focused: Johnson-Thompson wants to make up for the lost time caused by her foot injury . Role model: Johnson-Thompson held a long jump and high jump masterclass for young athletes . 'This is the time all athletes should be resting but now I'm so focused, so it's definitely going to be a blessing in disguise.' And next year could prove just the tonic for Johnson-Thompson ahead of the Rio Olympic Games in 2016, as the World Championships in Beijing loom next August. 'I watched the Commonwealth Games and after that I decided I couldn't (watch) the Europeans, so that was me done watching athletics this summer,' she added. 'It was very hard for me to watch an event you feel you're at your peak at and feel you're in really good shape. It's very hard to sit on the couch and watch it, so I kept busy. 'My next big event is the Europeans in March. I will be pretty much doing everything the same in training throughout winter (to prepare).' The Sainsbury's 2014 School Games, which is supported by National Lottery funding from Sport England and delivered by the Youth Sport Trust, is taking place in venues across Manchester (4-7 September 2014).

"By . Samuel Moore . and Adam Shergold . It is the spine-tingling and teeth-chattering challenge that has swept the world and raised millions for good causes. At the moment, it seems no visit to YouTube or a news website is complete without watching the latest nominated celebrity have freezing cold water poured over them from a big bucket. But where did this craze come from? And what's it in aid of? What is the 'Ice Bucket Challenge'? The choice is very simple. You either stand or sit there while some very kind and willing assistants pour a big container of ice water over your head, or you make a donation to an ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) charity. The whole thing is filmed and once the 'victim' has recovered from the icy shock, they nominate someone else to take the challenge. Chilly challenge: Lionel Messi is soaked in icy water as he takes his turn to do the Ice Bucket Challenge that has been sweeping the world to raise money for ALS charities . Dunked! David Beckham also took part in the spine-tingling challenge this week. So far, millions of pounds have been raised for good causes as a result of the challenge going viral on social media like Twitter and YouTube . 60558 . 58166 . 56402 . 60094 . 69010 . 59920 . 51920 . 58817 . 56680 . 56077 . 60233 . 60094 . 59908 . 57029 . 58329 . 55937 . 58631 . 62555 . 53685 . 59722 . 55427 . 60094 . 60094 . 60256 . 18159 . 72098 . 40519 . 34691 . 43770 . 116890 . 57493 . 62509 . 32694 . 63925 . 27307 . 15080 . 60094 . 60419 . 59120 . 60094 . 60094 . 52245 . 43282 . 57029 . 56402 . 32973 . 41611 . 31278 . 60094 . 15024 . 39358 . 55287 . 65876 . 55752 . 48809 . 67280 . 70891 . 52687 . 54637 . 60094 . 60094 . 66201 . 60094 . 60256 . 60094 . 63879 . 56402 . 76998 . 55078 . 58492 . 10194 . 60233 . 60094 . 60094 . 49600 . 60094 . 58329 . 48275 . 48089 . 60094 . 60814 . 55264 . 55937 . 60094 . 58956 . 54823 . 51800 . 56040 . 60094 . 57040 . 43120 . 60233 . 60233 . 29443 . 34250 . 55891 . 37060 . 48995 . 54428 . 102702 . 58120 . 36827 . 57958 . 59165 . Once nominated, the person has 24 hours to do the same thing and post the evidence on social media like Twitter, Facebook or YouTube to prove they've gone through with it. Most celebrities have gone through with the challenge but some, like Charlie Sheen, have chosen to donate money instead. Twist: Charlie Sheen decided to donate to charity rather than subject himself to the cold water . What is ALS? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the term used in the United States to describe Motor Neurone Disease (MND), which affects a person's ability to move voluntarily. While the person continues to think and feel, they are often unable to walk, eat or talk, leaving them effectively 'locked in' to their body. It is estimated about 5,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from MND and half of those diagnosed will die within the first 14 months of knowing they have it. There is no known cure at present. Grin and bear it: Neymar reacts to the shock of the freezing water after completing the challenge . Brave: Cristiano Ronaldo sat in just his pants when he had the ice bucket tipped over him . How did the craze start? In the States, when Chris Kennedy, a golfer from Sarasota in Florida, was nominated by a friend to participate in an ice bucket challenge similar to the one screened live on-air by programme Golf Channel Morning. Kennedy was the first to associate the challenge with ALS because he has a relative suffering from the disease and his video was posted back on July 15. Soon his friends were all doing it and using the hashtag #StrikeOutALS and it started to go viral when former professional baseball player Pete Frates took part. By the end of July, the ALS Association reported a dramatic rise in donations and the campaign has been gaining more and more popularity ever since. Team work: Golfers Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods poured water over one another in their clip . Fronting up: Tennis star Ana Ivanovic takes her turn at braving the sub-zero water . What impact is the campaign having? A very positive one. The ALS Association has seen a huge rise in donations - £9.4m compared with £30,000 in the same period last year - since the campaign went viral. The Motor Neurone Disease Association reported on Tuesday that is had raised £4,000 from text message donations since the campaign took off in the UK. Smaller associated charities have also reported a surge in donations. What a reaction: John Terry after taking his turn at being covered in icy water . Nicely chilled: Rio Ferdinand did his challenge during QPR's training session this week . Who has taken part? Celebrities the world over have volunteered to have the ice water thrown over them. Footballers including Neymar, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and John Terry have taken part, as have sports stars Usain Bolt, Tiger Woods, Kobe Bryant and Rory McIlroy to name but a few. Among other famous folk to have taken part are Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Lady Gaga, Mark Zuckerberg and Justin Bieber. Many have injected an element of humour into their 'dunkings', helping rack up millions of views on YouTube and other sites. Thousands of ordinary people have also done their bit, including the 200 who met in Boston's Copley Sqaure to dump water on each other on August 7.

"By . Claire Hayhurst, Press Association . Snooker player Stephen Lee has been fined £1,815 after admitting a charge of fraud relating to his personal cue. The 39-year-old, of Birch Gardens, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, appeared before magistrates in Swindon to admit a single charge of fraud by false representation. The court was told Lee, who was once ranked number five in the world, arranged to sell his personal £1,600 snooker cue to a fan through his Facebook page. Better times: Stephen Lee, pictured here playing in China in 2012, was once ranked fifth in the world . Dejected: Stephen Lee looks dejected as he drops a frame to Ding Junhui in 2007 . But although the man, who is based in Hong Kong, paid the money into Lee’s wife’s bank account, the cue was never sent - and Lee continued to play with it. Prosecutor Michelle Hewitt told the court that Lee offered his personal snooker cue for sale to the victim, Marco Fai Pak Shek. 'After some negotiations, it was agreed that the victim would pay £1,600 for the defendant’s personal snooker cue,' Ms Hewitt said. 'Arrangements were made by the defendant and the victim, who is based in Hong Kong.Following the arrangements, the victim agreed to pay £1,600 into Mr Lee’s wife’s bank account, which he did.' Ms Hewitt said Lee agreed to arrange for modifications to be carried out on the cue, before he sent it to Mr Shei. Then and now: Stephen Lee in action and arriving at court for his fraud case on Monday . Expensive times: Stephen Lee poses with his new Porsche during his early career . 'But following the transfer of the funds, the defendant failed to send the snooker cue or make any arrangements for the modifications to be carried out as agreed,' Ms Hewitt told the court. 'When there was no sign of the snooker cue, a report was made to the police. They carried out an investigation and arrested the defendant. The defendant was still using the cue as his own personal property.' Mr Shek made a formal complaint to police on January 24 this year, after the promised John Parris Ultimate cue failed to arrive. Ms Hewitt said Lee had promised to send the cue along with letters of authenticity from himself and John Parris. 'Mr Shek received an email from the defendant saying he was going to personally deliver it to Hong Kong,' Ms Hewitt said. The email read: 'If you want the cue, you need to drop the charges and I will sign some pictures for you', the prosecutor added. Focused: Stephen Lee in action against Mark Selby during the Masters Championship . However, Mr Shek refused to drop the charges and the case against Lee, who has no previous convictions, continued. Representing Lee, Mark Glendenning said his client had repeatedly apologised to Mr Shek for failing to send the cue. 'Mr Lee has a number of fans on his Facebook site and they regularly engage in conversation,' Mr Glendenning said. 'He has previously sold things to fans without incident. An arrangement was reached for the sale of Mr Lee’s personal snooker cue but it needed some work doing.Mr Shek sent the money via bank transfer and Mr Lee fully accepts he received that money.' Mr Glendenning said Lee had made 'some efforts' to arrange for work to be carried out on the snooker cue. Happier times: Lee won five ranking titles during his career, including the 2001 LG Trophy . 'Life took over, Mr Lee found himself embroiled in a number of difficulties which have been much publicised in relation to his career and that took a great deal of his time and energy,' Mr Glendenning said. 'He accepts in full he should have sent this cue, the difficulty being with his personal life impacting on his professional life. There was an intention to send that cue to Hong Kong but things took over and it didn’t get there.' Mr Glendenning said Lee is not working and receives £133 of benefits per fortnight. John Fryer, chair of the bench, told Lee: 'In arriving at our sentence at this matter, we have taken into account a number of things - your previous good character, you have not appeared before the courts before, and we have given you credit for your early guilty plea. Rising star: Lee worked his way through the ranks to a career-high ranking of No 5 . 'We also note that you are on benefits and your income is significantly lower.' Lee was fined £110 for the offence and told to pay Mr Shek £1,600 in compensation, along with £85 prosecution costs and a £20 victim surcharge. Mr Fryer asked Lee if he would be able to pay the total £1,815 to the court following the hearing.Lee, wearing a black jacket, black T-shirt and jeans, replied: 'I can’t pay that today, no.' Mr Fryer added: 'It will be deducted from your benefits on a weekly basis. We will also make a collection order, which means if the payments stop, someone will be knocking on your door.' Lee did not comment as he left the court.","Lee once ranked fifth in the world but is now unemployed and on benefits .

"By . Martha Kelner for the Daily Mail . Brendan Foster is posing for pictures on Gateshead quayside with a group of children whose parents were possibly not born when he was Britain’s best, winning our only track and field medal of the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. The long sideburns are gone, stubble shaved and the unkempt mane of dark hair is grey and brushed. His off-white cotton running vests — which back then revealed thick tufts of chest hair — are stored away, replaced by a smart navy blue suit and tie. This is Foster the businessman, the raconteur who can pick up the phone to Sting, Ant and Dec, or Alastair Campbell to ask a favour. One in a million: Foster, who had the idea for the Great North Run, is celebrating the event's millionth runner . Best known as the distinctive Geordie voice of athletics, Foster is most proud of his days as a brave frontrunner. He gritted it out in an era where systematic doping was as much a part of track and field as running spikes. But perhaps what will prove his greatest legacy is written in giant lettering on the Tyne Bridge, just behind him as he poses for pictures. Great North Run Million’ reads the sign. The event, which Foster conceived of during a twilight run on an Auckland beach with his friend Dave Moorcroft, will pass its one-millionth runner on Sunday. More than 56,000 will set off from the heart of Newcastle for the 34th edition of the biggest mass participation sport event in the world. The New York marathon will be second to reach a million and the London marathon follows in two years. ‘We didn’t realise until we started doing the numbers,’ recalls Foster. ‘Then we got in touch with all the other major events and said to them, “So how many have you got?” If you’re from Newcastle, you don’t really beat New York in anything, so it’s a proud moment for the North East.’ Back then: Foster ran as an amateur and says he feels sorry for modern, professional athletes . Foster looks out from the glass-fronted Sage Gateshead building, the heart of Tyneside’s arts scene, and gestures to the landscape that has made him tick down the years. From behind modern tower blocks peeks the upper tier of St James’s Park, where, since he was seven, many happy and some despondent afternoons have been spent cheering his beloved Newcastle United. He ran on the riverbanks as a teenager, while part of Gateshead Harriers. Trained by a local welder, Stan Long, Foster became Britain’s best long-distance runner before the public had heard of Seb Coe, Steve Ovett or Steve Cram. A chemistry teacher, he broke world records over two miles and 3,000 metres. ‘When I broke the (two-mile) world record at Crystal Palace in 1973 I was teaching (at St Joseph’s Grammar School in Hebburn),’ he says. ‘There were guys who were joiners, carpenters, welders and bank workers. Eventually you got a few quid but it was nothing more than pocket money. Record breaker: The long-distance runner broke the world record at two miles and 3,000 metres in the 1970s . Last time out: Kenenisa Bekele wins the 2013 Great North Run ahead of Britain's Mo Farah . ‘I feel sorry for some professional athletes now because if they don’t run fast they can’t pay their mortgage. We were less conventional, we didn’t have to do good interviews or thank the sponsors.’ Foster was adored for his no-nonsense northern attitude, which drew comparisons with a series of 1970s cartoons titled ‘Tough of The Track.’ The main character Alf Tupper, with his wild looks, bore a resemblance to Foster. ‘Tupper was a typical northern lad. He ate fish and chips, beat the toffs and overcame the establishment. Maybe some I ran against would say I was the tough lad of the track, but it wasn’t about being toughest, just being fastest.’ There are still no airs and graces with Foster. He litters his stories with ‘I should stop, I’m telling you too much,’ but free-flowing honesty is the only way he knows. It has made life difficult for him at times in the commentary box, like when he laid into a young Mo Farah after he won a mile race on the same weekend as the Great North Run several years ago, before he made his breakthrough. ‘I said: “What on earth are you doing? You need to get a proper coach and a new set-up.” He had a hell of a finish, he just didn’t have a clue how to win a race.’ Olympic hero: At the 1976 Olympic Games Foster was the only British medalist in track and field . Mo nonsense: Foster laid into a young Mo Farah but the British star has taken his advice on board . His plain talking is what has made Foster such an enduring broadcaster, having commentated on every major athletics event since 1983. He learned from the peerless David Coleman, who died last year. ‘He invited me to join him in the commentary box,’ says Foster, ‘I didn’t realise until I sat next to others that I’d been next to a Rolls Royce. If that’s your first car you don’t appreciate it until you’ve had a Ford Escort.’ At last month’s European Championships, Foster was a rare voice on BBC TV to stick up for the French steeplechaser Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad, who was harshly stripped of his gold medal for ripping off his shirt on the final straight while a long way clear. ‘I’ve seen Alan Shearer score and his celebrations were understated,’ says Foster. ‘Just because another goes mental doesn’t mean they should get a prison sentence. ‘The rebel in me liked him ripping his shirt off. Athletics can’t always be a function of how hard you try but it has to be a fair reward for what you’ve achieved. He didn’t get fair reward because he’s a bit crackers. Mo is getting fair reward now for years of unfailing effort. ‘I believe in a meritocracy. I guess it’s based on my history. I lost a gold to a guy who cheated. It doesn’t affect my life but I wish I hadn’t.’ Foster is used to battling against the tide, having competed at a time when athletics was rotten with drugs cheats. Different era: Foster claims athletics is a much cleaner sport these days than when he was competing . ‘The entire nation of East Germany was designed to win medals by fair means or foul,’ he says. ‘A guy I used to run against a lot was (East German) Manfred Kuschmann but we weren’t allowed to speak, we couldn’t swap vests, he was always whisked away after races. 'I used to go to training with him on my mind but I could never physically get to meet him.Things are a lot better in that regard now, the authorities have taken a stand against drugs. There will always be some but it’s nowhere near as bad.’ After his running career, Foster set up Nova International, a company which holds dozens of mass-participation sport events across the country with more than 200,000 people a year taking part in runs, swims and bike rides. Now 66, and a grandfather of two, he is still trim and runs four times a week. ‘I go with my mate who lives across the road,’ he says. ‘He’s 75, we’ve been running together for 20 years and have both got progressively slower. It’s hilly where we live so now we walk up the hills and run on the tops.’ He still lives in Newcastle and has a holiday home in the nearby town of Bamburgh. ‘I go to the local butcher to get the meat for the weekend and he’ll ask me what I’ve been up to and it’s lovely.’ Foster believes the region and the North in general is often given short shrift. ‘There’s a significant problem in this country, it’s that London is everything and everywhere else is nothing,’ he says. By way of example, he recounts a piece of advice given to him by Peter McHugh, then editor of GMTV, about how to raise the profile of the Great North Run. ‘About 15 years ago, it was the biggest event in the country. We had the best athletes and celebrities. I said, “How can we get promotion or on to your programme?” He said: “The best thing you could do is take North out of the title and people in the South will be more receptive”. ‘I was in the same class at school as Peter, he’s a good lad and was giving me proper advice. But that made me even more determined to make it work and make sure everyone knows about it.’ The Bupa Great North Run, televised on BBC, is Britain’s biggest running event. The Nova International event will become the first of its kind to celebrate its one-millionth finish. Visit greatrun.org to find out more.","Brendan Foster won Bronze in 1976 Olympic Games .

"By . Mike Dawes . Ali Carter says he feels 'wiped out' but remains 'strong and positive' after undergoing his first course of chemotherapy treatment since being diagnosed with lung cancer. The 34-year-old from Chelmsford revealed he had the condition a week ago, just a few months after he was given the all-clear following a battle against testicular cancer. 'Well that's the first bout of the chemo done. Glad it's over but way more to come soon. Feeling a bit wiped out but feel strong & positive,' he wrote on his Twitter account on Sunday. 'I'm looking forward to spending my day with my boy and my family and hopefully catching up with a couple of mates later'. Positive: Ali Carter's tweet said he was trying to remain 'strong and positive' Positive: Carter set a tweet out this morning to update his followers on his progress . The two-time World Championship runner-up, who suffers from Crohn's disease, was able to resume his career after recovering from testicular cancer last year. He contested almost a full season in 2013/14, ending at the World Championship in Sheffield when he beat Xiao Guodong in the first round before bowing out to eventual champion Mark Selby in his next match. Carter is a three-time ranking tournament winner, having landed titles at the 2009 Welsh Open, 2010 Shanghai Masters and 2013 German Masters. He lost to Ronnie O'Sullivan in each of his Crucible finals, in 2008 and 2012. A professional since 1996, Carter is ranked 13th in the world and has been as high as number two in his career. He is also a trained pilot, going by the nickname 'The Captain'. Winner: Carter has won three rankings tournaments in his career . Carter has is currently ranked number thirteen in the world rankings . Snooker has been touched by cancer tragedy in recent memory, with the three-time Masters champion Paul Hunter dying of a rare form of the disease in October 2006, at the age of 27. Writing on Twitter last month after news of his latest cancer battle emerged, Carter was in defiant mood. 'Me v Cancer. Going to be a long one but get your money on - I'm up for this one!

"By . Ian Parker, Press Association . In the hierarchy of cycling's Grand Tours, the Vuelta a Espana ranks third out of three. But this season, it could prove to be the best of the lot. Nairo Quintana's dominance amid a dearth of real contenders made the Giro d'Italia seem all too easy, while injuries decimated the Tour de France field and left the door wide open for Vincenzo Nibali. And so fans are looking to the Vuelta - where six former Grand Tour winners will line up for Saturday's opening team time trial in Jerez de la Frontera - for a real battle to be fought. Comeback: Team Sky's Chris Froome will ride the Vuelta a Espana after pulling out of the Tour de France . Return: Tinkoff-Saxo's Alberto Contador also pulled out of the Tour through injury but will ride at the Vuelta . Favourite: Nairo Quintana, who won the 2014 Giro d'Italia, will line-up alongside Froome and Contador . Team Sky's Chris Froome and Tinkoff-Saxo's Alberto Contador - the latter a two-time winner of his home Grand Tour - return after injuries ended their bids for Tour glory, but whether either yet has the form or fitness to challenge for victory remains to be seen. What is clear is that neither man is talking like a potential winner. 'Perhaps in the last week, I can fight for a stage win,' Contador said of his prospects, while Froome simply spoke in general terms of getting back on track after the disappointment of the Tour. 'I have always really enjoyed racing at the Vuelta, it's a tough race but a great opportunity for the whole team,' he said. 'I know that the level of competition will be incredibly high this year, but we have got a strong line up so we hope to be as competitive as possible.' That leaves Movistar's Quintana as the clear favourite after he skipped the Tour entirely, with the young Colombian apparently in much better shape than his older team-mate and co-captain, former Vuelta winner Alejandro Valderde. Garmin-Sharp, meanwhile, will have a three-pronged attack with Irishman Dan Martin and American Andrew Talansky returning from injury and former Giro winner Ryder Hesjedel bringing plenty of experience to the table. Fall: Froome was injured during the Tour de France as he feel three times in two days and had to withdraw . Katusha's Joaquim Rodriguez, 35, is missing a Grand Tour victory off an otherwise impressive palmares, and where better to win one than on home soil. Omega Pharma-Quick Step, who are without sprinter Mark Cavendish, will instead put everything into Giro runner-up Rigoberto Uran's bid for glory, while Nibali's Astana team will be backing 24-year-old Italian Fabio Aru, who was third in Italy. Defending champion Chris Horner (Lampre-Merida) has been withdrawn from the race by his team after treatment for bronchitis took his levels of cortisol below the minimum level expected by the Movement for Credible Cycling. The 42-year-old had been given a therapeutic use exemption for the treatment by the International Cycling Union but Lampre-Merida have replaced the American with Valerio Conti. Besides Froome, British interest will come in the form of his Sky team-mates Pete Kennaugh and Luke Rowe, as well as Orica GreenEdge's 21-year-old Adam Yates, who gets his Grand Tour chance a little under two months after twin brother Simon started the Tour de France in Yorkshire. Rivals: Froome (second left) and Contador (second right) surprisingly do not start the race as favourites . Although the battle gets under way with what promises to be a tough, technical team time trial full of roundabouts on Saturday, the real fight will take place in the mountains with no fewer than eight summit finishes - the first coming on stage six - and plenty of tough descents in between. The real business comes at the end of the second week, with three consecutive summit finishes testing the legs of the contenders. It is little wonder then that Quintana, who showed he could challenge Froome on the biggest climbs of the 2013 Tour, that finds himself as the favourite. The 24-year-old Colombian showed his form with victory in the Vuelta a Burgos last week and will take the start on a high. 'It's a real important win for me, not just for the sake of victory, but also because it gives me massive confidence before the Vuelta a Espana,' Quintana said after that race. 'I'm sure there are rivals quite stronger than me at the moment, but this shows I'll be getting to the race in good condition, and provided that Alejandro (Valverde) and the rest will be strong again, this can only be good.'

"Williams have confirmed Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas as their driver line-up for the 2015 Formula One season. Massa was already under contract for next term, whilst Williams have taken up the option on Bottas' contract following a stunning campaign. For Massa, next year will be the Brazilian's 14th season in F1, whilst Finn Bottas is fast emerging as a proven talent following the emergence of Williams as a force to again be reckoned with in F1. Driving force: Felipe Massa (pictured) and Valtteri Bottas will both be retained by Williams for the 2015 season . In his first year with Williams, following his release from Ferrari at the end of last season, Massa has been involved in a number of unfortunate incidents that have hindered his results. But given the 33-year-old's experience, he has endeared himself to the team, scoring Williams' first pole for two years in the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Bottas, who started out as test driver in 2010 before progressing to the race seat in 2012, has gone from strength to strength, scoring four podiums in the last five races to lie fifth in the drivers' standings. Team principal Sir Frank Williams said: 'I'm delighted to confirm Felipe and Valtteri will be racing for Williams again in 2015. Arrival: Finnish driver Bottas, who started as a test driver in 2010, has impressed for Williams this season . 'Felipe is a pleasure to work with, and combines raw pace with a wealth of experience. 'As for Valtteri, we have known for many years he is a very special talent, and in the FW36 we have given him a car that is allowing him to demonstrate his skills. 'The team is having a much improved 2014 season, and the skill of our drivers and their feedback to our engineers has proved crucial in this. 'This announcement gives us excellent stability for 2015 but of course we are very much focusing our attention on maximising the full potential of the car in the remaining seven races of this season.' The confirmation, ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, ends gossip surrounding Bottas as he had started to be linked with rival teams. Top three: Bottas will start behind Lewis Hamilton (centre) and Nico Rosberg for today's Italian Grand Prix . In confirming his immediate future with Williams, Bottas said: 'I've been a member of the Williams team for five years now and we have developed together throughout that time which is a great feeling. 'The team has also made some very impressive gains this season and I'm confident I'm at a team that is moving in the right direction and can continue to be competitive. 'Sir Frank and Claire (deputy team principal) have put a lot of faith in me and I'm very grateful they continue to do so. 'Felipe and I have a good working relationship and this early announcement will help us both input into the ongoing development of this year's car and next year's car.' Massa believes the team, currently pressuring Ferrari for third in the constructors' championship, have built a solid platform this season on which they can build for 2015. Massa said: 'I'm really enjoying my time at Williams and I feel settled here. 'Williams is such an iconic name in motor racing and I have a lot of pride when racing for this team. 'This season we have started to show our true potential, and I'm driving a car that is looking strong and has improved a lot as the season has progressed which is very encouraging for the future. 'It's important we continue to push in the second half of the season and that we start 2015 with some really good momentum we can build on.'","Williams announce unchanged line-up ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix .

"By . Andrew Levy for the Daily Mail . From Guy Fawkes’ lantern to a bucket used in the Great Fire of London and a horse gas mask from the First World War, they are items that bring history to life. Now they are being put to use in a project to liven up ‘dry’ text books used by history students in schools. A hundred objects have been chosen from museums around the country dating from 700,000 years ago to the modern day. Scroll down for video . Bringing history to life: School pupils will learn history through 100 objects including the 7th Century Sutton Hoo helmet, kept at London's British Museum (left), and the 700,000-year-old Happisburgh flint hand axe in Norfolk . War horse: The objects include an example of the gas masks worn by horses during the First World War . Other artefacts from British history include the Sutton Hoo helmet, a medieval wine jug and a Charles I commemorative ring. World history will be represented too in objects such as a Mesopotamian clay tablet, an early Islamic encyclopaedia and a Russian revolutionary plate. The idea of history being taught through a hundred objects coincides with the introduction of a tough new chronological curriculum. Children aged five to 14 and their teachers are being encouraged to access images online and learn about them from reliable entries written by curators. There will also be information about how to see them in person. Artefacts: Guy Fawkes' lantern is on the list (left), as is an Enigma coding machine at Bletchley Park (right) History: The 4,500-year-old Standard of Ur, an elaborate artwork, was found in a tomb in what is now Iraq . Launching the scheme yesterday, schools minister Nick Gibb it had been inspired by Victorian teaching methods which enlivened ‘quite dry’ history books. He said: ‘I often get accused of wanting to take us back to the Victorian era, which is just absolutely not true, but the Victorians did have that approach of teaching using an object. ‘That’s where the phrase “object lesson” comes from. They’d base whole lessons on, for example, a stuffed parrot and the whole lesson would revolve around that.’ The format is similar to one use in the recent BBC documentary History of the World in 100 Objects, which has had 35 million downloads. Five to seven-year-olds will view artefacts including Florence Nightingale’s writing box and Queen Victoria’s Jubilee badge. Key stage two pupils, aged seven to 11, will look into objects like an Egyptian mummy and an Iron Age boat. Trinkets: The objects include a badge to mark Queen Victoria's jubilee (left) and a Norman ivory game counter . Steaming its way into history: Built in 1825, there is Stephenson's first passenger locomotive Locomotion No 1 . Secondary school pupils, up to the age of 14, will discover items such as William III’s playing cards and a Wedgwood tea set. Some 20 items are already available online and the remainder will be uploaded before the end of the year. The oldest is the 700,000-year-old Happisburgh hand axe found in Norfolk. The most recent is a protest poster from the Middle East. Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum which worked on the scheme with the Department for Education, said: ‘This project will enable every primary and secondary school child in the country to access museum objects from the magnificent to the mundane but all of which can teach us about our global history. This is an extremely exciting project.’ Historian and broadcaster Dan Snow hailed the ‘amazing resources for young people’. He said: ‘The wealth of sources, images and links will enliven any lesson and foster a deeper understanding and love of the past in anyone who comes into contact with them.’ 1 Fire bucket from the Great Fire of London – Museum of London (right) 2 Florence Nightingale’s writing box – Florence Nightingale Museum . 3 Guy Fawkes’ lantern - Ashmolean Museum . 4 Queen Victoria’s Jubilee badge - British Museum . 5 The Happisburgh handaxe - Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery . 6 Bone engraved with a horse - Creswell Crags Museum, Worksop . 7 Mesolithic woodworking tool - British Museum . 8 Mesolithic headdress - Scarborough Collections . 9 Carved stone balls from Skara Brae – National Museum of Scotland . 10 Neolithic quern for making flour - British Museum . 11 Mace head from near Stonehenge - Wiltshire Museum . 12 Early Iron Age boat Vivacity - Peterborough Culture and Leisure Trust . 13 Iron Age horse trappings – British Museum . 14 Tools for making clothes in Iron Age Britain - British Museum . 15 Tombstone of a Roman cavalryman – Corinium Museum . 16 The Roman temple in Bath – Roman Baths Museum, Bath (below) 17 Cup decorated with gladiators – Colchester Museum . 18 Head of the emperor Hadrian –British Museum . 19 Roman mystery word square - Manchester Museum . 20 Roman silver pepper pot - British Museum . 21 Roman game – Llandudno Museum . 22 Anglo-Saxon casket – British Museum . 23 Scottish silver brooch – National Museum of Scotland . 24 Figurine of an Anglo-Saxon man - Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery .

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . and Australian Associated Press . A disturbing video of a union official verbally abusing a building inspector at a construction site in Adelaide has emerged at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. The commission, which is looking into allegations against officials from the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), was shown the footage of union official John Perkovic yelling at Seamus Flynn, a Fair Work Building and Construction inspector. Mr Perkovic can be heard repeatedly calling Mr Flynn a 'f***ing piece of s***' in the video, in which he also appears to touch Mr Flynn's stomach while saying 'look at this gut'. Scroll down for video . The Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption was shown a video of union official John Perkovic yelling at Seamus Flynn, a Fair Work Building and Construction inspector on Tuesday . During the verbal attack, Mr Perkovic stood inches from his victim's face and Mr Flynn could be heard saying 'get away from me' and 'don't touch me'. Mr Perkovic: Do you want a f****** photo, you f****** piece of s***? Mr Flynn: I'll take this further. Fair Work Inspector Angeliek Peters: Just to let you know, this is being recorded. Mr Perkovic: You gonna take it further. You're just about to have a heart attack, you're s******* yellow, you piece of s***. Mr Flynn: I can... Mr Perkovic: Go f***... and brush your teeth next time, you piece of s***, all right? Mr Flynn: (Indistinct). Ms Peters: This is being recorded so you're (indistinct). Mr Perkovic: Oh yeah. Not a coward like you, you piece of s***. Mr Flynn: Don't touch me. Mr Perkovic: Look at this gut, hey. Mr Flynn: Get away from me. Mr Perkovic: Look at this gut. Ms Peters: Guys, you knew that this was being recorded. Mr Perkovic: Look at him. Mr Flynn: Get away from me. Mr Perkovic: He's using his gut, he's using his gut, the piece of s***. You f****** coward. I'd f****** take you to school, you f****** piece of s*** . Mr Flynn has arrived to the building site to check reports that the union had entered without permits, AAP reports. In his statement, Mr Flynn said Mr Perkovic 'quickly moved towards me, saying `you f****ing maggot, what are you taking a photo of me for you piece of s***'. The video also shows Mr Perkovic saying: 'You f***ing coward, I'd f***ing take you to school, you f***ing piece of s***'. CFMEU's national construction secretary Dave Noonan, addressed the video in a press release by saying: 'Swearing on building sites is nothing new and doesn't warrant a $53 million royal commission'. Other inspectors have also reported to the commission that 'intimidation tactics' have been used against them by union officials, according to the ABC. Matthew Barr claimed that eight officials confronted him at Sydney's Barangaroo construction site less than two months ago, while Jared O'Connor told the commission that a union official called him a 'grub' and announced his mobile phone number over a megaphone at the same site. 'The threat of violence through words or conduct such as to lead another to apprehend assault itself constitutes an assault, which is an offence punishable under the laws of both New South Wales and South Australia.' Counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar said, according to the ABC. The commission also looked into the deleting of numerous emails after it had sent letters to the CFMEU on May 30, demanding extensive records be supplied within one week, including any files relating to any enterprise bargaining agreements reached with companies operated by underworld-linked businessman George Alex. Up to nine people worked to delete emails over three days at the branch, starting from June 23, 2014, to free up space on the email system and get it working again, Kylie Wray, general manager of the NSW branch of the CFMEU said. She said she asked union staff to delete an unknown number of emails after a 'disk space error' caused a crash that stopped the branch receiving external emails and denied that she wanted to delete the emails which the commission wanted to see. There had been no backup for the email system since a May 2010 firebombing of the union office. CFMEU national construction secretary Dave Noonan said in a press release after the day's hearing that the union had complied with the commission's requests. 'There has been no attempt by anyone in the union to knowingly destroy documents relevant to the Royal Commission,' he said in the press release. The hearing continues on Wednesday.","The video was shown at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption on Tuesday .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Carol Howard, 35, a firearms officer with the Met Police, has been awarded £37,000 after suffering race and sexual discrimination . Scotland Yard  leaked information about the arrest of a glamorous firearms officer in a bid to 'deflect' negative publicity surrounding her discrimination case, it has been found. Carol Howard, 35, won a racial and sexual discrimination case against the London force in July this year, after judges ruled she had been 'bullied' while serving in the Metropolitan Police’s 700-strong Diplomatic Protection Group. Today, Mrs Howard received £37,000 in damages after the tribunal branded the treatment of police chiefs towards the officer as ‘malicious, insulting and oppressive’. The force was heavily criticised for releasing details of PC Howard’s arrest and suspension from duty over an unrelated dispute with her ex-husband. Tribunal judges found the force had leaked the information as a way to 'deflect attention' and to 'portray her in a negative light', once the tribunal had found in her favour. The force was also accused of deliberately deleting findings of discrimination from internal reviews. And Mrs Howard was awarded an extra £10,000 over the fact the Met's commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe had failed to issue an apology to the officer since the ruling. After the hearing, Mrs Howard, from Coulson, Surrey, said she was glad the tribunal had recognised the force's 'dirty tricks' to 'smear' her name, but said that no amount of compensation could make up for what she had been through. She said: 'Today is not a day for celebration. I have been put through a two-year ordeal in which I have been bullied, harassed and victimised simply because of my gender and race. 'No amount of compensation will ever make up for the hurt and upset that I have been caused. 'Since I won my initial hearing, the Metropolitan Police has failed to apologise to me or express any regret at the treatment I received. The only reaction from the police was to smear my name by releasing misleading details of my arrests. 'I am glad that the tribunal recognised that this leak of information was a dirty trick by the Metropolitan Police aimed solely at deflecting criticism from itself while simultaneously seriously damaging my reputation. 'The arrests were, I believe, also motivated by revenge simply because I made a stand against police bullying. Even today I am still having to fight to clear my name, in this regard, as part of this ongoing nightmare.' PC Howard, who was one of just two black officers in the protection group, was discriminated against for being a black woman by her boss, Acting Inspector David Kelly, the tribunal found. Judges were highly critical of the way the Met Police dealt with the case and called for the force's internal Fairness At Work scheme to be overhauled. She continued: 'I did not willingly seek this employment tribunal but had no other option to pursue it after various attempts to resolve the situation internally with the police proved fruitless. Scroll down for video . The London force was criticised by employment tribunal judges for releasing details of her arrest and suspension from duty over an unrelated dispute with her ex-husband after she won the tribunal . 'In that regard, I am pleased that the tribunal has recommended that the Metropolitan Police's internal complaints system is fully and independently reviewed. 'I worked extremely hard to become a firearms officer in the Diplomatic Protection Group, was proud of my job and always gave 100%. 'It saddens me that I found myself in this position through no fault of my own but I do hope that lessons can be learned from my case which will allow more officers, suffering similar discriminatory treatment, to come forward.' Scotland Yard faced a barrage of negative media coverage over the case in July. Speaking outside court, Mrs Howard said she was glad the judges had recognised the force's 'dirty tricks' but that no amount of compensation could begin to make up for the two-year ordeal . The panel found that, while the force did not name PC Howard, a draft press statement was altered to include more detail about her three arrests linked to a domestic dispute with her estranged husband. The judges said: 'The respondent had received a lot of negative publicity and had been heavily criticised in the media as a result of the tribunal's judgment in favour of the claimant. 'We have no doubt that the second statement was issued to deflect attention and criticism from the respondent and to portray the claimant in a negative light.' PC Howard's solicitor Kiran Daurka, senior employment lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'We are delighted with the tribunal's recognition that PC Carol Howard experienced an extremely distressing and humiliating time throughout more than a year of discrimination against her. The London force was blasted by tribunal judges for being ‘malicious, insulting and oppressive’ and deliberately deleting findings of discrimination from internal reviews . 'The fact the Metropolitan Police did not issue a public apology following the tribunal's decision only exacerbated the hurt and distress felt by our client. This was reflected in the award for aggravated damages and a top award for injury to feelings. 'We now sincerely hope the tribunal's recommendations are implemented as soon as possible, as set out in the tribunal's judgement. 'In particular, we welcome recommendations there be an independent review of previous discrimination complaints brought by its own officers against the Met and also an independent inquiry into how the Met looks into future discrimination allegations. Judges also criticised commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe for failing to express any regret or to apologise for the way PC Howard had been treated . 'The tribunal's powers to make these wide recommendations is currently under threat from a change in the law. The Deregulation Bill will see these tribunal powers removed in future and we will be writing to the House of Lords shortly to ask that this power be retained. 'The power to recommend significant changes is clearly so important in cases such as this where there have been findings of discrimination with potential wide spread consequences.' PC Howard, who is currently on sick leave, was thrust into the spotlight in 2012 when the Met chose her to be a poster girl for a magazine feature on the 10,000 men and women on duty during the Olympics. She brought a claim of discrimination against the Met which was upheld earlier this year. She told the London hearing that she was subjected to sexual and racial discrimination, for which she was awarded aggravated damages. Her award included £25,000 for injury to feelings, £10,000 for aggravated damages, £350 for the financial loss of not being able to do overtime while she was off sick with stress and depression, a 5 per cent increase of £1,767.50 for delays in dealing with the case, and £282.97 interest. At the end of the employment tribunal, judges found Mrs Howard had been 'singled out and targeted' for almost a year by a senior officer. The case also revealed a practice where advisers involved in the internal Fairness At Work complaints process were not allowed to record findings of discrimination. A report had references to discrimination removed over concerns it would be used in a tribunal, and two other cases were cited where similar material was deleted. The system is now under review. After she won the hearing, it emerged that Mrs Howard had been held twice by Sussex Police - once last year and once in January this year. She was also arrested by Scotland Yard for alleged assault in April this year. Mrs Howard has been told that she will face no further action over the arrest by the Met Police. In relation to the arrests by Sussex police, a file is currently with prosecutors who are considering whether to bring charges.","Carol Howard, 35, won race and sex discrimination case against Met in July .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A great-grandfather has been left terrified after being forced to fight off a half-naked intruder who  broke into his house and tried to get into bed with him. Peter Than, 76, armed himself with his walking stick after the suspect broke into his home wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and one sock on Sunday morning. After unlawfully entering the pensioner's property in Plymouth, Devon, the suspect then went into his bedroom, pulled back the bed sheets and tried to lie down next to him. Peter Than, 76, fought off the intruder with his walking stick after the suspect broke into his home in Plymouth, Devon, on Sunday and tried to climb into his bed next to him wearing nothing but a pair of shorts and one sock . Mr Than was awoken in the commotion and bundled the stranger out of bed before fighting him off with his walking stick. The thug responded by clubbing the pensioner over the head with a rock used as a doorstop but Mr Than man was able to fend him off. Eventually, the suspect fled the flat and Mr Than - a former mining engineer - was left covered in blood from a head wound. He said: 'I pushed him out of the bed and he fell off, then I tried to push him out of the flat door. Mr Than, a former mining engineer, suffered cuts and bruises to his face and head after the suspect clobbered him with a rock as he made his getaway . 'I was worried as I have a bit of a heart problem. I've never punched anybody, even as a schoolboy, but I did hit him with my walking stick. 'He threw a few punches but then he picked up a rock I use as a door stop. 'I was able to push him through the front door and pushed it shut but he managed to open it and came back in to give me a bit more bashing. 'Eventually I got him to the door and he ran.' After fighting the intruder off, Mr Than staggered to a neighbour's flat who called for paramedics and police. He added: 'I had blood all over me, dripping onto the floor. I thought I was going to die. 'I felt nothing but the blood on my head and face. 'The hospital staff patched me up very well with stitches and glue to close the wounds. 'They did a marvellous job. I worry that I'm never going to see my own face again as I have lot of scars.' Neighbours watched the suspect flee the scene in what they described to police as 'jockey shorts and a T-shirt.' Officers believe the stranger was drunk but they have no idea why he tried to climb into the pensioner's bed. Devon and Cornwall Police said the suspect was described as white, in his 30s, around 6ft tall and of medium build. He wore a pair of black and white chequered knee-length shorts, a grey top, just one sock and no shoes. Detective Constable Christian Ferris said: 'This was a violent assault on an elderly man in his own home. The unusual incident occurred at Mr Than's flat in Albert Road, Plymouth, Devon, at about 7am on Sunday . 'Mr Than has been left with facial injuries and a wound to his chest. He had lost a lot of blood before he got to hospital. 'The suspect is unknown to Mr Than and it appears from descriptions he may have been under the influence of alcohol. 'We want to hear from anyone who was in the area or has information about this incident.' Anyone with information should contact Devon and Cornwall Police on 101.","Peter Than was shocked when topless intruder broke in and got into his bed .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Scientists have been left stumped by a giant jellyfish with no tentacles that was found off the coast of Australia. The huge creature, called Keesingia giga, has been described by experts as extremely venomous and 'as long as a human arm'. It is thought to cause Irukandji syndrome, a condition that can be fatal to humans. A giant new species of lethal jellyfish discovered in Australian waters. Keesingia gigas (shown) are gargantuan members of the Irukandji jellyfish family. They can grow to be as long as a human arm, but other members of its genus are only as big as a fingernail . The jellyfish was found off the north-west coast of Western Australia by Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, the director of Marine Stinger Advisory Services in Queensland reports The Guardian. It is a species of Irukandji jelly, which are normally only about as big as a fingernail in size. Keesingia gigas, however, was found to be almost as big as a person’s arm. Such animals have been spotted before but a specimen was not captured until 2013. ‘It is absolutely humongous - the body is about 30 to 50 centimetres [12 to 20 inches] tall... It's an absolute whopper of a jellyfish,’ Dr Gershwin told ABC Australia. In her paper discussing the species, she mentions how the sting of the jellyfish has been studied previously. In one instance a person was struck with severe Irukandji syndrome, while another victim had just local and groin pain. In the past Irukandji syndrome has been fatal in humans, as it can cause strokes or heart failures in addition to nausea and vomiting. The jellyfish has been spotted off the north-west coast of Western Australia at Shark Bay and Ningaloo Reef . Scientists are confused as the jellyfish has been found with no tentacles (seen in picture). It is also known to carry a powerful venom that can cause Irukandji syndrome. This can cause nausea and vomiting and in some instances can even be fatal in humans . The jellyfish was found off the north-west coast of Western Australia by Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, the director of Marine Stinger Advisory Services in Queensland. Such animals have been spotted before but a specimen was not captured until 2013 . For . those who do get stung by a jellyfish, treatments vary according to the . nature of the sting and which type of jellyfish is responsible. ‘The . most important thing to remember is that when you are stung the . jellyfish usually leaves its tentacle on you, so you should wash the . wound and add ice,' says Dr Peter Richardson, director of the Marine . Conservation Society’s biodiversity programme. Taking . antihistamines, scraping the skin with a (not-too-sharp) knife edge and . applying iced water to the injured area are just three methods used to . soothe injuries. There’s . no ‘miracle cure’ for a jellyfish sting. Urinating on the wound does . not help - although it is widely believed that it does. But . if you are stung by a particularly venomous jellyfish like a box . jellyfish overseas - or even a Lion’s Mane here in Britain - you must . seek medical attention. Every Kessingia gigas that has been found so far, however, has been seen to have no tentacles - leading to some confusion. It is widely accepted that the sting is transmitted through tentacles, so quite how this creature performs an attack is a mystery. ‘Jellyfish always have tentacles...that’s how they catch their food. The tentacles are where they concentrate their stinging cells,' Dr Gershwin told the Australian Assocaited Press. 'I think probably it does have tentacles but by random chance the specimens that we photographed and obtained don’t have them anymore.' This could have been because it sheds them on a regular occasions as a defence mechanism, Dr Gershwin added. 'I think it's probably a fairly tame explanation - I just don't know what it is.' A spokesperson from the Marine Conservation Society, meanwhile, tells MailOnline: 'Clearly there is enough toxin in the stinging cells in the bell of this jellyfish to negate the need for tentacles that are used to physically ""capture"" or ""hold onto"" prey. 'Many species evolve in different ways and there are many different ways to survive as an ""ocean drifter"". 'Clearly this jellyfish has developed the necessary tools to capture and deal with prey that allows it survive very well in the open water environment.' And Dr Jane Fromont of the Western Australian Museum, where the species will be kept, has warmed that swimmers should be wary of these creatures in future. However, it is not necessarily the size of the jellyfish that should be feared - previous Irukandji jellyfish that have killed humans have been known to be as small as a peanut. Pictured here is a Malo kingi jellyfish, part of the same family as Keesingia gigas, which has been known to kill a human. Irukandji jellyfish are normally about this size, that of a fingernail, making the recent finding of Keesingia gigas all the more astounding .","A giant jellyfish has been found off the coast of Western Australia .

"By . Steve Nolan . With security measures so stringent at airports around the world, it is a wonder that he managed to hop his way past guards without being noticed. Police were forced to lock down part of an Australian terminal building after a kangaroo surprised shoppers by creeping into a pharmacy. The marsupial, who was pictured in the skincare aisle of the store, probably made his way to the right part of the Melbourne Airport - he had been hit by a car outside and suffered minor injuries. Scroll down for video: . Unusual flying companion: Volunteer rescuers Ella Rountree, left, and Geoffrey Fuller pose for a photo with Cyrus the kangaroo who they captured at Melbourne airport . Going shopping: The kangaroo surprised shoppers in a pharmacy in the terminal when he hopped into the skin care aisle . The eastern grey male, who was nicknamed Cyrus, had to be sedated and carried out of the airport by wildlife volunteers. As he made his way through the terminal, astonished passengers hurried out of its path. Among them was comedian Julia Morris who wasn't joking when she sent out a Tweet reading: 'OK, so I'm at Melbourne airport & a KANGAROO has just jumped into the chemist.' Cyrus was taken to a nearby vet's where his injuries were assessed. Just looking: The kangaroo is pictured perusing one of the store's aisles . Sealed off: Police sealed off the area around the pharmacy while the animal was recovered . Wildlife volunteer Ella Rountree said that an initial examination showed that Cyrus the kangaroo had injuries to his feet. 'His claws are quite worn and that's from hopping down the tarmac and things like that,' she said. Mr Johnson Law, who works in the chemist's shop, said that at first he did not believe his co-worker when she told him there was a kangaroo in there. 'I just kept on doing what I was doing - I thought she was joking,' he said. Taken to the vet's: The kangaroo is carried from the store after being tranquilised by wildlife volunteers . It is not the first time a kangaroo has caused a stir at Melbourne Airport. In January a marsupial had to be shot with a tranquiliser gun after leading security guards and police on a chase around the terminal car park. Another kangaroo, nicknamed Qantas, also had to be tranquilised in the car park in October last year. The airport is located in an area of bushland which is frequented by the animals. Fortunately, the runway itself is guarded so that they cannot hop onto the tarmac. Although kangaroos are seen as largely placid animals, they can be aggressive towards humans. A 2002 census of wildlife in Australia recorded almost 60million kangaroos in the country.","The kangaroo, nicknamed Cyrus, had to be sedated by wildlife volunteers .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Neanderthals and modern humans both lived in Europe at the same time for up 5,400 years - and may have interbred. New research - looking at a period dating back 40,000 years - claims Neanderthals disappeared at different times, instead of being suddenly replaced by modern humans, as previously thought. Scientists used new dating evidence for 200 bone, charcoal and shell samples from 40 key European sites to prove the two groups overlapped for a significant period of time. Neanderthals and modern humans both lived in Europe between 2,600 and 5,400 years, according to new research, which analysed Neanderthal remains and tools. Neanderthal foot bones found in Spain are shown . It is the first time that researchers have constructed a timeline showing when the last Neanderthals died out. Because they and modern humans overlapped for a significant period, there was ‘ample time’ for interaction and interbreeding, experts said. Neanderthals were a human sub-species distantly related to, but genetically different from, modern humans, or Homo sapiens. They had already been living in Europe for hundreds of thousands of years when the first modern humans migrated out of Africa. Professor Chris Stringer, Research Leader in Human Origins, the Natural History Museum, London said that interbreeding probably occurred soon after small groups of modern humans began to leave their African homeland about 60,000 years ago. It is thought Neanderthals died out because they were unable to compete with our ancestors for food and resources. Experts now think that Neanderthals disappeared at different times across Europe instead of suddenly being replaced by modern humans . A team led by the University of Oxford dated the samples from sites that ranged from Spain to Russia. All of them were linked with the Neanderthal tool-making industry, known as Mousterian, or were ‘transitional’ sites containing stone tools (pictured) associated with either early modern humans or Neanderthals . It is commonly thought that Neanderthals died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources. The new research now suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred. Experts believe that Neanderthals ‘may have survived in dwindling pockets of Europe’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct, instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans. The study didn’t cover eastern regions such as Uzbekistan and Siberia, where Neanderthals are also known to have lived. ‘So it is still possible Neanderthals lingered later in some areas,’ Professor Chris Stringer said. ‘Overall pattern seems clear – the Neanderthals had largely, and perhaps entirely, vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago.’ A severe Heinrich event between 39,000 and 40,000 years ago, meant that cold and dry conditions hit Europe. ‘It remains to be seen whether that event delivered the coup de grâce to a Neanderthal population that was already low in numbers and genetic diversity, and trying to cope with economic competition from incoming groups of Homo sapiens,’ Professor Stringer said. A team led by the University of Oxford, dated the samples from sites that ranged from Spain to Russia. All of them were linked with the Neanderthal tool-making industry, known as Mousterian, or were ‘transitional’ sites containing stone tools associated with either early modern humans or Neanderthals. This tool making industry ended between 39,260 and 41,030 years ago, and suggests the overlap between Neanderthals and modern humans. The study claims that Neanderthals ‘may have survived in dwindling pockets of Europe’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct. It took experts six years to build mathematical models that combined the new radiocarbon dates with established archaeological evidence, according to the study, published in the journal Nature. Lead researcher Professor Thomas Higham, from Oxford University, said: Previous radiocarbon dates have often underestimated the age of samples from sites associated with Neanderthals because the organic matter was contaminated with modern particles. ‘We used ultrafiltration methods, which purify the extracted collagen from bone, to avoid the risk of modern contamination. ‘This means we can say with more confidence that we have finally resolved the timing of the disappearance of our close cousins, the Neanderthals. ‘Of course the Neanderthals are not completely extinct because some of their genes are in most of us today.’ The study suggests that Neanderthals ‘may have survived in dwindling pockets of Europe’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct. Here, researchers examine samples found in a Spanish cave . Because Neanderthals and modern humans overlapped for a significant period, there was ‘ample time’ for interaction and interbreeding, experts said. The heavy jawbone of a Neanderthal is pictured . The study shows that Neanderthals did interbreed over a sustained period of time, the researchers say. But they are unsure where interbreeding may have happened in Eurasia, or whether it occurred once or several times. ‘Significant interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern humans had probably already occurred in Asia more than 50,000 years ago, so the dating evidence now indicates that the two populations could have been in some kind of contact with each other for up to 20,000 years, first in Asia then later in Europe,’ Professor Stringer. ‘This may support the idea that some of the changes in Neanderthal and early modern human technology after 60,000 years ago can be attributed to a process of acculturation between these two human groups.’ Lead researcher Professor Thomas Higham, from Oxford University, said:  ‘Previous radiocarbon dates have often underestimated the age of samples from sites associated with Neanderthals - because the organic matter was contaminated with modern particles.'

One year on from the flash floods that devastated the town of Boulder, Colorado, a young couple are celebrating the first birthday of their daughter who was born amid the chaos. When Ingrid Combs, the daughter of Marty and Laura Combs who was born on September 12, 2013, is older her parents plan to share with her the traumatic events of the fateful day she entered the world. 'When we tell her more about her birth story,' Laura, 28, told The Denver Post, 'we'll say we're lucky that we're alive, and lucky that she's alive. Lucky to be alive: Ingrid Combs, the daughter of Marty and Laura Combs who was born on September 12, 2013, just as flash floods devastated the family's home in Boulder, Colorado . 'One of the things we'll remember is just not taking any day for granted. Anything can happen.' The Combs home, which they had only moved into three months before, was one of hundreds in the city almost totally destroyed by the flooding which killed 10 people across the state - including four in Boulder County. Heavy overnight rainfall had sparked flash flooding across the state from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, more than 100 miles south. Boulder County - including the city of Boulder - was one of the hardest hit areas, with as much as six inches falling in just 12 hours overnight into the morning causing rock and mudslides. Heavy overnight rainfall on Sept 12 2013 sparked flash flooding across the state from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs, more than 100 miles south . Marty Combs recalls waking up at 1 a.m. to the sound of water and mud rushing into the basement of their home. By that stage, Laura was several days overdue. By 1:30 a.m., the Combs realized their home was in danger of collapsing and so Marty transported his nine-months-pregnant wife to a neighbors' home. 'I was just hoping and praying I didn't go into labor in the middle of the night,' recalls Laura. She made it through the night, but then started to go into labor the next morning. 'I was in complete denial,' she said. 'I thought, ""This is not the time. I'm not having a baby right now. Our house is destroyed.""' The couple was rushed to Boulder Community Health in an emergency vehicle at 10:30 a.m. and at 2:06 p.m. on Sept. 12, Ingrid was born. Marty and Laura Combs say they plan to tell their daughter Ingrid all about  the traumatic events of the fateful day she entered the world on Sept 12 2013 . 'In a tragedy situation, I think she was a miracle,' said Laura. 'She's our little gift, our flood survivor.' With his daughter safe and well, Marty made the trip back to the family's home to collect several items for the baby. The house had been filled with more than two feet of mud and sludge, while the family's car had been buried above the wheels. The extensive damage required the Combs to completely redo their basement, get a new furnace and water heater, replace their buried SUV and fix their crumbled driveway. The Federal Emergency Management Agency covered less than 10 percent of their total costs, although Servpro and several church organizations pitched in money, volunteer hours and even a few new appliances. The basement is mud-free and recarpeted. The doors and windows have been replaced and there's even a new back patio, built with rock recovered from a nearby pile of flood debris. 'It was cool to build something out of the disaster,' said Marty, 'sort of as a reminder.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Early mammals alive when dinosaurs roamed the Earth were picky eaters, new research suggests. Analysis of tiny fossil mammals from South Wales is shedding new light on the function and diets of our earliest ancestors. For many people, mere mention of the word Jurassic conjures up images of huge dinosaurs chomping their way through lush vegetation - and each other. Analyses of fossilised mammals discovered in South Wales are shedding light on the creatures’ diets. The teeth of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium (pictured left and right)  hunted their prey on the  island they shared, which is now Glamorgan, South Wales, and are different insects . However, . mammals and their immediate ancestors were also around in the Jurassic . period, from 201 to 145 million years ago, albeit as rather less . spectacular creatures. The . shrew-sized, early Jurassic mammals were thought to have been confined . to the ecological margins, eating whatever insects they could find. However, . this was also the time when new mammal characteristics - such as better . hearing and teeth capable of precise chewing - were developing. Palaeontologists from the Universities of Bristol and Leicester studied shrew-sized early Jurassic mammals, which were originally thought to have eaten any insects that they could find. By studying their teeth, they found that two of the earliest mammals, Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium, were not generalised insectivores but had already evolved specialised diets, feeding on distinct types of insects. The experts were interested in whether competition was driving the evolution of features such as better hearing and teeth capable of precise chewing. So, they studied the fossils of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium found in Glamorgan, South Wales which 200 million years ago consisted of a series of small islands in a shallow continental sea. Mammals scurried alongside the dinosaurs between 201 and 145 million years ago. A footprint made by a theropod in what is now the south coast of Wales is pictured. Unlike with some dinosaur fossils, none of the mammal fossils have the sort of exceptional preservation that includes stomach contents to infer diet . Footprints made by dinosaurs 200 million years ago have been vandalised by amateur fossil hunters in Wales. The tracks were among the best examples anywhere in the world and their precise location has largely remained a secret. But blundering fossil hunters have damaged the footprints by filling one with plaster of Paris and hammering it in a bid to remove their plaster cast. They also lit fires on the rock shelf where the tracks have laid undisturbed since Jurassic times. An investigation has been launched to assess the damage and track down the culprits. Mr Langford discovered the damage while taking a party of 10 students to the site at Bendrick Rock, between Barry and Sully, on the South Wales coast. The footprints are believed to have been left by three-toed meat-eating theropod dinosaurs, that walked on their hind legs. Some wider four-toed footprints are believed to belong to a plant eating dinosaur which would have walked on all fours. The footprints were made by some of the earliest dinosaurs in the world and it is possible that ancestral crocodile-like replies walked among them. At the time, the site lay in the arid north belt of the equator and South Wales was a hot desert. Lead author, Dr Pamela Gill of the University of Bristol explained: ‘None of the fossils of the earliest mammals have the sort of exceptional preservation that includes stomach contents to infer diet. 'Instead we used a range of new techniques which we applied to our fossil finds of broken jaws and isolated teeth. ‘Our results confirm that the diversification of mammalian species at the time was linked with differences in diet and ecology.’ The team studied X-rays and CT scans to reveal the internal anatomy of the creatures’ tiny jaws, which are only 2cm in length. As the jaws are in many pieces, the scans were 'stitched together' to make a complete digital reconstruction. Finite element modelling – a technique used to design hip joints and bridges - was used to analyse the strength of the animals’ jaws, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The technique showed that Kuehneotherium and Morganucodon had very different abilities for catching and chewing prey. The teeth of Morganucodon and Kuehneotherium had different patterns of microscopic pits and scratches, known as 'microwear'. This indicated they were eating different things with Morganucodon favouring harder, crunchier food items such as beetles while Kuehneotherium selected softer foods such as scorpion flies which were common at the time. Professor Mark Purnell of the University of Leicester said: ‘This is the first time that tooth wear patterns have been used to analyse the diet of mammals this old. ‘That their tooth wear compares so closely to bats that specialise on different kinds of insects gives us really strong evidence that these early mammals were not generalists when it came to diet, but were quite definite in their food choices.’ Team leader, Professor Emily Rayfield from the University of Bristol added: ‘This study is important as it shows for the first time that the features that make us unique as mammals, such as having only one set of replacement teeth and a specialised jaw joint and hearing apparatus, were associated with the very earliest mammals beginning to specialise their teeth and jaws to eat different things.’","Mammals scurried alongside the dinosaurs 145 to 201 million years ago .

Police said his death was not being treated as suspicious . Tributes to Mr Jones (left), a 27-year-old plasterer from Bolton, describe him as 'the nicest person in the world' However, on trying to get out of the broken down lift, Mr Jones fell through the gap and plummeted five floors to the bottom of the lift shaft. Emergency services were called to the Marsden Road flats at about 4.50pm on Saturday after Mr Jones' friend escaped unharmed and raised the alarm. Mr Jones, a plasterer, was taken to Salford Royal Hospital but was pronounced dead about five hours later. It is understood Mr Jones had lived in the block of flats, called Marsden House, for several years.

Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The . current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, . is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. The map has a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 m) per pixel, while the approximately natural colours have been enhanced to bring out the contrast. Voyager 2's ‘eyes’ saw colours slightly different from human eyes, and this map was produced using orange, green and blue filter images. When it passed in 1989, most of the Northern Hemisphere was in darkness and was unseen. Because of the speed of Voyager's visit - about 15 miles (25 km) per second, and the slow rotation of Triton - only the Southern Hemisphere was seen clearly at close distance. The rest of the surface was either in darkness or seen as blurry markings. 'The biggest challenge in ""restoring"" this map was the color of Triton,' Dr Schenk tells MailOnline. 'We had considerable difficulty because some of the colour images were smeared or noisy, and there is some uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the colour images. 'We also do not know exactly what the colour of Triton was in those days.  Earth-based observations gave very different answers. 'We did our best to give at least an impression of what the colour of this very active body at the edge of the Solar System looks like.' And on his website Dr Schenk explains what is being seen in the video and images. ‘Voyager 2 made a hair-raising pass over Neptune’s large moon Triton in August 1989,’ he wrote. ‘Approaching from the deep south, Voyager passed over the north pole of cloud-swept Neptune, almost close enough to brush the far-attenuated upper atmosphere. ‘The gravity of Neptune pulled the spacecraft down toward Triton, passing over the unlit north pole of that bitterly cold icy moon.’ When Voyager 2 passed in 1989, most of the Northern Hemisphere (left) was in darkness and was unseen. Because of the speed of Voyager's visit, about 15 miles (25 km) per second, and the slow rotation of Triton, only the Southern Hemisphere (right) was seen clearly at close distance . Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft ever to have visited Neptune, seen here. Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, Neptune is the last of the hydrogen and helium gas giants in the solar system. More than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth, the planet takes almost 165 Earth years to orbit the sun . Triton is 1,681 miles (2,706 km) across, making it the 16th largest body in the solar system. It is also thought to have an icy surface, and may even have clouds in its skies. In fact, the moon is thought to bear some similarities to Pluto, which makes these recent restorations all the more interesting. Next year on 14 July, Nasa’s New Horizons probe will flyby the dwarf planet, and by using the experiences of Voyager 2 at Triton, engineers hope to get as much data as possible out of the mission. 'The new map of Triton sharpens the details . a bit but also shows us the entire surface, at least as far as Voyager . could see it,' Dr Schenk continues to MailOnline. 'It gives us a sense of how dynamic and active this place . is. More importantly we can compare it with other active worlds like . Europa and Enceladus. 'Perhaps the most important feature of the map is . that it gives us a complete and up-to-date picture of Pluto, her twin, . so that we will be ready when New Horizons gets there next summer.' And on whether he hope a mission visits again in the future, he added: 'I . certainly hope we go back. 'Uranus and Neptune and their strange moons . are among the largest bodies on the Solar System. 'After we go back to . Europa, the next targets should be Uranus, Neptune or both, with modern . scientific instruments like Cassini at Saturn has.' In another historic milestone for the . Voyager mission, 25 August also marks the two-year anniversary of . Voyager 1 reaching interstellar space. It is 37 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft (illustrated) were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from Earth has flown before.Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn.

"Experts this week have warned the internet could be running out of space, but it could also be under a completely different threat - sharks. Google protects its underwater data cables from shark bites with a hi-tech material, according to one of its employees. The fibre optic cables are responsible for carrying the world’s internet traffic, and they are protected from knocks that could break the glass tubes, as well as from shark bites that could break the backbone of the internet. Scroll down for video . Google protects its underwater data cables from shark bites by encasing them in super-strong Kevlar-like fibres, according to one of its employees. A stock image of a great white shark is shown . One of the search giant’s product managers told Network World that the firm uses a Kevlar-like material to provide extra cushioning for cables in the Pacific in order to protect them from shark bites. Kevlar is a high-strength armoured synthetic fibre designed by DuPont, and it seems that Google uses its own equivalent. It is thought that the creatures are so interested in the cables because of the magnetic field they create, which is similar to those made by fish in distress. Sharks may chomp on the cables in the mistaken belief they are about to get an easy meal. Here, a shark attacks a fibre optic cable (not necessarily one of Google's) perhaps because it was attracted by the electric or magnetic field . The fibre optic cables (illustrated) are responsible for carrying the world’s internet traffic and while they are protected from knocks that could break the glass tubes, there is a risk that sharks could damage the backbone of the internet . Lasers are used in the fibre optic cables to send information through glass. Data can be transmitted at speeds of up to one gigabit per second, which is around 100 times faster than copper connections, which appear to be unappealing to sharks. The fibres are encased in plastic coatings in different colours, then wrapped in a protective layer of Kevlar-like material before being sheathed in a polyurethane jacket. Not only does this provide cushioning from knocks and movement, the coating prevents electricity leaking and minimises electrical and magnetic fields emitted. Google has not commented on the attacks, but experts claim it is likely other companies also take measures to protect their cables from apex predators. Google's Faster project will connect Japan to the west coast of the US. The cable will stretch 5,000 miles (8,000km) under the ocean at depths of around 7,000 miles (11,300km) and will then link with local cable systems already in place. Faster is expected to be complete by Spring 2016 . Google is investing further in the underground cable network by backing a project that will span the Pacific Ocean. Called Faster, the $300 million (£178 million) scheme will connect Japan to the west coast of the US. The cable will stretch 5,000 miles (8,000km) under the ocean, and will then link up with local cable systems already in place. Faster is expected to be completed by Spring 2016. On the Japan side, the cable will land at Chikura and Shima and is designed to improve the network further into Asia. While on the US side, the cable will connect networks in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle. ‘At Google we want our products to be fast and reliable, and that requires a great network infrastructure, whether it's for the more than a billion Android users or developers building products on Google Cloud Platform,’ said Urs Hölze, senior vice president of technical infrastructure at Google. ‘And sometimes the fastest path requires going through an ocean. 'That’s why we’re investing in Faster, a new undersea cable that will connect major West Coast cities in the US to two coastal locations in Japan with a design capacity of 60 terabits per second.’ That’s ten million times faster than a household cable modem. Google has previously invested in other cable projects, including Unity in 2008, which also joined Japan to the US, and the South-East Asia Japan Cable (SJC) in 2011.","The fibre optic cables are responsible for carrying the world’s internet traffic .

"By . Associated Press . Mexico's largest crackdown in decades on illegal migration has decreased the flow of Central Americans trying to reach the United States — and has dramatically cut the number of child migrants and families. Convoys of Mexican federal police and immigration service employees in southern Mexico have begun scouring the tracks of the infamous freight train known as 'La Bestia,' or The Beast, hauling migrants from the rail cars and sending them to deportation centers. They have also set up moving roadblocks, checking the documents of passengers on interstate buses. Associated Press journalists who followed the train one night this week as it left the southern state of Chiapas and entered neighboring Oaxaca noticed the drop-off, with just a few dozen mostly adult males perched atop the rumbling cars instead of the hundreds of men, women and children who were there not long ago. The men said they were the only ones able to evade capture. There were only two women and no children on the train. Scroll down for video .

A Mexican crackdown seems to be keeping women and children off the deadly train, known as 'The Beast,' that has traditionally helped thousands of migrants head north . A Central American migrant is led off a northbound train during a raid by federal Mexican authorities (left) while another one hops on (right) The once-open route to the United States has become so difficult that trains now carry a small fraction of the migrants they used to, and almost exclusively adult men . 'They took almost everyone,' said Jorge Ruiz Williams, a 20-year-old Honduran migrant who avoided detention and was seated atop La Bestia on Tuesday night. 'We escaped because we're young and agile.' When the authorities come, the migrants who once circulated openly in shelters and boarded the cars as they were being attached to the locomotive are forced to hide in the woods, where criminals lurk. Some of the Central American men say that instead of trying to cross into the United States they'll now stay and look for work in Mexico. Many families have apparently decided not to attempt the journey through Mexico at all since news of the raids and checkpoints  — combined with stepped up efforts in the U.S. and among Central American governments — reached their communities, said Carlos Solis, the manager of a shelter in Arriaga. He said the city, once bustling with migrants waiting to board the train, emptied out almost overnight.

Migrants jump onto a moving freight train as it departs from Arriaga, Chiapas state, Mexico.

'The word spreads, one person tells another, and it goes down the line,' Solis said. 'They're also going after the coyotes, so it is increasing the cost of the trip and making them move through less visible areas,' he said, referring to the smugglers paid to get migrants through to the U.S. border. American and Mexican officials say they are noticing the same drop-off all along the route. The roundups follow U.S. requests for help from Mexico, as well as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. On Aug. 7, the Department of Homeland Security released data showing the number of unaccompanied children and children traveling with a parent arrested along the Southwest border of the United States in July was roughly 13,000, half what it had been in June. A sole clown shoe belonging to Honduran migrant Jorge Ruiz Williams, 20, lies atop a freight train after it arrived at the station in Ixtepec, Mexico.

When the authorities come, the migrants who once circulated openly in shelters and boarded the cars as they were being attached to the locomotive, are forced to hide in the woods, where criminals lurk . Officials in Chahuites say they do not allow federal police raids on migrants to happen in their small municipality. Strict enforcement is already drawing criticism, because it so closely mirrors the deadly cat-and-mouse game that U.S. border patrol agents have long played with Mexican migrants farther north . DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said the trend appeared to be continuing during the first week of August, and President Barack Obama said Thursday that numbers for the whole month will show a further decline. 'We're seeing a significant downward trend in terms of these unaccompanied children,' Obama said. It is a far cry from the wave of migration that pressed toward the U.S. earlier this year, spurred on by a surge in violence in several Central American countries and news that women and children who reached the United States were being let go inside the country with orders to return for immigration hearings because family shelter space had filled up. From October to July, about 63,000 unaccompanied children were detained after entering the U.S. illegally, double the number from the same period a year earlier. Another 63,000 families — mothers or fathers with young children — were picked up during that period.

A freight train heads north between Arriaga and Chahuites, Mexico . There were no Central American children in the government shelter in Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas, coordinator Jose Guadalupe Villegas Garcia said Thursday. During the surge, at any one time the shelter housed about 15 Central American kids who had been apprehended or rescued by Mexican authorities before crossing the Rio Grande. Officials say the children are being caught long before they get to the border. 'There are very few foreigners,' said Carlos Jimenez, a spokesman with the Mexican family services agency in Reynosa. 'We received three or four children' in August. Omar Zamora, a Border Patrol spokesman in the Rio Grande Valley, where most of the unaccompanied children have entered the U.S., said Thursday that the agency was seeing about 30 to 40 of the children in custody each day in recent weeks. That is down from a peak when 300 or more were arrested in a day earlier this summer. How long Mexico can or will sustain such a massive operation is unclear. Sealing off the notoriously porous border with Guatemala is neither physically possible nor politically popular, and strict enforcement further inland is already drawing criticism, because it so closely mirrors the deadly cat-and-mouse game that U.S. border patrol agents have long played with Mexican migrants farther north.

A pair of Central American migrants studies a map of Mexico as they arrive at a migrant shelter in Ixtepec, after riding atop a freight train from Arriaga, Mexico . But for now, the effort shows no sign of abating. Williams, the Honduran migrant, said dozens of Mexican federal police and immigration agents boarded La Bestia this week at a remote, unscheduled stop and hauled off all but a handful of the most fleet-footed migrants. To escape capture, Williams had to speed across cars and swing down on a steel ladder, injuring his hand in the process, before climbing back aboard when the danger had passed. Criminal gangs who used to prey on migrants on the train, threatening to throw them off unless they cooperated, are hiding in the woods near the highway checkpoints where immigration officials search passing buses, said Aliver Leon Lopez, 29, of Ahuachapan, El Salvador. He was shot in the neck by a band of thieves because he tried to hide his money from them. 'Before each checkpoint you have to get off and walk through the woods,' said Leon Lopez, who still wears a bloody bandage on his neck. 'They (criminals) have located the points where migrants get off to walk.' A migrant rests in a near-empty migrant shelter in Ixtepec, Mexico .

Faced with the nearly overwhelming obstacles in reaching the United States, Leon Lopez and others say they are giving up, at least for now. He plans to apply for a humanitarian visa available in Mexico to those who have been crime victims. Other migrants talked about finding work in Mexico, rather than the United States. 'Before you could get through more easily,' said Abner Ramirez, 30, a coffee picker from Coatepeque, Guatemala, who was sleeping on the side of the railway tracks in Chahuites after fleeing another raid on the train over the weekend. 'If I can get a steady job, a steady paycheck, I'd stay ... to send money back home,' he said. Juan Antonio Salmeron, a 48-year old construction worker from La Union, El Salvador, said he wants to work in the northern Mexico state of Sinaloa, picking fruit or vegetables. 'You can earn good money there,' Salmeron said. Migrants wait beside a train depot in the town of Chahuites, Mexico, which has decided to protect and aid migrants passing through .

"By . Alex Brummer . Ferrari-driving Philip Clarke¿s three-and-a-half years as chief executive had been a very bumpy ride . The change at the top of Tesco was sudden and brutal. But perhaps it was inevitable, considering that Ferrari-driving Philip Clarke’s three-and-a-half years as chief executive had been a very bumpy ride. Certainly, since taking over the wheel from shopping industry genius Sir Terry Leahy, he looked an increasingly isolated figure, not knowing in which direction to move. Clarke had been entrusted with turning round the core grocery enterprise, with a market share of 30 per cent, but instead the High Street giant proceeded to lose a huge volume of custom. Until then, for more than two decades, Tesco could do no wrong. While other supermarkets (most notably J Sainsbury) floundered, Tesco, first under Lord MacLaurin and then under Sir Terry, became a commercial powerhouse, dominated British high streets and edge-of-town shopping centres and took its  brand overseas. Taking advantage of the break-up of the Soviet bloc in eastern Europe, it established itself as the biggest supermarket group across the region from Poland to Slovakia – as well as venturing into South Korea  and Thailand. Although Sir Terry recognised the domestic market was changing too – and spotted potential from a new generation of smaller convenience stores – he failed to pay sufficient attention to the core UK grocery business. At the high point of his Tesco career, one in every seven pounds spent by Britons was in one of his stores. But then, suddenly, after he quit, the retail environment changed rapidly – and the Tesco he had built wasn’t ready for it. The financial collapse of 2007-09, followed by recession, put a huge strain on disposable incomes. Cash-strapped shoppers headed to Tesco’s price-cutting rivals: Asda (owned  by the American giant Walmart), Aldi, Lidl and Poundland. Those with more money moved upmarket to Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and, to a lesser extent, Sainsbury’s. When I interviewed Clarke shortly after he became boss, I noticed that he seemed a little overawed. Although a career Tesco-man who had begun as a shelf-stacker in his native Liverpool and looking like a Sir Terry clone, he seemed distracted and kept fiddling with his iPad. Clearly, like all successful retailers, Tesco had a strong digital model and home delivery service, but Clarke adopted a scattergun approach to novel ideas, hoping that at least some would work. They included the store launching its own Hudl tablet, loaded with Tesco apps, and directing customers to services from  home furnishing to funerals, insurance and digital banking. Tesco had a strong digital model and home delivery service, but Clarke adopted a scattergun approach to novel ideas . Clarke also improved the look of some very tired-looking Tesco shops and made some upmarket moves such as buying the Giraffe restaurant chain and artisan coffee stores Harris + Hoole. However, what people want, particularly  at a time of great financial squeeze, is  bargain prices.The ‘pile it high, sell it cheap’ tradition of Tesco’s mercurial founder Sir John (Jack) Cohen barely seemed to be on his radar. It turned out that parts of the Leahy legacy, especially Fresh & Easy (the chain of grocery stores set up in the United States that cost the firm nearly £2billion), were serious mistakes. Similarly, investment in China distracted Clarke’s attention from crucial changes back home. Online shopping was rapidly taking trade from out-of-town Tesco superstores. For example, why on earth would shoppers buy a big screen TV from Tesco – with a limited selection – when firms such as Amazon offered more choice, similar prices and free delivery? At the high point of his Tesco career, one in every seven pounds spent by Britons was in one of his stores . Also, Tesco’s huge high street range of products began to look superfluous in an age of austerity – whereas Lidl, Aldi & Co shrewdly offered a limited choice at bargain prices. And while Clarke invested time  and money in home delivery, Tesco’s stores were neglected. Many looked as if they hadn’t seen a new coat of paint in years and service levels were poor. The core enterprise was suffering. So, can Dave Lewis (from food and soap giant Unilever) turn things around? He is part of a team that helped make the Anglo-Dutch group, whose interests range from Flora margarine to Dove soap, into a more manageable enterprise. But his background is not in retailing. While Tesco chairman Sir Richard Broadbent said the appointment was designed to restore Tesco’s image as a ‘consumer’ brand, many of Britain’s great high street retailers (such as Justin King, recently of Sainsbury’s, Lord Wolfson of Next and Sir Philip Green of Topshop) will be rolling their eyes. Indeed, Lewis’s appointment is being compared with Marc Bolland’s move from  an early career in manufacture (with the brewer Heineken) to retailing as boss of Marks & Spencer. The transition was not easy at first, though there are now signs that he may finally be achieving some success. And there’s no doubt that Tesco can bounce back. I am convinced that Aldi and Lidl are not a major threat. Discerning shoppers want choice, not loss-leaders such as the much bally-hooed £4 school uniform and a single bargain bottle of Bordeaux when rivals such as Tesco do an excellent and wide range.What’s more, the queues at Lidl and Aldi are much too long, the car parks too small and the lack of choice – one kind of dark chocolate packaged to look like Lindt – will drive the shopper to despair and boredom. It may well be that in recent times, Tesco has been trying to do too much. However, it remains a trusted brand. The notion that somehow it is finished is  a fantasy. A different touch on the tiller might be precisely what it needs – especially as some of the tough decisions already  have been taken.","Philip Clarke had been entrusted with turning round the grocery enterprise .

"The average today is three times as many as in 1999 . Classic white pants are the nation's favourite . 61% admit Fifty Shades of Grey has encouraged them to buy 'special occasion' underwear . By . Bianca London . Fifty Shades of Grey is boosting sales in book shops and sex toy stores alike. And it seems that lingerie outlets are also reaping the rewards of the erotic novel as more women are heading out to buy new underwear. A new study found that women own an average of thirty four pairs of knickers, that’s three times as many as in 1999, when the average was just 12. The Grey effect: Women admit that reading the erotic novel encouraged them to buy more 'special occasion' underwear . And the figure is being boosted by the desire for more ‘special occasion undies’ - dubbed the 'Fifty Shades of Grey effect'. The typical knicker drawer contains 20 everyday pairs and 14 for 'best', according to a poll of 2,000 women for the UK’s leading laundry specialists, Dr Beckmann (Glo White). Most women (56%) say they have separate knicker collections for special occasions and for everyday comfort. The revolution in sexy undies has been led by the upsurge in saucy romance novels like Fifty Shades of Grey and the increasing number of women’s-only underwear retailers. And, of those, 61% admit it has made them more likely to purchase ‘special occasion’ underwear. All white: 58% of women confess that big and comfortable white knickers are their favourite . Dr Beckmann spokesman Susan Fermor said: 'There have clearly been many contributory factors to the upsurge in the number of pairs of knickers owned by British women. 'Our research reveals that they own, on average, three times as many pairs now as they did in 1999. 'And many put it down to this new era of female liberation we seem to be experiencing in the UK.' 'Back in 1999 it would have been unusual for a British woman to admit she was reading a saucy romance novel but now, in 2012, they are loudly and proudly reading similar fiction on the bus, on the train and even expressing their love of books like Fifty Shades of Grey across Facebook and many other social networking sites. 'It is a true 21st Century phenomenon and it is clearly informing British women’s choices when it comes to the way they are expressing themselves, including the amount and kind of underwear they are currently buying.' While the new era of female liberation may have ushered in many changes in 2012, the favourite colour of ladies undies, certainly among the women who wear them, remains the same. A massive 58% of all those women polled admit that bright white knickers are by far their favourite, whether for everyday or special occasions.","The average today is three times as many as in 1999 .

"By . John Naish . The professor, an expert in how drugs affect the brain, says it should soon be possible to get drunk safely ¿ by consuming ¿healthy alcohol' Hangover-free alcohol? Drunkenness that you can switch off with an antidote pill? The controversial former government drugs adviser, Professor David Nutt, has boasted that he is on the threshold of inventing what sounds like the answer to many a sandpaper-tongued Sunday-morning lament. The professor, an expert in how drugs affect the brain, says it should soon be possible to get drunk safely — by consuming ‘healthy alcohol’. He has been experimenting with laboratory-created substances that will supposedly allow people essentially to switch intoxication on and then off again. First, you drink a glass of his synthetic creation, designed to produce the same happy, fuzzy feeling engendered by a moderate amount of alcohol. Then, once you tire of being drunk, you simply swallow an antidote pill to sober you up instantly. Professor Nutt, who works at Imperial College  London, and has spent most of his working life treating alcoholics, says harm-free booze would ‘revolutionise’ healthcare. ‘These ambitions are well within the grasp of modern neuroscience,’ he says. The professor, it must be said, has a notorious record as a self-publicist and has previous form in championing ‘healthy’ inebriation. He was sacked from his post as the Government’s chief drugs adviser in 2009 for declaring that cannabis, Ecstasy and LSD are less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes. Indeed, he claimed taking Ecstasy is no more dangerous than riding a horse. Despite widespread criticism that downgrading Ecstasy would send out the wrong message and could convince youngsters it was all right to take the drug, he put his thesis to the test in a stunt on Channel 4 with an ‘experiment’ on several participants. True to form, Nutt recently posted a blog celebrating his self-administered experiments with alcohol. ‘After exploring one possible compound, I was quite relaxed and sleepily inebriated for an hour or so, then within minutes of taking the antidote I was up giving a lecture with no impairment whatsoever,’ he said. He claims to be experimenting with substances that copy the way in which alcohol affects one of the brain’s chemical transmitter systems. This system is called gamma aminobutyric acid (Gaba). Its job is to ‘keep the brain calm’, says Nutt. ‘Alcohol relaxes users through mimicking and increasing the Gaba function.’ The problem is that alcohol also potentially causes aggression and addiction, not least because of the way it releases people from their inhibitions. Nutt says that ‘in theory’ he can create a substance that ‘makes people feel relaxed and sociable, and remove the unwanted effects’. That sounds hugely ambitious, if not deluded. Professor Nutt says he may have invented alcohol that gets you drunk without the hangover . For one thing, he seems to ignore the fact that for many, if not most, of us who like a drink, any enjoyment of the intoxication is secondary to the appreciation of the peaty tang of a 12-year-old Islay whisky, for example, the intense fruitiness of a fine Shiraz or the complex bitterness of a Belgian beer brewed by monks. All of these drinks have a unique taste and are steeped in culture and heritage to which the good professor seems oblivious. Presumably, in Nutt’s brave new world, we will all simply ingest some colourless, odourless, flavourless chemical produced in sterile laboratories. And though we might be open to the idea of a problem-free alcohol drug, the fact is that in nature there is no such thing as a free lunch — or a consequence-free drinking session. Science shows you can’t separate the pleasure of being drunk from the long-term damage that being inebriated can cause to your brain. If Nutt’s ‘healthy alcohol’ really works in a similar manner to conventional alcohol, ultimately it will affect the brain in the same ways — thus causing many of the same kinds of social and physical harm. Perhaps most alarmingly, without a hangover, people won’t even realise what sort of damage they’re doing. Without the threat of a hangover, the temptation will be to keep going . Messing around with our mental chemistry is a notoriously inexact science. The human brain is, after all, the most complex biological entity in the known universe. Sousing it with chemicals opens myriad pathways to dangerous unintended consequences, in the short and long term. Only recently have scientists fully unravelled the way in which alcohol affects us. Studies by the University of Chicago Medical Centre show how the drug hits the brain like a sophisticated military task force, knocking out its defences, as well as causing civil disorder and chaos. Alcohol affects brain chemistry by altering levels of neuro-transmitters. These are the chemical messengers that transmit the signals that control thought processes, behaviour and emotion. Alcohol either increases their activity or dampens it, depending on which areas are affected. The Gaba calming system, for example, is affected in numerous ways. As well as making us feel more relaxed under the influence of booze, it also makes us sluggish and slurred. Our inhibitions also get turned down. We become more talkative, more self-confident. This disinhibition, plus the pleasure effects, means that the brain encourages us to have another glass — and then another, and another. Experienced drinkers know this is the point to stop — having suffered the horrors of previous hangovers. Professor Nutt was sacked from his post as the Government¿s chief drugs adviser in 2009 for declaring that cannabis, Ecstasy and LSD are less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes . As Kingsley Amis, the famously bibulous novelist, wrote in his book On Drink: ‘Guilt and shame are prominent constituents of the hangover.’ But without the threat of a  hangover, the temptation will be to keep going. There is another important factor to consider. The drunken brain also shuts down its limbic system, which controls our emotions and memory. Emotions — as we all know — become exaggerated, often with disastrous consequences. This is one of the primary reasons why alcohol-related problems cost the NHS £3.5 billion a year. Most of this money is used to treat the indirect harm caused by alcohol-induced recklessness. A study for NHS North West has shown that half of all violent assaults are related to alcohol, more than half of rapists drink alcohol prior to committing their attacks, and more than a fifth of accidental deaths are alcohol-related. We also know that the brain compensates for the regular presence of alcohol by altering its production of neuro-transmitters. If the drinking stops, physical and mental withdrawal symptoms — even the notorious DTs (delirium tremens — Latin for ‘shaking frenzy’) — can ensue. And the brain tends to develop a tolerance to pleasure-inducing drugs. People need to take ever more of them to achieve the same effect. With Professor Nutt’s ‘healthy alcohol’, there is a possibility that people may simply never take the antidote, but keep taking further doses instead. The fact is that any substance or activity that fires up the brain’s pleasure centres can become addictive. There are other psychological dangers, too. Constant use of pleasure-inducing drugs is also associated with the development of mental illness. As we have seen with the rise in use of super-strength cannabis, being habitually heavily intoxicated can seriously alter the way in which young people behave. However, Professor Nutt is determined to press ahead with his experiments. As he writes in his blog: ‘I have identified five such compounds and need to test them to see if people find the effects as pleasurable as alcohol . . . All that is needed now is funding to test and put them on the market.’ It seems doubtful that his ‘healthy alcohol’ will contain any compounds that induce a sense of personal or social responsibility. Nor can his lab experiments properly investigate his invention’s potential for long-term and widespread damage. Budgetary constraints on his work mean the tests will almost inevitably be too small-scale and short-term to explore the possible dangers fully. Moreover, this laboratory-made alcohol might work perfectly well on someone as drug-literate as Professor Nutt, but he is surely not representative of the most vulnerable people in our society. We need to consider carefully whether we really want ‘healthy alcohol’ to be made widely available, or whether it would create a hangover that might last for generations.","Professor Nutt was sacked from his post as the Government’s chief drugs adviser in 2009 .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Speaker John Bercow has come under fire for his choice of Carol Mills for Clerk of the House . Commons Speaker John Bercow will tomorrow face MPs for the first time since a row erupted over his recommended candidate for the post of clerk of the House. He will reportedly make a statement in the chamber amid growing disquiet among critics of the choice of Australian Carol Mills, who is currently head of the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS) in Canberra. Members have voiced concerns about her lack of knowledge of Westminster procedures and believe she is too inexperienced for the prestigious £200,000-a-year position, which combines the clerk's duties as a key constitutional adviser with the role of Commons chief executive. She has been dubbed the 'Canberra caterer' because her responsibilities at the Australian senate are said to include managing kitchens and cleaning. In an effort to defuse the row, Mr Bercow, who is expected to visit Australia next month, has indicated he wants to split the functions into two jobs, but the suggestion has failed to appease the critics led by Tory Jesse Norman. The Hereford and South Herefordshire MP has submitted a motion calling for Parliament to be given the opportunity to scrutinise the appointment. It has since been signed by 84 members from across the political spectrum, including three former foreign secretaries, a former deputy leader of the Labour party and six former ministers. All three deputy speakers are also understood to be against the choice of Ms Mills. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Norman said: 'So far there has not been any indication that Parliament will be given a say on this matter. Nor has the appointment of Ms Mills been withdrawn. 'Canberra caterer': Carol Mills' appointment has been criticised by MPs from all parties, led by  Jesse Noman . 'Instead it has been proposed that the role of clerk should be split and a new chief executive (presumably Ms Mills) be appointed as well. 'This effectively concedes that Ms Mills is not qualified to be clerk. But instead of dropping her and starting again, it puts the cart before the horse and proposes an on-the-hoof restructuring of the House, all it seems, in order to accommodate her appointment. 'Not only that - it proposes a new role of chief executive at a probable cost of £150,000- £200,000.' Carol Mills is the current Department of Parliamentary Services secretary in Canberra, Australia, a service department that supports the work of the Federal Parliament and is the principal support agency for Parliament House. It works closely with the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives to support the operations of the Parliament and its Committees, has around 800 staff and an annual budget of around $120 million. She is the former director general of Communities NSW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Recreation. He condemned the appointment process as 'flawed', because key people such as deputy speaker Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle had not been included. He also criticised the use of head hunters, adding: 'It is far from clear how they could have recommended a candidate who was, and remains, under investigation in Australia for maladministration.' Mr Norman warned that if allowed to drag on the affair could damage the office of Speaker and, in turn, the Commons. He added: 'We must hope he will move swiftly to end that appointment [in his statement tomorrow], reaffirm the importance of due process in the selection of public officials and put the wider issue of clerkship before a special committee elected by MPs.' Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans added on the Sky News Murnaghan programme that the real issue was whether Mr Bercow would have the 'guts' to stand up and tell the House Ms Mills was no longer the appointee. He went on: 'It has transpired that while she is very good at administration apparently she knows nothing about the constitution and wouldn't know what Erskine May is for instance, which is the bible of the chamber. MP Jesse Norman, who is leading the attack on Bercow's choice of Mills . 'In the meantime the Speaker has said why don't we split the job. Well, if we split the job which may have some sense may not, don't you re-open the appointment panel again to have a look? 'The real issue is whether John is going to have the guts tomorrow to stand up in Parliament and say Carol Mills is no longer the appointee of a position that really now doesn't exist. We need a panel to be set up to look at the job, what sort of job it is first and once we have sorted out what the job is then we can look at the candidates.' Meanwhile, an influential committee of members will meet tomorrow to discuss the Speaker's expected statement. Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, said he would be arguing for a pre-appointment hearing with Ms Mills if she is to be appointed to either the post of clerk or chief executive due to the need for scrutiny. Ms Mills was recommended for the role earlier this month following an open recruitment process with a selection panel led by the Speaker. Mr Bercow is believed to be keen to bring in an outsider to press ahead with modernisation of the House, rather than promoting deputy clerk David Natzler. Downing Street has insisted the new clerk must have the backing of MPs.The Prime Minister is responsible for passing the recommendation to the Queen to be finalised. A spokeswoman for the Speaker told the Mail on Sunday: 'The Speaker is keen to listen to the views of MPs.' She said his visit to Australia was planned a year ago and added that Commonwealth visits to meet other speakers were an 'important element' of his job.

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . John Bercow was forced into a humiliating climbdown last night over his bid to appoint an ‘unqualified’ Australian to run Parliament. The Speaker announced a ‘pause’ in the recruitment of Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year post of Commons clerk, following a barrage of criticism from MPs on all sides. In an extraordinary public revolt, Tory MPs openly heckled Mr Bercow while he made a statement on the issue. Commons Speaker John Bercow today issued the emergency statement to MPs as their returned from their summer recess . There were jeers and heckles from MPs in the Commons as Mr Bercow read his statement on his plans to fill the £200,000-a-year post of Commons Clerk . Then . they queued up to question his judgment over Miss Mills, who has been . dubbed the ‘Canberra caterer’ because her duties at the Australian . senate include managing the kitchens. Leading . Tory Jesse Norman, who is heading a cross-party Commons revolt on her . selection, said Miss Mills was ‘not qualified’ to carry out the role of . clerk – who advises MPs, including the prime minister, on constitutional . matters. Miss Mills, currently head of the Department of Parliamentary . Services in Canberra, was selected by a panel led by Mr Bercow in July. But Downing Street has sat on the recommendation for weeks rather than . passing it on to the Queen for approval, because of mounting concern . among MPs. 'Canberra caterer': Carol Mills' appointment has been criticised by MPs from all parties . Carol Mills is the current Department of Parliamentary Services secretary in Canberra, Australia, a service department that supports the work of the Federal Parliament and is the principal support agency for Parliament House.

She is the former director general of Communities NSW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Recreation. Whitehall sources believe Miss Mills is now unlikely to ever take up the post. One said: ‘Her letter of appointment is more likely to end up in a museum than ever reaching the Queen.’ In . a face-saving move, Mr Bercow yesterday said he would hold a . consultation over whether the post should be split – with the clerk . advising on constitutional matters and a new chief executive responsible . for managing Parliament’s £200million budget. Tory MP Crispin Blunt . likened Mr Bercow’s retreat to the British Army’s ‘evacuation from . hopeless positions’ at Dunkirk and Gallipoli. Former Commons Speaker . Betty Boothroyd warned that Miss Mills would be ‘totally out of her . depth’. Senior Labour figures, including former foreign secretaries Jack . Straw and Margaret Beckett, also raised concerns. Opposition has . been led by Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the appointment . undermines Mr Bercow’s credibility. Tory MP Jesse Norman (left) has launched a Commons motion calling for more scrutiny of the appointment, while Michael Fabricant heckled Mr Bercow in the Chamber today . Former Tory vice-chairman Michael . Fabricant said the Speaker should stand down in 2015, adding: ‘This is . going to get worse, not better. Mr Bercow yesterday insisted there was a . ‘compelling’ case for splitting the clerk’s job because of the growing . ‘complexity’ of Commons affairs and budgets. He added: ‘Thus, highly . skilled management is now vital, as much as expertise in procedure.’ The . move, which would require a change in the law, was called ‘very . foolish’ by Tory MP Rob Wilson. MPs meet today to decide whether to . hold a full parliamentary debate on the issue. Mr Bercow indicated he . would bow to pressure for Miss Mills to face a scrutiny hearing. Experts . have warned she could take legal action if her appointment is blocked . or the job downgraded. Deputy clerk David Natzler is also reported to be . considering legal action after being overlooked. But Mr Bercow said no legal action had so far been launched.

A man accused of riding city buses looking for victims of sexual assault has been charged with raping an 18-year-old disabled woman in the back of a Los Angeles County transit bus last week. Prosecutors say 20-year-old Kerry Trotter pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to one count each of forcible rape and rape of an incompetent person, and two counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object. Authorities say Trotter and the woman boarded the bus at the same stop last Wednesday and he allegedly raped her in the back over a 10 minute period. Scroll down for video . Savage attack: Kerry Trotter, 20, has been charged with raping a mentally disabled woman on the back of a public transit bus last week . The woman, said to have the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, was described by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department as too scared to cry out. 'The victim told our detective that she was shocked, and didn't know what to do, and was in fear of her safety and her life,' sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott told the Los Angeles Times. Video surveillance only captured the back of the attacker's ahead covering her during the attack, according to police. 'I looked at the tape twice,' Metropolitan Transportation Authority official Mark Littman told CBS LA. 'It appears (no one knew until the victim herself told the bus driver.)' Vehicle of attack: Police say Trotter entered the bus, one pictured, at the same time of his victim before following her to the back and raping her over a 10-minute period . Unnoticed: Passengers and the bus driver failed to notice the attack with the victim, who has the mentality of a 10-year-old, later telling police she was too frightened to scream . Trotter was arrested hours after thanks to an anonymous tip by someone who saw an image taken from a surveillance camera. He was ordered to remain jailed in lieu of $285,000 bail. It's not immediately known if Trotter has retained an attorney. If convicted, Trotter faces more than 20 years in prison. Hiding plea: Trotter pleaded not guilty to one count each of forcible rape and rape of an incompetent person, and two counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object while standing outside this courtroom door . Trotter has a lengthy criminal record according to the district attorney's office, including previous allegations of sexual assault. He was on probation for grand theft at the time of his arrest.

"By . Paul Collins . A group of Irish cyclists who travelled to Liverpool to raise money for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster had their bikes stolen –  outside Anfield. The six intended to take part in a 96km charity ride across the city to mark the 25th anniversary of the tragedy that left 96 football fans dead. But after taking a tour of Liverpool FC’s Anfield stadium, they returned to find their bikes, equipment and clothing worth more than £30,000 had been stolen from their van, which was parked nearby. The cyclists were doing a tour of Anfield Stadium, pictured, in Liverpool when their bikes, worth £30,000, were stolen from a van parked nearby . The team were all members of the charity Cycle 4 Sick Children and were fundraising for families of the 96 Liverpool football fans died at Hillsborough in 1989 killed in Britain’s worst ever sporting disaster. Last night campaigners spoke of their shock and disgust at the theft of the bikes. James Leech of the Justice for the 96 campaign said: ‘This is a truly despicable crime. ‘These six fundraisers were riding in support of a charity and deserve to be welcomed to Liverpool - they were guests in our city for a good cause. Instead they were left stranded without their bikes. It really is sick.’ The van, pictured with its windows smashed, was parked near Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium when the theft took place - as the cyclists were enjoying a tour of the club . On the Hillsborough Family Support Group page on Facebook, fellow campaigners were equally horrified. Paula Oulton said: ‘Not everyone in Liverpool is like the scum that did this, please don’t tar us all with the same brush. I find this disgusting, disgraceful and totally unacceptable behaviour and the robbers should be public ally named, shamed and flogged.’ Maxine Gibbs said: ‘Let’s hope the thief who took them can read so they see this disgusting act. In time one of their kids could be using that charity. What comes around goes around.’ Liam Murphy, who along with his wife Stacey founded of the charity after their daughter was diagnosed with a rare heart condition, said they were all devastated and begged the thieves to return the bikes. He said: ‘When we came out from the stadium we discovered the van window had been smashed and all bikes, passports, equipment and cash had been stolen. I feel sick to the stomach actually. ‘It’s really hard to put in words what this has done to us as we were over here to support the victims of Hillsborough. ‘With it being the 25th anniversary and so many of us being Liverpool fans, it is a subject that is close to our heart but this has just devastated us.’ The 96 kilometre bike ride was due to take place across Merseyside with all the money raised going to the charity. The Irish cyclists, pictured before the theft took place, were in Liverpool to support victims of the Hillsborough tragedy . Mr Murphy said the theft left them without any cash and they were forced to return home yesterday. Police have given descriptions of the stolen bikes to all officers in the area and have pledged to do 'whatever it takes' to help the riders take part in the race. Chief Inspector Chris Hitchell said: ‘This is an absolutely terrible thing to happen to anyone visiting our city but it is made worse by the fact that this group are here to raise money for charity and a cause which is dear to so many Liverpudlians’ hearts. He added: ‘Everything possible will be done to identify the offenders responsible for this despicable theft and I would call on people within the local area to help us get these bikes back quickly. One of the bikes stolen in a haul of equipment and clothing worth £30,000 . ‘All five are very distinctive and I would urge anyone who knows where they are being hidden or offered for sale to do the decent and honourable thing and call the police or Crimestoppers.’ ‘The victims have travelled all the way over from Ireland to raise money for the families of the Hillsborough victims and they are understandably distraught at what has happened. ‘We and the community will do whatever we can to help them so that they can still take part in tomorrow’s ride.’","Irish cyclists were in Liverpool to support victims of Hillsborough tragedy .

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . Fresh-faced and delicate, Esme, from Oldham in Manchester, might be barely 15 years old but to many in the Roma gypsy community, she's a catch. Originally from Hungary, she is just one of the estimated 250,000 Romany gypsies to relocate to the UK from Eastern Europe over the last decade. But with the influx of people has come their traditions - including the custom of marrying off girls and boys once they reach the age of 13. Scroll down for video . In demand: Esme is just 15 but has already been asked for as a bride. Luckily, her grandmother says no . Luckily for Esme, that won't be her fate. 'Today girls and boys are equal,' insists her grandmother. 'If she marries at 15 and has many children, she won’t have a life. 'I’m . in love with Romany Gypsy culture, We have beautiful traditions. But . the early marriage custom is no good. It needs to be changed.' Not every gypsy thinks this way however, and Esme's older sister was herself married off aged 14 to a man in Hungary two years ago. While the legal age for marriage in Hungary is 16, the authorities often turn a blind eye. Under the traditional Pachiv Gypsy code, families must pay a bride price for the girls - often of up to £5,000. But with many unable to afford so much, girls can change hands for as little as £3,000. Either way, in the UK, youthful marriage often brings unwanted attention from the police. One man to fall prey to the authorities' crackdown on gypsy marriage in the UK is Huko, an unemployed father of two who lives in Rotherham in Yorkshire. Too young: Under the Pachiv code, girls and boys are married off when they hit puberty - sometimes at 13 . Not happening: Esme's mother (left) and grandmother (right) want her to go to school rather than marry . Huko, who moved to the UK a year ago, is yet to find a steady job, or indeed, claim benefits as so far, the local council has turned down his application. 'There's no job, nothing,' he complains. 'What can we do? If I . steal, there’s food, if not there’s nothing. If we go stealing, the police . arrest us.' Incongruously, he adds: 'The wise never work.' With Huko and his family live his nephew, 23, his wife Maria, 14, and his 27-year-old niece Kivek, who was married off herself at 13 and, in consequence, has never been to school. 'I . don’t know how to read and to write,' she reveals. 'I’m 27 and without school, . without work, without anything. 'I got married when I was 13. Since . I was 13, I've had to look after myself. Begging around people for £1, £2... for one euro to buy food and stuff to live.' Not, however, that has put her off marrying young as is traditional under the traditional Gypsy Code, which is known as Pachiv. 'When . you're 11 or 12, when you're married you get responsibilities,' she continues. 'You have to make a responsibility, you're working. You have to make your . own life, make your own house, make your own child. You have to grow . them up. That's when you get married.' The police, however, take a dim view of this approach and have paid frequent visits to Huko's home in search of 14-year-old Maria. Different ideas: Romanian Roma gypsy Huko lives with his nephew, 23, and his 14-year-old pregnant wife . Not good: Despite lying to the police, the girl is eventually taken into care - as are his own two daughters . Maria, who is in an illegal gypsy marriage with Huko's nephew, came to the attention of social workers after being seen by a GP. Were social workers to discover the truth about Maria's marital status, that could cause problems for Kivek and Huko and as a result, they lie to the police whenever they visit. 'We . lied because we didn't want to tell the truth,' says Kivek. 'It's because . she's fourteen, she's pregnant. 'She has a husband here. She left her mum . in Spain. She lives here but we said to them she doesn’t live here. It's because If they find her they'll take her.' Take her, they eventually do - much to the horror of Huko and Maria's mother Nadia. 'He . had my daughter taken into care,' she fumes, blaming Huko for what happened. 'I will cut his nose off, I will take . his eyes out. I regret with all my . heart that I had to come here.' Nevertheless, she too is happy to see her daughter married to a much older man. 'I got married at 13 and had a baby at 15,' she explains. 'These are our rules.' Huko, Kivek, Maria and Esme appear on The Gypsy Matchmaker, tonight at 10pm on Channel 4 .","Under the traditional Pachiv code, girls and boys are married off at puberty .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A couple fear their seven-year-old boy has been scarred for life by a huge henna tattoo on his back - of Star Wars character Darth Maul. Liam Sayer was rewarded with the temporary image of his favourite Star Wars character for his good behaviour at the end of the family two-week holiday to Egypt. But a week after getting home - on his birthday - he woke in agony with his back covered in sores and blisters after a reaction to the black dye used to colour his skin. Scroll down for video . Liam woke in agony with his back covered in sores and blisters after a reaction to the black dye used to colour his skin . Sharon Sayer paid for her son Liam and daughter Lacy to have the tattoos as a way to mark their family holiday to Egypt . More than a month later he remains in constant pain as his entire back and lower body has broken out in skin rashes. And while the henna ink has faded the grimacing face of the evil Sith Jedi is clearly visible on his badly-damaged skin. Liam has been told to avoid the sunshine for the rest of summer and doctors have warned his worried mother Sharon he may be forced to stay inside for the next two years as his body battles the horrific condition. Tearful Liam said: 'My mum and dad said I could get the tattoo on the last day of our holiday if I was a good boy, and I was a good boy every day. 'Darth Maul from the Phantom Menace is my favourite Star Wars character. 'I was so happy. But then on my birthday I woke up and it was all sore. Liam woke up in agony on his birthday having suffered a severe allergic reaction to the henna ink . 'I hate it. It hurts so much. I wish I had not had it done. My summer has been spoilt and I was really looking forward to playing out with my friends.' Liam went on holiday with his mother Sharon, father Darren, both 45, and four-year-old sister Lacy for a two-week trip to the Titanic Beach Spa and Aquapark, in Hurghada, Egypt. On July 7, the last full day of their trip, Sharon paid for her, Liam and Lacy to all get temporary tattoos to mark the trip. Liam has been told he must stay inside and out of sunlight while his skin heals . But while . one artist inked a design on her leg and a small flower on Lacy's foot, a . second  used what was advertised as black henna to cover half of Liam's . back. While traditional henna- made from the plant Henna (Lawsonia inermis)- has been used for centuries to dye everything from cloth to hair, and is generally considered safe, many vendors reporting to use henna in fact use a variety of other chemicals to produce a much darker dye. True henna will produce a redish brown colour on the skin, which becomes darker the longer it is left on before washing. Other forms of skin dyes often are more black in colour. Sharon, of Basildon, Essex, said: 'Liam's tattoo was so much thicker than mine and Lacy's. 'We were fine, we didn't have any problems at all. 'But the guy that was doing Liam's was using a separate pot of ink and I reckon there must have been something in that. Doctors have warned Liam may be forced to stay inside for the next two years as his body battles the horrific condition . 'A week after, on the morning of his birthday, Liam came downstairs in tears, screaming ""Mummy, my back, my back."" 'I had a look at it and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 'It was a huge red weal where the henna had been, and his skin around it was all rashy, red and sore. 'I took him to the doctor, who said it was the worst skin reaction he had ever seen. 'It was an allergic reaction to some chemical in the ink. If I had known this would happen, of course I would never have let him go anywhere near it.' Sharon added: 'I'm so frustrated. It's been an absolute nightmare. 'I told the hotel what had happened, and the holiday company, but nobody has even emailed me back. 'I just want to warn other people to steer clear of henna tattoos. 'Liam is scarred for life now, and may be stuck inside for two years if he starts getting more of a reaction to sunlight. 'It's ruined all of our lives. I feel so sorry for him.' Since his diagnosis Liam has been proscribed two lots of antibiotics, two different steroid creams, and has been given a range of medicinal washes and lotions in a bid to try to calm his raging back, which is slowly showing signs of improvement.","Liam was allowed to get a henna tattoo as a reward for good behaviour .

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A bar owner has apologised after a bouncer refused entry to a woman because she had tattoos on her neck. Carol Paterson, 26, from Dundee, said she was 'mortified' at the 'disgusting' way she was treated by the bouncer at the city's West House. The make-up artist and tattoo model had attended Dundee's major tattoo convention at Abertay Union, before she was turned away from the bar on Saturday night. Scroll down for video . Carol Paterson, 26, said she was 'mortified' that she was turned away from a bar because of her tattoos . She claims she was urged to 'move on' by the bouncer when she tried to enter with friends. She said: 'I walked up to the door with my two friends and my colleagues and the guy just said, ""sorry, my manager's really against tattoos, so I can't let you in"". 'I couldn't believe it and told him that was ridiculous. I was totally shocked and mortified to be honest because that's never happened to me before. The way I was treated was disgusting. It's discrimination.' Ms Paterson said she was wearing a high-collared top which showed off little of her neck tattoo - but was forced to go elsewhere with her friends. She added: 'How many other people has he discriminated against? The security company needs to know about this person. 'It is a personal thing for me because my boyfriend is a tattoo artist. I am heavily tattooed but I don't look like a thug and I would hate for people to look at me like that.' The make-up artist said the way she was treated was 'disgusting' and was discrimination . Andrew McMahon, who owns the bar, has now issued a full apology to Ms Paterson. He said: 'As the owner of the West House I would like to apologise profusely. 'The doorman that refused you was from an outside agency. 'He has let myself and my business down massively and has created a horrendous impression, but most importantly he caused you great offence. 'We have no house rules in regard to tattoos. Many of my friends, family, customers, regulars, and even the majority of my staff have tattoos. 'So in no way do I have any issues with them.' Andrew McMahon, who owns Dundee's West House, has since issued an apology to Ms Paterson . Ky Thomasson-Kay, 40, who organised the Dundee Tattoo Convention, said that discrimination against people with tattoos still exists. 'It simply comes down to someone making a very bad judgment call and I'm quite surprised it happened. 'In the past tattoos have been associated with prisoners, members of the armed forces, biker gangs and people on the edge of society. 'But in the last decade it's become mainstream and that's down to the quality of the artwork. 'There shouldn't be a stigma attached to tattoos these days and if someone has preconceptions then they're the one with the problem.' A spokesman for SecuriGroup, who confirmed that it supplies door staff to West House, declined to comment.","Carol Paterson, 26, from Dundee, was refused entry to the West House bar .

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . She is the schoolgirl baking sensation who has to fit her cake-making around her homework. But it seems Great British Bake Off contestant Martha Collison is starting to feel the heat in the kitchen. The 17-year-old – who is the BBC1 show’s youngest ever competitor – was reduced to tears on last night’s episode after finding herself at the receiving end of Mary Berry’s withering criticism. Scroll down for video . It seems Great British Bake Off contestant Martha Collison is starting to feel the heat in the kitchen. The 17-year-old - who is the BBC1 show's youngest ever competitor - was reduced to tears on last night's episode after finding herself at the receiving end of Mary Berry's withering criticism . Miss Collison clearly struggled from the outset when she and the other remaining contestants were asked to bake some custard tarts . She did her best to produce a pistachio, apricot and honey version . The show is still recovering from last week’s ‘bingate’ scandal, when bearded competitor Iain Watters threw away his baked Alaska amid claims it had been ‘sabotaged’ by his rival Diana Beard. Mrs Beard subsequently accused producers of artificially heightening the tension of the episode to make her look like a villain. She and Mr Watters are no longer in the competition, after he was eliminated and she was forced to withdraw following a fall. But last night’s episode will do nothing to quell accusations that the BBC is seeking to make the gentle format more dramatic in a quest for higher ratings. Miss Collison clearly struggled from the outset when she and the other remaining contestants were asked to bake some custard tarts. She did her best to produce a pistachio, apricot and honey version. But judges Miss Berry and Paul Hollywood were scathing in their assessments, not least because she had committed the show’s cardinal sin and produced a ‘soggy bottom’ on her tart. Judges Miss Berry and Paul Hollywood were scathing in their assessments of Martha's tart . She was criticised because she had committed the show's cardinal sin and produced a 'soggy bottom' on her effort . Mrs Berry, 79, said: ‘The first thing when you look at it is it needs a shine. A lovely glaze of some sort. It looks as though that pastry is not quite done underneath. I think the consistency looking at it should be a little bit firmer.’ Mr Hollywood, 48, added: ‘There’s a lot of moisture there, isn’t there. A lot of wetness coming through from those apricots. I’m not convinced about the flavour. Miss Collison soon cheered up when she won the next challenge, which was to produce a set of 'mini pear pies' Despite admitting she had 'absolutely not a clue' what she was doing, she easily beat her much older competitors. This time she grinned for the cameras and said: 'I feel amazing coming first' 'It’s quite tart, apricot, for me, in the custard.’ Miss . Collison, who was sitting her AS-Levels at her school in Berkshire when . the episode was filmed in the spring, began to well up as the judges . moved on to the next contestant and praised his ‘perfect’ pastry. And she was unable to stop herself from crying throughout the post-challenge interview, when she said: ‘I guess it’s just hard when you spend two and a half hours making something. For them to kind of hate it is quite hard. And it hasn’t happened to me yet.’ Miss Collison soon cheered up when she won the next challenge, which was to produce a set of ‘mini pear pies’.

This morning was weepy Martha who made a rubbish custard tart, and now I’ve completely forgotten about that and it’s just amazing.’ Thanks to her strong improvement throughout the episode, Miss Collison escaped elimination. Instead, Scotsman Norman Caler, 67, was sent home after Miss Berry criticised his ‘crumbly’ haggis pie. Last year, Bake Off contestant Ruby Tandoh was accused of bursting into tears whenever she wanted the judges’ sympathy. After a string of tearful performances she was knocked out in the final, and later accused her critics of ‘lazy mysogyny’.","Martha Collison, at 17,  is the BBC1 show’s youngest ever competitor .

"By . Jason Groves . David Cameron confirmed today he has had dinner with 'significant' Conservative Party donors at his flat in Downing Street on three occasions since becoming Prime Minister, as well as at a post-election dinner in No 10 in 2010. The Prime Minister said he will publish details of the meetings later today, and will order the party to publish details of all meals with donors on a quarterly basis. But he insisted that most of the guests at the dinners were long-standing acquaintances and former Tory co-treasurer Peter Cruddas had never recommended that a donor should be invited. Mr Cruddas was forced to resign his post on Saturday after the Sunday Times published secret recordings in which he told undercover reporters that they could secure meetings with senior ministers by giving the party money. Scroll down to hear David Cameron's reaction . Close relationship: Tory treasurer Peter Cruddas, left, boasted that he could give donors private access to David Cameron, right . Mr Cameron said he had broadened the . Tories’ funding base since becoming leader, but there was still an . 'urgent need' for wider reform in British politics. 'I am ready to impose a cap on individual political donations of £50,000 without any further need for state funding. 'But to be fair this must apply equally to trade unions as well as private individuals or businesses.' Government sources were forced to . admit the existence of the intimate dinners after Mr Cruddas was . secretly filmed boasting that he could provide direct access to the . Prime Minister for ‘Premier League’ donors. But a source said it was ‘simply untrue’ to suggest donors were able to buy access or influence, adding: ‘This was never in exchange for anything. 'The PM is entitled to meet with people even if they happen to have given money to the party.’ But the revelation threatened to bring the ‘cash for access’ scandal to the very heart of Downing Street. Mr Cruddas, a multi-millionaire who was forced to quit as soon as the revelations became public, suggested major donors who agreed to give £250,000 a year would have their concerns and ideas ‘fed in’ directly to the Downing Street policy unit. He told undercover reporters posing as wealthy foreign businessmen that they could expect to attend dinners with Mr Cameron, Chancellor George Osborne and senior ministers if they donated enough cash. 'Business deals': Mr Cruddas was secretly filmed telling undercover reporters he could arrange private meetings with senior Conservatives . He went on: ‘Some of our bigger donors have been for dinner in No 10 Downing Street, in the Prime Minister’s private apartment, with Samantha.’ Tory donors invited for dinner are believed to have included billionaire City businessman Michael Spencer, himself a former party treasurer. Government sources last night said no donation had been offered or accepted, and claimed that Mr Cruddas was acting as a rogue operator whose boasts broke party rules. But the revelation that the Prime Minister has hosted private dinners for  donors could leave him open to accusations that he has breached his own ministerial code, which requires ministers to avoid any activity that could be perceived as improper. In another ominous twist, the Metropolitan Police were last night asked to investigate suggestions that Mr Cruddas or others may have accepted donations from wealthy foreigners – which is illegal under British electoral law. Mr Cameron described Mr Cruddas’s comments as ‘completely unacceptable’, adding: ‘This is not the way that we raise money in the Conservative Party, it shouldn’t have happened.’ The Prime Minister said he was ordering an internal inquiry into the affair. Sources initially suggested it would be led by the party’s co-chairman Lord Feldman, who recruited Mr Cruddas and was effectively his line manager. But the idea was dropped after critics questioned whether Lord Feldman, Mr Cameron’s former tennis partner and closest friend in politics, was sufficiently independent. Appalled: Sir Christopher Kelly, Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the revelations were 'not an isolated incident' while Labour leader Ed Miliband called the news 'disturbing' Labour called for an independent inquiry and will today press Mr Cameron to make a full Commons statement on the affair. Ed . Miliband said: ‘These are very disturbing revelations. The Conservative . Party has been seeking cash in exchange for access to the Prime . Minister and Chancellor and indeed influence over policy making. ‘It’s . no way to run a Government or a political party and these allegations . can’t be swept under the carpet. There needs to be a proper independent . investigation into whether influence was sought, what influence was . gained and what impact it had.’ Sir Christopher Kelly, chairman of the . Committee on Standards in Public Life, last night warned that the . revelations were ‘not an isolated incident’. He added: ‘As long as we have a system in which the main political parties are reliant on very large donations from very rich individuals – or organisations, in the case of the Labour Party – then events of this kind are almost bound to happen. ‘It is a cancer which needs to be addressed.’ Downing Street last night said it was fast-tracking cross-party talks on reform of party funding. A source said: ‘Clearly the current set-up is not ideal.’ The revelations are deeply embarrassing for Mr Cameron, who pledged two years ago to crack down on the shadowy world of lobbying. The existence of secret dinners with donors also undermines the Coalition’s much-vaunted transparency drive, which allows the public to see who ministers have met in their official capacity.

"By . Eleanor Hardning . They were once confined to the burly arms of sailors and criminals. But now it seems tattoos have an altogether more middle-class fan base, according to new research. More than a quarter of this social class have ventured into the world of body art, with 28 per cent admitting to having at least one tattoo. Sophie Walker is an attractive, intelligent women with a tattoo on her left upper thigh (File photo) Author Omogen Edwards-Jones has two tattoos on her right foot (and one on her bikini line) - the feet and ankles tend to be the favoured place for women to have tattoos although Miss Edwards-Jones bitterly regrets having hers . The study showed professionals are now marginally more likely to be tattooed than their working class counter parts – of which only 27 per cent have undergone the needle. It is a trend that has even become well established in the ‘AB’ upper class, with 19 per cent adorned with body art. Aman Malhotra, research assistant at Harris Interactive, which conducted the study, said that the tattoo was no longer the preserve of the working classes. Rose Gregory Smith is a typical middle-class woman - she works in finance in the City and has a small tattoo above her ankle (File photo) Many women plump for a discreet tattoo that cannot be seen when they are dressed (File photos) He said: ‘The tattoo appears to have transcended traditional class boundaries.’ The study, which looked at more than 2,000 people across the country and from different demographics, found that 6 per cent of the middle classes had between three and five pieces of body art and 17 per cent had between six and ten. Only 1 per cent had more than ten. But according to tattoo parlours, these new customers are adopting a wholly more conservative slant on the ancient craft. Middle-class women are most likely to opt for something small, discreet and feminine, while middle class men are choosing designs which are easy to hide under work clothes. Angelina Jolie has a number of tattoos on her body, some more discreet than others . Mo Coppoletta, 43, the founder of The Family Business tattoo parlour in Clerkenwell, north London, said that their approach to body art was still ‘conservative’. He told The Sunday Times: ‘Middle class women will go for something very decorative, with lots of embellishment and adornment, while men go for letters and scripts. ‘Women are always looking for something softer and feminine. They chose more intimate places for their tattoos — it is more for themselves than to show off. ‘They tend to be on the ankle, the foot, the lower back or the shoulder blade. Never prominent. Celebrities: Mutya Buena, once of the Sugababes (left) has several tattoos but not as many as Jodie Marsh (right, before she was almost totally adorned in them) who has many all over her body . ‘Middle-class men tend to go for letters and scripts. Koi fish tattoos are popular. Men tend to get tattoos on their backs, legs and under-arms. They don't tend to go really big.’ He said that after working in the tattoo industry for 18 years, he has seen a marked change in his customers in the last decade. ‘Tattoos are more accepted and more of a fashion accessory these days, so it has become more normal and therefore more attractive to all sorts of classes,’ he said. ‘Coming through the door now is mainly professionals, aged between late 20s and 40s. They are the main core of our establishment.’ The transition among the classes has been felt throughout the industry, with many parlours adopting classier looking décor to attract moneyed customers. Fortunately most women don't go as far as having a tattoo  'sleeve' covering their whole arm . Roland Hyams, publicist for the international London Tattoo Convention, has seen a dramatic growth in popularity since the event began in 2005. He said: ‘It's definitely sporting the middle classes, without a doubt. I think it is particularly because of celebrities and because tattoos have become more mainstream.’ When the convention first began, it had 3,500 visitors, now it has more than 20,000. Dr Gemma Angel, a tattoo historian and professor at University College London, added: ‘The visibility of tattoos does make it more acceptable as time goes on. Once something becomes ubiquitous and I think tattoos are now, they are not such a taboo.’","28% of middle-class admit to at least one tattoo but 27% of working class .

"By . Sam Webb . With their stunning white sands and crystal clear turqoise waters you could be forgiven for thinking these beaches are on an idyllic tropical paradise. But amazingly each of these incredible seaside landscapes is in Britain - and they're among the country's best kept secrets. The hidden locations of 400 hard-to-find and hard-to-reach beaches have been revealed in a new book by travel writer Daniel Start. He has spent 10 years researching stretches of unspoilt sand along Britain's rugged coastline, which at 20,000 miles including its islands is among the longest in the world. Azure beauty: A new book chronicles the hard-to-reach and awe-inspiring remote beaches throughout the UK. Pictured is Broad Sands on the Exmoor coast. The UK, amazingly: A swimmer at a cove near Knockvologan on the Isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland . Stunning: A beach at Crackington Haven, a coastal village in Cornwall, located at the head of a cove on the Atlantic coast . His book, called Hidden Beaches, lifts the lid on beautiful bays and tranquil hideaways from every corner of the country. Some of the beaches are just off the tourist trail while others, such as Sandy Bay near Tenby, Wales, can only be accessed by water. Losgainter, on the Isle of Harris in the Outer Hebrides, is so idyllic that Thai tourism officials once mistakenly used a picture of the beach in one of their holiday brochures. Keynance Cove on the Lizard, Cornwall, can only be accessed at low tide but those who make the effort are rewarded with a scene on a par with the Caribbean. The turquoise water gets its colouring from green minerals from the rugged rocks that surround the sandy cove. Abereiddi Blue Lagoon in Pembrokeshire, formerly a small slate quarry, now flooded by the sea having broken in . Sandy Bay in Pembrokeshire. Sandy Haven is a secluded bay, near to the oil refineries of Milford Haven, which can be reached along a single track lane from the village of Herbrandston . Fooled you: With their stunning white sands and crystal clear turqoise waters you could be forgiven for thinking these beaches are on an idyllic tropical paradise . The 'wonderful white cove' of Moor Sands at East Prawle in south Devon requires a two mile walk from the nearest car park. A disused quarry at Abereiddi on the north Pembrokeshire coast is now a little known but incredibly picturesque blue lagoon perfect for swimming in. Those who wish to reach the 'Robinson Crusoe' deserted beach of Sandy Cove near Tenby must endure a 200 yard swim as it is totally inaccessible by land, with no route down the cliffs. A tip-off from a friendly local led Daniel, 41, to a little-known plunge pool in the foot of the cliffs Llangannith on the Gower peninsula. Further north is one of the most stunning beaches to feature in the book - Traigh Gheal on the Isle of Mull. The rocky cove's white sandy beach and turquoise sea would not look out of place on the front of a holiday brochure for the Maldives. Mr Start quit his job at a London council to pursue his dream of writing a guide to Britain's best but least known beaches. The writer has spent 10 years researching stretches of unspoilt sand along Britain's rugged coastline, which at 20,000 miles including its islands is among the longest in the world . Scenic: Losgaintir Sands on the island of Harris, Outer Hebrides. It has widely-regarded as one of the UK's most spectacular beaches . Kynance Cove, Lizard, Cornwall. The cove became popular in the early Victorian era, with many distinguished visitors including the poet Alfred Tennyson . He has visited all of the beaches featured in the book, either alone, with friends, or with his wife Tanya and three-year-old daughter Rose. Mr Start, who lives near Bath, Somerset, said: 'I was sat in my office in London on a hot summer's day a few years ago feeling very frustrated and longing for the sea. 'I had been toying with the idea of writing a guide book to Britain's best out-of-the-way beaches for a few years. 'I found there wasn't anything on the market so I decided to do it myself. I took the summer off work with a view to possibly going back to my job but I never did. 'It took me a year to put the book together but really it is the culmination of 10 years of research - it's a lifetime's passion. 'To find the beaches I have studied maps and satellite images of the coastline to find stretches of sand that aren't so well known, then visited them myself. 'Also, you can't beat a tip-off from a local, especially if they are a surfer, because they often know the best spots.' Seclusion: A cove near Porth Iago, located on the Llyn Peninsula West Wales. The writer has visited all of the beaches . Blue Pool at Blue Pool Bay, North Gower, located at the southwestern tip of the Gower Peninsula in Swansea . Mr Start quit his job at a London council to pursue his dream of writing a guide to Britain's best but least known beaches. Pictured, Port Gaverne in North Cornwall. Fancy a dip? Swimmers descend to the enticing waters at Port Gaverne in North Cornwall . Idyllic: Beaumont Quay in the parish of Beaumont-cum-Moze, Tendring, Essex . Chapman's Pool in Dorset. The writer says the only drawback to the beaches is the water can be a little chilly . He added: 'Until I started researching this book I hadn't really realised just how beautiful Britain is. Now I think it is home to the most beautiful beaches in the world. 'The book features everything from beaches that are slightly off the beaten track to some which you can only access by swimming to. 'There is something magical about swimming onto a deserted beach and sitting on the sand feeling like Robinson Crusoe. 'Previously I had thought about moving abroad and finding my own little piece of paradise but putting this book together has made me realise paradise is here at home. 'The only problem is that the water can be a little chilly!' Epic landscape: Elender Cove in South Devon (left) and Kingsgate Bay in Kent (right). Mr Start has previously written a book about wild swimming . Three Cliffs Bay is a bay on the south coast of the Gower Peninsula in Swansea, Wales. The bay takes its name from the three sea cliffs that jut out into the bay . As well as a guide to the 400 secluded beaches, the book also recommends the best beaches for skinny-dipping, the best for sunset views and the best for 'jumps'. Hidden Beaches is published by Wild Things Publishing and costs £16.99. The book is the follow-up to Wild Swimming, his expert guide to lakes and rivers to swim in around the country.","Incredible images show the beauty of the UK's hard-to-reach and secluded coastlines .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A cat-crazy couple wanted to ensure that their new kitten felt welcome when they brought him home. So Mike and Megan, from Michigan, built an assault course-style installation including ropes and a bridge for their new pet, who ended up playing on it constantly. Little did they realise that this would lead them to open their very own online cat furniture shop, aptly called CatostophiCreations. And their two cats Ickle and Heisenberg quality control all their creations. Scroll down for video . Mike and Megan opened cat furniture online shop CatostophiCreations, which sells cat hammocks . When preparing for their first kitten's arrival, the couple wanted to build a 'cat wall' or place where he could feel safe and hang out. 'We were trying to design a cat wall for him to climb and couldn't figure out how to bridge the gap where our hallway was. Then it hit me! We needed a bridge.' Mike explains that when they could not seem to find one anywhere they decided to build one for themselves. 'Since we were bringing home a kitten, we decided that it was safest to add ropes along the length of it and thus we created the Indiana Jones Cat Bridge. 'Little did we know that Ickle would completely fall in love with his bridge and would be sleeping on it almost every night.' Mike and his partner started to think about whether other cats would also enjoy using a bridge. They added ropes along the length of a wall installation, thus creating the Indiana Jones Cat Bridge . When they could not seem to find one anywhere they decided to build one for themselves . His mother, who has her own shop on Etsy, suggested that they should start up a shop on their own. 'We started adding shelves to match our collection and it just grew from there. Before we built our bridge, we bought several cat trees for our cats to climb on. 'To us they all looked very similar. People's living rooms don't all look the same, so it seemed silly for them to have cat furniture that all looks the same.' When they first started the couple built everything in their apartment, and did all of the woodwork and sanding by hand. 'We have now teamed up with Matt Kindall, a carpenter with over 20 years of wood working experience. Matt helped us make changes to all our items to ensure we were creating quality, safe cat furniture.' Mike explains that they really want their furniture to stand out and be different, along with being better looking and more functional than other cat furniture.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . Success: Fay Hand today secured a five-figure payout for unfair dismissal after winning her employment tribunal case against EE . An employment tribunal has lifted the lid on a 'prank' culture in an EE call centre that resulted in a man being kicked unconscious at his desk. Workers at the mobile giant's site in Darlington engaged in 'occasional incidents of banter' to lighten up the 'somewhat mundane and repetitive' work, the hearing in Teesside heard. These included 'crop dusting' - breaking wind near a colleague - as well as switching the language on others' computers, swapping screens to cause confusion and taping up a computer mouse. But last September, things turned more serious when an employee who had his car keys stolen and his ID card defaced flipped and kicked his colleague at his desk, knocking him unconscious. Operations manager Fay Hand, 37, who had worked for the firm for almost 17 years, was sacked alongside seven others following the incident. But today, Mrs Hand secured a five-figure payout for unfair dismissal after winning her employment tribunal case against EE. Judge Gerald Johnson found the mother of two, who was in charge of 11 team leaders and 111 agents, had an unblemished record and was 'clearly a highly-regarded and valued employee'. The tribunal heard the disgruntled employee had spoken to Mrs Hand after his cars keys were stolen and a new Fifa computer game inside his vehicle was taken and held for ransom. Mrs Hand then told the team leader the worker was not happy and asked her to 'sort it out'. The employee later admitted he had had a 'sense of humour failure' and the issue was believed to be resolved, Teesside Magistrates' Court heard. But the following month, when his . security pass was defaced with a permanent marker by a colleague, he . kicked the man at his desk until he fell unconscious. Tribunal: The work at the mobile giant's site in Darlington could be 'somewhat mundane and repetitive', so employees engaged in 'occasional incidents of banter', the hearing at Teesside Magistrates' Court heard . The attacker was immediately suspended and the next day he came to work with a three-page statement, claiming the security pass incident was the 'last straw' and his team leader and Mrs Hand had not taken his complaints seriously. Following the incident, EE sacked seven employees, including the victim, the kicker, the team leader and Mrs Hand. Mobile giant: An EE spokesman said the firm took its responsibilities towards its staff 'very seriously' The firm said Mrs Hand failed to protect the employee and breached its policy on harassment and bullying. But Judge Johnson found that the investigation into Mrs Hand’s actions had been 'wholly inadequate', and that her dismissal was pre-judged. Speaking after the case, Mrs Hand, from Wynyard, Teesside, said the employment tribunal had been 'worth going through'. She said: 'It was painful but I had to stand up for myself. It was worth going through all of that, I can hold my head up high again with a clear record. That is what I wanted. 'I did love my job, I did it well and there had not been any issues.' Mrs Hand no longer has a call centre job and works in an office managing fewer people. Today, her solicitor John Mitton, of PG Legal in Gateshead, said: 'From the outset of meeting with our client, it was evident that there were a number of failures adopted by EE with their procedures. This should be a time for reflection on EE’s part.' An EE spokesman said: 'We are one of the largest employers in Darlington. 'We take our responsibilities towards our staff very seriously and have robust policies in place that ensure a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and harassment in the workplace. 'We accept the tribunal’s ruling.'","Fay Hand, 37, was sacked after man was kicked unconscious at his desk .

Heavy rain was this morning delaying efforts to rescue more than 50 people still missing after landslides the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Hillsides caved in or were swept down into neighbourhoods in at least five valleys in the suburbs of the western Japanese city on Wednesday, crushing dozens of houses after heavy rains. Officials said 39 people were confirmed dead and 51 others were missing, feared dead, as of yesterday. Twenty-three people were injured, 13 seriously, they said. Scroll down for video . Desperate search: Rescue workers from Japan's Ground Self-Defence Force hack their way through the mud at the disaster zone in Hiroshima, where the number of those listed as unaccounted for increased to 51 and the death toll was revised to 39 after landslides swept through the area three days ago . Apocalyptic: Hillsides caved in or were swept down into neighbourhoods in at least five valleys in the suburbs of the western Japanese city on Wednesday . Hunting for survivors: But there are fears that continuing heavy rain could trigger more landslides in the neighbourhoods which sit at the bottom of steep valleys . Danger: Police officers move to higher ground after an announcement to evacuate due to fears of another landslide . Rescue workers today feared the continuing rain could set off further landslides in the area. About 2,500 police and military personnel have been searching for the missing in the mud-covered areas. At one point work had to be abandoned and the area evacuated when it looked like another landslide might tear through the area. Among those killed were two brothers, aged 11 and 2, and a firefighter who was engulfed by mud as he was carrying a toddler to safety. The child also perished. 'There was a really strange smell, a very raw, earthy smell. When we opened a window to see what was going on, the entire hillside just came down, with a crackling noise, a thundering noise,' one woman told Fuji television. She and her husband fled just before their house filled with mud, leaving five-metre boulders where they had been sleeping. A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with official policy, said there was a possibility of some inaccuracies in the tally of those killed and injured in the disaster. Hurrying to safety: About 2,500 police and military personnel have been searching for the missing in the mud-covered neighbourhoods . Grim-faced: Rescue workers search for survivors with sniffer dogs, picking through an area which no longer looks reognisable as a city suburb . Still standing: Police officers stand next to a damaged house at a site where a landslide swept through a residential area at Asaminami ward in Hiroshima . Mess: Rescue workers heave mounds of matted, twisted vegetation brought crashing into the neighbourhood by Wednesday's landslide . A month's worth of rain fell in one night on Wednesday, loosening slopes already saturated by heavy rain over the past few weeks. Hiroshima city officials have faced criticism because their initial evacuation advisory came an hour after the first mudslide. Officials said their response was delayed because the land collapsed so quickly at multiple locations. Opposition politicians have also rounded on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for his handling of the disaster. He played several rounds of golf on the day the news broke, before coming back to Tokyo, the capital. He then returned to his vacation villa afterwards.

Grief: An elderly woman rests her head on her hand as she sits in a folding chair inside the evacuation centre where she and others have been put up . Landslides are a constant risk in mountainous, crowded Japan, where many homes are built on or near steep slopes. Hiroshima's geology, consisting of highly water-retentive soil, makes the city particularly prone to such disasters, experts say. About 9in of rain fell in the area about 2 miles from the centre of the city in the 24 hours up to Wednesday morning, the Meterological Agency said. Roughly half of that rain fell in one hour.","Rescue workers forced to evacuate the area after warnings of another landslide .

"By . Sam Marsden . Detectives have launched an investigation into alleged child abuse at a school set up by a friend of the late paedophile MP Cyril Smith. Former pupils at Underley Hall, a boarding school opened by John Turner in Cumbria in 1976, claim that boys were physically assaulted by staff and sexually abused by a fellow pupil. Mr Turner, a former headmaster at the notorious Knowl View School in Rochdale where Smith targeted vulnerable young boys, is accused of beating a pupil who complained about being indecently touched by the politician. Paedophile MP Cyril Smith was a friend of John Turner who set up Underley Hall, a boarding school in Cumbria, in 1976 . On at least one occasion Smith visited Underley Hall – a private boarding school for 'troubled' boys – as Mr Turner's guest, according to a former pupil. There is even a suggestion that the disgraced MP had opened the school. Outdoor pursuits teacher John Wadlow was charged in 1997 with sexual offences against children at Underley Hall but killed himself while awaiting trial. But former pupils have told the Daily Mail they made much broader complaints of abuse to police at the time – including violent beatings by staff – only to find them brushed under the carpet. One former pupil, now in his 50s, said the Liberal MP sexually assaulted him in the Knowl View staffroom in 1971. But when word got back to Mr Turner, he allegedly thrashed the boy and accused him of dragging the politician's name through the mud. The Lib Dem politician, who died aged 82 in 2010, is alleged to have used his status to sexually abuse scores of young boys with impunity at Knowl View School in Rochdale . The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'John Turner was very good friends with Cyril Smith. 'When I told them about Cyril Smith [abusing me], I was spanked by John Turner. He said I was trying to ruin a man's career. He punished me for it.' Joseph Ryan, 44, from Manchester, who claims he was repeatedly sexually assaulted by an older boy and beaten when he was at Underley Hall in the early 1980s, said: 'We want justice. We want a proper inquiry. We want answers to the questions that should have been answered years ago.' Mr Turner left Underley Hall in 1985. He retired to Scotland, where he died in 1996 aged 64. The school was closed in 2012 after a damning Ofsted report.","Underley Hall was opened by John Turner in Cumbria in 1976 .

"By . Andrew Levy . Child porn: Geoffrey Bettley was allowed to keep working as a teacher even after he was convicted of possessing indecent images of children . A crackdown by Michael Gove on paedophile teachers was unravelling last night after it emerged that 11 already cleared to return to classrooms will not have their cases reviewed. They include individuals who have downloaded child porn, one who kissed a pupil and another who allowed a teenager to drink alcohol. Mr Gove announced that stricter guidance was to be issued to the teachers’ professional conduct panel in an attempt to defuse a growing scandal. The Education Secretary acted after it emerged that the panel allowed religious education teacher Geoffrey Bettley, 36, to continue working despite a caution for downloading sick child porn images. A senior DfE civil servant then approved the ruling. The guidance suggested that no teachers with child pornography offences would be able to work in a classroom again. But officials have admitted they are powerless to take action against anyone who has been through the process. It means the perverts are free to continue teaching, potentially bringing each one into contact with thousands of children. A DfE insider said: ‘We can’t retrospectively change the guidance. The laws of natural justice and double jeopardy apply here, so old cases cannot be resubmitted to the panel. 'However, schools must carry out criminal records checks before they can hire someone, so if a teacher applied for a new job their record will come up.’ The source admitted that head teachers had the discretion to employ such individuals but insisted: ‘In practice it’s just not going to happen because no head is going to hire someone who has been convicted of possessing images of child abuse.’ DfE staff are checking records in an attempt to establish exactly how many perverts have slipped through the net. Mr Gove said: ‘The panel which makes these decisions was operating on guidance that wasn’t fit for purpose. ‘We’ve . made it clear that if you are cautioned for viewing these sorts of . horrific and indecent images, that should be taken into account. The . panel should ensure that we do not have people who have been guilty of . these sorts of crimes anywhere near children.’ Egg on face: Education Secretary Michael Gove had promised stricter guidance to ensure that no teachers convicted of possessing child pornography would be able to work in a classroom again . The . DfE confirmed that Bettley is not working with children at present. The . married father-of-four was working at St Mary’s Catholic High School in . Menston, West Yorkshire, when he was arrested for downloading nearly . 200 images. He was cautioned and placed on a . ‘barred list’ by the Independent Safeguarding Authority, although his . name was taken off last June. From Thursday's Mail . His case was heard by the National College for Teaching and Leadership professional conduct panel, which concluded that he was not a risk to children and the DfE backed the decision. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said he had ‘zero’ confidence in the Government’s ability to tackle child-related offences. ‘Everyone is aghast at the failure to grasp the common sense that everything must be done to ensure that these people can never go near classrooms again,’ he said. ‘They haven’t pinched a pen, they have accessed pictures of children being abused. ‘After Soham and all these inquiries we’ve had, surely they need to take this a little more seriously?’ Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were killed by their school caretaker Ian Huntley in Soham, Cambridgeshire, in 2002. He had previously been accused of offences including rape, indecent assault and burglary. An inquiry that followed made recommendations to improve safety for schoolchildren. By CHRIS BROOKE . Banned from teaching: Andrew Channing at his . home in Wootton Bassett, where he refused to comment on his alleged relationship . with an underage pupil . A teacher has escaped prosecution despite being banned from his profession after it was found he had a prolonged sexual relationship with an underage pupil. Andrew Channing, then aged 26, was accused of taking the  14-year-old’s virginity on Valentine’s Day, 2002. The married man allegedly had a secret relationship with her for three years. Channing even cut the teenager during kinky sex sessions, a  tribunal heard. The girl – known as Pupil A –  suffered a breakdown after their relationship ended and reported Channing to police about six years later. Officers arrested him and sent a file to the Crown Prosecution Service, but lawyers refused to charge him. However, a Department for Education disciplinary panel heard detailed evidence from both sides before ruling Pupil A had told the truth. At a hearing, the science teacher denied there was any affair when she was at Greendown School in Swindon, but admitted having sex once at his house when the girl was 17 and no longer a pupil. Pupil A said that in December 2001, they met outside school. Channing wore sunglasses and a hat to disguise himself and drove her to his house, with the girl lying down on the back seat of the car so no one could see her. Channing kissed her and she was said to be ‘terrified because she had never kissed anyone before’. They then lay naked in bed together but didn’t have sex, she said. The panel decided the case ‘proven’ on the ‘balance of  probabilities’ – a lesser standard than in the criminal courts – and that Channing’s explanation of events was ‘implausible.’ A prohibition order banning the 37-year-old from teaching  indefinitely was ratified by the Secretary of State last month. Channing refused to comment at the family home in Royal Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire. A Wiltshire Police spokesman said the CPS ruled the case did ‘not meet the criteria or right level for a prosecution’.","Teachers already cleared to return to work will not have cases reviewed .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . A toddler who suffered six cardiac arrests before his first birthday has made a miraculous recovery thanks to a pioneering operation. One-year-old Joshua Newman was born three months prematurely with a severe heart condition that left him fighting for his life. After suffering six cardiac arrests - four of them at just two hours old – doctors performed an operation that had never before been carried out on a baby so small. After 22 weeks in hospital Joshua has recovered and is now at home with his family in Chelmsford, Essex. Joshua Newman, one, of Chelmsford, Essex has recovered after suffering six cardiac arrests before his first birthday due to congenital heart disease . Doctors at the Royal Brompton hospital in London were unable to give Joshua's parents survival odds as the surgery he needed to widen his artery had not been performed there before on babies so young . It took Suzy Newman, 37, and her husband Alan eight years to conceive Joshua with IVF treatment. At the 20-week scan she was told her baby had a heart condition and would need surgery as soon as he was born. But, she said that did not prepare her for what happened when her son was born. She said: ‘When Joshua was born it felt like a nightmare - it was so surreal. ‘A doctor explained to us that he’d suffered four cardiac arrests, and they didn’t know how long they could keep resuscitating him. ‘We couldn’t believe it - four cardiac arrests - it was horrifying. ‘After I gave birth my husband and I just had to sit for two hours and wait to find out if our baby was alive. ’But I just remember thinking that this wasn’t going to be how our story ended.’ Joshua was diagnosed with congenital heart disease in the womb. He was born with two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery in the body. Mrs Newman said: 'When Joshua was born if felt like a nightmare - it was so surreal. My husband and I just had to sit for two hours and wait to find out if our baby was alive' Suzy and Alan Newman cried and hugged each other in the street when they found out son Joshua had survived an emergency operation to widen his artery. He is pictured right with one of his surgeons . The narrow artery meant Joshua’s tiny heart was under too much pressure to pump blood around the body, causing him to go into cardiac arrest. After being born at the family’s local hospital, Joshua was transferred to Royal Brompton, a specialist heart and lung hospital in London. It was decided he needed an operation to widen his artery, but this type of surgery was not normally carried out on babies so small. After initial scans, doctors there said the problem didn’t appear to be too severe, so they sent him back to the local hospital to grow bigger. But Joshua began to go downhill, having yet another cardiac arrest, and sent straight back to Royal Brompton. His small size was still an issue, and so once again it was decided to wait until he grew bigger before he would have the operation, but he was struggling to gain weight. As Joshua’s condition became worse, doctors were forced to operate. Mrs Newman said she was petrified, as doctors were not able to say whether Joshua was likely to survive. She said: ‘The anaesthetist at the time said they couldn’t give us any survival odds as they didn’t have any for the type of operation on a baby so small. ‘We were told the words that no parent ever wants to hear - they might not be able to bring our precious baby back. Mrs Newman said: 'That day Joshua broke Royal Brompton history and opened up new pathways for pioneering surgery to be performed on tiny babies in the future’ The Newman family are raising money for a £4.5 million state-of-the-art operating theatre for the Royal Brompton hospital in London, where Joshua received the surgery that saved his life . ‘Waiting for the phone call to tell us whether he had survived the operation was truly one of the worst times of our lives.' She describes the feeling of joy when she found out Joshua had survived. She said: ‘But we were delighted when we were told that Joshua had pulled through - we were crying and hugging each other in the middle of the street. ‘That day Joshua broke Royal Brompton history and opened up new pathways for pioneering surgery to be performed on tiny babies in the future.’ Unfortunately, scans after the operation showed that Joshua’s problem had returned and he would need further surgery. Twelve weeks later, Joshua had finally grown bigger, and the second surgery was performed - and this time it was successful. Donor tissue was placed into Joshua’s heart to make a bigger pathway allowing the blood to flow to the rest of his body without being obstructed. They tiny holes in his heart were also fixed. Once again, waiting for her son to come out of surgery was terrifying for Mrs Newman and her husband. She said: ‘Eight very, very long hours later they brought our little hero back from surgery and yet again he had been amazing. ‘He was very poorly afterwards - and suffered yet another cardiac arrest a few days later - we couldn’t believe he’d had yet another one! ‘But once again he took it all in his stride.’ After 19 weeks in intensive care Joshua finally began to improve and doctors began to allow him to breathe for himself. Joshua was born with two holes in his heart and a narrowing of the aorta, the main artery in the body . Mrs Newman said she was ‘over the moon’, when she was finally able to take Joshua home 22 weeks after he was born. She added: ‘Walking through the door of our home, with no machines, nurses, or doctors, was the scariest thing ever. ‘But a year on, he’s doing amazingly well - he’s strong willed and determined, as he has always been! She is now raising money for the hospital’s charity to open a new state-of-the-art operating theatre. She thanks the hospital for their help at a truly difficult time. She said: ‘The Royal Brompton has been fantastic and we can’t thank the staff enough - not only did they look after Joshua but they looked after us too. ‘We met so many amazing people there, it is a truly inspirational place. ‘The charity needs £4.5 million in total, but we’re determined to do our bit - they saved our son’s life, and we couldn’t be happier.’ For more information on raising money for the Royal Brompton’s new hybrid operating theatre visit www.rbhcharity.org. Unless someone starts cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) the person may suffer permanent damage to the brain and other organs . A cardiac arrest happens when your heart stops pumping blood around the body. If you have a cardiac arrest, you lose consciousness almost at once. There are also no other signs of life such as breathing or movement. This is an emergency and if you witness a cardiac arrest you should call 999 immediately. What is the difference between a heart attack and cardiac arrest? A cardiac arrest is different from a heart attack. Most heart attacks are caused by coronary heart disease. If you have a heart attack, it does not always lead to a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest does not always happen because you have a heart condition. If you witness a cardiac arrest, you can increase the person’s chances of survival by phoning 999 and giving immediate CPR. Treating a cardiac arrest . Unless someone starts cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) the person may suffer permanent damage to the brain and other organs. Ambulance staff are trained in advanced resuscitation and all emergency ambulances carry a defibrillator. What causes a cardiac arrest? The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead.

A Chinese mother has given birth to a baby weighing a huge 13lbs 10oz - more than six bags of sugar . It is not currently known whether the baby was born naturally or by C-section. Medics at the Shanghai hospital where the child was delivered believe the baby’s size was caused by the mother eating a lot and spending much of her pregnancy in bed, Sky News reports. The doctors explained that she put on weight quickly during the pregnancy meaning the baby grew more rapidly than normal. The new mother told Chinese state TV: ‘I drink one glass of milk [and] eat an egg every day. That's a must since I became pregnant. I also ate a lot of fruit.’ A relative of the woman added: ‘Soup with chicken, pigeon and fish is normal for an expectant mother, as well as seafood including shrimp and fish.’ Xu Chang'en, of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University, believes the baby could face health problems as it grows up.

According to Guinness World Records, the biggest baby ever born worldwide was a boy born in Ohio in 1879. The baby tipped the scales at 23lbs 12oz but died 11 hours after birth. His parents both had gigantism - his mother, Anna Bates, was 7ft 5ins tall and his father, Martin Van Buren Bates was 7ft 11ins tall.","The woman, 27, gave birth in a hospital in Shanghai - it is not known if the baby was born naturally or whether it had to be delivered by C-section .
The child weighs almost twice as much as an average Chinese newborn .
Both the unnamed mother and the baby are believed to be in good health .
Doctors think the baby's size is due to its mother eating a lot during her pregnancy and spending much of the pregnancy in bed .
There are concerns the baby will be at greater risk of obesity and diabetes ."

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . Justo Santos, 44, was arrested after the daughter of the Manhattan restaurateur shot dead in 1986 tracked him down following an online manhunt years later . A man accused of killing a restaurant owner more than 25 years ago has said he was acting in self-defense when he shot him during a scuffle as he feared for his life. Justo Santos, 44, was arrested after the daughter of the Manhattan restaurateur shot dead in 1986 tracked him down following an online manhunt years later. Santos was arrested in Miami last year in connection with the killing of José 'George' Martinez. He was tracked down by Martinez's daughter, actress Joselyn Martinez, who was just nine when her father was killed in front of his wife. Appearing in court yesterday, Santos said his life has been destroyed, the New York Post has reported. Santos told the court: 'I was the victim too.' He said he acted in self-defense after Martinez choked him during a scuffle outside the restaurant. Asked about why he moved to Miami instead of staying in New York following the shooting, Santos said he 'had no winter clothes' and wanted to go somewhere warm, according to the New York Daily News. The hearing was held yesterday to decide whether Santos' constitutional rights had been violated because of the length of time it took for authorities to prosecute him. On the night of the shooting, Santos, then 16, and two of his companions were thrown out of Mr Martinez’s restaurant, after they allegedly made a rude comment to a waitress. Santos told the court he shot Martinez in self-defense after he felt his life was in danger when the restaurant owner started choking him. Santos was tracked down by Martinez's daughter, actress Joselyn Martinez (pictured), who was just nine when her father was killed in front of his wife . Days after the incident, Santos flew to the Dominican Republic where he was arrested for the killing. The court heard Santos chose to face trial in a Dominican court where he was found guilty of manslaughter, jailed for a year and ordered to pay 50,000 pesos to Martinez's mother and brother. Upon his release from prison, Santos moved to Miami where he started a new life, the New York court heard. His defense lawyer, Lawrence Herrmann, has argued the authorities allowed too much time to pass before issuing an indictment. He said the delay has meant it is difficult for Santos to put together a credible defense, The New York Times reported. The hearing is due to resume with final arguments on September 18. At the time of Santos's arrest last year Joselyn Martinez (pictured with her mother at a birthday party) said: 'My mom told me to never forget his name. She’d tell me, ""You have to know who did this to your family""' At the time of his arrest last year, it was reported how Joselyn Martinez kept the wanted posters following the shooting to make sure she would not forget who she was hunting. She said: 'My mom told me to never forget his name. She’d tell me, ""You have to know who did this to your family"".' Ms Martinez started to use social media, she kept an eye out for the man she had been looking for, although his name did not show up on Facebook or MySpace. Then in 2008, she signed up for a free promotional search on Background.com and Santos' name appeared. Spurred on by the results, Joselyn paid $70 fees to Background.com and similar sites, including USA-Peopleseach.com, Peoplelookup.com and Intelius.com. 'They all had it. They had his address. They had his phone number,' Ms Martinez said.","Justo Santos was arrested last year after victim's daughter tracked him down online .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . When a new tourist map of Berkhamsted was drawn up, officials were hoping it would attract visitors to the historic monuments and picturesque pubs which line the canal. The drawing of the Hertfordshire town - where the English surrendered to William, Duke of Normandy, in 1066 - was one of hundreds created by the Canal and River Trust in the past year to promote the nation's waterways. But what really caught people's attention was its phallic shape - although tourism chiefs today defended the choice of map. Rude route? The map was drawn by the Canal and River Trust in a bid to attract more people to the historic monuments and pubs of Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire . Layout: A map on Google Earth shows how the landmarks compare to the location of the canal . It points out the town's 11th century castle, the Canadian Totem Police and waterside pubs including The Rising Sun, The Boat and The Crystal Palace. The map also highlights some local amenities, including local car parks and the nearest Waitrose. However, the location of the landmarks has resulted in the outline resembling that of a giant penis - much to the amusement of Canal and River Trust. Jonathan Ludford from the Canal  and River Trust, told MailOnline: 'The UK’s canals are a haven for people and wildlife and we’ve produced 100 maps of some of the top family friendly destinations. 'It was pointed out to us that the map of Berkhamsted maybe looks a bit phallic. But canal maps are invariably going to be long and straight and sometimes they might have a couple of bulges at one end. Waterway: . The Grand Junction Canal runs parallel to the town's High Street and . was completed in 1798, before it was extended to Birmingham in 1805 . 'We have over a hundred more maps for you to check their shapes. Fortunately everyone’s seen the funny side and so we’re not too deflated about it.' The Grand Junction Canal running through Berkhamsted was completed in 1798 and runs parallel to the High Street - which is lined with restaurants and bars. The section - connecting the River Thames at Brentford to the town - was then extended to Birmingham in 1805, and became one of the main routes for goods to be taken from London to the North and Midlands. The new map was posted on the Facebook page of the town's Haresfoot Brewery and quickly attracted social media users who noticed the outline. The brewery said: 'Great graphic by the Canal River Trust highlighting the three canal pubs in Berkhamsted.' Location: The community is 30 miles north of London and its population is just over 16,000 people . History: Berkhamsted Town Hall was built in 1859 . The story of Berkhamsted begins in 1066. William, Duke of Normandy, had defeated the English army at Hastings and he crossed the river Thames to meet a delegation in the town. It was there that he agreed to take the crown and was where he was given the name William the Conqueror. Legend has it that in between this meeting and William's crowning at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day of that year, Berkhamsted was the capital of England. It became a popular holiday destination for Norman and Plantagenet kings and would became renowned for its the castle - which was built in the same year as the invasion. It was an important battle station between the 11th and 13th centuries, but it was abandoned in the 15th century. All that remains are parts of the perimeter walls. However it is now one of the town's most popular tourist attractions - alongside the Canadian Totem Pole on the banks of the canal and the restaurants and bars which line the nearby high street. The area also boasts the Rex Cinema, described by Visit the Chilterns tourist site as 'possibly Britain's most beautiful cinema'. The town is 30 miles north of London and has a population of just over 16,000 people.","Map of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, was drawn by Canal and River Trust .

"By . Tara Brady . The remains of the first emperor of Brazil Dom Pedro I and his two wives have been exhumed 180 years after he died which could re-write the history of the country. Tests were carried out in secrecy between February and September 2012 by historian and archaeologist Valdirene Carmo Ambiel at the University of Sao Paulo who hopes to shed more light on the Imperial family. Over three mornings, the remains were transported from the Brazilian Imperial Crypt, in Independence Park, to the university's medical school. Regal: This picture shows the remains of Dom Pedro who was Brazil's first emperor and king of Portugal. Tests were carried out on the skeleton after he was exhumed from the Brazilian Imperial Crypt . Researchers discovered the emperor had four fractured ribs on the left side which would have crippled one of his lungs and may have aggravated the tuberculosis that killed him at age 36 in 1834. The injuries were the result of falling from a horse in 1823 and a chariot in 1829. Surprisingly, when his casket was brought up, there was no insignia or Brazilian emblem among the five medals found with the skeleton. The first emperor of Brazil was buried as a Portuguese general wearing cavalry boots. The face of an emperor: Dom Pedro was examined by experts at the University of Sao Paulo . Discovery: The first emperor of Brazil was buried as a Portuguese general wearing cavalry boots . Historic: Researchers hope to find out more about Brazil's first Imperial family . The only reference to the period Pedro ruled Brazil is the cover of one of his coffins which reads: 'First Emperor of Brazil' beside 'King of Portugal and Algarves.' For the first time, the country's largest hospital complex was used for historic research which carried out hours of scans using state-of-the-art equipment. His two wives, Dona Leopoldina and Dona Amelia of Leuchtenberg were also examined. The most surprising find was that Dona Amelia of Leuchtenberg, Dom Pedro's second wife, was mummified and preserved so well you can see her hair, nails and even eyelashes. Research: Medical experts and historians examined the remains over three days using modern technology including a MRI scanner . Within her well-preserved hands, which still have skin on, she holds a crucifix made of wood and metal. It had been thought that the emperor's first wife Dona Leopoldina, had fallen or been thrown down a staircase in the palace of Quinta da Boa Vista, where the Royal family lived. However radiographers could not verify in she had fractured bones. A medical researcher said: 'The lab was transformed with professionals using the latest equipment for the sake of historical research. 'The material collected will be useful to continue the research in several areas over the coming years.' Exhumed: The research showed Dom Pedro I had four fractured ribs which could have led to him getting tuberculosis . Pedro I was born October 12, 1798, in Lisbon, Portugal and was the founder of the Brazilian empire and first emperor of Brazil from 1822. He was also crowned King Pedro IV of Portugal. Generally known as Dom Pedro, he was the son of King John VI of Portugal. When Napoleon conquered Portugal in 1807, Pedro accompanied the royal family in its flight to Brazil. He remained there as regent when King John returned to Portugal in 1821. Pedro surrounded himself with ministers who counseled independence. When the Portuguese parliament, preferring colonial status for Brazil, demanded that Pedro return to Lisbon to 'complete his political education,' he issued a declaration of Brazilian independence on September 7, 1822. Within three months he was crowned emperor. Pedro’s initial popularity waned, and in 1823, when the Brazilian Assembly was preparing a liberal constitution, he dissolved that body and exiled the radical leader José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva. On March 25, 1824, however, Pedro accepted a somewhat less liberal constitution drafted by the Council of State at his request. Although adoption of that charter may have saved Pedro from deposition, it did not reestablish his popularity. Preserved: Dom Pedro's two wives, Dona Amelia of Leuchtenberg (left) and . Dona Leopoldina (right) were also examined by experts who discovered . his second wife was mummified . His autocratic manner, his lack of enthusiasm for parliamentary government, and his continuing deep interest in Portuguese affairs antagonised his subjects, as did the failure of his military forces in a war with Argentina over what is now Uruguay. Strong opposition in the Brazilian Parliament and a series of local uprisings induced him to abdicate in 1831 in favour of his son Dom Pedro II, who was then five-years-old. Pedro I then returned to Portugal. On the death of King John VI in 1826, Pedro I had become titular king of Portugal as Pedro IV. Two months later, still in Brazil, he issued a parliamentary charter for Portugal and conditionally abdicated the Portuguese throne in favour of his daughter Maria da Glória, the future Queen Maria II. He died of natural causes in Portugal while securing his daughter’s claim against that of his brother, the regent Miguel.","Tests carried out on the remains in secrecy at the University of Sao Paulo .

'Ginny will always be an integral part of Williams’ history and success, and today we pay tribute to a much loved member of the Williams family who will be sorely missed. 'Please respect the family’s wishes for privacy at this time.' In a moving tribute, McLaren racing chairman Ron Dennis described Lady Williams as a 'truly great lady.' He said: 'I'm extremely saddened to hear the news. Ginny, as we always called her, was friendly and fun, yet also a tower of strength and intelligence. 'She supported my old friend Frank through many triumphs and disasters, treating those two imposters just the same, over a long and happy marriage. 'She'll be missed not only by the Williams family, to whom we offer our condolences at this very difficult time, but also by the entire motorsport community worldwide.' The Williams have three children, Claire, Jonathan and Jaime.

"By . Jennifer Smith . With modern technology, advancing design and ever-changing style, it's hard to imagine life in some parts of the country 200 years ago. But the life at the Foxton Locks Flight doesn't seem to have changed too much, with the historic canal locks bearing a striking resemblance to how they looked during the 19th Century. Photographs of the locks throughout their history have been released by the Canal River Trust to mark the 200th anniversary of the locks being built. Built by architect Benjamin Bevan between 1810 and 1814, the ten canal locks in Leicestershire facilitate the Grand Union Canal and are the longest staircase of locks in Britain. At the height of the Industrial Revolution they carried huge quantities of goods, such as coal and cotton, between London and the Midlands.Today the canal is more popular among leisure boaters, walkers, canoeists and anglers. To mark the occasion visitors are invited this weekend to hear live music and enjoy food stalls as well as watching a parade of historic boats  from Crick in Northamptonshire. Nigel Crowe, Head of Heritage for the Canal and River Trust said: 'I'm absolutely delighted to see the locks so well looked after. 'It's such an interesting site that was badly neglected during the war.' The Canal and River Trust has partnered up with local authorities to implement a preservation plan which Mr Crowe said is a 'good' arrangement. 'We all work together to make sure the locks are preserved properly. It's a site that I and everyone else at the trust is very proud of.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"By . Mia De Graaf . A property developer has won a £167,000 legal battle with 11 of her neighbours after she became embroiled in a bitter boundary dispute - over a 9ft piece of land. Valerie Wright, 56, claims she was subjected to a vicious seven-year hate campaign at the hands of villagers living in picturesque Southrey, Lincolnshire, over the the small strip of grass. The mother-of-one moved onto two acres of land with her husband William - who has since died -  in 1990 where they built two houses, one of which they moved into into 2006. Victory: Valerie Wright, 56, claims she was subjected to a seven-year hate campaign to reclaim her land . Dispute: The nine-foot strip of land between her house (left) and her neighbours' consists mainly of weeds . But since 2007 she has been locked in a turf war with locals over a small strip of grass behind her home - consisting mainly of nettles and a ditch. She took fellow villagers to Lincoln County Court after deciding they were trespassing on her £270,000 detached property. Those she challenged claimed they did nothing wrong and that the boundary was clearly marked on the deeds of their homes on Ferry Road. But following a lengthy row over the tiny plot of land six families have been forced to stump up £167,000 in damages and court costs following her victory. The dispute has shrunk each of their gardens by 9ft and every single penny of Mrs Wright’s £3,650 damages and her £92,000 legal costs has now been paid by them. Additionally, the residents she challenged in the leafy village have also had to settle their own legal costs of at least £72,000. Anger: While she claimed residents were trespassing, they claimed she was making them cut their gardens . The court heard how the money has been paid through a combination of selling up, taking out loans, or claiming on home insurance. Today, Mrs Wright, a building project manager, who has since used some of the payout to erect a sturdy fence to reinforce the boundary, said: 'I claimed back what was rightfully mine. 'This was and is my property and looking at the Land Registry records proved that. 'We came to the village in 1990 and all we wanted was a quiet life - we had everything but that. 'I have been on the receiving end of a fair bit of animosity and have been the victim of a nasty hate campaign. I would say I have been harassed by some members of this community. 'They even held meetings in the village hall to discuss my land, I was very much ganged up on. 'I claimed back what was rightfully mine. I have been harassed by some members of this community' 'The problem is that if we had ever wanted to sell up we had people on our property. 'My solicitor wrote to them in 2007 telling them to get off my land. 'A summons was issued in 2010 and even after that they still had the chance to back down. 'I have lived in the parish all my life and the action I took was justified. It took seven years because there was six properties but I’ve finally done it. 'I’m just happy to be left alone and move on with my life, just live and let live and mind my own business.' Mrs Wright and husband William, who died in 2011, had claimed neighbours from nearby Ferry Road had had extended their gardens onto her land 'without licence or consent'. But Lincoln County Court heard that the defiant local residents still 'refused to withdraw' Two years ago successfully argued that the true boundary - once marked by a wire fence - lies about 4ft to the east of a dyke running parallel with Ferry Road. Jeffrey Withey, 66, of Ferry Road, said: 'We had done nothing wrong, but unfortunately the court has decided and we are out of pocket and garden space. Mrs Wright and her late husband bought the land in Southrey, Lincolnshire, in 1990 . 'It was a nice village when we came 20-something years ago, but now we want to move. We used to trim the hedges and tend to it and she just wants to build on it. 'Two of the couples involved have already moved out and I want to as well to be honest. I have lost my apple and pear tree because of this. 'We’ve felt driven off our land - even if it is a couple of metres - but its the principle that counts. 'We had paperwork showing our land went down to the old fence.' His wife Jacqueline said: 'I could not understand how the deeds were wrong. 'This house has been here for 100 years, but the deeds are not worth the paper they are printed on.' Neighbour and former parish councillor Mike McKenna added: 'The boundary is marked out on the deeds and it is a mystery to me how it got to this stage.'","Valerie Wright, 56, was subjected to seven-year 'hate campaign' over land .

"By . James  Nye . In a move which could have dramatic ramifications, the Justice Department confirmed today that it will look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to determine whether federal prosecutors should file criminal charges against George Zimmerman in the wake of his acquittal.

In . a statement Sunday, the Justice Department said the criminal section of . the civil rights division, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office for . the Middle District of Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence . generated during the federal probe, in addition to the evidence and . testimony from the state trial. The statement . said that, in the government's words, 'experienced federal prosecutors . will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation.' Outraged: NAACP President and CEO Benjamin Todd Jealous (center) has launched a petition to have federal civil rights charges brought against George Zimmerman by Attorney General Eric Holder . This moves follows demands from a furious NAACP for the Obama administration to intervene. Already, . over 100,000 people have signed up to an online petition and the NAACP . has written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging the . Department of Justice to press civil rights charges against 29-year-old . Zimmerman. In his first public statement since the verdict, President Barack . Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman . in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, saying . his death was a tragedy and that the country should seek ways to stem . gun violence. 'We are a nation of laws and a jury has . spoken,' Obama, the first black U.S. president, said in a statement. 'I . now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two . parents who lost their young son.' Obama, . who last year said that 'if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,' added . that he was aware the Florida case has elicited strong feelings. 'And . in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even . higher,' he said. The president . urged Americans to broaden 'the circle of understanding and compassion' in their communities and put some of the emotion the case has aroused . into curtailing gun violence. 'We . should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun . violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily . basis,' he said. 'We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a . society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this.' 'That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin,' he added.

Sunday, Daryl Parks, an attorney for the family of Trayvon Martin was . non-committal when asked if they supported the NAACP's call for . Zimmerman to be prosecuted by the Justice Department. When . asked on 'Fox News Sunday' if Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy and . mother, Sybrina Fulton, supported such a move, Parks seemed to defer. 'The . beauty of our country is that we have several tiers of government, . several aspects of laws and that different times different aspects . apply,' said Parks. 'Different laws apply at different times, different places apply at different times. That would be a different arena.' Both . Tracy Martin and Trayvon's mother Sybrina Fulton chose not to be in the . Seminole Circuit Court when the jurors announced their decision just . before 10 p.m. George Crump the family's attorney said that they will still be pursuing a civil case against George Zimmerman. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous was unequivocal in his response to the not-guilty decision by the Florida jury. 'We are outraged and heartbroken over today's verdict,' NAACP President Benjamin Jealous said in a statement.

'We will pursue civil rights charges with the Department of Justice, we will continue to fight for the removal of Stand Your Ground laws in every state, and we will not rest until racial profiling in all its forms is outlawed,' said Jealous. Politicians such as Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y) and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson have all added their voices to the NAACP's position and demanded the administration review the case. The Rev. Al Sharpton, called the verdict 'a sad day . in the country' and 'a slap in the face to those that believe in . justice in this country.' 'I think this is an atrocity,' Sharpton said. 'It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen.' Jesse Jackson called the verdict 'Old South justice.' 'I'm disappointed and I'm saddened for the family,' Jackson said. Jealous said Martin's family may bring a civil . suit against Zimmerman but said federal criminal charges must be filed . because evidence suggests race was a factor in the case. He . told CNN the black community is upset with a situation in which 'our . young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys. The robbers . and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who think . that they're keeping folks safer.' Sharpton, . who called the verdict 'a slap in the face to the American people,' cited the example of Rodney King, the man whose videotaped beating by . Los Angeles police triggered rioting two decades ago after a state . criminal trial found the police officers not guilty. Later, the Justice . Department brought a federal case that resulted in the conviction of two . officers. Groundswell of Support; The parents of Trayvon Martin, Tracy Martin (left) and Sybrina Fulton (2nd right) stand with the Rev. Al Sharpton (C) and Rev. Jesse Jackson (far right) as they all attend a rally in his honor in Florida . However, after Zimmerman was found not guilty on second-degree and manslaughter charges by a Florida jury on Saturday, Attorney General Eric Holder has been left with a decision of massive implications. The enormous pressure on Holder, the United States' first African-American attorney general will grow over the coming days - especially in light of previous statements made on the matter. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice launched a review of the shooting and Holder went on record to say that he would take appropriate action if there was sufficient evidence of a civil rights crime. 'If we find evidence of a potential federal criminal civil rights crime, we will take appropriate action, and at every step, the facts and law will guide us forward,' said Holder in a speech in April to Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. However, in remarks subsequent to that, Holder toned-down his comments, saying that the DOJ faces a 'very high barrier' to bring federal criminal charges. Controversy: This combo image made from file photos shows Trayvon Martin, left, and George Zimmerman. On Saturday, July 13, 2013, jurors found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Martin . Holder made personal remarks about the death of Trayvon Martin in April, saying 'as a parent I reacted to it.' 'This is a pain that no parent should have to endure. The notion of having to bury a child is something that is, I think in some ways for a parent, the ultimate pain,' said Holder. Attorney General Eric Holder,The Department of Justice has closely monitored the State of Florida’s prosecution of the case against George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin murder since it began. Today, with the acquittal of George Zimmerman, it is time for the Department of Justice to act.The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin. We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation.Please address the travesties of the tragic death of Trayvon Martin by acting today.Thank you .

"By . Sam Webb . Sam Sodje, seen here playing for Charlton Athletic, has been filmed apparently arranging to fix football matches . Police have now arrested six people in connection with a second investigation into football spot-fixing following allegations that a player rigged a Championship game in return for cash. The National Crime Agency (NCA) acted after ex-Premier League footballer Sam Sodje was filmed bragging that he can arrange for professional . footballers to get yellow cards or even sent off in return for cash. The Sun on Sunday handed over information on Sodje, gathered over a . period of four months by an undercover reporter posing as a middleman . for a betting syndicate based in the Far East. In the video, 34-year-old Nigerian . defender Sodje brags that he can arrange for a player to get themselves . booked for a £30,000 pay-out, and that he could guarantee certain events in play in return for money. Fraudsters can capitalise on this . through in-game betting, where they put large bets on incidents like red . and yellow cards, penalties and even corner kicks. In the video recorded by an undercover reporter from the Sun on Sunday , Sodje claimed he fixed it for an ex-Premier League player, who now plays in . the Championship, to get a yellow card and can even organise similar . such events in Premier League games - for a much greater price because of the huge fines for players at that level. Sodje, who played for Portsmouth and also in the top flight at Reading, . even said he was preparing to fix matches at next year's World Cup in Brazil. An NCA spokeswoman said: 'An active NCA investigation is now underway and we are working closely with the Football Association and the Gambling Commission. 'Six people are in custody and are being questioned by NCA officers. We cannot comment further at this stage.' In the Sun on Sunday footage, Sodje said it was child's play for a player to get a yellow card, as they are so common no one suspects anything is amiss and the player can continue playing afterwards. He said: 'This guy came to meet me at my house and it was sorted. That's how easy it is - it's nothing.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cristian Montano, formerly of Dagenham and Redbridge (pictured) and now at Oldham Athletic, reportedly tried to get a yellow card in a game against Wolves but failed . Sodje . and his brother Stephen claimed they could even get players sent off - an . event which can cripple a team's chances in a game - for between £50,000 . and £70,000. He said . he could set up a bet an entire week before a game, while his brother warned the . reporter not to pay one player rumoured to be involved in fixing . matches because the sportsman was already under scrutiny. Sodje spoke of a meeting a Premiership player in a Manchester hotel room, as well as at the home of another to discuss a potential fix. The footage also shows him admitting punching an opponent in the groin to get sent off for a £70,000 pay-out. While playing for Portsmouth, Sodje punched Oldham Athletic's Jose Baxter twice in the game, which took place in February. Sodje also boasted that having pocketed £70,000 from the gambling ring, even after his £10,000 fine he was still £60,000 better off. While playing for Portsmouth, Sodje punched Oldham Athletic's Jose Baxter twice in the game (pictured), which took place in February . Bizarre: Sodje said he had to launch the attack as  the referee had not been booking him for tackling . Payout: Sodje was fined £10,000 for the punches, but still made money after he was paid £70,000 from a gambling ring . He said: 'Do you know how much I got fined? I got fined ten grand and I missed six games.' He said he had to launch the bizarre attack, which his then-manager at Portsmouth, Guy Whittingham, described as 'inexcusable', as the referee had not been booking him for tackling. Spotting his chance after a tackle by Baxter, Sodje ran up to his opponent and punched him in the crotch - to the shock of spectators. The reporters also claim to have met with Cristian Montano, who was alledgedly supposed to get booked in a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the first half - but failed. In action: While playing for Brentford in 2005, Sodje competes with Oldham's Luke Beckett for the ball . The 21-year-old Colombian reportedly claims he was 'hacking' opposition players and even swore at the ref but did not get carded, offering to fix another game to make amends. Sodje had called former Notts County teammate Montano to a hotel to explain himself. The fixer showed the reporter text messages from Montano explaining that he had dived for penalties and pulled other players' shirts, only to receive just one booking - for a clean tackle. Montano's current club Oldham Athletic said in a statement: 'Oldham Athletic Football Club . has been made aware of the incident and allegation surrounding one of . its players, Cristian Montano. The club will commence an immediate . internal investigation to establish all the relevant facts of the case. 'The . club is co-operating with other agencies in this matter and cannot . comment on specific facts at this stage. The club will not be issuing . any further statements at this time.' Award winner: Sodje with his Evening Standard Footballer of the Month winner for February 2005 . In the video, Sodje also claimed that . another of his brother's Akpo, 33, who plays for Tranmere Rovers in . League One, would get booked in each of his next six games in exchange . for cash. He said that the brothers were trying to prepare for a life after football. Portsmouth FC spokesman Colin Farmery . said: 'If these serious allegations are true then we are extremely . shocked and saddened by them, as match-fixing of any type goes to the . heart of the integrity of the game. 'The . player in question no longer plays for the club and we have not been . contacted by the authorities, but of course we would cooperate fully . with any inquiry.' It is thought that illegal betting syndicates are worth £320billion worldwide, with the practice on the rise because of the growing popularity of gambling during games, and the ease of in-play betting. A large proportion of the money is generated in Asia, where gambling is largely unregulated, as opposed to Europe. Speaking about the latest reports, Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey said: 'We treat any allegations of criminal activity in our competitions with the utmost seriousness. 'Given that there is an ongoing police investigation into this matter, we cannot comment further at this time. Although, we would encourage anyone with any evidence to report it to the police. 'We will be giving our full assistance to the police during their investigation.' A spokesman from the Football Association said: 'The FA is aware of the National Crime Agency investigation and is working closely with the NCA and other authorities. We will make no further comment at this time.' A Gambling Commission spokesman said: 'The Gambling Commission has responded quickly in supporting this ongoing National Crime Agency investigation and continues to liaise with both the NCA and the Football Association.' The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said in a statement: 'These allegations, if proven, unfortunately demonstrate the real issue football faces in terms of corruption and highlights the necessity of the work carried out by the PFA and other stakeholders in the game in educating players of these risks. 'We take the issue of integrity very seriously and will continue in our efforts to eradicate this evil from our game. 'In terms of these specific reports, due to the ongoing investigation by the National Crime Agency, we are unable to comment further at this time.' Meanwhile, Marcus Gayle, manager of Conference South team Staines Town, has claimed his players were offered match-fixing bribes just three weeks ago. The former Wimbledon and Watford player told BT Sport he was furious when he discovered the approach, which was made to one of his players by telephone. Gayle said: 'We reported the incident straight away to the FA. That shows we have done the right thing. Our players are absolutely furious. 'I never thought match-fixing was possible but now I have changed my mind for obvious reasons, now I am convinced it's all over the place, at least that's how it appears to be to me. 'After what has happened at my club I am angry and I want to stand up for the integrity of the game, even if that means standing up alone, so be it. 'As a club I believe we have done the right thing reporting it to the FA and I am sure they will be passing on that information to the police. We reported it to the FA 24 hours after I found out about it. 'It does worry me just how much is going on in the game at the moment, and I am sure it is far more than people think.'

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A horrified shopper has told how she found two false widow spiders in a bunch of red grapes from a Co-Op supermarket. Nichole Sarra, 28, was puzzled to see 'dust and cobwebs' when she opened the bag for lunch at her office in Cardiff Bay before spotting the live venomous arachnid. Luckily for Ms Sarra, experts believe the spider was a male - and it is female false widows whose bites have made headlines. Creepy-crawlies: Shopper Nichola Sarra found this spider - believed to be a false widow, Britain's most venomous - in a bag of red grapes which she had bought for lunch from a Co-Op branch in Cardiff Bay . But she complained to the store's customer service department - and then found a second identical spider lying dead at the bottom of the bag. Ms Sarra said she jumped in shock when she noticed the first spider, drawing the attention of colleagues who took photos of it. 'We weren't sure at first if it was a false widow spider,' she said. 'But my colleagues looked at the markings on its back and after looking online identified it as a false widow spider. 'After that no one wanted to go near the grapes.' A British Arachnological Society spokesman confirmed the spider 'certainly looks like a false widow spider'. Scene: The grapes were bought from a Co-Op branch in Cardiff Bay (pictured). The firm has apologised . They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders? Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people. Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain. By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction. False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings. However, the spokesman added it looked like a male, saying: 'Only the females have been known to bite on rare occasions'. Ms Sarra sent the picture to the Co-Op and was put in touch with the customer service department. 'I was told to go back to the bag of grapes and get the barcode number so they could track it,' she said. 'They believed it came from Spain'. A spokesman for the Co-operative Food said: 'We are committed to working closely with farmers and suppliers in order to provide a consistently great shopping experience for our customers. 'We are sorry that this product fell short of those expectations and will investigate the matter with our supplier.' As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs. An entire secondary school was shut in October in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated. In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later. But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled. There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s. It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself.","Nichole Sarra, 28, bought the red grapes from a Co-Op store in Cardiff Bay .

"By . Associated Press . A Utah woman whose two-year-old son died after police say she inadvertently poured her methadone from a Gatorade bottle into his sippy cup will serve up to 15 years in prison. Judge Robert Adkins said Tuesday in a Tooele courtroom that he disagreed with prosecutors who said the 33-year-old Jill Goff shouldn't serve prison time. She was sentenced on Tuesday to prison . for up to 15 years despite recommendations for leniency from the . prosecutor and defense attorney. Tragic: Aiden Goff, right, has died after his mother Jill Goff, left, accidentally served him methadone . Goff pleaded guilty in June to a child abuse homicide charge in the death of Aiden Goff, who was found dead February 1st after drinking a pink liquid. Court documents say Goff realized she had served her son the wrong drink when her 8-year-old son tried it and said it tasted like medicine. She told police she didn't call 911 or poison control right away because she was scared. 'These are probably the most . troubling cases for me,' said Judge Robert Adkins. '… It doesn’t appear . you intentionally gave methadone to your children.' Loss: Aiden drank from the cup his mother gave him on Friday afternoon. She was unaware that she had given him liquid methadone, which was being stored in a pink Gatorade bottle . Mother and son: Two of her other children also tasted the liquid but they survived after treatment. After realizing her mistake, Jill Goff put Aiden down for a nap but he did not wake up . Adkins, nevertheless, imposed the maximum punishment of one to 15 years at the Utah State Prison. Defense . attorney Jacob Linares had asked for jail, not prison, saying: ""This is . a horrific, tragic accident that she suffered, as well as the rest of . the family. 'Had she known . for sure what was happening, she would have done whatever she could to . change the outcome,' Linares told the judge. Prosecutor Gary Searle agreed that prison wasn’t the place for Goff. She 'refused to give her child a fighting chance,' Searle said, but didn’t kill him on purpose. 'It’s not going to bring her child back,' he said. 'It’s not going to serve any purpose … but satisfy the lust for vengeance.' Aiden Goff died after his mother accidentally gave him liquid methadone that she . stored in a Gatorade bottle. Methadone . is a pain reliever that can . also be used to help recovering addicts through withdrawal symptoms and . its side effects can mimic . heroine. Mix up: She served him pink liquid methadone . (left) - a strong pain killer that has similar side effects to heroin - . that had been stored in a Gatorade bottle (right). It is not clear why . the drug was stored in the bottle . Scene: Goff went for a nap with Aiden at the home, pictured, and later found him unresponsive . Police believe she obtained the drug legally but they have not . said why it was in liquid form or stored in a drink bottle. The . hospitalized children told relatives and detectives that their mother . had given Aiden a drink but he did not like it, the probably cause . statement said. When he complained that he did not . like it, the mother gave it to the five-year-old, who agreed it was . disgusting. The eight-year-old then tasted it and he said it tasted like . medicine. Investigators believe that, rather than serving her child Gatorade, she inadvertently . gave him methadone, which had been stored in the Gatorade bottle, . Wimmer said. The mother then . realized that she had switched the liquids and tried to get her . two-year-old son to throw up, the statement said. She then gave him a . bath and put him down for a nap. She told investigators that she did not call police because she was scared. A 14-year-old sibling went to wake Aiden, but he wasn't responsive. Goff called 911.","Jill .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Accused: Richard Dawe is accused of breaching his ASBO by driving onto his neighbour's land and chasing her pregnant sheep around the field in his car . An 80-year-old pensioner breached his ASBO by driving onto his neighbour’s land before chasing her pregnant sheep around the field in his car, a court heard. Richard Dawe is accused of attacking livestock belonging to next-door neighbour Barbara Wilkes, during an ongoing dispute between the pair, who live in the village of Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire. Worcester Crown Court was told Dawe, who referred to himself as the 'Don of Castlemorton', had driven his Vauxhall Astra at speed towards the terrified herd of sheep. The jury was told one of the expectant ewes died following the incident on March 18 of this year. Roger Brown, prosecuting, told the court Dawe had first breached the ASBO, imposed in 2005, on November 21 last year when Mrs Wilkes spotted him damaging her son’s car. Giving evidence, Mrs Wilkes told the court there had been a dispute between the neighbours over land, which left her so scared she carried a recording device every time she left the house. The jury heard a recording Mrs Wilkes, 57, made on January 14 in which Dawe could be heard shouting and swearing at her as she fed her animals. 'I found it quite alarming and unpleasant,' she told the court. 'I expect something to happen every time and I carry a recording device whenever I go outside.' The jury were also played a second recording from March 18 this year when her sheep strayed from common land into a field. Dawe said he would get them out but was later spotted driving his car behind them as his dogs ran loose. Under cross examination from Lee Masters, defending,  Mrs Wilkes admitted she could not be sure if the dead sheep was one of the ones chased. The court was told that Dawe had threatened to attack Mrs Wilkes's sheep prior to the alleged attack in March, after comparing himself to the action film character Mad Max. Giving evidence for a second day she said: 'Mr Dawe did threaten to set his dogs on to my sheep. 'His words were ""I'll dog them out of it' referring to the field. Rampage: Worcester Crown Court was told Dawe had driven his Vauxhall Astra, thought to be the one pictured, at speed towards the terrified herd of sheep . 'Mr Dawe made lots of threats to do things to my sheep over the few days they were going in to the field. 'He was likening himself to Mad Max.' She added: 'He often says he's the Don and he's in charge. 'These sort of events are happening frequently, in fact every time I come in contact with Mr Dawe.' The court heard Mrs Wilkes's son Thomas had painted ""Eeaw the donkey"" on a white shed on her land facing Dawe's house. Asked . by defence barrister why he had done this, Mrs Wilkes added: 'It's . something my son put on there because Mr Dawe calls himself the Don of . Castlemorton. 'It's our way of dealing with it. If you can liken Don to a donkey rather than a mafia boss. 'It's different ways of dealing with a situation that I can't even begin to explain to people. 'Mr Dawe seems to delight by terrorising people by referring to himself as a Don, it's our way of dealing with it. Dispute: Dawe is accused of attacking livestock belonging to Barbara Wilkes, during an ongoing dispute between the pair who live in the village of Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire . 'It's not as offensive as some of the things Mr Dawe has called myself and other neighbours.' Mrs Wilkes also told the jury about the moment she saw Dawe driving his car 'fast' at six to eight of her sheep. The . mental health nurse, who keeps sheep as a hobby, added: 'He was driving . a car and the dogs were running around chasing my sheep. 'I only saw the one but I presume it was the two (dogs). 'I would say even 20 to 30mph would be very fast in a field. It looked fast because of the way he was covering the ground.' Bespectacled . Dawe, who wore a khaki-coloured shirt and a blue fleece, changed his . plea to guilty for one of the four charges he is facing. He admitted . breaching his ASBO by being verbally abusive and using foul language . towards Mrs Wilkes on January 14 by using the phrase 'a load of bloody . c***s' Livestock: Sheep in the field near the homes of Dawe and Mrs Wilkes. The court was told one of her expectant ewes had died following the incident in March of this year . Dawe now denies a total of three charges including breaching . his ASBO by using conduct likely to cause distress, alarm or harassment . towards Mrs Wilkes by driving a car towards her sheep. He also denies a charge of criminal damage and a charge of breaching the ASBO by damaging property. The . court heard those two charges relate to an incident on November 21 last . year when Mrs Wilke's son's red Renault Clio was scratched after he . parked it on a public track near Dawe's home. In police interviews . Dawe claimed the Wilkes family deliberately parked vehicles on the track . to annoy him but denied causing the seven scratch marks. He admitted driving at the sheep but said he did so slowly to shepherd them away. He . also claimed his two dogs were in his car at all times and said he only . let them out of the vehicle once the sheep were out of the field and . the gate was closed. The court heard the ASBO was handed to Dawe at . Birmingham Crown Court on October 5, 2004 and was due to expire on . October 4 this year. The trial, which is expected to last another two days, continues.

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Accused: Footballer Ravel Morrison is to go on trial next year over claims that he threatened to throw acid in his ex-girlfriend's face and have her killed . Premier League footballer Ravel Morrison is to go on trial next year over claims that he threatened to throw acid in his ex-girlfriend's face and have her killed. The 21-year-old West Ham midfielder is also accused of threatening to blow up Reah Mansoor's house during a four-year campaign of harassment against her. Morrison, who started his career at Manchester United, is also alleged to have assaulted the 19-year-old and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in Salford in the early hours of July 27. During a brief appearance at Manchester Crown Court today, Morrison entered not guilty pleas to two counts of assault of beating, one of assault causing actual bodily harm and one count of harassment. He was told that he would next appear for a case management hearing on November 10, with a provisional trial date set for January 26. Morrison, originally from Manchester, was initially remanded in custody last week before being bailed. His bail conditions are that he lives at an address in east London and does not contact either Miss Mansoor or her mother. He is also prevented from entering the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance or for a West Ham game, in which case he must return to London immediately after the match. Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce took him to Upton Park but he was later shipped out on loan to Birmingham and QPR. He featured for the Hammers in Tuesday's Capital One Cup match against Sheffield United, with his team eventually going out after losing 5-4 on penalties. Morrison picked up the first of his four England Under-21 caps in a 4-0 win over San Marino in October.

"By . Damien Gayle . A new study has shown how fraudsters are able to use information shared online on social networks to build detailed profiles of potential victims. Researchers interviewed one ex-offender to find out the techniques he and others use to garner details from online sources enabling them to steal others' identities. He revealed that while users are often canny enough to withhold enough information on one site to foil fraudsters, resourceful crooks can collect enough data from various sources to apply for credit or make online purchases in their victim's name. Online predator: Researchers interviewed one former offender to get an insight into how fraudsters gather information from individuals' various online profiles to collect enough data to steal identities . Chief among the top three online resources for collecting potential victims personal details was not a social media website at all, but was in fact 192.com. The directory inquiries website was noted as particularly useful for providing information on where potential victims live, their age, other occupants, and how long they have lived there. Fraudsters can then flesh out the skeleton identity this crucial data provides by using Facebook for details on location, activities, friends and photographs; and LinkedIn, on which users often reveal their entire work and education history. ‘192.com was such a good resource – the . information on there was so good,' the study's interviewee revealed. 'LinkedIn is good – the whole point of the website is to get everything . you’ve done across to people you don’t know.’ He added: 'Photos are important. It can give you clues about a password or a security question – you may be asked favourite holiday place, or favourite football club – it’s a piece of information.' Whose checking your profile? The research, conducted on behalf of online security company ALLOW, revealed fraudsters often mine Facebook profiles for information that could help them crack passwords . Cyber-criminals are making $5million a year using computer viruses that hold the data on your hard drive to ransom. The scam has been around for several years, but new variants which claim to be the work of law enforcement agencies means the number of victims has soared. Ransomware is now a major criminal industry, said Symantec, the company behind anti-virus packages like Norton. 'If you look at the nature of the beast, it really puts the screws to you,' said Kevin Haley, director of Symantec's security response team. 'We see so many gangs moving to ransomware, looking for new angles, new versions, that we're going to see a lot of this in the future.' The malware infects a personal computer and cripples the machine. It can even encrypt its files. It then displays a message - the ransom note - that demands payment to restore control to the owner.

The ex-fraudster revealed how he would . create fake Facebook profiles using pictures of attractive women to . contact men in an effort to get them to reveal sensitive personal . information. 'You’ve got to get in to the minds of people – most guys will add a pretty face even if they didn’t know them,' he said. 'One . of my victims, I nicked someone’s phone, chose a pretty girl from a . different social networking site, got some of her photos and made a . profile on Facebook and added a few random people. 'This . guy emailed me stuff, where he would be and what he was doing – he . thought he had a chance with this fake person I had made up.

'You can extract information, it's an avenue to exploit to get bits of information.' The study, conducted on behalf of personal security company ALLOW, which offers services to keep internet users safe online, revealed how information collected by fraudsters was predominantly used to apply for credit or make purchases in the victim's name. 'Common sense': Justin Basini, CEO and founder of ALLOW, said social media users can take easy steps to protect their identity online . This typically involved using personal details to create an identity at a particular address the fraudster had access to, then applying for credit cards or loans. Alternatively the offender could collate the details into a complete identity then sell them on to others to commit the fraud. The fraudster said he felt social networks and social media sites 'didn't care' their services were being exploited by criminals. 'The more popular they are with everybody the happier they are,' he said. 'I think the thing they are worried about is if it became public knowledge that people can get defrauded through using them, I don’t think they would like it.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 13:09 EST, 24 November 2011 . A teenager blew off his fingertips . and was left with horrific burns after a bomb he bought on the internet . exploded in his hands. Luke Stillman, 16, lost the top of . his thumb when a Spanish 81mm mortar that he ordered from a collectors' website turned out to be live. The Northamptonshire teenager was . dismantling the device - which he believed was inert - when part of the metal detonator, about the size of a Malteser, exploded in his hands. Luke Stillman, 16, from Northamptonshire, had to have pieces of shrapnel dug out of his wounds by a doctor . The Spanish 81mm mortar was supposed to have been deactivated . 'We heard a big bang followed by a scream and thought the bookcase in his bedroom had fallen over,' said his father Terry Stillman, 56. 'But when we went up to his room, we realised the bomb had exploded and there was blood everywhere. It was horrific. 'Luke was screaming his head off and thought he had lost all his fingers.' Luke, a pupil at Moulton School, Northampton, began buying military memorabilia over the internet in January. He paid £36 for the Spanish mortar, which the seller said was inert, from the Specialist Auctions website. Mr Stillman said it was delivered to their home by Royal Mail. Luke also has several grenades and bullets in his collection, which have all been deactivated. 'It is quite legal to sell them inert, but this one clearly wasn't and I'm very worried that this could happen to someone else and they could suffer an even worse accident,' added Mr Stillman, of Walgrave in Northants. 'When the mortar arrived, Luke took it up to his bedroom to dismantle and see how it works and he actually did this several times before it exploded. 'It was part of the metal detonator, about the size of a Malteser, which went off and scattered slivers of shrapnel everywhere. 'Luke was standing up at his desk and he suffered an impact injury to his chest and lost the tip of his right thumb and the pad of his index finger. 'There were also lots of tiny pieces of shrapnel in both his hands which had to be pulled out by a surgeon. But he was lucky as it could have been so much worse.' Luke, who is a member of the Air Training Corps, was taken by his parents to Kettering General Hospital and then transferred to the Leicester Royal Infirmary for an operation. 'We were absolutely horrified by what happened but at least Luke is getting better,' added his father. 'I have never worried about this happening before as you believe mortars are inert when you are told that. 'We have told Luke he is not buying anymore and I want to warn other people about the risks. I also find it worrying that if someone actually wanted to buy a live bomb it would be possible for them to do so.' The family has contacted the website about last month's accident and has been told the seller has now been blocked from trading, but they are worried the original dealer is still selling items. Mr Stillman added: 'My worry is that someone could actually die if this is allowed to carry on.' Northamptonshire Police is investigating the incident under the Firearms Act. 'This incident could potentially have resulted in Luke sustaining a much more serious injury. As it was, his fingers were burned and the table he was sitting at was damaged,' said Detective Sergeant Andy Rogers, of Northampton CID. 'Messing around with any ordnance is potentially very dangerous. If you discover ordnance of any description, steer clear and contact the police immediately. 'We need to know how this mortar round was still ""live"" and available for purchase in this country and, to that end, we are investigating to see whether any criminal offences have been committed.' A spokesman for Specialist Auctions said today: 'The site is similar to eBay, we enable buyers to meet sellers. 'We are very strict that the ordnance sold is inert and the minute we heard what had happened we started working with the police to make sure they had all the information they needed. 'We also have specialists from the British Ordnance Collectors Association who monitor what is being listed for sale. 'Inert ordnance can be bought and sold in the UK so we let people do that on this site. 'The vendor in this instance will not be allowed to trade again. 'This is the first time we have had an issue like this and we have been running for eight years.' Ruth Barker from Royal Mail said: 'We are very sympathetic to the nasty injuries suffered. We are not aware of the circumstances or evidence that this item was delivered by Royal Mail. 'We do of course take the security and safety of mail very seriously and will always work closely with the police on such issues.'",Luke Stillman paid £36 for device he was told had been deactivated .
"By . Andrew Downie . Brazil's successful experiment of playing without a designated striker will continue this year and although coach Dunga does not rule out other approaches he has told his players to get used to the new system. Former international midfielder Dunga returned to coach Brazil after their World Cup debacle and led them to a 1-0 win over Ecuador on Tuesday, four days after they overcame Colombia by the same scoreline in his first match in charge. He introduced a floating attack with Neymar and Atletico Mineiro striker Diego Tardelli changing positions up front and was pleased with the way they responded. It's staying that way: Dunga, Brazil's manager, says the false No 9 is here for good after taking over . It worked! Dunga introduced a floating attack with Neymar and Atletico Mineiro striker Diego Tardelli up top . 'We are going to keep observing players and keep watching those that played,' Dunga told reporters after the game in New Jersey in the United States. 'Players need to play more to gain confidence and to feel more sure of themselves. 'This was the first time Brazil has played without an attacking reference point and that is very difficult. So we need to talk to them, the players' movements need to be synchronised, there needs to be someone in the area when we are going forward. 'We tried to put in more players who were quick and agile but who have no defined position except when we don't have the ball. And we'll keep working on that, we'll test a few different ways of playing so that when we begin next year things will be much clearer.' He's back: Neymar returned to the action for Brazil and played the full 90 minutes against Ecuador . Floating: Diego Tardelli is to remain in his role of freedom in Brazil's attack, insists new manager Dunga . Although they qualified for the semi-finals - where they were hammered 7-1 by Germany - they rarely shone. Dunga called up 10 players who were at the World Cup to his first squad and his revolution, if it can be called that, looks more likely to be about tactics than personnel. He praised the new boys - Ricardo Goulart and Gil made their debuts against Ecuador - and promised continuity for next month's friendlies against Argentina and Japan. 'We played two good teams and when we were up against it the side grew in stature,' Dunga said. 'The team that wants to win has to know how to suffer, they need to be humble enough to run and to take advantage when they're on top. I think what was positive was the way that each of the players took their chance.' Dunga led Brazil in the 2010 World Cup but was fired after they were eliminated at the quarter-final stage by the Netherlands. His first competitive matches this time around will come in next year's Copa America in Chile. Better: Dunga won the match 1-0 against Ecuador as Brazil rebuild their confidence after a bad World Cup .","Brazil successfully tried playing without a designated striker and beat Ecuador 1-0 after shambolic World Cup on their home ground .

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . One 92-year-old man proves it's never too late to tell someone you love them. Last year, Howard Attebery of San Diego married Cynthia Riggs, the woman he spent a summer working with in 1950 and instantly fell in love with. The two never got together during that summer because Riggs had a boyfriend, but Atterbery continued to think about what could have been. They reconnected 62 years later when Attebery sent Riggs a love letter out of the blue. Now the husband and wife live together in Riggs' home on Martha's Vineyard, making up for lost time. Young love: 92-year-old Howard Attebery (left) and 82-year-old Cynthia Riggs (right) met in 1950 but never ended up dating. The two reconnected more than 60 years later when Attebery sent a coded love letter to his former crush. Pictured above at their wedding last year . Correspondence: Attebery and Riggs worked one summer in 1950 and would write notes to each other in the office in code, on sheets of paper towels. Attebery sent Riggs a letter in February 2012 in the same code, saying 'I have never stopped loving you' Age gap: Riggs (left) and Attebery (right) pictured around the time they met in 1950. Riggs was 18 and Attebery was 28 . However, Riggs was hesitant when she first received the love letter in February 2012. Popping the question: The couple met again in person in May 2012 and within an hour Attebery had asked Riggs to marry him. She agreed and they were married a year later (one of their two ceremonies pictures above) It was written in code and on paper towels, but she soon remembered the way she used to pass notes with Attebery that summer, when she worked at a geology lab sorting plankton. At the end of that first note, Attebery wrote that he had 'never stopped loving' Riggs, according to the Boston Globe. Unsure of what to think of the gesture after more than six decades apart, she showed the letter to her writing group who mostly agreed that it was romantic. So Riggs started writing Attebery as the two caught up on their lifetime apart. Both had married and had children, but ended up single. Riggs divorced her husband and father of her five children several decades ago. Attebery divorced his first wife and his second wife died. He worked as a microbiologist as well as a dentist and photographer. Before becoming a mystery novelist, Riggs worked as a science journalist, boat captain and was the seventh woman to set foot on the South Pole. They also talked about their first summer together, with Attebery revealing that he fell for Riggs from the first moment he saw her. She admits that she always thought of him as an older brother, since she was 18 at the time and he was 28. By May 2012, they both organized a trip to meet in person, with Riggs flying out to Southern California. But before the trip, Riggs expressed worry about whether he would be disappointed with her older body. 'Of course I remember the THEN Cynthia, but is it the NOW Cynner [her nickname] that is with me. You are the one,' Howie said. 'NOW is the person I love and not the shadow of the past . . . but she sure set the stage and what a beautiful introduction.' Happy ending: The couple now live together at Rigg's home on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts . Dedicated: The couple admit that their time together is limited, so they keep their romance alive with little gestures . Attebery met Riggs at the train station, holding a single red rose and within an hour, asked Riggs for her hand in marriage and she agreed. The next year, Attebery had moved out to Martha's Vineyard and the two were married in both a Buddhist and church ceremony. This summer they took a paddle-wheeler down the Mississippi River as a honeymoon. Since they are both getting on in years, they make sure to keep their relationship alive with little gestures, like Attebery writing 'I Love You' on his wife's banana peel for breakfast. 'We realize we have limited time,' Riggs told the Globe. 'It’s unrealistic to think too far ahead. And so all the things that would have bothered me as a young woman don’t bother me anymore.'","Cynthia Riggs, 82, and Howard Attebery, 92, met while working for a geology lab in the summer of 1950 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Taking up tango classes is the perfect way to rid yourself of anxiety, stress or depression, a new study shows. Just two weeks of lessons in the South American dance led to significant improvements in mood, researchers found. In a study published in the journal Music and Medicine, academics in Australia have shown that dancing the tango has significant health benefits for people experiencing mood disorders. Healthy: The study, published in the journal Music and Medicine, showed that dancing the tango has significant health benefits for people experiencing mood disorders . The authors wrote: ‘Participants showed significant reductions in depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Satisfaction with life and self-efficacy were significantly increased. ‘At one-month follow-up, depression, anxiety, and stress levels remained reduced. A brief  programme of tango dance was shown to be an effective strategy in alleviating mood disorders.’ The team at the University of New England in New South Wales and Australian National University in Canberra recruited 41 people with complaints of stress, anxiety and depression. Mood: The team at the University of New England in New South Wales and Australian National University in Canberra recruited 41 people with complaints of stress, anxiety and depression . The participants were aged from 18 to 73, mainly well-educated and 80 per cent were female. Clinical assessments were made to classify their symptoms as extremely severe, severe, moderate, mild or normal. Twenty participants then took eight tango sessions of 90 minutes each over a two-week period, while the 21 in the control group were put on a waiting list for classes. The assessments were conducted again at the end of the two weeks. Most tango participants showed clinically significant improvement in at least one area, whereas those on a waiting list were stable or became worse. Dancers also reported less insomnia and better general life satisfaction. One month later all 41 people were asked to complete the survey again and the results showed the tango’s benefits in reducing anxiety, stress and depression still remained. The benefits for insomnia and general life satisfaction did not, however, suggest longer courses might be needed for sustained effects in these areas. The authors said tango requires 'a strong connection' with a partner, synchronisation and improvisation. They said study feedback 'indicated that this activity helped the participants to focus on the present moment and mentally switch off from their feelings of stress and distress'. Another recent study, also by Australia’s University of New England and published in the British Journal of Visual Impairment, found that dancing the tango reduced depression, boosted self-esteem and improved balance in people with age-related macular degeneration.","Australian academics said the dance has significant health benefits .

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . Dubbed 'Kangaroo Dundee', Chris 'Brolga' Barnes has been saving orphaned kangaroo joeys in Outback Australia for the past nine years. While working as a tour guide in the Northern Territory, he realised that people in remote areas of Australia were looking for a place to take orphaned or injured animals, so he opened The Baby Kangaroo Rescue Centre. It was later redeveloped and expanded into the larger Kangaroo Sanctuary just outside of Alice Springs. Scroll down for video . Chris 'Brolga' Barnes hand rears orphaned kangaroo joeys at his Kangaroo Sanctuary in Alice Springs . Brolga is a true blue Aussie hero for saving native animals in the Alice Springs area . The little roo that inspired him to educate people and rescue other joeys was Palau, a joey that was left for dead on the side of the road. 'I was a tour guide at the time and I saw the roo on the road and I got off the bus to check it.  It was bloated and rotting, it'd been dead for a few days but there was still a joey barely alive in there,' Brolga told Daily Mail Australia. 'I called her Palau after the TV show Survivor, it was one of the tribes on there, I nursed her back to health and released her a year later.' The baby kangaroos are kept together to bond and form a mob so they can be released together . It was from that first rescue that Brolga began devoting his life to saving baby kangaroos. 'That motivated me to set up an education centre, because so many people drive past carcases not knowing that there could be a little joey inside that's still alive,' he said. He quickly discovered that The Baby Kangaroo Rescue Centre needed to be expanded, but he didn't have the funds, 'I had big dreams but no money!' 'I had a few kangaroos that had too many injuries to be released and the Northern Territory doesn't allow kangaroos as pets so they [the Northern Territory government]  were pushing me to find a place for them or to have them shot'. Chris was working two jobs in order to fund the sanctuary in Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, when a 'supportive uncle' left him an inheritance to build it. Brolga will often have a little joey tucked under his shirt in a little pouch to keep it warm . From there Brolga's Kangaroo Sanctuary has gone from strength to strength.  His efforts were even documented for a BBC TV show called 'Kangaroo Dundee' a spin off of Paul Hogan's 'Crocodile Dundee'. Kangaroo Dundee' was a two-part series about his story and life as a surrogate mother to so many baby joeys. A finalist in the Australian of the Year awards this year, says he's always had a passion for animals and became a zookeeper at the age of 17. 'Anyone can do it,' he said, 'All it takes is learning how and being committed.' His dedication goes above and beyond, as he often camps out with the roos in his sanctuary. Brolga makes sure the joeys grow up among other kangaroos and are released back into the wild once they are healthy . Brolga started the Kangaroo Sanctuary from scratch working two jobs to support his passion for saving baby kangaroos . Brolga's 36 hectare area of bushland homes 30 kangaroos of various ages. He tries to keep the bushland untouched so that the roos all feel like they are in a natural habitat before being released. For the young joeys he creates a faux pouch out of canvas bags and blankets or pillow cases. 'The babies need to be kept warm so they go everywhere I go' he said. Since opening in 2005, Brolga's Kangaroo Sanctuary has saved over 200 kangaroos . It's a full-time job, these baby kangaroos need 24 hour care . Brolga, a true Aussie hero hopes to build Central Australia’s first wildlife hospital on the grounds of his Sanctuary. 'It would be good to have a place where my mates who also care for orphaned joeys could get medical assistance for the babies without having to go to a vet where out of pocket costs fall on them' said Mr Barnes. 'It's a long-term goal but one that I am slowly working towards and it would really benefit us here.' To donate or to find out more about Brolga's sanctuary visit The Kangaroo Sanctuary. The joeys go where he goes. He becomes a surrogate mother to young joeys and needs to carry them as if they were in their mother's pouch .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pensioner has become the first to receive a 100th birthday congratulatory message from the Queen written in Welsh. Emrys Evans opened his card wishing him well on reaching the milestone on Wednesday as he celebrated with family and friends. The former farm worker and gardener struggles to understand English because he wears hearing aids and finds it much easier when people speak to him in Welsh, his first language. A 100-year-old man has received the first-ever congratulatory telegram from the Queen, pictured, written in Welsh . Mr Evans, who lives in a nursing home in St Asaph in Denbighshire, North Wales, said: ‘I was very pleased that the Queen’s card was written in Welsh.’ His son Elfed said that The Welsh Language Commissioner arranged for the card to be in Welsh after palace officials were initially reluctant. ‘We were a bit surprised that this was the first telegram to be written in Welsh,’ he added. At the time of the 2011 census there were 610 people in Wales aged 100 years or over and Rachel Stanyer who also lives in Trefnant celebrated her 105th birthday on Tuesday. Emrys Evans was born in the Chapel House in Prion, near Denbigh, and remembers collecting water from a well for his partially sighted mother. The centenarian, who has a daughter called Dilys, three grandchildren and four great grandchildren, said: 'I've never driven a car, or tractor, only horses and we would plough, harrow and sow the fields that way. 'The village had no pipeline and a man called T P Roberts had one built and then he opened a shop selling bread, only bread. 'Eventually he opened a bakery in Vale Road, Denbigh and that was where I had my first job delivering bread by bike. 'The first farm I worked on was called Pen Bryn Llwyn in Llanrhaedr but I worked on a lot of others. 'I worked as a gardener for Howell's School in Denbigh but was more of a weeder than a gardener.

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . A beetle that appears the whitest shade of white to the human eye has been examined by scientists. Researchers say that the scales on the Cyphochilus beetle can scatter light better than any other animal or plant. They believe its reflective coating could be copied to make brighter computer screens and paints as well as whiter paper. Researchers say that the scales on the Cyphochilus beetle (pictured) can scatter light better than any other animal or plant, making it an inspiration to scientists looking to develop new reflective materials . The beetle has developed its extraordinary whiteness to blend in with the white mushrooms common in its native South-East Asia. Another species called Lepidiota Stigma has the same pigmentation. Animals use a rainbow of colours for camouflage, communication, mating and to control their temperature. Pigments in their skin absorb certain wavelengths of light and reflect others - giving them a colour. So to appear the whitest shade of white, the beetles reflect all wavelengths of light equally. To appear the whitest shade of white, the beetles reflect all wavelengths of light equally. They do this using a specially-adapted internal structure (pictured) to make a reflective coating . The ultra-white Cyphochilus use the geometry of a dense network of chitin - a molecule which is found everywhere from the shells of mussels to the structure of mushrooms – to reflect light. A magnified image of the Lepidiota Stigma beetle, which has the same pigmentation, is pictured . The Gaboon pit viper has ultra-black markings to help it blend into the forest floor. Its black scales reflect less than 11 per cent of light, according to Nerdist, making it the 'blackest' of creatures. The snake is also the heaviest viper with the largest venomous fangs. But scientists have engineered a material that is blacker than the snake. British Firm Surrey Nanosystems claims to have created the 'blackest' material last month. Vantablack absorbs all but 0.04 per cent of light that hits it to give it its ultra-black appearance. The material is made from nanotubes that are 10,000 times thinner than a human hair. The tubes are packed so tightly together that entering light cannot pass through them and gets 'lost' inside them. The material could be used by the military and the space industry. The ultra-white Cyphochilus uses the geometry of a dense network of chitin - a molecule that is found everywhere from shells  to  mushrooms – to do this. Scientists at Cambridge University have shown that the beetles have optimised their internal structure to produce maximum ‘white’ with minimal material and effort. Scientists likened them to a painter who needs to whiten a wall with a very small quantity of paint. Lead researcher Dr Silvia Vignolini, of the University’s Cavendish Laboratory, said: ‘Current technology is not able to produce a coating as white as these beetles can in such a thin layer. ‘The lessons we are learning from these beetles is two-fold. ‘On one hand, we now know how to look to improve scattering strength of a given structure by varying its geometry. ‘On the other hand the use of strongly scattering materials, such as the particles commonly used for white paint, is not mandatory to achieve an ultra-white coating.’ Co-author on the study, Dr Matteo Burresi, of the Italian National Institute of Optics in Florence, said: ‘These scales have a structure that is truly complex since it gives rise to something that is more than the sum of its parts.’ In recent years, many engineers have been turning to nature to inspire ‘new’ types of structures. Using technology perfected by the beetles, scientists hope to make paper, plastics and paints a brighter white. They also believe that white-light reflectors inside computer and TV displays could also be made whiter and lighter, according to the study, which was published in the journal Scientific Report.

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . An RAC mechanic who was crushed by the Jaguar as he was worked underneath it was saved by a team of rugby players who were able to lift the one-tonne car off him. Jason Hutchings had raised the S-type car on a jack, only for the car to slip and pin him to the ground in the car park of Canterbury Rugby Club, Kent, leaving him unconscious with several broken bones. The father-of-two was only saved thanks to the members of the club who hauled the heavy car off him after the accident. Saved: RAC mechanic Jason Hutchings was crushed underneath a Jaguar he was working on, but was saved by rugby players who lifted the one-tonne car off the father-of-two, pictured with daughter Caitlin . Mr Hutchings, 38, fractured his vertebrae, broke several ribs and suffered multiple fractures of his collarbone when the car fell on top of him. He was airlifted to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, where he remains on oxygen a week later. 'Without the help of the guys at the rugby club I would be dead,' said Mr Hutchings. 'It was a big car - it must have weighed a tonne and I just thought they would never, ever be able to lift it off me, it was impossible. 'But they did and I am eternally grateful to them.' He added: 'All I remember is thinking there is no way I'm going to get out of this. I thought 'that's it, it's over'. Scene: Mr Hutchings was fixing the Jaguar in the car park of Canterbury Rugby Club when it fell on him . 'I don't believe it was a fault with the equipment. It was just one of those things. I'll go back to work but I'll just be a bit more conscious about what I am doing.' Mr Hutchings had been using a locking trolley jack, axl stand and wheel chock to support the car, but it had slipped off the jack. He said: 'It's one of those things, the car slipped off the jack, it was on a slope. It was not me being incompetent nor was it an equipment fault, it can happen to anyone.' Mr Hutchings hopes to be discharged from hospital this weekend and back home in Faversham, with wife Karen, 40, and their daughters Caitlin, six, and Morgan, four. And after working for the RAC for nearly nine years, he says the experience will not put him off returning to work. 'I just want to thank everyone for their help. I wouldn't be here without them all,' he said. Rugby club chairman Giles Hilton said: 'It's pretty fortunate that we were there. 'We'll have to remind any future RAC workmen to only come on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when the players are training. 'But jokes aside, we are very pleased with the actions the guys took, and presumably it was those actions that saved this man's life. Car: Mr Hutchings was pinned to the ground by the Jaguar S-type car, similar to the one pictured . 'I am incredibly proud of the club and the swift move that members took to make sure this man survived.' RAC spokesman Pete Williams also thanked the players on behalf of the roadside recovery service. 'We are very grateful to members of the club and the public who helped and actually lifted the vehicle off the patrolman,' he said. 'Our thoughts are with him and his family and we are providing every support. A full investigation into the incident is under way.' The Health and Safety Executive said it will also be investigating the incident.","Jason Hutchings, 38, was working underneath S-type car when it fell .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Driving in thick fog can be rather unnerving, with it being difficult to see other cars in the low visibility conditions. But a new heads-up-display (HUD) for cars could alleviate these concerns by showing the position of other cars on the windscreen. The fighter-jet-style display can alert drivers to other cars in dense fog and other extreme weather conditions - and this could help avoid a collision. Researchers at Glasgow Caledonian University have developed a smart heads-up-display for cars (shown). It can alert drivers to other cars on the road in poor weather conditions . The display is being developed at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU). A photorealistic 3D model of a BMW 5 Series car has been developed for accommodating the HUD interface and to enhance the realism of the simulation. The driving simulator allows the user to drive in clear conditions and thick fog, clearly illustrating the requirement for HUD interfaces to display information which the driver no longer has access to when driving ‘blind’. More than 150 user trials have already been performed during the evaluation of the different iterations of the innovative HUD interface. This presents significantly improved response times for a large variety of everyday drivers and reduced the rear collision probability under low visibility by 70 per cent on average. It is the work of Professor Vassilis Charissis and his team, based in the Virtual Reality and Simulation Laboratory (VRS Lab). The display has been developed and evaluated in a 3D driving simulator, which allows ‘drivers’ to navigate a perfectly recreated stretch of the M8, M74 and M80 motorways in a choice of conditions. One of the options lets the driver tackle the motorways in dense fog, before giving them the chance to drive the same stretch again using the HUD. When started, the windscreen of the car highlights where other vehicles are on the motorway within a range of 1,300ft (400 metres) and even lets the driver know when it’s safe to change lanes. It's hoped that the display will eventually be used in the windscreens of real cars to help drivers see other vehicles on the road under low visibility conditions. Further testing will need to be carried out before the technology is available to the public. The display is being tested in a 3D simulation of a BMW 5 Series car. This allows drivers to navigate recreated motorways in various weather. It could be used in both civilian and emergency services vehicles in future . ‘Driving is a demanding psychomotor activity which can be significantly hampered by adverse weather conditions,’ said Professor Charissis. ‘Drivers’ spatial and situational awareness suffers in such conditions, as neighbouring vehicles and other objects can be hard to see and avoid. 'Being able to see clearly obstacles on the road while driving, despite visual restrictions such as thick fog, is important to avoid collisions. ‘[HUDs] are a potential solution to this problem as they can provide the user with information directly in the field of view, allowing the driver to remain focused on the road. 'The HUD system projects crucial information on the windscreen, using augmented digital input to enhance the real environment. 'The presented data can provide notification of road markings, the proximity of neighbouring vehicles and warnings of traffic congestion to enhance human responses and improve driving safety.'","Researchers at Glasgow Caledonian University have developed a smart heads-up-display for cars .

"By . Mark Prigg . The man behind Apple's maps software has been sacked in a major restructuring of the computer giant's executives after he refused to apologise for its Maps software. Scott Forstall, a long-time lieutenant of late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, was asked to leave following years of friction with other top executives and his recent refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of the Apple's much-criticized mapping software, people familiar with the situation said. Sources said Forstall refused to sign a public apology after Apple's mapping product, which displaced the popular Google Maps on the iPhone and the iPad in September, contained embarrassing errors and drew fierce criticism. Scott Forstall was asked to leave Apple after reports he refused to take responsibility for its map debacle . Instead, CEO Tim Cook signed the letter last month. Forstall will leave the company next year, Apple said in a statement. It also confirmed that John Browett, who was hired as the . company's retail chief just seven months ago after serving as CEO of . U.K. electronics retailer Dixon's, will also leave Apple. The UK executive was Mr Cook's first major appointment and, when his recruitment was announced in January, said that Mr Browett had a commitment to customer service ""'like no one else we've met.' Mr Browett, who relocated to California in April for the job, was awarded a $56m (£36m) 'golden hello' for joining Apple. The payment, due to be made over five years, dwarfed the £1m pay package he collected for running Dixons. His efforts to improve profits at the . stores had alienated employees and sources close to Apple said Cook had . concluded he was simply the wrong person for the job. 'These changes show that Tim Cook is . stamping his authority on the business,' said Ben Wood, analyst with . CCS Insight, said. 'Perhaps disappointed with the Maps issues, Forstall . became the scapegoat.' A retail high-flier credited with reviving the fortunes of PC World and Currys, former Dixons boss John Browett today left the technology giant in a shock exit that comes after he joined in April to head up its global store chain. Mr Browett relocated to California and was reportedly awarded a ""golden hello"" package worth up to 56 million US dollars (£36 million) to drive expansion of Apple's shop portfolio as senior vice president of retail. He was seen as being one of Apple chief executive Tim Cook's key hires and was described by him at the time as having commitment to customer service ""like no one else we've met"". But it is understood Mr Browett, who joined Dixons at the end of 2007 and overhauled the business following a period of under-performance, caused a backlash among employees by trying to cut back hours and staff numbers, before the group quickly reversed the changes. The executive changes are the biggest at Apple in more than a decade, and mark the first major move by Cook to shape his own management team since Jobs' death a year ago. While Apple has enjoyed enormous success since Cook took the helm, recent stumbles including the Maps debacle and several earnings disappointments have underscored the long-term challenges the company faces in retaining its dominance in the smartphone and tablet markets. In Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics, Apple faces an array of powerful competitors who are determined to own a piece of the exploding mobile-computing market. 'Competition is moving much faster to be more Apple-like,' said Tim Bajarin, president of technology research and consulting firm Creative Strategies. The executive changes hand substantially more responsibility to Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's celebrated industrial design chief, who will now oversee both hardware and software design. Sir Jonathan Ive: The British born designer now oversees the look and feel of Apple's hardware and software . Eddy Cue, a long-serving executive who runs online products, will take charge of Apple Maps and the Siri voice search software. Craig Federighi, who oversees the OSX software that powers the Macintosh computers, will take charge of the iOS software. Putting the mobile and personal . computer software teams together under Federighi could improve . operations within the company, particularly as the capabilities and . features of smartphones and PCs increasingly converge, said analysts. Ive, now responsible for design across . all products, has played a key role in Apple's success by imbuing its . gadgets with a distinct look and feel. BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis said . Ive could now help reinvigorate the look of Apple's software, which . has been slow to evolve. 'If you have two different heads, you have two different fiefdoms,' he said. The retail stores will report directly to Cook while a search is conducted for a new head of the division. Shares of Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company by market value, have declined 14 percent in the past month since reaching a 52-week high of $705.07 in September. Apple's maps was plagued with problems . People with knowledge of Apple's . inner workings said Scott Forstall's departure was years in the making, and . came to a head with the Apple Maps incident. A 15-year veteran of the company, . Forstall was once considered a possible CEO candidate and is credited . with playing a central role in making the iPhone and the iPad two of the . most successful consumer electronics products ever. But Forstall was also considered a . hard person to work with, and he alienated other senior executives with . his abrasive style, one person familiar with the situation said. This person added that once Jobs passed away, Forstall was left with few defenders at the top of the company. The fate of the executive, who had . 1,000 people directly reporting to him, was sealed by the Maps debacle. Even after a public uproar over the shortcomings and widespread calls . for Apple to revert to Google Maps, Forstall would not acknowledge the . gravity of the problem, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Forstall instead likened the situation . to the complaints over the antenna in an earlier iPhone and insisted it . would blow over without a public mea culpa, the source said. But Cook . disagreed, and issued a public apology with his own signature on it . after Fortstall would not go along, the source added. Apple described Monday's moves as a . way to increase 'collaboration' across its hardware, software and . services business. Forstall will serve as an advisor to Cook until his . departure.","Scott Forstall asked to leave after refusing to take responsibility for maps problems .

"By . Darren Boyle . A killer who strangled his teenage girlfriend after she told him she was pregnant had earlier killed a cat and left its severed head on an ex-girlfriend's pillow. Ben Blakeley, who was jailed for life for the murder of Jayden Parkinson, spotted his then girlfriend talking to a male friend and accused her of sleeping around. The 22-year-old killer flew into a violent rage before attacking the cat with a knife. Jayden Parkinson, left, was murdered by Ben Blakeley, right, just hours after the teenager told her violent and abusive boyfriend that she was expecting her first child on December 3, 2013 . Ms Parkinson, pictured, was due to give birth this week according to her mother Samantha Shrewsbury . The un-named girl said: 'This man is pure evil. Once, he saw me chatting to a man in a local shopping centre and confronted me later at my home.' The girl said she tried to convince Blakeley that the man was simply a school friend but the killer could not be convinced. She said: 'He ran out into the street and picked up a neighbour's cat and raced upstairs into my bedroom. When I ran up after him he had killed the cat with a kitchen knife and cut the bloody head off and left it on my bed.' Blakeley told the girl that he killed the cat because she had been sleeping around. She told the Daily Star Sunday that she was lucky not to have been killed herself. However, she did not report the cat killing to the police because she was afraid of Blakeley's reaction. Ms Parkinson's mother Samantha Shrewsbury, 47, said she hopes Blakeley dies in prison as her daughter was due to give birth this week. She said that Blakeley groomed her daughter with a range of gifts, many of them stolen. Ms Shrewsbury said that once Blakeley had seduced her daughter, he became violent and controlling. Three of Blakeley's ex girlfriends told the court that he was violent and abusive towards them during their relationships. Jayden's mother Samantha Shrewsbury said she wished she had pushed Blakeley down the steps from her flat as her daughter might still be alive . Ms Shrewsbury said she tried to split up the couple and get her daughter to return home to Didcot. She told The Sunday People: 'We had a stand-off once when he went to pull this screwdriver he had and I dared him. 'I told him I would charge him and take him down the steps from the top floor of our flat, which shut him up. He was your typical cowardly bully. 'But I wish to God I had pushed him down those stairs because maybe Jayden would still be here. Oxford Crown Court heard that Blakeley smoked cannabis almost daily from the age of 11. He told one prison officer 'I'm a celebrity now miss' after spotting a story about him on the television news. Blakeley killed Ms Parkinson on December 3, 2013 and initially dumped her body in a countryside ditch. He later moved her, digging up his uncle's grave in Didcot, Oxfordshire, dumping her body inside the grave. Ms Parkinson was last seen on CCTV on the night she went missing. A jury at Oxford Crown Court yesterday found Blakeley guilty of murder following a five-week trial by a majority decision of 11-1 after more than 20 hours of deliberations. Blakeley, of Reading, Berkshire, had denied murdering Jayden but admitted her manslaughter. The court heard how he was obsessive and controlling and threatened to post intimate videos and photographs of Jayden on Facebook after their break up, hoping she would kill herself as a result. His brother, Jake Blakeley, 17, admitted a charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice by helping to dig the grave in which Jayden was later buried. The jury of six men and six women was dismissed today having failed to reach a verdict on whether Jake Blakeley, of Didcot, prevented a lawful burial for Jayden. The judge said: ‘On December 3 you took Jayden Parkinson, a complicated but loving and vulnerable 17-year-old girl into open countryside near Upton in the dark of an early winter’s evening, you murdered her by strangulation.’ The judge said that his ‘unreasonably jealous’ treatment of Jayden had involved ‘physical and emotional abuse’ during their relationship. ‘You dominated and controlled her daily life,’ the judge said. ‘You removed her phone so she couldn’t contact others and when she was at the hostel you demanded that she stayed in her room even to the extent of forbidding her from using the toilet, forcing her to urinate in a plastic bottle. ‘Jayden was infatuated with you, her violent abuser, and found it difficult to separate emotionally from you.’ The judge said Jayden finally plucked up the courage to end the relationship in November last year, with Blakeley threatening to pose intimate photographs online to ‘humiliate’ her. ‘Unfortunately she discovered that she was pregnant and you were the father,’ the judge said. ‘Being a decent young woman she wished to inform you of that fact.’ The jury at Oxford Crown Court were shown CCTV images of Ms Parkinson and Blakeley, both circled, walking through Oxford train station on the last day that the pregnant teenager was last seen alive . The judge said the pregnancy was the only reason Jayden met Blakeley on December 3. ‘At the time you were in my judgement consumed with anger having found out that Jayden had been intimate with another young man after she had broken off her relationship with you,’ he said. The judge said Blakeley murdered Jayden without thinking of the possibility she could be carrying his unborn child. Police used CCTV in a bid to trace Ms Parkinson's movements in the hours before her death . The judge told Blakeley: ‘You first concealed her body in a ditch. It is clear that you later decided to move her body. ‘In the early hours of the morning of December 9 2013 you returned to the ditch and dug up Jayden Parkinson’s body. ‘You then crammed the mortal remains of poor Jayden into a suitcase. ‘You then persuaded an unwitting taxi driver to transfer her body to All Saints’ Church in Didcot. ‘You had dug a grave for Jayden over the interred body of your Uncle Alan. ‘To your twisted mind you might have thought a graveyard was a better place for Jayden to be buried than a ditch in a field but there was no respect or remorse in this hasty interment.’ The judge said Jayden’s father had died shortly before the trial and must have been ‘haunted’ by what Blakeley had done. He said Blakeley had caused upset to the priest, congregation and family members of those buried in the graveyard by the ‘sacrilege done there’. Blakeley decided to dump Ms Parkinson's body in his uncle's grave in All Saints' Church in Didcot, pictured . The judge also jailed Blakeley for eight years for attempting to pervert the course of justice, to run concurrently with his murder sentence. Members of Jayden’s family shouted ‘See you in hell’ as he was led to the cells. Emotional victim impact statements from Jayden Parkinson's family were read to the court, describing how her murder has affected them. Jayden's mother Samantha Shrewsbury, wept as her lengthy statement was read, detailing how her family's lives had been ‘changed forever’. ‘Jayden was not only my youngest child but also my best friend,’ she said. ‘The day I had to attend the John Radcliffe hospital mortuary to identify the remains of my beloved daughter will remain sealed in my memory until the end of my days on this earth. ‘The sight of Jayden's bruised and battered beautiful face is an image that can never be erased from my mind.’ Ms Shrewsbury said the impact of her daughter's death had left her contemplating suicide, but the support of her family helped her make it through the days. ‘I am mentally and physically exhausted,’ she said, stating that her weight had dropped to below seven stone. ‘The only solace I can find is to keep a diary and write to Jayden about how my day has been, mostly about how much I love and miss her and the girly chats and fun which we used to share,’ she said. ‘I know she will never be here with me to tell her about my day or to tell her how much I love and miss her. ‘When I visit Jayden's grave it breaks my heart to not be able to hold Jayden safe in my arms, take her home with me and tell her how much I love her, in order to lay Jayden to rest and knowing that I will never be able to see her in a wedding dress and to have children of her own to love and cherish. ‘My family had to choose a dress for her to be buried in yet we will never be able to see her happy and smiling in that dress.’ Blakeley and his brother Jake dug up their uncle Alan's grave before dumping Ms Parkinson in the hole . Before her murder, Ms Parkinson, pictured here on CCTV, arranged to meet Blakeley to tell him about the baby . Ms Shrewsbury described how the ‘evil person’ who took Jayden was still able to breathe and eat three meals a day. ‘The thought and reality that I and my family will never be able to celebrate birthdays, Easters, Christmases with Jayden and take her to the music festival I promised her for her 18th fills me with deep sadness,’ she added. ‘Nothing will be able to remove the anger and heartbreak that fill my life every waking day.’ Ms Shrewsbury said she was haunted by questions of whether her daughter was ‘crying out for help’ or ‘aware her life was being taken’ during her murder. ‘I and Jayden's family cannot and never will find any forgiveness,’ she said. Jayden's sister, Shardy George, also submitted a victim impact statement to the court. ‘There isn't a day that goes by I don't think of Jayden but I don't get upset anymore,’ she said. ‘Instead I think of the good times we had. Although my heart aches my face smiles. Ben Blakeley has done enough to my family without ruining my happiness. ‘I won't give him the satisfaction. When he took my sister's life he didn't just take her life and that of her unborn child, he ripped our family and community apart.’","Ben Blakeley severed a cat's head after a row with a former girlfriend .

After announcing that the world's most expensive new car was going on sale, the London dealership displaying it spent £3,000 making sure every inch of its lacquer coat was perfect. Scroll down for video . Two Topaz experts buffer the Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse worth £2.1million in the Jack Barclay Showroom in Mayfair . The vehicle was shipped from Shanghai to the Jack Barclay showroom in Mayfair, west London, after being showcased at events around the world. To give it a 'shake down' ahead of sale, they brought in Topaz Detailing to give its carbon fibre and polished aluminium body new finish. Experts spent more than eight hours forensically examining the car with a microscope to pinpoint even the tiniest imperfection. Using an ultrasonic depth measurement gauge, they assessed the depth of each layer of the vehicle’s paint, which is made up of primer, paint and lacquer. After studying the scans on a laptop, they then remove the scratches and impurities in a process known as paint correction, using electronic buffing tools. Using the finest grades of polish, they scanned and polished until all of the scratches and impurities in that section were removed before moving on to the next part. The car, which has a top speed of 255mph is one of the fastest in the world as well as being the priciest . The process begins by covering the car's wheels with protective plastic before specialists get to work . The Topaz Detailing staff use paper tape to cover the vehicle's headlights and bonnet rim . The full Topaz Detailing treatment costs between £2,500 and £3,000 and can take up to eight hours .

The experts then study the images from the device to identify the tiniest of imperfections on the car's finish . After examining the car in small sections the analysts can identify how where to polish it without causing damage to its paint . Two of the Topaz Detailing experts examine images from the microscope on a laptop before polishing the car . The service, which sometimes takes more than 60 hours, typically costs between £2,500 and £3,000 plus VAT, but is vital when dealing with a car worth more than £2 million. Derek Bennett, general manager of the the Jack Barclay showroom, said: 'I have never seen anything like it. For the price of the Topaz Detailing polish, you could put your car through a standard car wash 6,000 times . Two Honda Jazz 2004 models would cost less at £1,425 each on Autotrader . A Peugot 1.07 0.9l engine could be filled more than 75 times for the same amount . Two tickets on the Silver VIP Terrace at the 2015 F1 Monaco Grand Prix would cost less at £1,303 each . 'It is amazing what they have done. We are absolutely delighted with what they have done. 'Jack Barclay has a long and rich history in selling some of the most exotic and finest supercars in the world. 'For many of our customers perfection is the only goal. Everything associated with the car from the factory to the detailers meets exacting standards only achievable through carefully selected partners such as Topaz. 'Our showroom is literally a motor show, everyday our cars must shine spotlessly and fit the vision our customers had when they first dreamt of supercar ownership. 'Attention to detail is a statement of intent, that we will deliver on our promise of being the finest Bugatti retailer in the world. 'Bugatti detailers polish and finish their cars by human eye, but Topaz use a digital scanner to seek out areas so microscopic that only the final polishing effect of these marginal gains can be appreciated as a whole once the car is complete.' While it may seem like a lengthy process the cars at the showroom have to be at their best at all times, says manager Jack Barclay . The service is a 'must' for any car worth more than £2million according to the Jack Barclay showroom . Once the tiny imperfections are identified the experts can get to work buffering the carbon-fibre exterior of the car . The vehicle was brought to the UK after being showcased at car events all over the world . As good as new: Following the eight hour clean the car gleams in the windows of the London showroom . A manager at the Jack Barclay showroom, which is home to some of the most exquisite cars in the world, described the process as 'amazing' Mazin Naamo, director at Topaz Detailing said he was thrilled to have worked with the car. 'It really gives us a sense of achievement to work with what is probably the most exclusive dealership in the world and with one of the last Veyrons that may ever be made.' Mr Naamo described the company as cosmetic enhancement specialists for anyone who cares about the way their car looks. 'Our service caters to everyone you don't have to have a Bugatti. 'It is for people who are passionate about the way their cars look, paying for them to look a certain way and maintain it. 'It's like consulting a specialist doctor - we're paint specialists and everything to do with the cosmetics of the car. We are cosmetic enhancement specialists, we know how to bring up the paint work on specialist materials to make it look brand new or better.' Mr Naamo added the technologies used on the Bugatti were the company's 'secret'. 'Every buffer pad has a different density and a different abrasion level. It also has a different backing plate so the combinations that we have to work out in terms of machine, pad and compound combination - you're talking hundreds of possibilities. 'That's where our experience comes in, that's our secret.'","The Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse is the world's most expensive car .

"By . Sarah Dean . Disgraced former NRL star Todd Carney has been partying with convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby and her sister Michelle in Bali, a photo posted on social media shows. In the snap, the sacked Cronulla Sharks player has his tattooed arms draped over the sisters' shoulders and a big smile on his face. Corby, 37, was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of cannabis to Indonesia. And 29-year-old Carney has escaped Australia after his 'bubbling' scandal, which showed the sportsman urinating into his own mouth in a lewd photograph taken in a hotel toilet. Trio: Todd was photographed partying with Schapelle Corby who was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago, and her sister Mercedes last week . The 'bubbling' photo was and leaked on social media and led to him being sacked from his team. Corby lives with her sister in Kuta, Bali, where Carney is currently holidaying. Just three months after being released from jail she got back together with her Indonesian boyfriend Ben Panangian, who supported her while she was locked-up. It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island. 'Toddy and me post bubble!': A fan posted photos of himself with Todd Carney on Instagram during a night out at Alleycats bar in Katu, Bali. Bryson McNeill said Carney asked him what he did and brushed off his own troubles . Schapelle Corby is on parole after being released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison in February this year. This photo shows her in 2005 before her trial for drug smuggling . On 16 July, Carney first graced his social media accounts since his spectacular exit from the sport. He was all smiles with former Cronulla Sharks teammate Wade Graham, as the pair caught up mid-week for a sweet treat. He captioned a photo: 'Always good company and laugh with this frick @wadegraham17 #waffles #yogurberry,' All smiles: Sacked NRL star Todd Carney has graced his social media accounts for the first time since his spectacular exit from the sport last month, with teammate Wade Graham . Fans were supportive of Carney's return to social media, sending him well wishes, with one saying: 'Good on ya @tcarney86 bounce back bigger and better,' while another posed the question on everyone's lips: 'What are u going to do now after that thing u did @tcarney86.' Carney's sacking followed years of controversy including run-ins with police and NRL officials. In 2009, a full-frontal naked photo of Carney appeared on a rental phone in Canberra. The telephone company apologised after a woman found the images on a phone she was loaned by a Telstra Shop while her handset was being repaired. Career breaker: Todd cut a far different figure to that when he hit the headlines more than a month ago amidst his 'bubbling' scandal . In 2006, while playing with the Canberra Raiders, he was charged with drink driving and lost his license for five years. He was later caught driving while disqualified and failed to stop for police, which resulted in his being sentenced to community service. He allegedly urinated on a man in a Canberra nightclub in 2008. Later that year he was de-registered and banned from playing in the NRL competition until 2010 due to his on-going string of alcohol-related incidents.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Back in the day: Holder has repeatedly spoken publicly about his involvement in the protest but he never mentioned anything about weapons . Attorney General Eric Holder may have been armed when he and some fellow Columbia University students occupied an abandoned school office and demanded that it be rededicated to Malcolm X. Conservative news site The Daily Caller reported that when he was a sophomore at the Ivy League school, a then-20-year-old Holder was an active member of the Student Afro-American Society who fittingly sported a similar hair style at the time. They cite old student archives which allege that Holder and his fellow protestors were 'armed' when they took control of the then-abandoned office space that had previously been used to house the campus chapter of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. Holder's involvement in the protest is undisputed, and The New York Times reported in 2009 that Holder was recruited by upperclassmen to participate in the five-day occupation. In their report, however, the students were 'armed with pillowcases and sheets'. The Times also contradicts the Daily Caller report, saying that Holder was a freshman and not a sophomore at the time of the occupation, and says that it took place in 1969 rather than 1970. Holder's close college friend Steve Sims confirmed in both the New York Times article and a GQ profile that both he and Holder participated in the protest, but in neither did he mention weapons. The Daily Caller's report does not specify what weapons they believe Holder and his compatriots held during the sit-in, but they imply that their tools were more dangerous than simply bedding. The website credits the weapons claim to the Columbia Black Student's Organization, which has since taken over for the Student Afro-American Society. They say that on BSO website, the occupiers were 'armed' during the raid, but that portion of the BSO website is not readily available. Politically active: In the early 1970s, racial tensions were rife both on and off Columbia's campus (pictured recently) Similar stories: Holder graduated from Columbia years before Obama and Obama supposedly spent many hours in the Malcolm X lounge that Holder helped rededicate to the black leader . MailOnline contacted the Department of Justice's press office about the claims and has yet to receive a response. Racial tensions were rife both on and off the pristine grounds of the New York campus at the time of the protest, and the student group decided to take over the unused space so that it could be rededicated as a place for students of color to meet. In a recent biography of President Obama, who went on to study at the same university years after Holder had graduated, author David Maraniss reports that a young Mr Obama spent many hours in the Malcolm X lounge. Even though university officials initially decried their actions as they went against the school's rules, given the circumstances, they found it appropriate to rename the space the Malcolm X Liberation Center and declined to press any punitive charges against the students involved. The timing of this new allegation of Holder's involvement with weapons comes just one month after he was cleared of any wrong doing in the Operation Fast and Furious scandal, where one ATF officer died as a result of a failed gun trafficking plot.","As a college student, Eric Holder participated in a protest where dozens took over an empty office space in hopes of turning it into a black student lounge .

"By . Steve Hopkins for MailOnline . and Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . Islamist militias have seized control of Libya's main airport, setting planes and surrounding buildings ablaze. The group called Dawn of Libya, consisting mainly of fighters from Misrata, captured the major foothold in Tripoli at the weekend from a rival faction from Zintan in western Libya. It followed weeks of fierce fighting. The group said it has also taken hold of other locations in the capital controlled by rival militias. Scroll down for video . Islamist group Dawn of Libya captured Libya's main airport in Tripoli over the weekend and set planes and terminal buildings on fire . Dawn militants sit in a truck mounted with anti-aircraft guns at the gate of Tripoli International Airport on Sunday . The fight has largely destroyed the . airport and scarred the capital, prompting diplomats, foreign nationals . and thousands of Libyans to flee. Fire destroyed the terminal at the airport on Sunday, but it was unclear who had burned it. Supporters of the rival factions took to social media to accuse each other. In the campaign to overthrow Gaddafi, fighters from Zintan and Misrata were comrades-in-arms. But they later fell out. The violence in Libya is rooted in the empowerment of militias. Successive transitional governments since the 2011 ousting of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi depended on them to maintain order in the absence of a strong police force or a unified military. These forces receive state salaries and wear uniforms, they report in practice to their own commanders and towns. The attack comes as part of a backlash by Islamist factions after losing their power in parliament following June elections and in the face of a campaign by a renegade military general against extremist Islamic militias in Benghazi, Libya's second-largest city. But this has been the worst bout of violence in the battle over turf and influence since 2011. Mysterious airstrikes have struck the positions of Islamist militias, with accusations by the groups that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, who oppose Islamists in the region, were behind them. Wrecked: The passenger terminal of Tripoli international airport . A severely damaged plane at Tripoli International Airport . The fighting on the ground has mirrored a political stand-off between Islamists and the outgoing parliament they controlled, and anti-Islamist groups who control the newly elected parliament. Each considers the other illegitimate. Libya now faces the prospect of two competing parliaments. In a challenge to a parliament elected on June 25, a Dawn of Libya spokesman called for the old General National Congress, set up after the fall of Gaddafi, to be reinstated. The Misrata forces have rejected the new House of Representatives, where liberals and lawmakers campaigning for a federalist system have made a strong showing. The parliament has declared Dawn of Libya as well as militant Islamists like the Ansar al-Sharia as 'terrorist groups'. Muslim Brotherhood party member Amina al-Mahjoub, a former national congress member, told Reuters the congress would reconvene on Monday morning. 'It is not clear if the meeting will be consultative or we grant legitimacy to the rebels,' he said. The House of Representatives, which has fled to Tobruk in the east with senior officials to escape the fighting, had asked Haftar to fight the Operation Dawn forces. Haftar launched a campaign against Islamists in the eastern city of Benghazi in May and threw his weight behind the Zintan fighters. Islamist militias also controlled an air defence base near the city's international airport, a security official said.

"By . Associated Press . Conrad Hilton suffered major injuries when he lost control of his BMW and crashed on a highway near Palm Springs on Saturday, authorities said today. Paris Hilton's 19-year-old brother was taken from the accident scene to Desert Regional Medical Center.  His current condition is unknown, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Daniel Hesser said on Tuesday . Authorities said Hilton was speeding shortly after midday when he tried to change lanes and hit a Volkswagen. Cops said he then lost control of his car and crashed into a tractor trailer. Paris Hilton's younger brother Conrad, pictured in May at LAX, was involved in a major car crash in Palm Springs on Saturday . Firefighters used the jaws of life to pull Hilton from his vehicle. Police determined that alcohol or drugs were not factors in the collision. Hesser said the CHP received reports about a reckless driver before the crash occurred, but officers were not in pursuit at the time. A CHP helicopter crew witnessed the crash. According to TMZ, Hilton reportedly skimmed the back of another car when he tried to change lanes, which caused him to hit the back of a tractor trailer before he came to a stop at the side of the road. MailOnline has contacted Hilton's representative for comment. This isn't Hilton's first brush with the law. In 2011, he crashed into two parked cars in Los Angeles after a night out in West Hollywood. The following year, he was arrested after testing positive for marijuana, which was reportedly a violation of the terms of his probation for a previous marijuana arrest. Conrad is the younger brother of socialite Paris and the great-grandson of hotel baron Conrad Hilton. The siblings are pictured in LA in 2009 .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been voted Australia's most popular politician ahead of 18 other male members of the Government. The only woman of the 19-member team of cabinet ministers was rated number one ahead of Malcolm Turnbull, second, with Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey finishing in 14th  and 19th place respectively. The survey of 1004 Australian voters was conducted by McNair Ingenuity Research just before the first anniversary of the Abbott government's election victory. Participants were asked to rank each minister on a scale of 100 for excellent, 75 for good, 50 for average, 25 for poor or zero for terrible. Ms Bishop, who finished with the top score of 57.6, said she was delighted by the result but considered the efforts of her 'team' was what contributed to her top place. 'I'm delighted to be considered in that light, but let's focus on the team effort,' Ms Bishop told AAP on Tuesday. 'Our team have been delivering on those core promises that we took to the last election.' Malcolm Turnbull was the crowd favourite when the survey was carried out six months ago, but the communications minister had to settle for second best this time. Ms Bishop has been far more prominent at home and abroad this year, most notably spearheading Australia's campaign at the United Nations to condemn the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17. Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott slipped in the placings, while Christopher Pyne, left, finished second last . She has been tipped by pundits and party insiders as a future Liberal prime minister. Current Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, who have both been dealing with fallout from an unpopular May Budget, polled 39.1 and 32.1 respectively. Mr Hockey dropped from third-most-popular position in the previous survey in December, while Mr Abbott slipped slightly lower than his result in the previous poll. The McNair first-year scorecard, conducted between 27 and 30 August, involved a 'nationally representative' selection of members of an online panel, the company said. It said the results were weighted to population statistics by age, gender and location. The lead researcher, Matt Balogh, said it was not surprising that ministers were more well known to the public now than at the time of the last survey, taken at the 100-day mark of the government. 'In both cases we actually asked people whether they felt they knew each politician well enough to rate them and the ratings are only taken amongst people who said they knew that person well enough,' he said. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison polled in third position behind Malcolm Turnbull .","Researchers McNair Ingenuity polled 1004 voters in August survey .

Mrs Suwyn rushed out of the car after parking, since she needed to use the restroom, and went about her day under the impression she took Skyah out of the car and put her down for nap as usual.

"By . Sally Lee for Daily Mail Australia . The mother of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby has denied her daughter is in a relationship with an Indonesia man who has been arrested for drug possession. It was revealed on Friday, Corby's boyfriend Ben Panagian was allegedly caught with marijuana after he was searched on a Bali street on August 20 and later found more in his wardrobe. The 32-year-old faces a maximum of 12 years in prison if he is found guilty, the Herald Sun reported. Scroll down for video . Schapelle Corby's boyfriend has been charged by Indonesian police after he was allegedly caught in possession of drugs in Bali . Schapelle Corby was released from a Bali jail in February after serving nine years for drug smuggling . Indonesian police allege Ben Panangian was in possession of marijuana . Rosleigh Rose told Nine News was not aware of the specifics of the charge. But she was adamant that 'Ben [was] not Schapelle's boyfriend'. 'They know each other, that's it,' Ms Rose said. Her denial comes despite Corby and Panagian being linked as early as 2006 after meeting in jail while both were serving time for drug offences, according to The Australian Women's Weekly. As Corby is only free on parole in Bali under the condition that she stay away from drugs and crime, she is expected to receive a severe warning and will be monitored more strictly. Panangian first met Corby behind bars while he was serving time in jail . Police on Friday said they had no plans to investigate Corby because the pair's relationship is unclear. Panangian, who's previously been locked up for drug charges, was arrested in Nusa Dua at about 6pm with two packages of marijuana. Police said they seized a total of nine grams of cannabis and arrested him under the name Bernanrd P. Simanjunta. Witnesses confirmed the man was Corby's boyfriend. Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana to Indonesia. The 37-year-old got back with her Indonesian boyfriend who supported her while she was locked-up a couple of months after her release from jail, Daily Mail Australia reported in July. The two reportedly met when they were both inmates serving time in prison. Corby was released from a Bali jail in February after serving nine years for drug smuggling. Parole board boss Ketut Artha says officers will now watch the convicted drug smuggler more closely. He may also personally warn her about the company she is keeping - but he won't revoke her parole. 'With this case, we will tighten supervision for her,' he said on Friday. 'We will also warn her and visit her more often. 'Early next month she is due to report [to the parole office] and we will warn her.' Corby's parole officer also said she never mentioned a boyfriend in her counselling sessions.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Police called out to investigate strange noises coming from an abandoned house in south-western Mexico were shocked to find a caged tiger inside. Officers called to the property in the town of Chilapa de Alvarez, in the state of Guerrero, found that the house was completely empty, with no evidence of anyone living there. But after hearing noises coming from one of the rooms for themselves, they broke in and discovered a female Bengal tiger locked in a cage in one of the rooms. Police officers in Mexico were shocked to find a female Bengal tiger living in a cage in an abandoned house after they were called to reports of strange noises coming from the property . Investigators say the animal was likely kept illegally, and say the owner is facing a fine from the environmental protection agency, as well as a court case for keeping a dangerous animal without proper protection . Investigators are now trying to work out how the tiger got there, but confess they are at a loss. Police spokesman Leonidas Bueno Escamilla said: 'She didn't have any food or water to hand, but we don't think she could have been there for long because she was in good condition. 'The cage was much too small for an animal of this size, it's a complete mystery what the tiger was doing there.' Officers managed to track down the owner of the house, but he denied any knowledge of the tiger. Police were called to reports of strange sounds coming from an abandoned house in Chilapa de Alvarez . They said whoever placed it there is not only facing a fine from the environment protection agency but also a legal case for keeping a dangerous animal without the proper safety and security measures in place. Escamilla added: 'If a child or anyone else had wandered near the cage the tiger could easily have grabbed them and then the consequences could have been terrible. 'It has been taken to a zoo for the time being while attempts are made to trace the owner, we suspect it was probably an illegally owned tiger.'","Police called to reports of strange noises in abandoned house in Mexico .

Worryingly several families walking past just a few feet away fail to notice the men behave recklessly at the beauty spot . This is the shocking moment a group of men risk their lives by posing for photographs, while dangling their legs over a crumbling 500ft high cliff .

'If they could see the cracks underneath them and the under-hangings where the are lying they wouldn't go anywhere near it. 'They really shouldn't go anywhere near it at all.' Mr Hollingsworth, from nearby Seaford, filmed the group on Sunday afternoon as he went walking along a nearby coastal path with a friend. The group, who were taking it in turns to pose perilously close to the edge, were filmed at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, East Sussex . The photographer, who regularly sees people balancing precariously close to the edge, sent an unmanned drone up into the air to capture the men's actions. He added: 'They were there for a good 10 to 15 minutes, to put his own and others life's in danger is disgusting and he should be ashamed at his actions. 'If children had seen this and copied it could of been a tragic afternoon. 'Lots of people walk by without even a glance, it has become the normal for people to do this, what does it need to stop this. 'I asked the person I was with to ask them to step away from the edge, but by the time they had got down there over 20 people had walked by them without a word, they had also moved on.

Britain’s European 100m champion James Desaolu was third in 10.06 while the 200m champion, Adam Gemili, was fifth in 10.13. It was a better night for Britain’s women’s sprinters who won the 4x100m relay ahead of a strong Jamaican quartet. Scroll down for videos... Speed demon: Kemar Bailey-Cole won the 100m final at the Diamond League meeting in Zurich . Long limbed: Kemar Bailey-Cole was only man to run below 10 seconds in a strong field . Asha Philip, Anyika Onuora, Ashleigh Nelson and Desiree Henry won in 42.21, a new national record and three-hundredths faster than the time that three of them – with Onuora coming in for Jodie Williams – ran on their way to European gold in the same Letzigrund stadium eleven days earlier. ‘It’s amazing,’ said Nelson. ‘We just wanted to run well again. The crowd was amazing, the girls are amazing.’ Henry, who ran the anchor leg, said; ‘I just looked to my left and right and thought, oh my God, these are the quickest girls in the world, but you know what, I consider myself one of them and I knew that these girls would do a fantastic job to put me in a good position. I’m so glad that we were able to get the baton around smoothly.’ Withdrawal: Usain Bolt was pictured out on the town in London during the week . Desaolu was merely content with his performance in the men’s 100m, running from lane one. ‘I felt pretty good, and I’ve still got a few races left so hopefully I’ll be able to improve. I’m 100 percent fit,’ said the injury-prone Desaolu. Gemili, who confirmed afterwards that this would be his final race of 2014, said: ‘I didn’t realise until I took my first stride, it was hard. Coming off the back of two championships I had done a lot of work. But to finish fifth ahead of Nesta Carter, who’s run under 10 seconds this year, is good.’ Earlier, Martyn Rooney, the European 400 metres champion, faced LaShawn Merritt and could only manage 45.10 for fourth, with Merritt winning in 44.36. Flying the flag: (L-R) Desiree Henry, Anyika Onoura, Asha Philip and Ashleigh Nelson won the women's 4x100m . ‘That was poor,’ said Rooney. ‘I’m really disappointed with that. You need to challenge but if you give LaShawn Merrit five metres it’s very hard to chase him down. I’ve had two championships, one better than the other, but these opportunities don’t come everyday.’ It’s not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There’s £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .

"By . Charlie Scott . Follow @@charliefscott . Brazil legend Ronaldo thinks the 2002 World Cup squad he was part of is better than every other Selecao team ever – apart from the side that won the trophy in Mexico in 1970. Though many people believe the side that lost in the 1998 World Cup final against France was one of Brazil’s best teams ever, the striker disagrees. ‘The 1998 . team wasn’t as solid [as the 2002 side],’ Ronaldo told FourFourTwo. ‘I . dare to say that team of 2002 was better than all the others Brazil sent . to a World Cup, except for the 1970 team. World-beater: Ronaldo peels away after scoring in the 2002 World Cup final against Germany . ‘That 2002 team was very balanced: it had great defenders and great strikers. We could stop anyone and we could score at any time, against any team. There was jogo bonito and there was strategy. ‘It wasn’t as brilliant in 1994. Much less in 1998, although we did pretty well before the final. The 2002 team earned Brazil credibility, especially after our win over Belgium in the round of sixteen.’ Goodbye: Ronaldo's final World Cup game in 2006 . Dejection: The Brazilian looks devastated in 1998 . The 2002 tournament was Ronaldo’s third World Cup, though it was the first time he was able to show his best form in a final. He was . called up to the 1994 World Cup squad as a 17-year-old, but did not play . any part as Brazil won the trophy for the fourth time in USA. Four years . later the stage looked set for the striker to lead his nation to . victory in France, but he suffered convulsions and lost consciousness . for several minutes before the final against the hosts. The . initial team sheet did not include the forward because of the episode, . though he did play as Brazil were thrashed 3-0, with Ronaldo some way . from his brilliant best. In 2002, . Ronaldo was able to get redemption, winning the Golden Boot and scoring . twice in Brazil’s 2-0 win over Germany in the final.

In his prime: A jubilant Ronaldo celebrates scoring Brazil's first against Holland in the 1998 semi-final . Snapshot: Ronaldo slots the ball past Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn in the 2002 final .

Surprise! Ronaldo has guest-edited the latest FourFourTwo . ‘But we deserved it! After we arrived in Brazil, the celebrations went on for two more days. We were so worn out in the end.’ Ronaldo . started all five of Brazil’s games at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, . scoring three goals to become the leading all-time scorer in World Cup . tournaments. Brazil . lost to a Zinedine Zidane-inspired France in the quarter-finals, though . Ronaldo’s goalscoring record has remained until this year. Miroslav . Klose equaled the Brazilian’s tally of 15 during Germany’s group . matches, and could surpass the former Real Madrid star with Germany into . the quarter-finals after beating Algeria in extra-time on Monday. To celebrate its 20th birthday, football magazine FourFourTwo asked Ronaldo to guest-edit a special edition. Ronaldo worked with the FourFourTwo team to deliver the edition, which includes a special birthday photoshoot, as well as an in-depth feature on the great man’s life. And he wrote about his role in an editor’s letter at the front of the special edition. ‘It was no picnic. I had to do things I’ve never done before, like suggest ideas for stories and get people for interviews (Ronaldinho, you’re my man!). ‘I can now say that scoring goals is easier than editing a magazine!'","The striker played at the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cups .

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . Texas Governor Rick Perry say on Thursday that there's a 'very real possibility' that Islamic extremists have infiltrated the United States through its porous southern border. 'I think there is the obvious great concern that because of the . condition of the border, from the standpoint of it not being secure and . us not knowing who is penetrating across, that individuals from ISIS or . other terrorist states could be [coming in],' Perry told attendees of a Washington, D.C. event. And while he admitted that 'we have no clear . evidence of that,' Perry said 'your common sense tells you' that it may . have happened given how many criminals from other countries have . crossed border illegally. Use your common sense: Texas Governor Rick Perry admitted that 'we have no clear evidence' that Islamic extremists are sneaking in the country through the shouter border, but claimed 'your common sense tells you' that it may have happened . Rick Perry, right, greets National Review Editor Rich Lowry, left, and Republican strategist and pollster Kellyanne Conway before delivering remarks about immigration and the situation in Iraq at The Heritage Foundation this afternoon . 'I’m talking about the assaults, the rapes, the murders by individuals . who have come into this country illegally over the last five years. 'The . idea that they would not be looking at and managing any of those types . of attacks from that region is not a good place to be,' he added. The Republican governor told the National Review Online that people from countries known for terrorism are crossing over to border in greater numbers, and it is a cause for concern. 'We know that there are individuals from countries that have . terrorist ties that are being apprehended and we had reports of record . high numbers of those individuals who were coming in back in the . summer,' he said. The embattled Texas governor dropped by the nation's capitol on Thursday to speak at the Heritage Foundation on the immigration crisis. But the likely 2016 presidential candidate hit on other topics as well, including the conflict in Iraq. His remarks on the subject gave way to questions about jihadists permeating the United States through it's border with Mexico, which is . also the Texas border, and his opinion on how the U.S. should be handling the Islamic State. 'They need to be eliminated,' they need to be eliminated . now,' he said of the terrorist organization. Perry said he did not think the president should be ruling out a strategy that involves putting combat groups on the ground nor should he be revealing his hand to his enemies. 'I think signaling to your enemies what . you are not going to put on the table is very very bad, both strategical . and tactical errors by this administration,' he said. 'We need to have all of our . options open.' The Republican politician said he understood the country was weary of war, yet he cautioned attendees that the costs of inaction could be far worse than those associated with a military operation. 'For many Americans, of course, just the last thing we want to think . about is more conflict in Iraq and what that might involve,' he said. 'But we better get on top of this crisis by every means necessary . because events are moving fast and the price is only going to move up.' Perry appeared calm and collected throughout his appearance at the 35 minute event on Thursday afternoon despite facing chaos back at home. The Lone Star State governor was formally charged this week with two felonies over an alleged abuse of power after he vetoed funding for a government agency that investigates corruption. Perry briefly touched on the topic at the beginning of his remarks before moving on to his speech. 'I am very confident in my case, and I can assure you that I will fight this attack of our system of government,' he said.","The Republican governor was at an event in Washington, D.C. when he was asked about the permeability of the U.S.-Mexico border .

"By . Jaya Narain for The Daily Mail . Captured on CCTV, this is the moment that turf war erupted in a quiet suburban street – as a couple had their front garden stolen by two middle-aged lawn thieves. The women were filmed methodically rolling up the newly-laid turf, before scurrying off down the road. The shameless pair had to make seven return trips to strip the garden bare – and even stopped half-way through for a cigarette break. Scroll down for video . Grassed up: The women, who look middle-aged, can be seen ripping up the freshly-laid lawn during the robbery . Wearing pink: After rolling the grass up she hoists it into her arms while her accomplice approaches . The . victims’ neighbour Bobby Stacey caught the whole thing on CCTV, having . installed a camera after thieves stole tools and a mountain bike from . his own property. Mr . Stacey, 51, who owns a beauty salon, said his neighbour had spent all . day carefully levelling his front garden before neatly laying the strips . of turf. ‘He’d done a fantastic job. I went in to work and I had a . phone call asking to check my CCTV because the turf had been stolen. I . couldn’t believe it.’ Mr . Stacey, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, said he was stunned by the . footage. ‘It was shamefully funny. I couldn’t stop laughing,’ he . admitted. Daylight robbery: The woman in the pink jumper strides away from the scene - presumably to a getaway car . Well-earned break: The brazen thieves appear to stop for a cigarette half-way through the turf heist . ‘It . was about 5am in the morning ... it was dark when they started, but . when they finished it had got light. It took about 40 minutes to an hour . – half-way through they stopped and had a smoke and a sit down on my . wall.’ Mr Stacey said he had heard rumours that the perpetrators were a mother-and-daughter team. ‘It . was cheeky, but the turf must have cost at most £30 – it doesn’t even . seem worth it,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t stop laughing. I was annoyed at the . same time though. I don’t know where they took the turf, because that’s . off-camera, but they must have been loading it up somewhere. ‘We . live in a quiet neighbourhood and we have older people living behind . these houses, and I worry for them if this goes any further.’ The . owners of the stolen turf were too upset to talk about the raid . yesterday.

"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . Stuart Lancaster and Andy Farrell will be in Salford to watch the first head-to-head in what promises to be an intriguing early-season tussle for England fly-half places. The two national coaches will be fascinated spectators at the AJ Bell Stadium as Danny Cipriani and George Ford lock horns when Sale take on Bath. The pair will be aiming to guide their sides to an opening win in the Aviva Premiership, but also score personal points ahead of next month’s belated naming of the senior EPS squad for the autumn international campaign. Cipriani will be out to continue the positive momentum which propelled him back into the Red Rose ranks at the end of last season. Fly-half: Sale Sharks man Danny Cipriani is hoping to seal his place as England's fly-half . Having done enough to convince Lancaster and his assistants that he had the requisite attitude to go with his considerable talent, he was picked for the tour of New Zealand and fared well with encouraging cameos in the first and third Tests, and a fine game against the Crusaders. In contrast, Ford is playing catch-up as he seeks to re-establish his own burgeoning credentials. The 21-year-old had climbed to the status of first reserve during the Six Nations – ending the tournament with a glittering contribution off the bench against Italy in Rome. Yet, just as the Bath tyro seemed destined to go to New Zealand as first-choice for the series opener, in the temporary absence of Owen Farrell, he aggravated a shoulder injury and was told he needed surgery. Forced to watch the tour from afar, he saw Freddie Burns and Cipriani push their selection case. It left him driven to respond at the start of this season, in the knowledge Stephen Myler of Northampton is also in the England mix. Competition: George Ford is playing catch-up as he seeks to re-establish himself after his injury . Statement: Has Cipriani done enough to convince Lancaster  he has the attitude to go with his  talent? Burns will make his competitive debut for Leicester against Newcastle at Welford Road today, with his own agendas to address. He will be desperate to show more of the composed form he produced against the All Blacks in Auckland, to move on from an altogether more chastening experience in Hamilton two weeks later. And he will be striving to fend off the challenge for the Tigers playmaker role posed by Welshman Owen Williams, who is available again after serving a ban. Williams was sufficiently convincing in his work in the shadow of Toby Flood last season that the rookie ultimately ousted the far more experienced England stand-off from the Leicester XV. He was on course to go to South Africa with Wales in June, until being suspended for gouging Luther Burrell in the Tigers’ Premiership semi-final defeat at Franklin’s Gardens. Options: As well as Cipriani and Ford, Freddie Burns and Stephen Myler are other options for Lancaster . England forwards coach Graham Rowntree will be at Welford Road but, rather than focusing on the scrap for the hosts’ fly half berth, his eye will be drawn to more earthy matters up front. He will monitor Tom Youngs’ return to action after the Leicester hooker missed the New Zealand trip on compassionate grounds. Newcastle replacement props Kieran Brookes and Scott Wilson will also come under scrutiny. James Haskell admits he will be inspired by Lawrence Dallaglio when he leads Wasps for the 2014-15 season. Haskell’s first taste of captaincy will be today’s opening match of the traditional Aviva Premiership London double-header against Saracens at Twickenham. Haskell played alongside Dallaglio for six years. He said: ‘To me Lawrence was everything you want in a leader. I’m not trying to be Lawrence won’t copy him. You can’t help but be inspired by a guy who was a natural leader and had respect from people.’","Stuart Lancaster still to decide on England's fly-half .

"By . James  Nye . The Catalina Island Museum has opened an exhibit dedicated to a notorious Native American grave robber who presided over an 'Indian museum' built out of the bones he recovered from the burial grounds. 'The Strange and Mysterious Case of Dr. Glidden' delves into the colorful and mysterious past of amateur archaeologist Ralph Glidden - hoping to shed light on a gruesome period in the Californian islands history. The no-holds-barred exhibit features an introduction that says he, through his unscientific plundering, disregarded 'the sanctity of human remains' and inflicted 'near-permanent damage' on research into local Native American life. The interior of Ralph Glidden's Indian Museum in Avalon, California - complete with bones and skulls from Native American burial grounds . Laying out what visitors can expect, the museum's Executive Director Michael De Marsche compared the exhibition to those at Holocaust museum's in Europe saying they explore, 'similar issues: the genocide of a people, the desecration of their graves and the lack of respect for the sacredness of their remains.' The 'disturbing and troubling exhibition' was put together after museum curator discovered boxes of Glidden's journals, letters and photographs that document how he went about his dubious methods. Throughout the early part of the last century up until the 1930s, the self-proclaimed professor was hired by a foundation to excavate Native American graves. He dug up hundreds and obtained thousands of objects, many of which went to prestigious museums. They included bone flutes, war clubs and arrowheads, cooking stones used to boil soup in baskets and beads that were used as currency. Grizzly Past: A photographic exhibit of the former Glidden museum is seen at the Catalina Island Museum . A Santa Catalina Island museum has opened an exhibit on a self-styled archaeologist who dug up hundreds of local American Indian graves and made a tourist trap out of their bones . He also built an island museum that incorporated Native American bones as architectural elements, including windows edged with finger and toe bones, leg and arm bones as shelf brackets and ceiling panels decorated with vertebra and shoulder blades. His macabre makeshift exhibition tent was described by Glidden himself as 'unlike anything else anywhere in this country'. He modeled the interior on a mortuary chapel on the Mediterranean island of Malta which had walls created from the bones of monks. The Catalina Islander said that his museum displayed rows of human skulls and femur bones were deployed as shelving supports. Windows were decorated with bones from Native American fingers and feet and Glidden happily posed for photographs inside his decrepit museum. Ralph Glidden poses with two unidentified ladies in his Indian Museum - the self-styled pseudoscientist archaeologist looted hundreds of Native American graves and made a tourist trap out of Tongva Indian burial grounds . Ralph Glidden poses with a soapstone urn at his Indian Museum - a new  exhibition will run from May 11 through Sept. 29, 2013 at the Catalina Island Museum. No bones are part of the current exhibit . Calling himself 'Dr', despite there being no evidence he even graduated from high school, Glidden is thought to have rifled through 801 grave-sites from 105 individual locations around Catalina Island. His methods allowed him to accumulate one of the largest collection of human remains and artifacts of the native peoples of Catalina Island and by the 1920s he was enjoying fame and fortune, dining with the nation's wealthiest men. Shrewdly using the media to promote his own aims, Glidden hired an ex-Los Angeles Times journalist to become his personal publicist, transforming himself into 'the famous archaelogist Ralph Glidden'- complete with funding from oil baron George Gustav Heye. His finds made their way across the United States to prestigious institutions and he made fantastical claims to have unearthed a mythical prehistoric race of blue-eyed, giant Native Americans. Indeed, in 1930, he announced the discovery of a skeleton of a 'royal princess' surrounded by the skeletons of 64 children buried in four tiers and five feet below the children was the skeleton of a 7 feet, 8 inch tall man. No photographic proof of this was ever provided. Just three years after initiating his first dig, Glidden sold his entire collection to the prestigious Heye Foundation of the Museum of the American Indian in New York owned by Gustav Heye (right) The exhibit on Ralph Glidden that opened over the weekend at Catalina . Island Museum features an introduction that says he, through his . unscientific plundering, disregarded 'the sanctity of human remains' and . inflicted 'near-permanent damage' on research into local Native . American life. In the 1920s and 30s, the self-proclaimed professor was hired by a foundation to excavate Native American graves. He dug up hundreds and obtained thousands of objects, many of which went to prestigious museums . Born in 1880 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Glidden moved to Catalina in 1896 with his parents and was working as a carpenter in 1915 when he first began excavating Native American graves. Political sensitivities and the law were not against his actions at the time and within a short time he had amassed a collection that the Los Angeles Times said 'would make any curator in this nation envious.' By 1918 he had entered into his partnership with German-American Heye and sold his loot to his Foundation of the Museum of the American Indian in New York. In 1922, the Heye Foundation suddenly reduced its funding to Glidden and in April of 1924 cut all money for excavation of the islands burial sites. His only source of income was his grizzly museum of human bones that overlooked Avalon's harbor. A fresh interest in archaeology provided by Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamen in 1923 gave Glidden a boost - leading to him spinning his wondrous yarns about giants and princesses found on the small Pacific island off the coast of California. He also built an island museum that incorporated Native American bones as architectural elements, including windows edged with finger and toe bones, leg and arm bones as shelf brackets and ceiling panels decorated with vertebra and shoulder blades . Media interest descended and articles by The New York Times, the Boston Globe and the Chicago Tribune all showed up the 'Dr's' empty boasts. By the early 1930s he was almost bankrupt and began touting a tale of a 'secret history' of the island which he refused to give up until he was paid. The price included the remnants of his collection and for 30-years he unsuccessfully tried to shop the history and his artifacts around. In 1962 he was paid $5,000 for the collection, but not the history. Hundreds of skulls and bones and thousands of teeth were moved to the University of California, Los Angeles. After his death in 1968, the secret was revealed to be less than 10 pages of text. Jeanne Hill, 89, of Avalon recalled hiking up a hill to the museum in the 1930s and paying 35 cents to get inside. 'It was scary, very scary,' Hill told the LA Times. 'Bones piled up all over the place. One skull had a light on in it.'","A Santa Catalina Island museum has opened an exhibit on a self-styled .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . Former champion Richie Ramsay admitted the chance to make history had crossed his mind in the opening round of the Omega European Masters. An eagle and six birdies in his first 15 holes at Crans-sur-Sierre left Ramsay needing to birdie the last three on the par-70 layout to record the first ever 59 on the European Tour. But after a superb tee shot to six feet on the difficult 16th, Ramsay's birdie attempt slipped past the hole and he eventually signed for an eight-under-par 62 to share the lead with Italy's Edoardo Molinari. Wish you were here? Richie Ramsay putts during the first round  at Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club in Switzerland . In the swing: Ramsay leads after the first round of the Omega European Masters after a brilliant 62 . 'On the 16th I thought that if I could make my birdie putt I'd have a good chance, because the last two holes are decent chances for birdie,' Ramsay said. 'But once I missed the putt, I obviously knew the game was up.' Ramsay's season has been disrupted by injury, but he arrived in Switzerland on the back of finishing joint fourth in the Italian Open on Sunday. We promise it's him: Edoardo Molinari is the early joint-leader after also shooting a superb opening 62 . Mountain to climb: Ross Fisher of England chips during the first round amid a stunning backdrop . The 31-year-old from Aberdeen won his second European Tour title here in 2012 and added: 'There's a great picture of me holing the winning putt with the big screen behind me, so it'd be nice to recreate that on Sunday. 'This course really suits me. It's a proper golf course, you really need to think a lot and plot your way around, especially off the tee. 'Good shots get rewarded and poor shots get punished, which is exactly the way it should be. 'It's a tricky course but if you get on a run, there's definitely a low score to be had out there. I played really well two years ago and I was able to draw on those good memories on my way round today.' Low scoring was the order of the day with Northern Ireland's Gareth Maybin and English pair Tommy Fleetwood and Graeme Storm recording rounds of 64 and Ryder Cup debutants Jamie Donaldson and Victor Dubuisson in a large group on five under. Fleetwood, who won his first European Tour title in the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles last year, recovered from a double bogey on the fourth with four birdies in his last five holes. He said: 'It's obviously never nice to start with a three-putt, but then I holed a good par putt on the 11th so I could've been two over after two. 'But the birdie on 15 got me going and from there on in I played really well and felt good about my game. I shot five under on my back nine, which is the front nine, and didn't really have to hole any putts of note. 'When you're playing that well you just want to make the most of it and luckily I managed to do that today.' England's Seve Benson was part of the large group on five under thanks to a 65 in just his second tournament since May due to back problems. The 27-year-old revealed he has had to change his swing due to a broken bone in his back, which kept him out of action from the BMW PGA Championship in May until last week's Italian Open. 'I had a fracture in my vertebrae so it was pretty serious,' Benson told Sky Sports 4. Sky's the limit:  Korea's Jin Jeong plays a shot during the first round in Crans-Montana . 'Initially I thought it was just a pulled muscle but we had a few scans and I had fractured one of my vertebrae so it was rest time and then some rehab. 'I had to change my swing a little bit and as long as I keeping swinging in the new way then fingers crossed I will be fine, but if I revert to my old swing then it could come up again.' Defending champion Thomas Bjorn, seeking to emulate Seve Ballesteros by winning the event for the third time, rounded off a perfect day for Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley with a four-under 66. The 43-year-old Dane will play his first Ryder Cup since 2002 later this month, but added: 'You have to play the golf in front of you and not worry too much about what's ahead. 'The score was decent today so it's a good start.' Donaldson is looking for back-to-back victories after sealing his place on the team by winning the Czech Masters. He said: 'We had a few chats about the Ryder Cup but like Thomas said, I have two tournaments to play before then so my focus at the moment is continuing the good form and getting my game in shape.'","Richie Ramsay leads Omega European Masters at Crans-sur-Sierre .

Previously unbeaten in four starts, the impressive German Derby winner was installed as ante-post favourite for the Paris feature after his 11-length romp in the Hamburg Classic back in July. However, after making his own running in the hands of Cristian Demuro for the majority of the Group One event, Sea The Moon was overhauled inside the final furlong and readily eclipsed by Filip Minarik aboard Jean-Pierre Carvalho’s four-year-old.

Coral reacted by easing Sea The Moon to 6-1 (from 7-2) for the Arc, while Ivanhowe was introduced into the market at 16-1. Last year’s winner Treve is the 9-2 favourite. There were two big-race British successes in Turkey when Pether's Moon and Glory Awaits landed sizeable pots for their connections. The former, trained by Richard Hannon, lifted the £150,000 International Bosphorus by a length from Village Wind following a typically patient Richard Hughes ride.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline . Former Rangers commercial director Imran Ahmad has gone to court for a third time in a quest to freeze £620,000 of the Ibrox club’s assets. If successful, lawyers for Ahmad could push Rangers closer to the financial edge after lodging a fresh claim at the Court of Session for £500,000 in unpaid bonuses plus legal expenses. Last week, the Ibrox club launched a new £4million share issue in a statement to the London Stock Exchange in a move they hope will rebuild a ‘stable, sustainable and successful business’. Money: Former Rangers commercial director Imran Ahmad has taken the club to court to try and freeze £620,000 of the Ibrox club's assets . Success needed: Rangers will hope the Glasgow giants can gain promotion from the Scottish Championship . Back on the brink: If the shares issues fails to reach at least £3m then Rangers' future could be uncertain again . Concern: Ally McCoist is worried about the club's perilous finances and the prospect of administration . Conceding that external funding will still be needed even if the open offer is successful, however, the statement served only to trigger fresh speculation over cash flow at the club. Ahmad has twice before lost similar motions. But counsel Kenny McBrearty QC told Lord Stewart that the former Zeus Capital executive is concerned about the stability of the club’s finances and fears Rangers could not afford to pay him by the time his claim for £500,000 plus legal costs reached court. Ahmad’s advocate cited a sharp drop of 15,000 in season-tickets sales, with the last recorded figure running at 23,000. Mr McBrearty said the latest plans for a share issue may only raise £3.6m after costs, adding: ‘There is a significant hole in the club’s finances for the forthcoming season.’ Lord Stewart continued the case until Friday when lawyers for Rangers will address the court. Concerns over the likely success of the forthcoming open offer have been raised by claims current chief executive Graham Wallace will not invest any of his own money in new shares.

"By . Andy Hampson . Stoke forward Peter Odemwingie is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a knee injury, manager Mark Hughes has revealed. Odemwingie was carried off on a stretcher during the Potters' Barclays Premier League victory at champions Manchester City last Saturday. Hughes initially expressed hope the problem was not serious but now it has emerged the 33-year-old Nigeria international will need an operation. Out of action: Stoke forward Peter Odemwingie is likely to face a lengthy spell on the sidelines through injury . As yet no timescale has been put on his recovery but the club have not included Odemwingie in their 25-man Premier League squad, meaning he cannot be registered to play until January at the earliest. Hughes told the club's website, www.stokecityfc.com: 'He's going to have some kind of procedure but the medical staff are waiting for the knee to settle down. 'He's going to have to wait a couple of weeks before it's actually done but once the operation is done we know he will work extremely hard to get back. 'It's a significant injury and unfortunately it's a long-term one, but Peter has a great attitude to work and life in general - he's always got a smile on his face - and he's going to need those qualities. It will be a long road back but we wish him well.' Ouch: Odemwingie (left) suffered a knee injury after coming on as a second-half substitute on Saturday . Odemwingie only entered the action as a half-time substitute at the Etihad Stadium and almost set up a second goal for match-winner Mame Biram Diouf. But he was injured in the process and was himself substituted after 65 minutes. Odemwingie appeared to have settled well at Stoke following his move to the Britannia Stadium last January.

"By . Richard Moore . Mark Cavendish’s troubled season continued in Liverpool on Sunday as he collided with a car and crashed during the first stage of the Tour of Britain. The Isle of Man sprinter recovered to finish third behind Marcel Kittel, and then went straight to hospital. ‘I was coming back and I was behind a car,’ said Cavendish, who was returning to the peloton after an early problem with his shoes. ‘Someone had to stop for a puncture, so the car slammed on its brakes and there was an island in the road. If I went right I would hit the island, so I went left and I whacked another car. Ahead: Marcel Kittel of Germany celebrates as he wins stage one of the Tour of Britain . Sprint: Cavendish powered towards the line at the end of the race to try and finish as high as he could . ‘I hit it with my left leg and I was down on the road. I immediately felt a lot of pain on my quadriceps. ‘I don’t know what’s wrong but it’s f*****. That’s why I’m off to hospital.’ That Cavendish was able to contest the final sprint at all was a surprise. Still battling back to full fitness after suffering ligament damage when he crashed at the Tour de France, his woes continued here with his shoe problem, his crash and a compromised sprint. Cavendish said: ‘I wasn’t planning to sprint, it was painful. But after a couple of laps we decided to just try anyway, but to sprint seated because I was in pain. I still got third, but it’s a shame because I really wanted to win in front of the British public. Focus: Mark Cavendish has suffered a difficult season and will be hoping to recover and find his form . ‘Accidents like this are a part of cycling and it’s just a matter of bad luck. I really hope that my luck turns in the next days.’ There was another crash in the final kilometre, which Cavendish avoided, but he could do nothing against Kittel, the Giant-Shimano sprinter who, for the second year in a row, won four stages at the Tour de France. Kittel won in Harrogate and London when the Tour was in England, having also won the first stage of the Giro d’Italia in Belfast. Liverpool was billed as a re-match with Cavendish, who was at fault when he crashed in Harrogate, but the German’s dominance continued. He remains unbeaten against Cavendish in head-to-head sprints. The opening day of the eight-stage race, which finishes in London on Sunday, was bathed in sunshine as the riders tackled eight laps of a flat 13.1km circuit around Liverpool. Sir Bradley Wiggins appeared on the front on the final lap, keeping the pace high for his Sky team-mate Ben Swift, who finished fifth. Wiggins, the defending champion, said this could be the last time he starts a stage race aiming to win. ‘When I was at the Tour of California earlier this year I said I would never go for it again, but then I thought I would like one more crack at this one,’ said Wiggins. ‘The plan is to put on some weight and I will be training for the track, so stage racing to win the GC (general classification) will be out the window after this. ‘I will definitely be racing to win but whether I can is another matter. If I can just stay close to the big GC guys on Tuesday I can be competitive.’","Cavendish collided with a car during the first stage of the Tour of Britain .

Sykes was struggling to keep up with the Frenchman and watched helplessly as Italy's Melandri moved past him and into second place on lap 11. Melandri had passed his team-mate with four laps remaining in race one and this time around he overtook Guintoli with five laps remaining and never looked back. Race: Melandri leads the pack during World Superbike Race 1 in Spain on Sunday . He is mathematically still in contention for the WSBK title but, at 85 points behind, it looks like the 2014 crown will go to either Sykes or Guintoli barring spectacular collapses from the pair at Magny Cours and Losail. Chaz Davies rode his Ducati into fourth place while Jonathan Rea (Honda) was fifth ahead of Eugene Laverty (Suzuki) and Baz in seventh. Leon Haslam (Honda) and Alex Lowes (Suzuki) were eighth and ninth while Toni Elias (Aprilia) rounded out the top 10.","Melandri won twice at the Circuito de Jerez on Sunday .

Agnieszka Radwanska's charge through the draw came to a shocking end on Monday night, with the fourth seed crushed by Ekaterina Makarova in less than an hour. The Pole had conceded only nine games - and not a single set - going into her fourth-round match against the 22nd seed. But she was demolished either side of rain delays, going down 6-3, 6-0 in just 53 minutes. Off the pace: Agnieszka Radwanska was beaten 6-3, 6-0 by Ekaterina Makarova in less than an hour . It was a stunning defeat for a woman who has reached the final and semi-finals here in her past two visits. She was broken twice in the first set, before a terrible second set in which she won only four points off her own serve. When Radwanska had break points, two of them, both in the second set, she failed to convert. Makarova had eight and took five — decisive and devastating. Winner: Makarova celebrates her straight sets win on Monday evening . The Russian, who had never previously gone past the third round at Wimbledon, was relentless, hitting 24 winners and making only six unforced errors as another big name was knocked out. Of the top four, only third seed Simona Halep, who plays Zarina Diyas in the fourth round today, remains in the draw. Makarova, 26, is paired with Lucie Safarova, the 23rd seed from the Czech Republic, who made light work of qualifier Tereza Smitkova. She said: ‘I am very comfortable this year. My parents are over here with me and we are all staying in the same house. It is like I am at home, eating Russian food that my mum cooks. I feel very good.’ Day to remember: Makarova hit 24 winners and only made six unforced errors .","Agnieszka Radwanska was beaten in straight sets by Ekaterina Makarova .

The 7-inch MyTablet costs just £99.99 - the same price as the Kindle Fire, £20 cheaper than Tesco's Hudl and Amazon's Kindle Fire HD, and £100 cheaper than Google's latest Nexus 7. Argos has said the device is aimed at teenagers and will come with parental controls enabled by default when it goes on sale Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Datawind's tablet is the latest cut-price device to go on sale in the run up to Christmas. Argos recently launched is 7-inch MyTablet, pictured, for £99.99. It runs Google's Android Jelly Bean and has 8GB of memory . The high-street retailer said the proportion of Argos sales via mobile devices, which include tablets, is now 15 per cent. MyTablet runs Google's Android Jelly Bean operating system and comes preloaded with apps, including Facebook and Twitter, plus games and Skype. 'Millions of people have bought . tablets during the last year but there is still around 75 per cent of . the UK population without one. 'We know that tablets will feature heavily . on Christmas lists this year,' said John Walden, managing director of . Argos. 'At just £99.99 the Argos MyTablet is . highly competitive with a great specification.' A . spokesman added the device has been designed 'with teenagers in mind . offering all the functionality of a traditional tablet with built-in . parental controls for younger users.' It is powered by a 1.6GHz dual-core . processor and has with a 1024 x 600 resolution LCD screen - giving the MyTablet a pixel density of 169.

Prices may vary on third-party shops or during promotions . **Currently £99 on offer . Although this pixel density is lower than Google's 323 PPI and Tesco's 237 PPI, it is six points higher than Apple's iPad mini. MyTablet comes with 8GB of memory - half the basic storage of other 7-inch tablets on the market - but does have a MicroSD port that supports an extra 32GB. MyTablet is available in pink, pictured, and silver. It goes on sale 16 October and is powered by a 1.6GHz dual-core processor . Elsewhere, the device has a built-in 2MP rear-facing camera plus a low-resolution 0.3MP front-facing camera, and has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. After Apple dominated the tablet market for years, Google was the first major company to challenge the iPad and, in particular, the later iPad mini with the launch of its Nexus 7 by Asus. It was a budget tablet that went on sale for £159, compared to the iPad mini's £269, without compromising on the majority of features. The search giant launched a Nexus 7 successor earlier this year that cost £199 and came with the world's highest resolution screen. Tesco then took it a step further with the launch of its Hudl tablet last month. The 7-inch Hudl costs just £119 and beats the majority of other budget tablets in terms of screen pixel density. It could even be bought for as little as £60 when purchased with Clubcard vouchers. At the launch, Tesco insisted it had not cut corners to . produce the budget tablet and claimed it would beat similarly priced . competitors ‘hands down’. The Argos MyTablet is available from 16 October from the Argos website, through the Argos app or high-street stores. Argos' plans to pitch this tablet at younger people is a growing trend in the tablet market. A survey by OnePoll, commissioned by Justin's World - apps by Justin Fletcher aimed at children - found tablets have become a must-have . accessory for toddlers, with 50 per cent of the UK’s two . and three-year-olds using one. It also found 61 per cent of three-year-olds and 38 per cent of two-year-olds play and learn on iPads. Tablet usage is often by more casual . users of technology, who are likely to be using their device for social . media, games and other lightweight means. Most people want access to . this type of technology but can't invest in a phone/tablet that gives . them much more than they need. The budget alternative may be just what . they have in mind. Commenting on the rise of budget . tablets, Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your . Bubble, told MailOnline: 'There will always be a market for luxe tablets . like the iPad, favoured by early adopters and professionals, just as . there will always be a market for budget, child-friendly slates. 'The . average British family doesn't really care about having high-resolution . screens, as long as they keep their kids quiet on long car journeys. 'That's . why bargain-priced slates from trusted budget brands are worthy . contenders for the booming two-tier tablet market. It's likely we'll see . more sub £100 tablets emerge, but it's unlikely they'll match the . quality of Hudl and MyTablet.' While Oliver Folkard, technology expert at uSwitch.com, added: 'Following the launch of Microsoft’s pricey Surface slates and Tesco’s pocket-money priced Hudl, Argos’ effort is more evidence of how diverse the tablet market is becoming. 'With inevitable snobbery around retailer-branded devices, it's highly unlikely image-conscious teenagers will want to be seen out and about with an Argos or Tesco tablet. But young families who just want to keep kids entertained won't care. 'The Hudl and MyTablet have robust spec sheets, but are loss leaders for the retailers, so it's unlikely we'll see good quality entry-level tablets get much cheaper than £99. 'But such a low price tag could spell the end of the humble laptop for some consumers. Tablets are changing how and when we get online - and are truly portable. But it’s unlikely that cheap tablets will fully replace smartphones.' Tunde Cockshott, Creative Consultant at marketing and technology consultancy Amaze told MailOnline: 'Argos have hit the right price point. In this market the nuances of specs are less important than price. Okay, it is less powerful than the Tesco Hudl, but it is also £20 cheaper. Argos will heavily promote this through their channels and I expect TV adverts. I think they may be onto a winner.' Tony Jiang, associate strategist at digital agency TH_NK added:  'With the two devices being released at the same time and at a similar price point there's the obvious danger they could split the market opportunity. 'Tesco seems to be better placed to generate revenues from the budget tablet space with all Hudl devices coming pre loaded with its film subscription service Blinkbox. And given their marketing power it's hard to see how the Hudl won't be on everyone's gift list come Christmas.'","The 7-inch MyTablet costs £99.99 and will be on sale from 16 October .

AS claim that Manchester United keeper David de Gea was 'the revolution' during Spain's performance, while coach Vicente del Bosque admitted: 'We lacked understanding with Diego Costa’s play'. Elsewhere in Spain, former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez has also been tipped to score on his debut for Real Madrid, having netted on his opening games for both Chivas and United.

"Loic Remy is hoping to discover his best form under Jose Mourinho after almost certainly becoming Chelsea's final addition of the 2014 summer transfer window. Mourinho had long stated that the window was closed for the Blues, having completed deals for Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis and Didier Drogba earlier in the summer. Fernando Torres' departure to AC Milan for the final two years of his five-and-a-half-year Chelsea contract - in effect ending his time at Stamford Bridge following his £50million move from Liverpool in January 2011 - necessitated the arrival of another striker, but even then Mourinho moved swiftly to sign Remy from QPR for £10.5million. New arrival: Remy joined Chelsea from QPR for £10.5milllion this week . Target man: Remy says Jose Mourinho has set him goals for this season and can improve his game . It could be if an opportunity arises - like the one last year which saw Willian join despite passing a medical at Tottenham - Chelsea may make a further signing, but, for now, Remy completes the squad for the first half of the 2014-15 campaign. 'I spoke with him (Mourinho),' Remy told chelseafc.com after agreeing a four-year contract. 'He is very clever and he knows exactly what he wants. He has targets for me and I know I have a target for myself as well. 'Everybody wants the best so the discussion was really good. I know he can get the best out of a player and I'm looking forward to working with him.' International: Remy arriving at France training. The striker was part of the World Cup squad this summer . Prolific: Remy scored 14 league goals last season but didn't to score this year for QPR . Costa has scored four goals in three Premier League games so far this season after his double in the 6-3 win at Everton. Remy added: 'We have two great strikers here already and I don't have a choice if I want to be in the team - I have to play at a very high level.' Many of those not in contention for a first-team place have left on loan - 21 in all after Marco van Ginkel, the midfielder who spent most of last season out with a serious knee injury, joined Torres at the San Siro. Main man: Costa has made a great start at Chelsea with four goals in his first three Premier League games . Back home: Remy will have a tough time getting above club legend Didier Drogba in the Chelsea pecking order . The Dutchman's departure means Chelsea fulfil the Premier League's homegrown player rule and will have the maximum 17 foreign players in their 25-man squad.

"By . Sophie Borland . One in four visits to A&E is made by a patient who cannot get an appointment with their GP, according to research. The first study to estimate the scale of the problem has found that 5.8million visits a year are directly down to patients being unable to see their family doctor. Last week, the number of patients arriving at casualty reached a record high of almost 300,000 – a 10 per cent rise on the same period three years ago. Researchers found that 18 per cent of patients surveyed had been unable to get a convenient appointment and 1.67 per cent had resorted to going to A&E . Patients have been finding it increasingly difficult to get a GP appointment and waiting lists have soared with the rising population and longer life expectancy. But the situation is made worse by the fact that many surgeries routinely shut their doors for up to four-and-a-half hours for lunch or for an entire afternoon during the week. And it is almost impossible to see a GP out of hours because, since 2004, doctors have been allowed to subcontract the work to private firms who employ locums. In the first study of its kind, researchers from Imperial College London, analysed the Department of Health's annual GP patient survey which covers one million people. They found that 18 per cent had been unable to get a convenient appointment and 1.67 per cent had resorted to going to A&E. If these findings are representative for the 345.6million patients who try and see their GP every year, it means 5.77million are ending up in casualty because they cannot get an appointment. This is just over a quarter of the total 21.7million A&E attendances a year. Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt has been warned plans to name and shame doctors over cancer delays 'could backfire' Last night Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said: 'The crowds at A&E just rise and rise because people can't get an appointment. You have to wait hours in A&E, it's not an easy option. People are just upset and worried, it's hopeless. 'GPs used to be open much longer and . if they weren't at the surgeries at least you could get hold of them. I . remember doctors ringing me out of hours and talking me through my . problem. Now you just get a recorded message … and that's the end of it. We need more doctors. It's getting very serious.' Thomas . Cowling, a researcher at the School of Public Health at Imperial . College London, said: 'There has been a lot of talk in recent years . about rising numbers of A&E attendances and the impact that this . might be having on A&E departments. 'It . has been suggested that a lack of access to GPs could be a factor but . there hasn't been much evidence … The aim of this analysis was to inform . the debate – until now, the numerical scale of the problem hadn't been . estimated.' The study, published in the British Journal of General Practice, did not break down whether patients had tried in vain to see their GP during the normal working week or out of hours. But an investigation by the Mail this month found that more than a quarter of surgeries close for at least one afternoon during the week with some shutting for four-and-a-half hours at lunch. A few offer evening and weekend appointments but most put patients through to private, out-of-hours firms who provide a patchy service staffed mainly by locums. Last week there were 299,031 A&E attendances, the highest since records began in 2010 and a rise of 5 per cent compared to the same period last year. But GPs also say they cannot cope with the demands of the rising, ageing population on top of a recruitment crisis. Some under-pressure surgeries have had to strike patients off arbitrarily including one in Watton, Norfolk, which removed a 95-year-old widow from its books. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chair of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: 'There are not enough GPs and other staff available to treat the sheer number of people coming through the surgery door. This is not a problem that is going away, we need urgent action.' Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said that 'a significant number of patients could be seen elsewhere if that capacity existed'. He added that the College's own research had estimated that just two million patients went to A&E after failing to see their GP – fewer than the Imperial College study. Yesterday Tory MPs urged David Cameron to increase the NHS budget in the face of unprecedented demand from patients. Dr Sarah Wollaston, a qualified GP, and former health secretary Stephen Dorrell wrote to the Prime Minister warning him the system could 'collapse' within five years. NHS England's director of operations, Dr Sarah Pinto-Duschinsky, said: 'Emergency admissions to hospital remain high and NHS England is redoubling efforts to ensure patients have speedy access to care, and address performance issues quickly.'","5.8million visits directly down to patients being unable to see doctor .

Impeccably-bred Ol’ Man River has been handed quotes of 20-1 for both the 2015 2,000 Guineas and Derby by Coral after justifying a tall reputation on his Curragh debut on Sunday. The Aidan O’Brien-trained 11-10 favourite, who cost his Coolmore Stud owners 2.85million euros, is a son of the late 1999 Arc winner Montjeu, who sired 2008 Derby winner Pour Moi, while his dam is Finsceal Beo, winner of the 2007 English and Irish 1,000 Guineas when trained by Jim Bolger. Ol’ Man River beat Aared three-quarters of a length in the one-mile Irish Stallion Farms EBF Maiden under Joseph O’Brien. Class act: Josephy O'Brien rides Ol' Man River away from his rivals to win in impressive style at Curragh . While the initial success was inevitably the catalyst to a confetti distribution of bookmaker quotes, Ol’ Man River can be credited with travelling smoothly throughout in a manner that demands he will be tested in a higher level. How soon that will be is as yet unknown. The colt holds a clutch of Group One entries but O’Brien said he would be in no rush to get Ol’ Man River back on the track. The trainer added: ‘It looked a good solid race and he travelled very strongly. He had to get tired going that gallop first time, but he cruised into the lead. ‘We’ll take our time with him and won’t be in any panic. We’d rather go gentle and see what’s going to happen. ‘The good thing about him is he’s a strong traveller and seems to have plenty of pace. Looking at today he wouldn’t mind going back to seven furlongs.’ Family victory: Aidan O'Brien (right) says he won't rush the horse, ridden to victory by his son (left) Inevitably, given the strength of stock in his Ballydoyle stable in Co Tipperary and his success in the last three runnings of the race, O’Brien-trained colts dominate the embryonic 2015 Investec Derby market. Coral have the Irish trainer Glorious Goodwood winner Highland Reel and Curragh maiden winner John F Kennedy sharing favouritism at 10-1 while Ol’ Man River is bracketed with unraced Sir Isaac Newton, a son of Galileo which cost 3.6million guineas as a yearling when sold at Tattersalls in October. Meanwhile, it was also a significant day at the Curragh for jockey Andrea Atzeni, who won the Group Three Round Tower Stakes on Ger Lyon-trained Cappella Sansevero.

After an inspirational manager lead them to a fine finish at the World Cup but since left for Manchester United, these could be seen as challenging times for Holland. But morale is still high in the squad under a new boss ahead of the friendly against Italy. Here, Sportsmail looks at what the Dutch have to offer in life after Louis van Gaal. New era: Holland prepare for Thursday's friendly with Italy with Guus Hiddink at the helm . Tough act to follow: Louis van Gaal, now of Manchester United, lead the team to a third-place finish in Brazil . So, what's new? Holland have turned to the steady hands of Guus Hiddink as they look to continue progressing with a talented group of players. The vastly experienced boss has enjoyed a 27-year managerial career, including with national teams South Korea, Australia, Russia and Turkey. He has even taken charge of the Oranje before, guiding the likes of Dennis Bergkamp and Frank de Boer to a World Cup quarter-final in 1998. Some believe they would have been deserving winners with their brand of football. Hiddink rarely gets things wrong when it comes to coaching a side (he's often brought in when club side's face crisis) so it's no wonder he was picked for the job following a low-key spell at Anzhi Makhachkala. He's not changing too much, either... Happy to be here: Hiddink is preparing for his first match in charge of his second spell with the Oranje . How things have changed: Hiddink was the Dutch coach from 1994 to 1998 . Who's in, who's out? Out of the 23-man squad travelling, only six didn't go to the World Cup. Rafael van der Vaart was due to take part but has since picked up a knock (he was recalled after missing the trip to Brazil through injury), though Stoke's Erik Pieters has been brought back into the fold. Jonathan de Guzman, now of Napoli, and Terence Kongolo are dropped from the set-up, as is Michel Vorm, but Ibrahim Affelay gets a chance to shine again. Goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, Ajax's Davy Klaassen, Gregory Van der Wiel ad Virgil van Dijk all win call-ups, but all in all Hiddink hasn't made any drastic changes in terms of personel, he has simply made changes due to injuries. That doesn't mean he's sticking with Van Gaal's system, though... Back in business: Gregory van der Wiel and Virgil van Dijk have been recalled . So, no more 3-5-2? Why fix it when it's not broken? I hear you say. Van Gaal's system, deploying Dirk Kuyt as a free-roaming left wing-back worked wonderfully in Brazil, thrashing Spain in the group stages on the way to a third-place finish. However, at times of desperation the new United boss did in fact change things, to 4-3-3 to be exact. And that's what Hiddink has opted for as he begins his reign. 'I had a discussion with the important players and we've decided to go back to 4-3-3. There was no surprise about it,' said Hiddink. Arjen Robben is out of the game in Bari but the system would presumably mean a place out on the right-hand side for the winger. Memphis Depay, Jerome Lens or Kuyt will be the main candidates to partner Van Persie against Italy. Target man: Van Persie will play the No 9 in the new 4-3-3 system, rather than with a partner in a 3-5-2 . 4-3-3 has been popular for Hiddink over the years. When appointed at Chelsea after Luiz Felipe Scolari's attempt at introducing Samba Style at Stamford Bridge, Guus kept things simple. Florent Malouda on one side, Nicholas Anelka on the other, Didier Drogba through the middle. It's safe to say it worked. Chelsea won 11 out of 13 Premier League games with the Dutchman at the helm. Hiddink favoured 4-4-2 during his first spell with Holland and tried out a bizarre 3-6-1 with Australia in 2006, but there's no doubt 4-3-3 is his preferred method. More conservative he may be, and you may not be getting the same Van Gaal fireworks, but the Dutch are on the right path for Euro 2016 and beyond. Will it get the best out of the star men? As mentioned above, Van Persie will surely be the lone striker in this system. Holland have used it in the past with the 30-year-old impressing, while he scored 31 Premier League goals as the main man at Arsenal. Wesley Sneijder will still have the freedom to create in his No 10 role, and he should have quick wingers to provide through the flanks. In that sense the formation suits the Dutch perfectly. However, one worry could be the defence. Despite the attacking talent, Holland have never really been blessed with world class players at the back, none more so than now. Passion: Arjen Robben will operate from the right-hand side, though he is a doubt for the game on Thursday . Blow: Klaas jan Huntelaar will miss out in Bari, but would probably be second choice behind RVP . Ron Vlaar is a solid individual and had a superb World Cup with two centre halves supporting him, but doubts will remain about his suitability in this formation. Daley Blind is another who had a fine tournament, though it is not yet clear whether he will operate best at left back, midfield or centre back in Hiddink's team. He played in all three positions in the World Cup. Verdict? It's hard to improve from a third-place finish in the World Cup, lead by Van Gaal, but Holland have hit the jackpot here. Hiddink is the perfect man for this job with the same star players you associate wearing the orange shirt. The mix of youth and experience should see this side kick on in the next few years.","Guus Hiddink took over at Holland after third-place finish at World Cup .

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . West Brom manager Alan Irvine is hopeful goalkeeper Ben Foster will get the all-clear to return to action early next week. The 31-year-old left England's squad before Wednesday's friendly win over Norway after sustaining a thumb injury in training. He will not be reassessed until Monday, which would seemingly rule him out of rejoining Roy Hodgson's squad for their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland. Ruled out: Ben Foster (centre) was forced to leave the England camp after injuring his thumb during training . Hopeful: West Brom boss Alan Irvine believes Foster could be back in action by next week . Safe hands: Foster pulls off an acrobatic save during West Brom's 3-0 defeat to Swansea . 'He's had a little bit of a problem with his thumb during pre-season but nothing we haven't been able to manage,' Irvine told wba.co.uk. 'He just got it jarred. He went to catch the ball, secured it with his left hand but it then ricocheted off and hit down on the top of his thumb. That's exactly the movement he wouldn't have wanted. 'We don't feel there's a need to do anything drastic at this particular moment. 'We are hoping that when he's assessed again on Monday he will be fine. 'There isn't a lot of swelling there, there's not a lot of bleeding, we don't believe it's a major injury or a big problem.' Back-up goalkeeper Boaz Myhill featured in last week's Capital One Cup victory against Oxford but has not started a league match since December. However, Irvine has no concerns if he has to call on Foster's deputy to face Everton a week on Saturday. 'Boaz is a Premier League goalkeeper, he has proven that many times,' he added. 'He stood in for Ben last year and did extremely well. I am really comfortable with him. In reserve: Foster was due to be Joe Hart's understudy against Switzerland on Monday . Next in line: Irvine insists he is comfortable with Boaz Myhill playing in the absence of Foster . 'We are lucky to have two of them because it's not easy to keep two top goalkeepers happy. We are very lucky to have such good back-up.' Irvine is also hopeful midfielder Graham Dorrans will recover quickly having pulled out of Scotland's squad with an injury. 'Graham is hoping that three or four days off it and it will settle down,' he said. 'There's not really an awful lot you can do to treat it because of what it is and where it is. 'It's a bruise but it's not like a bruise somewhere you don't notice it unless it gets hit, it's a bruise you notice every time you take a step. 'I will be surprised if he has still got problems with that kind of injury by that time (Everton fixture). I would expect that would have settled down in time. 'Hopefully he will be back training the early part of next week.'","Ben Foster was forced to leave the England camp after hurting his thumb .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . A year on from the lowest moment of his career, Marin Cilic defeated Tomas Berdych to reach his second grand slam semi-final at the US Open. Cilic dominated the match against sixth seed Berdych to win 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) and set up a last-four clash with either Roger Federer or Gael Monfils. The Croatian was not in New York 12 months ago. Instead he was serving a provisional ban after failing a drugs test. Joy: Marin Cilic celebrates reaching the US Open semi-finals after a 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 victory over Tomas Berdych . The news had leaked out but the International Tennis Federation, who run the anti-doping programme, would not confirm it until Cilic had been found guilty of an offence. That came in September and he was banned for nine months. Cilic protested his innocence, his explanation that his mother had brought him tablets over the counter that he thought were the same as ones he knew to be clean. His ban was reduced to four months on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport last October and Cilic has been making up for lost time ever since. Earlier this summer he beat Berdych on the way to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, where he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to one before losing. Composed: Croatian Cilic was in brilliant form and won to reach just his second Grand Slam semi final . Now he has gone one better and it was thoroughly deserved against a lacklustre Berdych, who has had a disappointing summer. Cilic won five of the first six games on his way to taking the first set and was quickly a break up in the second. Berdych led 3-0 in the third but lost his break after becoming involved in an argument with umpire Louise Engzell over a double bounce call and was outplayed in the tie-break. Cilic, whose previous slam semi-final came in Australia in 2010, is the first Croatian man to reach the last four at the US Open since his coach Goran Ivanisevic in 2006. Outplayed: Czech player Berdych simply could not handle Cilic who was in magnificent form on Thursday .","Marin Cilic beat Tomas Berdych 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) at US Open in New York .

"By . Pa Reporter . Manchester United defender Phil Jones is expected to meet with the club's medical staff on Tuesday as the Red Devils wait to discover the extent of the injury he sustained on England duty. Jones limped off in the 77th minute of Monday's 2-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory in Switzerland due to what appeared to be hamstring problem. No confirmation has been forthcoming from the Football Association on the matter and United will be eager to assess the 22-year-old when he arrives back in Manchester. Injury: Manchester United will assess Phil Jones's injury before they face QPR this weekend . The Old Trafford outfit, without a win to their name yet this season after four matches in all competitions under new boss Louis van Gaal, are next in action when they host QPR in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday. Several United players could make debuts in the match, including Jones' fellow England defender Luke Shaw, who it is understood is now fit and ready for selection. Left-back Shaw has been unable to make a competitive appearance for his new side following a summer switch from Southampton having suffered a hamstring injury of his own in August. There could also be United bows on Sunday for another defender in Marcos Rojo, with the necessary paperwork for him to do so now signed off, plus the versatile Daley Blind and striker Radamel Falcao, the two transfer deadline day recruits. Hamstring: Phil Jones limped off holding his hamstring as England beat Switzerland 2-0 in Basel . Meanwhile, Ander Herrera, who arrived from Athletic Bilbao over the summer, is hopeful of making his comeback in the game. The midfielder has been restricted to just one competitive United run-out so far because of an ankle complaint, but wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'Training hard and looking forward to this next game at Old Trafford!' There could also be a home Red Devils debut for Angel di Maria, the winger the club broke the British transfer record to sign last month. Comeback: Ander Herrera could make his return from injury against QPR in the Premier League on Sunday . United striker Robin van Persie is keen to get back working among the new signings once he finishes his international duties this week with Holland. Speaking in the Austrian Alps, where the Dutch team have been training, 31-year-old Van Persie - who has also expressed his desire to play at the 2018 World Cup and keep his career going through to the age of 40 - said: 'I can't wait to go and train and play with the world class players we have signed - wow! 'That feeling, that we are going to perform well, has only got stronger after the buying of players over the last weeks. I find it very exciting, the arrival of all those new players. 'For me personally, it's brilliant to go and play with some of the best players in the world. It's great that I can go and train and play with them every day.' Excited: Robin van Persie said he was very excited about Manchester United new boy Radamel Falcao . United wide man Ashley Young is also convinced the future is bright for the club. 'I definitely think things are going to turn for us and I would say to the fans there is nothing to worry about, we're going to come good,' Young told Inside United magazine. 'It's just like the manager has said, just believe in the philosophy and how we're playing and keep believing that we're going to turn this round because we do.' Sir Bobby Charlton has echoed the sentiment that United supporters should not be too fearful about what lies ahead. 'We've got nothing to worry about,' said the club's all-time leading goalscorer, quoted by the Manchester Evening News. 'He's got the world at his feet, the new manager. 'What we need to do now is put the players in the right places and the ball in the right place. But that's harder than it sounds.'

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Gareth Southgate will not search for stars if England reach Euro 2015 as he vowed to stick with the players who are on the brink of qualification. England, who have already won Group One, face fixtures tonight in Lithuania and Moldova next Tuesday before they discover in seven days which country they must beat over two legs in October to secure a trip to the Czech Republic. But if they fulfil that aim, Southgate has made it clear he will not look to draft in players such Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling to boost England’s chances, even though they are all eligible. Warning: Gareth Southgate has told young England hopefuls they must show commitment to his project . (4-2-3-1): Butland: Gibson, Moore, M Keane, Robinson: Ward-Prowse, Chalobah: Redmond, Kane, Ince: Berahino. Former Under-21 head coach Stuart Pearce used to clash with the FA over not being able to select the best available players and often used the example of Spain, who picked World Cup winners Juan Mata and Javi Martinez when they won the 2011 tournament in Denmark. Southgate, however, does not feel there would be any benefits – either for the players or his team – by naming those who have graduated. Sterling, for instance, played in three of Southgate’s first five games but is now one of the first names on Roy Hodgson’s team sheet. I can tell you now that isn't even in my thinking,’ said Southgate. ‘Alex, for example, has been to two major championships. Those guys are seniors. I know people cite Spain, with Mata and a couple of others. But this is fairly typical of must Under 21 coaches around Europe. ‘Christian Eriksen still qualifies to play for Denmark but I don't see the Danes clamouring for him (to be involved with the Under 21s). It is that balance. You need to see what can be gained by bringing them back into this environment. Senior step-up: Raheem Sterling has become a starter for England and is seen as the future of the side . No go: Gareth Southgate has confirmed players such as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain won't play for the Under 21s . Leading the attack: West Brom striker Saido Berahino celebrates scoring for England Under 21s . ‘My job is like that of a reserve team manager at a club - you have got to adapt and adjust to the players you have got available. Roy wants to play younger players, so they are going to gain international experience. That is key.’ The standard of opposition England face over the next five days, starting here in Kaunas, will have no relation to what will be in store next month but Southgate is not concerned they will be found wanting after their educational trip to Toulon this summer. ‘We went there so the players could recognise the level that is needed and the experiences they are going to face,’ said Southgate. ‘Very few of the countries (who will be in the play-offs) are going to face a really top side prepare them for next month. There are going to be seven or eight top nations in the draw but you don’t know who will be strong. For all we know, Poland could be stronger than Spain. It is difficult to tell with age groups but I don't think we are short of talent.’","Gareth Southgate's side have already secured top spot in their group .

"By . Jim Van Wijk . Four-time Olympic champion Sir Ben Ainslie is confident his £80million America's Cup team can follow the example of Team Sky's success at the Tour de France by bringing sailing's oldest trophy back to British shores. Ainslie, 37, was part of Oracle Team USA which secured a dramatic 9-8 win over Team New Zealand in San Francisco last Autumn, and is determined to repeat that success with a home-grown team come 2017. Ben Ainslie Racing has been backed by the likes of co-founder of Carphone Warehouse Sir Charles Dunstone, and deputy chairman of the London Organising Committee of the 2012 Olympic Games Sir Keith Mills while experienced New Zealand America's cup campaigner Jono McBeth will take on the role of sailing team manager. Bringing it home: Sir Ben Ainslie won the 2013 America's Cup as tactician for Oracle Team USA . The British team is set to be based in Portsmouth under the flag of Yacht Squadron Racing, a club affiliated to the Royal Yacht Squadron. There will be a three-year racing programme ahead of 2017, with some six America's Cup World Series events between nations hoping to qualify for the showpiece match-off against the holders. 'Winning that event in San Francisco with a good group of guys was way more powerful than anything I had done as an individual, to share that experience, but standing there on the podium lifting the America's Cup, it did cross my mind that it would be much more fulfilling with a British team, and so that is the goal,' Ainslie said during Tuesday's launch at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, which was attended by the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton. 'It is never easy, but it is about bringing together the right people who have built successful corporations, designed successful America's Cup boats, sailed on winning boats, brought the Olympics to Britain - and we have those people. King of the sea: Four-time Olympic champion Ainslie will lead a Portsmouth-based America's Cup team . 'I know what it is like to be successful. All of us are here to win the America's Cup and we will do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. 'I learned a great deal aboard Oracle in San Francisco and I would not be challenging if I did not believe we have a real chance of winning this time. 'For me, it is probably not the easy option, but it is the right option. 'It is about righting a wrong and bringing the cup back to British waters for the first time ever. 'Our budget is around £80million, which is realistic to try to win, we don't just want to take part. 'We need to bring together the right talent in terms of designers, we have a fantastic core team and will be building the team out from here. Asset: Red Bull Formula One designer Adrian Newey has been linked to Ben Ainslie Racing . There have been reports Red Bull designer Adrian Newey could come on board with BAR, whom Ainslie said would be a 'tremendous asset.' The British Olympian added: 'We have already started on that process of trying to learn from motor sport, specifically with some of the engineering challenges we have with these boats. 'We have also seen cycling become very technologically based in their performance, Team Sky for example, the approach they have. 'That is what we need to follow in their footsteps and need to be better in every department (than our rivals), which these teams have done.' The America's Cup was first contested off the Isle of the Wight back in 1851 and after the inaugural trophy was lost to the United States' boat, it has never been won back by a British yacht club. Ainslie said: 'This has been a childhood ambition since I was growing up down in Cornwall, watching the British team, backed by Peter de Savary, racing in the old 12 metres. 'Something just bit me and I had this burning desire and ambition to ultimately be part of a winning British America's Cup team. 'It was a fantastic experience with Team Oracle last time, we have a lot of respect for them, also for Team New Zealand and all the other competitors, but ultimately we want to win this for Britain. BAR already have in place some 40 per cent of the funding needed and are confident of bringing the remainder on board over the coming months. Dunstone said: 'The British public have become captivated by the America's Cup, we have got the world's greatest sailor and a very exciting format - if this is ever going to happen, it is going to happen now.'","Four-time Olympic champion Ainslie will lead a British based team in 2017 .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A swan dubbed 'Asboy' has become the latest in his family to terrorise punters and kayakers as they try to enjoy a relaxing jaunt on an idyllic Cambridge river. The feathered fiend, who is the son of 'Mr Asbo', is now causing his own havoc on the River Cam after his father was removed in 2012 after becoming too violent. 'Asboy', who rules the roost by swimming up and down pecking at punters and flying into families on the waterway, has already attacked a canoeist and swimmer. Scroll down for video . 'Asboy' has been attacking any boat which gets close to it on the River Cam in Cambridge and regularly attacks . The swan is the son of 'Mr Asbo' who was removed from the River Cam in Cambridge in 2012 for being violent . 'Asboy' rules the roost by swimming up and down pecking at punters and flying into families on the waterway . It has prompted locals to describe him as 'the most vicious swan ever' amid fears the animal may soon seriously injure someone. At their last meeting the river authorities, The Cam Conservators, revealed how the bad-tempered bird attacks any boat which gets too close, including canoes and rowing boats. 'He's the most vicious swan I have ever seen. When I was punting with my family he stuck his neck in the boat and hissed and pecked at us,' said John Gale, 45, from Cambridge. 'I even saw him trying to bite through the chains which tether the punts to the wall of the river.' Resident Mary Samuels, 67, who lives near the river, said many believed 'Asboy' was now worse than his predecessor. 'He swims up and down the river as if he is patrolling it and flaps his wings and hisses at anything which gets in his way,' she said. 'Asboy' has been described as 'the most vicious swan ever' by locals who fear he may soon seriously injure . One resident said 'Asboy' was now worse than his vicious father who had to be moved 60 miles away . Punt operators believe some tourists are flocking to Cambridge just to see 'Asboy' and take photos of him . 'We thought things would settle down when they removed Mr Asbo, but his son is much worse. There have been some near misses and I don't think it will be long before someone is really injured.' One punt operator said: 'Asboy seems to have become a bit of a tourist attraction and people are even more interested in taking photos of him than King's College.' The Cam Conservators moved 'Asboy's' father 'Mr Asbo' to a secret location about 60 miles away in 2012 because they said his behaviour was risking the safety of river users as well as himself. His behaviour left dozens of rowers with cuts and bruises and a special marshal even had to be employed during a university rowing race to prevent him from injuring the students. One resident said: 'We thought things would settle down when they removed Mr Asbo, but his son is worse' The bird is said to patrol the waterway and peck, hiss and flap its wing at anyone who gets too close to him . The swan has even been spotted trying to break through the chains which line the idyllic River Cam . John Gale, 45, from Cambridge, described 'Asboy' as 'the most vicious swan I have ever seen' Ever since, 'Asboy' has taken over as chief of the waterway and has spent the last 18 months trying to scare visitors away. He hasn't just taken a disliking to humans though - he has also been spotted attacking one his own, as well as confronting a huge bull. Last year, horrified tourists watched on as 'Asboy' ferociously grabbed a passing swan by the neck with his beak, held it under the water for 15 seconds and then sat on it to stop it wriggling free. The hapless victim only escaped the attack when its partner came to the rescue. The river authorities, The Cam Conservators, confirmed the bird had already attacked a swimmer and canoeist . The 'vicious' swan patrols the River Cam, pecking at people, punters and rowers as they glide along the river . A large bull has been the only creature to stand up the swan so far, and scared it back down into the river . Visitors watched in horror as 'Asboy' turned on one of his own and grabbed a fellow swan by the neck . 'Asboy' is following in the footsteps of his father 'Mr Asbo' (pictured) who regularly attacked on the River Cam . However, 'Asboy' met his match when he left his safe haven of the water and tried to scare off a huge bullock. The huge animal was simply grazing on the riverbank when the swan approached and prepared to launch an attack. However, the bullock was having none of it and, unperturbed, simply advanced towards 'Asboy' and put him back in his place by forcing him back down into the river.","'Vicious' swan nicknamed 'Asboy' has been terrorising punters on River Cam .

"By . Sam Turner . John Quinn became one of a select band of trainers to record a Group One victory on the flat and a Grade One success over jumps when The Wow Signal maintained his unbeaten record in the Prix Morny at Deauville yesterday. Quinn, who won the Triumph Hurdle in 2012 with Countrywide Flame, was on hand to see Frankie Dettori instigate a Group One double aboard the winner who stepped up on his Coventry Stakes triumph to repel fellow Royal Ascot scorer Hootenanny by half a length. The Wow Signal, now unbeaten in three starts, will be stepped up in trip to seven furlongs for his next assignment according to the ecstatic winning trainer. Wow: Frankie Dettori blows away the field with The Wow Signal as the horse maintains it's unbeaten record . Success: The Wow Signal won the Prix Morny at Deauville and has ridden to victory in it's three outings . Quinn said: 'He's crying out for seven furlongs and I would say it will either be the Dewhurst or the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere for him next. 'We're delighted. It's a great day. I wouldn't say this is what we do it for, but these are the days you dream of. 'Everyone works hard and you hope you might come across a horse like him. We're thrilled to have our piece of it.' Dettori completed his Group One brace when the James Fanshawe-trained Ribbons produced a fine turn of foot to land the Darley Prix Jean Romanet from fellow British raiders Princess Loulou and Secret Gesture who filled the places. Trained up: John Quinn the trainer was ecstatic with the win and says the horse will go up to seven furlongs next time out . Fanshawe, who coincidentally is also a member of the Group One/Grade One winning club, felt the Prix de L'Opera at Longchamp on Arc de Triomphe weekend would be a logical step for Ribbons. 'I asked Frankie about moving up in trip but his advice was to stay at a mile and a quarter as he thinks she just has that turn of foot.'  Roger Varian is eyeing a step up in trip to seven furlongs for Lowther Stakes runner-up Cursory Glance, with either the Moyglare Staks or the Rockfel Stakes the preferred options.","The Wow Signal is now unbeaten in three starts .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . A flying saucer flew high over the Pacific off Hawaii on Saturday as Nasa tested a new vehicle that could one day be used to transport people to Mars. The test drive of the Low Density Supersonic Decelerator, which was carried 120,000ft (23 miles) into the sky by a helium balloon, was considered a success despite the parachute not fully working. Cheers in the control room as the vehicle launched from the island of Kauai quickly died down however, when it became clear that the new inflatable braking system had failed to property unfurl. The low-density supersonic decelerator could one day be used to take astronauts to Mars . Flying saucer: The spaceship-shaped test vehicle is lifted by a helium balloon in Hawaii . NASA officials were still pleased with . the flight for the $150 million experiment, and said it was a . pretty good test of technology that might one day be used to deliver . heavy spacecraft - and eventually astronauts - to Mars. The . space agency also hopes that the new craft could one day replace the . same parachute design in use since the twin Viking spacecraft landed on . the red planet in 1976. Saturday's launch over Hawaii was the first successful attempt after previous flights were marred by strong winds that could have blown the craft into no-fly zones. Technology needs to advance, or else humanity won't be able to fly beyond the International . Space Station in low-Earth orbit, according to Michael Gazarik, head of space . technology, at NASA headquarters. 'Technology development 'is the surest path to Mars,' Gazarik said at a June briefing. The device is hoisted on to a launch tower which is used to attach it to the balloon . To infinity and beyond: The $150 million flying saucer shaped vehicle is put through its paces . The test vehicle is seen drifting into the distance on Saturday . Viewers around the world followed . portions of the mission in real time over the internet thanks to cameras . on board the vehicle that beamed back low-resolution footage as it . ascended over the Hawaiian island of Kauai. After . taking off at 11.40am from the Pacific Missile Range Facility, the . balloon boosted the disc-shaped vehicle over the Pacific. Its rocket motor ignited, carrying the vehicle at supersonic speeds to an altitude of 34 miles above the surface. The environment this high up is similar . to the thin Martian atmosphere, where NASA still uses 1970s technology . to bring rovers and other devices onto the Martian surface. A graphic shows the proposed flight path and touch down for the flying saucer . 'We want to test them here where it's . cheaper before we send it to Mars to make sure that it's going to work . there,' project manager Mark Adler of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory . said during a pre-launch news conference in Kauai in early June. When . it prepared to drop back the Earth, a tube around the vehicle was . supposed to have expanded like a Hawaiian puffer fish, creating . atmospheric drag to dramatically slow it down from Mach 4, or four times . the speed of sound. In flight: The saucer-shaped vehicle hovering Saturday over Kauai, Hawaii, during an experimental flight high in Earth's atmosphere . Saturday's test: This image shows the launch of the high-altitude balloon carrying a saucer-shaped vehicle for NASA . The parachute, which on this occasion failed to fully unfurl, is used to guide the vehicle to a safe ocean splashdown. At 110ft in diameter, the parachute is twice as big as the one that carried the 1-ton Curiosity rover through the Martian atmosphere in 2011. Engineers planned to analyze the data and conduct several more flights next year before deciding whether to fly the vehicle and parachute on a future Mars mission.","The Saturday launch over Hawaii took the spacecraft 23 miles above the surface and into the Earth's atmosphere .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A football fan has lost 7st by giving up his season ticket and replacing match day pies and binge drinking with meditation and ultra-marathons. William Robertson, 28, from Glasgow, once weighed almost 21st. He now weighs 13st 4lb. He was a fanatical Celtic FC supporter who drank 30 pints of lager over the course of a weekend while following his team. William after his first 100 mile ultra marathon (left) and at his heaviest in 2012 (right) Facing declining health, the father-of-one made the painful decision to hang up his green and white supporter's jersey and commit to a lifestyle of regular exercise and healthy foods like kale and wheatgrass for the sake of his daughter. Mr Robertson, of Glasgow, said: 'I was a really big drinker in the days when I followed Celtic all over Europe. Then I gave it all up for running, and I feel amazing for it. 'I live a more peaceful life. I don't miss the football or the drinking now. I'm calmer in my mind and my body is much healthier. I would much rather being running up mountains.' William struggled with weight issues since his schooldays growing up as a Celtic fan in Anderston, Glasgow. He said: 'I had depression as I grew up and my weight would yoyo up and down. My PE teacher told me I couldn't run, which was upsetting.' William followed his team across Europe in their Champion's League campaigns, taking in matches in France, Portugal and Spain. William Robertson drinking before a Celtic away game against Portugal . William would bing- drink during football matches, but now lives a more peaceful life. Pictured before (left) and running one of his first marathons while still overweight (right) He said: 'If there was a match on a Saturday I would start drinking on a Friday night and continue until Sunday evening. I had around 30 pints on an average weekend.' A pint of lager amounts to around 200 calories, meaning that over the course of the weekend Mr Robertson was consuming an extra 3,000 calories a day on top of his daily food intake. As the weight piled on, Mr Robertson's health started to fail. By 2012 Mr Roberton weighed 20st 10lbs and found he would get out of breath easily while walking to his seat at Celtic Park. He said: 'At the match I would put on a happy face, but deep down I wasn't happy. I wasn't healthy and I knew I needed change.' Breakfast: Large fry-up . Lunch: Pizza and a pint . Dinner: Fish and chips from his local takeaway . Snack: Chocolate bars and crisps throughout the day . Breakfast: Wheat grass and spirulina with bananas and . strawberries . Lunch: Spinach and kale . in a wrap . Dinner: Vegan pasta . Snack: Nuts and fruit throughout the day . In January 2013, after the birth of Ava-Jane, his daughter, he decided to take charge of his life . In the . winter of 2012, Mr Robertson's doctor delivered the shocking news he had . deranged liver function and an inflamed stomach - and that unless he . changed his lifestyle, he could be dead within two years. In . January 2013, after the birth of Ava-Jane, his daughter with partner . Karen McIntyre, 29, he decided to take charge of his life. In a dramatic lifestyle overhaul, he switched to a . vegan diet and began marathon training. He said: 'I looked into my daughter's eyes and I knew I needed to make her happy, and I wanted to set a good example for her. 'All I had was a tracksuit. I wore hill-walking shoes at first. I knew I had to stay on course for my daughter.' William with his daughter Ava-Jane (right) and his nephew Martin at the end of a 5k run . Mr Robertson completed his first marathon in April 2013 in a time of four hours 53 minutes. He said: 'It was incredibly hard because I weighed 19st 6lb at the time. I still managed to get to the finishing line eventually. 'I decided to stop going to the football entirely. The unhealthy food and boozy weekends didn't fit with my new lifestyle. 'I found I didn't miss watching the games - my time was completely filled with training and marathon runs.' Before beginning his weight loss, he typically ate a large fried breakfast, followed by a pizza and a pint for lunch. For dinner he would often get fish and chips from his local takeaway and would snack on chocolate bars and crisps through the day. Today, he typically eats wheat grass and spirulina with bananas and strawberries for his breakfast. For lunch he will have spinach and kale in a wrap. For dinner he now goes for the healthy option of vegan pasta. He will now snack on nuts and fruit throughout the day. He said: 'I actually eat more now - up to 4000 calories to give me energy for running - but it's all healthy food. You don't get fat on spinach and kale. 'Now I'm vegan I'm at much less risk of heart disease and my liver and stomach are much more healthy. 'In August this year I completed my first ultra marathon. It was 100 miles and extremely difficult but it's an amazing accomplishment. 'The rush I get from completing a marathon is a hundred times better than the one I used to get when Celtic would score.' Mr Robertson, a trainee counsellor, took on a charity challenge to run 2014 miles this year - and completed it with six months to spare. He said: 'I gave up Celtic for my new lifestyle. I sometimes see my old friends when I go for a drink of water in the pub but the laddish drinking and football lifestyle are now firmly behind me.'","William Robertson, 28, from Glasgow, once weighed almost 21st .

"By . Beth Stebner . An investigation has been launched after an elderly bus monitor was belittled, picked on, and threatened by a group of merciless middle school students who called the woman fat, ugly, and poor. Karen Huff Klein, 68, is seen in the 10-minute video, which has been viewed more than a million times ,trying to ignore the endless taunts and cringe-inducing epithets from the students, and wipes away tears after several particularly scathing comments. Greece Central School District officials In upstate New York phoned police on . Wednesday after viewing the video and students thought to have been involved have been questioned at the school and officials are debating whether to bring any formal charges. Scroll down for videos (WARNING: DISTURBING CONTENT) Tormented: Karen Klein, 68, was taunted and tormented by middle school students in Greece, New York in a difficult-to-watch 10-minute video . On the road: Mrs Klein had been a bus driver for 20 years, and a monitor for three and said never in all that time has she been so upset . But in a heart-warming turn of events, . donors from across the country raised almost $250,000 for Mrs Klein, . who has been serving the school district for more than 23 years, in . hopes that she can take the vacation she’s always dreamed of. Mrs Klein, a widow of 17 years, worked as a bus driver in Greece, New York for 20 years, and has been a bus monitor for the last three years. 'I want the boys punished, but I don't know how,’' Klein told Matt Lauer . on TODAY on Thursday. 'It made me feel really terrible, but I will get . over it. I've gotten over everything else.' Her duty is to ride in the bus with students, making sure that they behave themselves on the route to and from school. For that, she gets paid around $15,000 annually. She told the Today show host that it took large reserves of willpower not to retaliate. 'It took a lot of willpower because I'm not usually that calm — just ask my kids,’ she told Lauer. Expressing his thoughts on the matter, Lauer said he was outraged. 'As a parent,' Lauer said, 'let me apologize for those children because what they did was despicable.' The veteran bus driver had strong words for the parents of the children who bullied her. 'I'm sorry that your sons acted the way they did,' Klein said. 'I'm sure . they don't act that way at home, but you never know what they're going . to do when they're out of the house. 'They should've been taught to . respect their elders no matter who it is.' Mrs Klein told WHEC in Rochester that the ride on Monday started out as any other day. ‘Everything started out as usual,’ she told the station. ‘I don’t know what happened.’ She said that the four students who relentlessly heckled her were often full of mischief, but things quickly spiralled out of control on this particular day. The video, which was uploaded to YouTube by a concerned third party, has become a national internet sensation, garnering more than 1,000,000 views in days flat. At one point, Mrs Klein turns to the teens and says with arms folded: ‘Unless you have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all.’ Unacceptable: At one point, a student says: 'If I stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** lard' Brighter days: More than 9,000 people have raised almost $200,000 for Mrs Klein in hopes that she can take a dream vacation - or even retire . One of the kids responds: ‘Shut the f*** up,’ and then asks why there is water on her face. ‘Are you sweating?’ the student asks. ‘No, I’m crying,’ Mrs Klein says. The video shows the teenagers getting more and more crude. At one point, a student says: ‘You’re so ugly, your kids should kill themselves.’ One of her sons had committed suicide 10 years ago, msnbc.com reported. At the 6 and a half minute mark, a student said: ‘If I stabbed you in the stomach, my knife would f***** go through like butter, because it’s all f***** lard.’ MailOnline is not naming or picturing the students, as they are all minors and the investigation is on-going. In interviews after the video surfaced, the grandmother of eight explained how she tried not to respond to her tormentors. ‘I was just trying to ignore,’ she told WHEC.com. ‘I’m hoping they would go away, but it doesn’t work.’ Mrs Klein, who is hearing impaired, watched the 10-minute video for the first time Wednesday morning at the police station as she agreed to help police with the investigation. She did not hear all of the horrific things said by the students until she was at the precinct. Shocked: Mrs Klein watched the 10-minute video for the first time at the police station as she agreed to help authorities with the investigation . Closely monitored: She works as a bus monitor for the Greece School District, which is outside of Rochester; the school district says appropriate punishment will be given to the students involved . Greece Central School District had contacted authorities Wednesday morning about the disturbing video. According to WHEC.com, the students who were involved will be forced to attend a meeting with their parents, lawyers, and the school superintendent. 'It's just plain mean, no one should have to live with that.' -Bullying victim Karen Klein . After the board and superintendent hear their cases, they will decide the appropriate disciplinary measures. Assistant Superintendent Deb Hoeft told the Democrat and Chronicle: ‘All students found to have a role in this incident will face disciplinary action,’ adding that as the current school year has come to a close, the students will face punishment come September. The school district urged people not to act rashly, saying in a written statement: ‘Although their behaviour was inexcusable, we also have concern for the safety of all involved. 'We urge patience to allow us to investigate and determine the appropriate discipline.’ If criminal charges are filed, the case will likely go to Family Court, the Democrat and Chronicle reported. As of Thursday, more than 11,000 have donated almost $250,000 for Mrs Klein’s dream vacation. While the bus monitor is most certainly thankful for the striking generosity of strangers, she told the D&C that there is one thing that would really make her happy – an apology from the four students that turned an ordinary afternoon bus route into a nightmare.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . How old are Saturn's rings? That’s a question that has puzzled scientists for quite some time. Some believe that they came to be in the last few hundred million years due to the accumulation of material, possibly from a destroyed moon. But now evidence from the Cassini spacecraft suggests they have a much more ancient origin, coming into existence about 4.4 billion years ago. How and when Saturn's rings formed (Cassini image shown) has continuously puzzled scientists. Most say that if they had an ancient origin of about 4.4 billion years then they should be dirtier than they are now. However, new evidence says they can be that old - their just aren't many pollutants for them to accumulate . As reported by Nature News, scientists at the University of Colorado found the rings are very poor at accumulating material. Launch: 15 October 1997 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida . Dimensions: 22 feet (6.7 metres) high; 13.1 feet (4 meters) wide . Total weight: 5,712 kilograms (12,593 pounds) with fuel, Huygens probe, adapter, etc . Orbiter weight (unfueled): 2,125 kilograms (4,685 pounds) Power: 885 watts (633 watts at end of mission) from radioisotope thermoelectric generators . Distance traveled to reach Saturn: 2.2 billion miles (3.5 billion kilometres) Key instruments: Imaging radar, cosmic dust analyser, infrared mapping spectrometer . It had been thought that, if the rings were up to 4.4 billion years old, then they should have turned black as they collected particles from elsewhere in the solar system. However the scientists found the rate of accumulation was about 40 times lower than expected. This explains why they are so clean, despite their age. ‘If the pollution problem is not as severe, then the rings could last a lot longer before they turn black,’ Dr Phillip Nicholson, a planetary scientist at Cornell University told Nature. The research was presented by Dr Sascha Kempf, a space physicist at the University of Colorado. It was based on data collected by Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around Saturn. With his colleagues, Dr Kempf found that, over seven years, the rings had accumulated just 140 particles from elsewhere in the solar system. This rate of just 20 particles per year was 40 times less than expected, and suggests it is a lot less dusty out by Saturn than thought. Other theories for the formation of the rings include the possibility that a moon was ripped apart in the past few hundred million years, creating vast amounts of debris around the gas giant planet. Here shadows can be seen cast across the rings in this image from Cassini . Nasa's Cassini spacecraft (illustration shown) launched on 15 October 1997 and arrived in orbit around Saturn on 30 June 2004. During this time it has dramatically increased our knowledge of the planetary system, revealing vast bodies of liquid on the surface of Titan, giant storms on Saturn and much more . It also supports the theory that the rings are ancient - around 4.4 billion years. ‘The . rings can be three to ten times older than we used to think,’ said Dr . Larry Esposito, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado . Boulder. One of the main pieces of evidence for Saturn’s rings being so old comes from the abundance of water-ice in their composition. The amount of water-ice is too much to have been brought to the rings by other means such as comets, suggesting they must have formed in the early solar system. However others believe they formed much more recently when a moon was gravitationally ripped apart, while some say an unknown recycling process may keep them looking fresh.","Scientists at University of Colorado say rings could have an ancient origin .
It had been thought the cleanliness of the rings meant they formed recently .
But evidence shows that there just isn't much pollution for them to collect .
This means they could have formed up to 4.4 billion years ago .
Evidence for this comes from water-ice in the rings that must have formed in the early solar system ."
"By . Liz Hull . Working as a pawnbroker, Mark Manning was used to seeing weird and wonderful things coming through his shop. But even he was sceptical when one customer walked in with 101-year-old relics from the Titanic in a plastic carrier bag. The punter claimed part of the collection which included a fragment of the doomed ship’s metal hull, had been gifted to him by George Tulloch – one of the men behind the controversial decision to bring artefacts up from the seabed in the 1990s. Mr Manning told the Daily Mail he thought his luck was 'too good to be true' when the collector brought the relics to his shop in Chester . The collector told the Daily Mail he had been fascinated with the Titanic since he was a child. His decision to sell the collection 'was never about the money' and rather a way of allowing other people to admire the artefacts . After examining some accompanying documents, Mr Manning took the customer at his word and agreed to hand over £15,000 for the collection. To his amazement the story checked out and the relics have since been valued at more than £1.2million. Last night Mr Manning, 50, said: ‘Initially, I thought it was mad, a bit of a hoax. It just seemed too good to be true. ‘For a start who carries around 100-year-old relics in a plastic bag, it just seemed a bit crazy. ‘But then the customer began to tell me his story, about how he came to own them. He had all the supporting documents, so it began to seem less insane and appeared genuine. ‘It was a massive gamble, handing over . the £15,000, but now I know the collection is worth a lot more. I had . one offer for £1.2million, but I don’t want to sell them just yet. I . want people to get a chance to see them first.’ The . customer, a civil servant and avid collector, from Wirral, Merseyside, . became obsessed with the story of the Titanic as a young boy after he . inherited a piece of wooden stairwell from a first class cabin on the . liner. Among the artefacts is a fragment of the doomed ship's hull and a piece of wood taken from its grand staircase . The collector, who wishes to remain anonymous, also had in his possession a block of wood which was used to sit the engine upon while it was being made . His great grandfather was given the small piece of carved wood by a deckhand on board the Cable Ship Minia which was sent to recover bodies and debris from the Titanic immediately after it sank. The customer's great grandfather befriended the man who had worked on the Canadian vessel during the First World War. When it emerged that Mr Tulloch and his company, RMS Titanic Incorporated, were planning an expedition to the ship, the collector, who the Daily Mail has spoken to and agreed not to identify, penned a letter to the salvage company boss. He initially expressed his disgust, . believing the wreck, which was found at the bottom of the North Atlantic . Ocean in 1985, should be left untouched as a memorial to the 1,500 . people who perished when it famously struck an ice-berg on its maiden . voyage in April 1912. A piece of wood from the ship's grand staircase (imagined here in plans for a replica vessel, Titanic II) was given to the collector's great grandfather during the First World War. He later inherited it and began collecting other relics . The collector was outraged when he learned an expedition team was travelling to the seabed to recover part of the wreck in the 1990s sand wrote to George Tulloch, one of the team, to complain . To his surprise, Mr Tulloch wrote back, saying it was the company’s aim to preserve the wreck for future generations and included a piece of coal salvaged from the ship. It was the beginning of a pen pal relationship between the two men, who corresponded for seven years before Mr Tulloch’s death, aged 59, in 2004. During that time Mr Tulloch also sent the collector a two inch piece of hull – believed to be one of the largest pieces owned by a private individual – as a gift. The small piece of rusted steel was accompanied by a letter which confirmed that it was salvaged from a cabin on the upper right hand section of a 17 ton section of hull, known as ‘the big piece,’ which was raised from the seabed in 1998. The recovered piece of coal was given to the collector by George Tulloch, one of the men behind the controversial decision to bring artefacts up from the seabed in the 1990s . George Tulloch, pictured above, gave the collector a piece of the ship's hull after recovering it in an expedition in the 1990s. The two men remained in touch until Mr Tulloch died in 2004 . Last night the collector told the . Daily Mail: ‘It was never about the money, so I’m not kicking myself. I . have been interested in the Titanic since I was a boy. I inherited the . staircase, then built up my collection over 15 years. ‘But it deserves to be . cherished, it’s no use being locked up and out of view and I thought . Mark, with his contacts, would be the best person to get it out there . and seen. ‘It got to the . stage where I couldn’t look at the piece of hull or handle it because it . is so fragile, I was terrified it might get stolen and I realised I . wasn’t the right person to own it. ‘It’s a very rare, valuable ordinary looking object which should be viewed by ordinary people, but not owned by one.’ As . well as the piece of coal, staircase and hull, the collection also . includes a piece of the wooden block used to sit the engine upon while . it was being made, a small section of green patterned carpet from first . class and iron from a gantry used in the creation of the ship’s hull. The tragic ship has fascinated people for 100 years. An artist recreates black and white images in colour here to give a more realistic imagination of what it looked like in 1912 . The collector was constantly worried he would be burgled with the precious artefacts in his possession . Enthusiasts have spent years trying to recreate the ship and its interior in art, exhibitions, film and television . Mr . Manning, who runs Regal Pawnbrokers, in Deeside, near Chester, said he . has all the original, signed letters and documents from Mr Tulloch which . accompany the collection and they have been authenticated. Mr Manning is thinking of loaning the relics to a museum. He said it was 'amazing' to own a piece of a story the 'whole world knows about' ‘I paid £15,000 which doesn’t seem much now compared to the historical value,’ he added. ‘The . collector was paying insurance on the relics, he was worried he could . be burgled and wanted to get rid of that burden, as well as getting some . money for it. ‘He also wanted other people to see it, so I’ve been taking it around schools - kids think it is great to be able to touch a genuine piece of the Titanic. ‘I’m also going to look into loaning it to a museum for a few months. ‘We’ve already had an offer of £1.2million for the piece of hull, but when I sell it the collector will get a fair share. We have a gentleman’s agreement because I had no idea it was worth that much when he walked through the door. ‘We see some very unusual items in the shop, but the whole world knows the story of the Titanic so to have a piece of the original ship is amazing.’ The story is one of several unusual tales filmed at the pawnbrokers for a new fly-on-the-wall documentary series on HISTORY. Pawn Stars UK continues Mondays at 9pm on HISTORY .","Mark Manning, 50, bought the collection for £15,000 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . The world has been abuzz with news of Rosetta’s arrival at its comet target recently, with the mission making headlines across the globe. But next year on 14 July 2015 an even more remarkable mission will reach its climax - Nasa’s New Horizons probe will flyby Pluto in the culmination of a nine-year journey, returning the first ever close-up images of the dwarf planet. And Nasa has announced that the spacecraft has now crossed the orbit of Neptune, the last planetary crossing on its way to Pluto, in record time. The New Horizons probe (artist's illustration shown) has passed the orbit of Neptune on its way to Pluto. Officials at Nasa in Washington DC heralded the milestone as a key moment for the mission. This was the largest major planetary crossing before the spacecraft arrives at Pluto on 14 July 2015 . The piano-sized spacecraft, which launched in January 2006, reached Neptune’s orbit in just eight years and eight months. 8 June 2001 . New Horizons is selected as a mission by Nasa . 19 January 2006 . The spacecraft successfully launches at a speed of 36,373 mph (58,536 km/h) - the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth orbit, 100 times faster than a jetliner. 7 April 2006 . The spacecraft passes the orbit of Mars . 28 February 2007 . New Horizons flies by Jupiter at a distance of 1.43 million miles (2.31 million km). 8 June 2008 . The probe passes Saturn’s orbit. 25 February 2010 . New Horizons reaches the halfway point in its more than 3 billion-mile (4.8 billion km) journey to Pluto. 18 March 2011 . The spacecraft passes the orbit of Uranus. 25 August 2014 . Yesterday’s milestone saw the spacecraft pass the orbit of Neptune. 14 July 2015 . New Horizons’ flyby of Pluto begins. Extensive images and readings will be taken before and after, including mapping of the surface of Pluto and its moon Charon to a resolution of 25 miles (40 km). 2016-2020 . New Horizons will flyby one or several Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), if any suitable candidates can be found. 2026 . The mission formally ends. 2038 . If still operational, the probe will explore the outer reaches of the sun’s influence on the solar system - the heliosphere. That beats the previous time to travel this distance of nearly 2.75 billion miles (4.4 billion km) taken by Voyager 2 by nearly four years. And in a rather fitting tribute to its predecessor, the milestone comes on the 25th anniversary of Voyager 2’s encounter with Neptune on 25 August 1989. ‘It's a cosmic coincidence that connects one of Nasa’s iconic past outer solar system explorers, with our next outer solar system explorer,’ said Dr Jim Green, director of Nasa’s Planetary Science Division at Nasa Headquarters in Washington. ‘Exactly 25 years ago at Neptune, Voyager 2 delivered our “first” look at an unexplored planet. ‘Now it will be New Horizons' turn to reveal the unexplored Pluto and its moons in stunning detail next summer on its way into the vast outer reaches of the solar system.’ While New Horizons is crossing the orbital path of Neptune, the mission was not designed to encounter the planet - instead, Pluto is the primary target of the mission. In fact, Neptune is actually 2.48 billion miles (4 billion km) from New Horizons at this moment, and with the spacecraft heading out of the solar system it will never encounter the gas giant. Nonetheless the milestone is important - it marks a key stage of the mission and the last ‘hurdle’, with all the major planets now crossed ahead of the rendezvous with Pluto next year. New Horizons' journey is so long that when it first launched on 19 January 2006 Pluto was still classified as the ninth planet of the solar system. It was controversially reclassified as a dwarf planet in August 2006 when another body, Eris, was found to be larger. This led to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefining what it means to be a planet, and in the third category Pluto fell short - namely, it had not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit. But whatever its designation, the mission is of huge importance. Barring a few blurry images from Hubble and other long-distance images, no human has ever truly seen what Pluto looks like. Although Neptune (pictured by Voyager 2 in 1989) was nowhere near at the time, the crossing of its orbit is still an important moment in the New Horizons mission. It also came on the 25th anniversary of Voyager 2's first look at the gas giant back in 1989 . This diagram shows New Horizons' position now. For reference, 1 AU (astronomical unit) is defined as the distance from Earth to the sun. The diagram also shows how it takes more than eight house to communicate with the spacecraft as it is so far away . Just like Voyager 2’s visit to Uranus and Neptune, which returned the first ever images of those worlds, New Horizons’ discoveries promise to be just as groundbreaking. Pluto is an extremely distant world, orbiting the sun more than 29 times farther than Earth. It is about two thirds the size of our moon. With a surface temperature estimated to be -229°C (-380°F), the environment at Pluto is far too cold to allow liquid water on its surface. Pluto's moons are also in the same frigid environment. The moon Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The distance between them is 12,200 miles (19,640 km). Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth days. Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of Charon always faces Pluto - this is called tidal locking. Compared with most of the planets and moons, the Pluto-Charon system is tipped on its side. What Pluto looks like is still unknown, with some estimating it might have a vast icy surface, possibly even with a cloudy atmosphere, while others say it will be more barren like Neptune’s moon Triton. ‘Nasa’s Voyager 1 and 2 explored the entire middle zone of the solar system where the giant planets orbit,’ said Dr Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. ‘Now we stand on Voyager's broad shoulders to explore the even more distant and mysterious Pluto system.’ Like Voyager 1 and 2 before it, New Horizons is also on a path towards the Kuiper Belt after it has flown by Pluto. The Kuiper Belt is a disc-shaped region of icy objects past the orbit of Neptune, but it still remains somewhat of a mystery. In fact Nasa had been concerned that rogue Kuiper Belt objects could pose a threat to New Horizons if it encountered one on the way. In addition, while Pluto is the main goal, officials had been hoping to find a suitable target in the Kuiper Belt the spacecraft could visit. However, none has yet been find - and it will be a race against time to find one before the spacecraft leaves the vicinity of Pluto next year. This image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2012 shows Pluto and its five moons. Styx, also known as P5, is the most recently discovered. The main targets for the New Horizons mission will be Pluto and its largest moon Charon, with the spacecraft planning to map the surface of the to a resolution of 25 miles (40 km) New Horizons captured this view of the giant planet Neptune and its large moon Triton on 10 July 2014 from a distance of about 2.45 billion miles (3.96 billion kilometers) - more than 26 times the distance between Earth and the sun. It's thought Triton may bear some similarities to Pluto .","The New Horizons probe has passed the orbit of Neptune on its way to Pluto .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Deep in a Russian forest lies a secretive training facility intended to prepare people for a voyage into space. Few outsiders have ever seen it with their own eyes - but one photographer has now gained rare access to the heart of the Russian space programme. Mitch Karunaratne took the snaps of the highly secret Star City complex - known in Russian as Zvezdniy Gorodok - inside forests around 30 miles (48 kilometres) from Moscow. Photographer Mitch Karunaratne from London has taken rare photos of Russia's Star City. The facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles (48 km) from Moscow Pictured is a Sokol spacesuit used by cosmonauts when travelling to and from space . The centre, run by the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), is in a closed town where the legendary cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin trained. 12 April 1961 - First human in space (Yuri Gagarin) 5 May 1961 - First American in space (Alan Shepard) 16 June 1963 - First woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova) 21 July 1969 - First human on the moon (Neil Armstrong) 7 June 1971 - First manned space station (Soyuz 11/Salyut 1) 12 April 1981 - First manned space plane (Space Shuttle/STS-1) 20 November 1998 - Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) begins . 15 October 2003 - First Chinese taikonaut in space (Yang Liwei) In fact it was previously named after Gagarin and his family still live within the area of the centre. Today - despite the area no longer being a military zone in 2008 - it remains difficult for outsiders to gain access. 'I grew up as self-proclaimed space fanatic - I was born in 1969 - and a photograph of Neil Armstrong landing on the moon has always hung in every house I've ever lived in and I've met Buzz Aldrin,' said Mr Karunaratne, from London. 'I grew up in the era of Star Trek and Star Wars and the Clangers, however the Russian space programme was always on the fringes, always mysteriously out of reach I felt. 'Star City is up and running and still the main space training centre for all international cosmonauts and astronauts visiting the space station as well as the centre for the Russian space programme. 'It is located about 30 miles [48 kilometres] east of Moscow, set within a deeply wooded area and it doesn't appear on any maps or have road signs. 'It is a ""closed"" town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees.' The Star City facility is located deep in a forest about 30 miles (48 km) from Moscow . Star City is used to train astronauts and cosmonauts for missions to space. Shown here is a centrifuge, which is used to test how cosmonauts respond to the intense G-forces experienced in take-off and landing . Training facilities like these are used by agencies to prepare astronauts for missions in space. Seen here are mock-ups of modules from the ISS, which cosmonauts use to familiarise themselves with the layout before they travel to the space station . The Sokol spacesuit, shown, was first introduced in 1973 and is still in use by cosmonauts today. It is only worn during take-off and landing, however, and is used to keep astronauts alive in the event of their spacecraft depressurising. For spacewalks a separate Orlan suit is used . The centre was established in the 1960s and was originally called the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre. Since then it has trained at least 400 astronauts - or cosmonauts as they are called in Russia - from more than 30 different countries.' 'All personnel involved in the Soviet and Russian space programme, and their descendants have the right to live here,' Mr Karunaratne continued. 'It houses both space training installation buildings, as well as accommodation, shop, church and a school. Yuri Gagarin's family still live here.' Mr Karunaratne said inside the complex there were several life-size mock-ups of the International Space Station used for training. One is even submerged in a swimming pool where cosmonauts can practice their space walks, although Mr Karunaratne was not allowed to take photos in this area. Seen . here is a mural of historic Russian space achievements. On the left is . the short-lived Buran shuttle that completed one unmanned flight in . 1988. In the middle is Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial . satellite, which launched in 1957. On the right is Buran attached to the . Energia rocket that took it to space . The facility is used to prepare astronauts and cosmonauts for trips to the ISS (pictured) Shown here is a mock-up of the Soyuz spacecraft used to take astronauts to the ISS. The Soyuz family of spacecraft has been in operation since the 1960s, although it has been continuously upgraded since then . Shown here is  a statue of Yuri Gagarin, who on 12 April 1961 became the first human ever to travel to space. Star City was once also known as the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre . The centre also contains technology from the history of Russia's space endeavours (shown). There is also a mock-up of the ISS in a swimming pool cosmonauts can use, although Mr Karunaratne was not allowed to take photos in this area . 'All cosmonauts from the Soviet space programme and then the Russian Federation Space Agency have trained at this facility,' he added. 'The facility has a very lived in look, but is cared for with such obvious pride. The heart and soul of the Russian space programme, and indeed the Russia people, can be felt very profoundly here. 'Dreams of outer space have been a constant in Soviet society since the 1920s, which have survived perestroika and the break up of the Soviet Union in 1991. 'Access was limited, and although I was able to walk around with my guide freely I was not able to take photographs [everywhere]. 'The image of the lake Yuri Gagarin helped to dig, the supermarket where all goods are plentiful and cheap, the washing of the current space team pegged to a green nylon rail - will forever be those images I wish I had taken.' 'It is a ""closed"" town - and very tricky to get access to and has a heavily guarded border and access is for residents and space trainees,' said Mr Karunaratn. Shown is a mock-up of a docking module on the ISS . The facility apparently has a very lived in look but is 'cared for with pride' according to Mr Karunaratn.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Google's self-driving cars will be designed to exceed maximum speed limits, in a move to improve safety. The lead engineer for the project has revealed the vehicles will go 10mph (16km) faster than the speed limit. The purpose is to avoid the Google car being significantly slower than speeding vehicles around it, which would increase the risk of an accident. California-based Google's driverless cars, unveiled in June (shown), will be able to speed on roads. This was revealed by lead software engineer Dmitri Dolgov in a test drive. The cars will be capable of going 10 mph (16 km/h) above the speed limit, which will allow them to match the speed of other cars for safer driving . In the US driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot. It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. Dmitri Dolgov, the lead software engineer for the project, said research showed that sticking to the speed limit when other cars are speeding can be dangerous. Therefore, the car’s speed would be altered depending on traffic conditions, Reuters reports. The same . radar and camera system used for collision avoidance would be used to . monitor the speed of other cars and match to them accordingly. There will be a limit, however, and if another car is dramatically speeding then Google's driverless car will go no faster. But . Mr Dolgov did not elaborate on how the feature would work with speed cameras or . mobile police, and whether it could incur a speeding fine. Google hopes the autonomous cars will drastically reduce accidents on the roads. 'Thousands and thousands of people are killed in car accidents every year,' said Mr Dolgov. 'This [the car] could change that.' In June, it was announced that driverless cars would be allowed on British roads in six months. The UK government will allow the first trials of computer-controlled cars to start in January 2015, as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars. Ministers have previously admitted that the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles (press image shown) The Government will allow the first trials of computer-controlled cars to start in January 2015, as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars on UK roads. Ministers have previously admitted that the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves. The vehicles work by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s position on an electronic map. In June, Google unveiled its computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals. Instead, it has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing the planned route. Google says the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’. The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service. Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.","California-based Google's driverless cars will be able to speed on roads .

The firm says that the Wi-Fi 16GB base model costs roughly £117 ($188) for Apple to build - and it sells them for £269 ($329) each. Scroll down for video . The iPad mini in pieces: US site IHS has added up the cost of the components, and found the base £269 model costs £117 to make . The IHS study found the iPad mini's bigest costs were: . £50 ($80) - Display (with associated control chips) £9.70 ($15.50) - Memory chips . The 32GB and 64GB models cost an additional £19 ($31) and £39 ($62) to build, respectively. During its Q4 earnings call last week, Apple's CFO Peter Oppenheimer said that the . iPad mini gross margin is 'significantly below' the rest of the products . Apple is cranking out. 'We’re unwilling to cut corners in delivering . the best experiences in the world,' Tim Cook added. Apple also said it will be working to make iPad mini production more . cost-effective in the future. In its report, IHS further looked at the components that are being used . to build the iPad mini. It was found that LG Display and AU Optronics . are supplying roughly $80 in display components for the 7.9-inch tablet. iFixit’s teardown released on Friday found that Samsung is also making . display components, too. Samsung was also found to be supplying the A5 . chip in the iPad mini in IHS’ report. However, IHS wasn't the first site to rip apart Apple's new mini. Ifixit.com got there before the gadget even went on sale . The . £269 iPad mini goes on sale tomorrow, but the site has already posted a . look inside the gadget set to become the must-have this Christmas. Apple's iPad mini uses a display from South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, one of Apple's major suppliers and also its fiercest rival in the global mobile-device market that the two companies dominate. Analysts say the Silicon Valley-based iPhone maker is trying to wean itself off its reliance on Samsung, as both giants are embroiled in a bitter international legal battle over mobile patents, for everything from microchips to displays. In the first dismantling of the iPad mini, which will be sold in 34 countries beginning tomorrow, teardown and gadget-repair specialist company, iFixit, discovered a Samsung display driver chip, which indicated that Apple had picked the Korean firm's screen technology. Like most producers of mobile hardware, the U.S. company typically employs several suppliers for the same components in its gadgets. Apple has been known to use screens made by LG Display, for instance. The chips (coloured) which reveal Samsung as the screen supplier for Apple's iPad mini . The ifixit site details the entire process of dismantling the iPad Mini . The iFixit.com site is well known for taking apart gadgets as soon as they are released. It aims to help third parties find out how easy their new gadget are to repair, and each new gadget is given a 'repairability index'. In the iPad mini's case, the index was low - meaning few parts can be repaired. However, the firm did find that the Samsung manufactured screen can be easily repaired. 'Though the markings on the back of the LCD (display) don't turn up much information, the Samsung display driver IC (chip) reveals that Apple, once again, went with Samsung in its display manufacturing,' iFixit said, detailing the teardown on its website. However, Apple does sometimes uses more than one supplier. Supplying parts for Apple's iPhones and iPads - some of the industry's most popular and advanced gadgets - is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers. The iPad mini also employs SK Hynix Inc flash memory, a Broadcom touch controller, and a number of microchips from Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc, according to iFixit, which acquired one early. The 7.9-inch iPad mini marks the Apple's first foray into the smaller-tablet segment. The company hopes to beat back incursions into its home territory - carved out with the original iPad's launch in 2010 - with 7-inch slates that are popular with consumers, even as it safeguards its lead in a larger tablet space that even deep-pocketed rivals like Samsung have found tough to penetrate. It has won mostly positive reviews focused on its ability to wrap most of the functions of its full-sized iPad sibling into a smaller package, but critics pointed out the higher price tag of the iPad mini and an inferior display relative to those of rival products like Amazon's Kindle Fire HD and Google's Nexus 7. The main motherboard of the iPad Mini, with Apple's a% processor visible in the centre. However, the site has so far failed to identify many of the other components in the gadget. Online sales have run for a week, but Apple has not disclosed sales numbers so far. Friday's global sales rollout may offer a hint of demand for the gadget, which analysts expect to be strong. Apple and Samsung are engaged in patent disputes across several countries, and Apple is believed to be seeking ways to rely less on Samsung. But the Asian tech powerhouse remains a key supplier for Apple, manufacturing its application processors and providing other components. Samsung has stopped supplying displays for Apple's iPhone, and plays a reduced role in the full-sized iPad, according to DisplaySearch. Apple is also buying fewer memory chips from Samsung for the iPhone 5, relying more on Hynix and Elpida Memory. Many analysts believe Apple will also gradually phase out Samsung as the main producer of the mobile micro-processor and shift business to rival supplier TSMC.

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . The megarocket Nasa is developing to take man to Mars is so loud it could damage nearby buildings and even astronaut's hearing when it takes off, the space agency has admitted. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, the Space Launch System (SLS) will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. Nasa has been testing small scale versions of the rocket amid fears it could be too loud. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off . Four SLS RS-25 engines will be used to power the world's biggest rocket into orbit. 'A 5-percent scale model, including solid rocket motors, of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is ignited to test how low- and high-frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad,' the agency said. 'The data collected from the tests will be used to help direct and verify the design of the rocket's sound suppression system.' Previous tests have shown that most ofthe acoustic energy being emitted from a rocket engines is concentrated in the low to mid frequency ranges. 'This may have the potential to damage structures or harm personnel in the immediate vicinity of the test stand.' a Nasa report warned. The SLS is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today said it is about to start testing the  engines for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the Apollo rockets. Four engines, a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011, will be used on the mega-rocket. 'This test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for SLS that are different than the space shuttle,' said Steve Wofford, SLS Liquid Engines Element manager. Earlier this year Nasa signed a $2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. 'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager. A 5-percent scale model, including solid rocket motors, of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) is ignited to test how low- and high-frequency sound waves will affect the rocket on the launch pad. 'We are passionate about NASA’s mission to explore deep space. 'It’s a very personal mission, as well as a national mandate.' This milestone marks NASA’s first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon. Scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017, the SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs. The biggest rocket ever made: The SLS will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds . There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. The initial flight-test configuration will provide a 77-ton capacity, and the final evolved two-stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons. The rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station, and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system. 'The potential use of SLS for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'SLS has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos.' Currently under construction, NASA’s Space Launch System will be the world’s most powerful launch vehicle. Designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations, including an asteroid and Mars, SLS is working toward a first launch in 2017. For that first flight test, the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons (77 tons) of payload into low-Earth orbit, almost three times what the space shuttle could carry. From there, SLS will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons (143 tons), more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry. 'While many people think of the Space Launch System in terms of human exploration, SLS could have a wide application in a lot of other areas, including space science,” said Steve Creech, assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for SLS. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . Nasa's previous rockets, the Saturn, Shuttle and right, the smaller configuration of the new SLS . 'For missions to the outer planets, for example, SLS could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible, such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times.' Agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper, a proposed mission to one of Jupiter's icy moons, on the SLS rocket, and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system’s outer planets, rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed, reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles. In the case of the Europa Clipper, for example, the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles. 'For as long as people have been launching rockets into space, mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width,” Creech said. 'Depending on how large you make it, it can only go so fast, which in some cases limits where you can go. 'Today, if you want to send a mission to the outer planets, you have to be able to make it fit within that box. With SLS, we’re about to make that box much larger. An artist's impression of the vast hanger needed to set the rocket up for flight . 'With the space shuttle, for example, we were able to launch missions like NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope that were about the size of a school bus. 'With SLS, you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried Hubble. 'It’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions.' 'The Space Launch System could be really game-changing for space science,” said ACO manager Reggie Alexander. 'For some missions, it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out. 'A Mars sample return mission, for example, could be flown using only one rocket instead of three. 'But for other destinations, SLS lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of Saturn’s moon Enceladus.' an artist's impression of the rocket heading for the launch pad .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Anthony Marsh earns £232,000 a year as head of the West Midlands and East of England ambulance services - £90,000 more than the Prime Minister . An ambulance service boss who earns more than the Prime Minister claimed £30,000 in 16 months for hotel and transport expenses, it has been revealed. Anthony Marsh earns £232,000 a year as head of both the West Midlands and East of England ambulance services - £90,000 more than the Prime Minister. He took up the joint role in January 2013 and works three days a week for the East of England service and two for the other. The move brought a £50,000 increase to his salary. He came under fire from health minister Dan Poulter, the MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, earlier this month who said his salary package was 'unacceptably high' and sent a 'very bad message' to front-line staff. According to records obtained by the BBC, Mr Marsh has stayed at 92 hotels in the last 16 months and claimed over £13,000 in expenses to cover his visits. The amount includes 20 nights at the four-star Pullman St Pancras hotel in London which cost the taxpayer £4,514. Since July 2013 he has also claimed more than £10,000 in taxi and car costs and over £6,000 on train fares. The ambulance services claim that Dr Marsh's combined role saves £130,000 in public money and said he had no choice but to stay in hotels. A spokesperson said: 'Like every ambulance service chief executive in England, Dr Marsh spends time in London meeting MPs, other stakeholders, officials from NHS England and working on national projects through the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives. 'As he is currently representing two ambulance services, this work is being delivered more effectively and efficiently for the taxpayer. 'Mr Marsh is currently running two ambulance trusts; he does not receive the salary of two chief executives saving the taxpayer approximately £130,000 on the cost of having a substantive chief executive in each ambulance trust. 'By comparison, within the same two areas, there are 11 chief fire officers and 10 chief constables.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the tax payer is getting poor value for money. Mr Marsh has stayed at 92 hotels in the last 16 months and claimed over £13,000 in expenses to cover his visits. The amount includes 20 nights at the four-star Pullman St Pancras hotel in London, pictured . 'As Mr Marsh works several days a week in the East of England each week, it would not make sense to have him travel down on a daily basis and therefore requires accommodation. 'This is governed by NHS Guidelines. The lowest cost is always sought for his overnight accommodation such as using standard government negotiated rates. Health minister Dan Poulter, pictured, criticised Mr Marsh earlier this month who said his salary package was 'unacceptably high' 'Rather than spending upwards of seven hours a week driving himself, where he would be unable to work, Mr Marsh is often driven between the West Midlands and East of England. 'This allows him to continue working throughout the journey once again bringing value for the tax payer.  Mr Marsh has not made any subsistence claims. 'However, he has spent or been entitled to allowances to the value of just under £3,000, none of which have been claimed. 'West Midlands Ambulance Service is exceeding its performance targets this year despite very challenging circumstances.' The spokesperson added that his joint role has helped make £8million savings of back office functions and management savings which was funding 400 staff, 147 ambulances and over 60 rapid response vehicles. Mr. Poulter's office yesterday said he was on holiday and would not be able to comment on the issue. Dr Marsh was brought in to oversee EEAS after criticising its failings in a report. The service says Dr Marsh has put in plans so its targets are met. The expenses figure was revealed in a Freedom of Information request submitted by the BBC.","Anthony Marsh is head of West Midlands and East of England services .

"By . Richard Spillett . A quiet village in East Anglia has been rocked after a haul of weapons were allegedly uncovered at the home of its parish council chairman. Deadly automatic guns, including an Uzi sub machine gun and an AK-47 assault rifle, were allegedly found during a police search of the home of Jim Arnold in the village of Wyverstone near Stowmarket, Suffolk. Arnold, 49, who has been chairman of Wyverstone parish council for around seven years, has been charged with four counts of possessing prohibited weapons. Probe: Police in Wyverstone, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, following the arrest of the parish council chairman . The charges relate to the Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine gun, an AK-47, a self-loading rifle and a bolt action shotgun. Arnold, a former crane driver who is suffering from terminal cancer, was remanded in custody by Ipswich magistrates yesterday. He entered no plea to the weapons charges and was deemed too ill to enter pleas to two charges of assault. A series of controlled explosions were carried out by an Army bomb disposal team at his home on Monday to destroy other suspect items found by police. Officers refused to confirm what had been found, other than describing it as 'some produce'. Arnold's house, which he shared with his wife Lyn, 45, remained cordoned off today as a search of his four acres of land continued. An Uzi sub-machine gun like that pictured is alleged to have been among the weapons found. File photo . Officers were first called to the house on April 13 to reports that a woman in her 40s had been assaulted on March 27 in an alleged domestic incident. Arnold, who is believed to have been a licensed firearms holder, was arrested on suspicion of assault before police began searching his home. Andy Mellen, the vice chairman of Wyverstone parish council, said: 'Jim Arnold is a diligent council chairman. 'He is well known in the community and has served the village well in various ways for many years.' Another local who asked not to be named said: 'It is no secret that Jim is very ill and only has weeks or months to live. The charges against Mr Arnold also relate to alleged possession of an AK-47 rifle, like that pictured. File photo . 'He was a legitimate firearms holder and had an interest in guns for many years.' Another villager criticised police, saying: 'No-one is telling us anything. They won't say how long it's going on for or whether there's any danger. 'It's been like this for the past week. It all goes quiet then all of a sudden everything kicks off, the police move in and all hell breaks loose. It's been a total nightmare.' Anne Hornsblow, who lives near Arnold's home with her husband Rob and their children, said: 'Everyone in the village is wondering what's going on. Response team: Controlled explosions were carried out in the area of Suffolk following a police raid . 'There's a lot more talking going on and everyone seems to be taking their dogs for a walk outside our house to see what's been happening.' Other villagers said they had been told to expect a heavy police presence to remain in the village for another fortnight while further searches are carried out. Sgt Jon Taylor of Suffolk Police said the controlled explosions were carried out to 'dispose of some produce' found at the property. Interest: One local resident in Wyverstone said 'everyone in the village is wondering what's going on' He said the investigation had 'far-reaching implications' for the whole force, with officers drafted in from across the county. Arnold will appear before Bury St Edmunds magistrates on April 28 for a further hearing on the assault charges. He is due before Ipswich Crown Court on May 1 to answer the weapons charges. A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'Police are continuing investigations following the discovery of a number of weapons at an address in Wyverstone.' The spokesman confirmed that a 45-year-old woman from the Stowmarket area had been arrested on suspicion of possession of a prohibited firearm. She has been interviewed by officers and bailed to return to police on May 21.

"By . Sarah Griffiths For Mailonline . For years humans have wondered what the high pitched noises made by dolphins and whales mean. And now scientists believe that the marine animals squeal with delight to express their happiness. Initially, noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food. Scientists believe that dolphins (stock image) and beluga whales squeal with delight to express their happiness.Initially, noises emitted by the animals when offered fish treats were thought to be signals communicating the presence of food . Whales and dolphins are known to squeal when they hear a whistle or buzzer associated with a food reward. But when dolphins and beluga whales were trained to switch off a sound after making a deep dive, they announced a successful mission by producing the same squeals. It was the equivalent of a human 'whoop' of triumph, according to U.S. cetacean expert and author Dr Sam Ridgway. 'The [squealing] behaviour had transferred over to another stimulus that wasn't food,' he said. To investigate further, Dr Ridgway and his colleagues at the National Marine Mammal Foundation in San Diego, California, analysed decades of recordings of experiments involving dolphins and beluga whales. Beluga whales (pictured) also squealed to signify happiness in the experiment. Dr Ridgway said: 'We think we have demonstrated that it [the victory squeal] has emotional content.' They wanted to understand if the delay before a squeal was mirrored by the release of dopamine, a brain chemical that stimulates sensations of pleasure. Dopamine release takes 100 milliseconds, so if the delay between a reward promise and a squeal was longer than this amount of time it would suggest a connection. In dolphins, the delay was 151 milliseconds and in beluga whales 250 milliseconds. 'We think we have demonstrated that it [the victory squeal] has emotional content,' said Dr Ridgway, whose findings appear in the Journal of Experimental Biology. Male dolphins have been known to show their romantic side by presenting their partner with a specially-selected piece of seaweed, which if she accepts, can lead to a relationship and mating . Documentary crews have previously filmed a male bottlenose dolphin wooing his sweetheart with a strand of seaweed, indicating the animals communicate in many different ways. Courting males will spend hours looking for the longest and most perfect strand of seaweed to present to the objects of their desire. Before handing it over, a hot-blooded dolphin will use the seaweed to show off his prowess: tossing it between his fins, tail and nose. If the female is impressed, she will accept the seaweed and then play with it seductively like a feather boa, they said. Now they are an item, the amorous pair will do the dolphin equivalent of cuddling - stroking each other with their fins - as they twist and spin around each other. By using remote-controlled cameras shaped like small animals, the documentary makers discovered that dolphins can be pushy parents, loyal friends, and prone to adolescent bursts of machismo.","Scientists at the National Marine Mammal Foundation in San Diego, California, first thought the noise indicated the presence of food .

"By . Bianca London . Tired but elated, Pippa Middleton was . all smiles as she completed a cycling race across America after covering 3,000 miles in six days, ten hours and 54 minutes last week. The 30-year-old younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge was the only woman in a team of eight, which also included her brother James, 27, and it seems she's sparking a healthy new trend. Ahead of the Tour de France, and following Pippa’s triumphant cycling challenge, a new group of cyclists getting on their bikes has been identified. An inspiration: Pippa Middleton, who recently finished the Race Across America, has inspired a new breed of female cyclists . REAR’s, which stands for Regular Enthusiastic Amateur Racers, are 30-something women who cycle for pleasure but are still competitive with their friends and want to achieve fitness or personal goals. This new category of women have been inspired to cycle this summer by events such as the Tour de France and celebrity influencers like Davina McCall, 46, Victoria Pendleton, 33, and Fearne Cotton, 32, who all love their bikes. This is the first year since 1989 that women have been able to cycle Le Tour alongside men and one cycling company has pinpointed rocketing sales of bikes and accessories as a result.

Fears in recent days that Greece was heading rapidly towards a chaotic default have sent the interest rates on 10-year government bonds soaring to new record highs. Today they were 25.3 per cent, more than 23 points higher than the German equivalent, suggesting investors have all but given up on Greece being able to fix its public finances. The main fear of a Greek bankruptcy is that it could destabilise other financially troubled European countries, potentially causing a defaults in Portugal, Ireland, Spain or Italy. It would also have a knock-on effect on banks, many of which are which are large holders of Greek government bonds. Moody's rating agency downgraded the credit ratings of two French banks, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole, after a period of huge volatility in the markets as investors fret about exposure to Greek debt. However, the downgrade seems to have sparked some optimism on the market. After a shaky start to trading, the FTSE 100 is up 93 points at 5267, the Nasdaq up 1.49 per cent, the French CAC up 1.98 per cent and German DAX up 1.98 per cent. Credit Agricole is also up around 3.1 per cent. Italy meanwhile gave final . approval to a 54billion euro austerity package today, . although the plan has so far done little to reverse investor alarm . over whether the country can manage its debts. Rome was dragged deeper into the crisis yesterday, with borrowing costs hitting a . record high at a crucial bond auction as confidence in the nation’s . finances tumbled. Relief: Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi shakes hands in Rome after Italy's parliament gave final approval to an austerity package . Economy . A Greek exit from the single currency would lead to 'financial and economic disaster', Citigroup has warned. The main fear is a full debt default could de-stabilise other financially troubled European countries, potentially causing a domino effect of defaults in Portugal, Ireland, Spain or Italy. The eurozone is the UK's major trading partner and the shockwaves of this could easily send the UK tumbling back into recession and markets back into turmoil reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis. Britain could be hit with losses of up to £366billion from the collapse of the Greek economy. The potential devastation of banks and other City institutions would be equal to 24 per cent of our annual national output, or £14,640 for every family in the UK, according to Fathom Financial Consulting. Banks . The real danger to British banks from Greece is not direct exposure but the unknown contagion effect. British banks say they have 'only' £2.5billion of exposure to Greek government debt, while the Bank of England says the potential losses would be £8billion. Royal Bank of Scotland, 83 per cent owned by the UK taxpayer, has set aside £733million for losses on its £1.4billion holdings of Greek bonds. But more importantly, Greek default could bring events to a head in the far bigger economies of Italy and Spain, where British banks have greater exposure. Meanwhile, the cost of borrowing on international markets would spike, laying the conditions for credit crisis II. The industry remains in a fragile state after the last banking collapse and further big losses would once again raise fears about solvency. Last time, the Government was forced to step in to save vast swathes of the industry. To do so again would pulverize public finances and leave the Government’s financial credibility in tatters. That outcome would eventually take the UK down the same route as southern Europe and Ireland, with international markets demanding far more drastic cuts than the Coalition would dream of doing by choice. Government . In terms of direct bailouts, its’ all down to the European Union and the IMF.  Chancellor George Osborne has insisted Britain would not contribute any more money to Greece. The British Government has a relatively small direct exposure to Greek government debt, standing at roughly $3billion. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's . government tabled a confidence motion which have would force it to resign . if it lost the austerity vote. Credit markets are already factoring in a 90 per cent . chance of a Greek default. In a three-way conference call later today, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Nicolas Sarkozy will press Athens to honour its national austerity pledges in return from more bail-out cash from Europe. The alternative, the Greek government is being warned, is national bankruptcy and a rupture in the single currency. Greece . has warned it will run out of cash in a few weeks and needs an 8 billion euro tranche next month to pay wages and pensions. It follows the crippling downgrading of two French banks this morning because of their exposure to Greek debt by credit rating agency Moody's. Credit Agricole was cut from Aa1 to Aa2 and Societe Generale from Aa2 to Aa3. This morning, shares in the two giants fell 4 per cent. A . third bank, BNP Paribas, was kept on review for a possible downgrade. The move has raised fears of a fresh crisis in the banking sector. However, in the face of speculation about a Greek exit from the euro, European . Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso insisted the answer to the . growing threat to the currency was a more, not less, integrated European . Union. Speaking  before he addressed the European Parliament, Mr Barroso said the debt crisis has turned into a 'fight for European integration'. He said: 'This is a fight for the jobs and prosperity of families in all our . member states. 'This is a fight for the economic and political future of . Europe. 'This is a fight for what Europe represents in the world. This is . a fight for European integration itself.' He . defended the Greek government - widely accused of failing to implement . planned austerity measures - saying it had taken significant steps to . deliver on its commitments. But UKIP leader Nigel Farage slammed the 'Troika' as a group of 'part-time overseas dictators' telling the Greeks what to do. He . said: 'Unless Greece is allowed to get out of this economic and . political prison, you may well spark a revolution in that country.' Deputy . Prime Minister Nick Clegg today dismissed suggestions that Britain . should take the opportunity presented by the crisis to renegotiate its . relations with the EU. He . said: 'On a day like today, when people have been talking openly about . the possibility of a Greek default, the key question is not, how do we . seek to renegotiate the United Kingdom's place in the European Union in a . threat that hasn't even materialised yet.' Greek prime minister George Papandreou . is expected to ask Germany and France for the debt swap to go ahead. It . was a key part in a planned, second bailout for the cash-strapped . country which was agreed by EU leaders in July. Under . its provisions, private investors are expected to share the cost of the . rescue plan, by exchanging their Greek government bonds with . longer-maturity, lower-coupon paper.

Outrage: Cuts to deal with the crisis have sparked riots in Athens. Here taxi owners clash with riot police outside the Transport Ministry . The Centre for Economics and Business Research said it had modelled good and bad scenarios and Italy could not support its debt even if bond rates fall back - unless the eurozone's third-largest economy sharply increases growth. Low growth in Italian is causing grave problems for the Government in financing its national debt, which stands at a massive 120 per cent of GDP.The recent hikes in the rates Italy has had to pay investors to take government debt off their hands is an unsettling echo of the pressures that forced Ireland, Greece and Portugal to seek a rescue from eurozone partners and the IMF and raised the prospect that the country could actually default on their debts. For heavily indebted eurozone members, seven per cent is the 'line of death'. That is the yield on Government bonds - the price demanded by investors - above which the country concerned is believed to be in deep trouble. Italy's at the moment stands at a record 5.6 per cent. Greek newspaper Kathimerini said without citing sources: . 'The PM will ask the two leaders to increase pressure to their banks to . the take part in the PSI (private-sector involvement)' The conference call between Mr Papandreou, Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel is scheduled to take place at about 4pm. Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos has asked his counterparts in 57 . countries to tell him by September 9 how many of their banks intend to . take part in the debt swap. Greece has said it might cancel the transaction if less than 90 per cent of bondholders take part. Bankers said last week the take-up rate was at about 70 per cent. Kathimerini reported, also without citing any sources, that Venizelos told a government meeting on Tuesday 27 countries, including some large European ones, have not yet responded. The euro has declined against the dollar and yen due to concern over Greece’s debt problems which will raise borrowing costs for other countries in the region. The euro fell 0.5 per cent to 104.75 yen this morning in London from 105.25 in New York yesterday -it reached 103.90 on Sept. 12, the lowest since June 2001.","Fears grow of an imminent debt default by Greece .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . and Leesa Smith for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The Boomers' World Cup nightmare has worsened after basketball's governing body opened an investigation into the controversial loss to Angola in which Australia was accused of tanking. A day after a surprise defeat to Turkey sent them out of the tournament in Spain, Australia learned they could face disciplinary action from FIBA over the manner of last week's loss to Angola. The Boomers rested several key players and let a 15-point lead slip in the third quarter against Africa's No.1 nation in their final group game in Gran Canaria to go down by 91-83. The 91-83 loss meant Australia could not face the all-conquering USA team until the semi-finals but Boomers head coach Andrej Lemanis rejected suggestions they lost on purpose. The alleged strategy proved irrelevant after a 65-64 loss to Turkey in their sudden-death round of 16 game on Sunday, but Basketball Australia must now formally defend the performance against Angola or face possible sanctions such as a fine. Scroll down for video . Angola's forward Eduardo Mingas  vies with Australia's forward Cameron Bairstow . Australia's Brock Motum fends off Angola's Eduardo Mingas . A number of star players were rested from the Boomers squad in the third round . Angola celebrating winning their game against Australia in the third round of the world cup . 'The on-court behaviour displayed by Australia in that game generated huge disappointment by basketball fans and experts,' FIBA said in a statement on Monday. 'It is widely suspected that Australia lost that game in order to avoid having to face the reigning world champions USA until the semi-finals. 'Basketball Australia has an opportunity to state its case before FIBA decides whether and to what extent disciplinary sanctions shall be imposed.' Slovenian NBA star Goran Dragic was among the fiercest critics of Australia's performance, taking to Twitter after the match to urge FIBA to take action. 'Basketball is a beautiful sport, there is no room for fixing the game like today Australia vs Angola!! @FIBA should do something about that!' he posted. With a place in the knockout stages already secured, Lemanis rested his two best performing players of the tournament, star centre Aron Baynes and sharp-shooting veteran Joe Ingles, while giving fellow starters Matthew Dellavedova and David Andersen less than four minutes each. When challenged post-match on whether his side had contested the match in the spirit of the game, Lemanis was defiant, arguing the heavy tournament schedule demanded he rest his players before the next stage of competition. 'We always, as Australians, compete the right way,' he said. Pressed on how some people would view the loss Lemanis said: 'People will make up their own minds. 'There's always going to be speculators. I can't control what people think.' Injured Australian star Andrew Bogut hit out at FIBA's comments and questioned the governing body's consistency. 'So u can naturalize a plyer who has nver stepped foot in a country, but you cant rest players in a game 2 better a draw 4 youself? Ok @fiba,' Bogut wrote on Twitter. 'Love it or hate it I have seen this and much more occur many times @fiba tournaments I have played in since 2002 (incl. Juniors).' Jubilant Angolan supporters enjoy the eight point win in the game against Australia . A dejected Australian bench watch on as the side comes to terms with losing . Australia were in contention to run away with the game when they led by 15 in the third quarter . Despite missing their two best players, NBA stars Patty Mills and Bogut, Australia had been optimistic of challenging for a first ever World Cup medal. The Boomers were on course for their first quarter-final appearance in 20 years, leading Turkey by six points with just over a minute to play in Barcelona on Sunday night. However, some poor decision-making allowed Turkey back into the game and Emir Preldzic buried a three-pointer with five seconds remaining to give the reigning silver medallists a famous win. Basketball Australia is yet to make comment on FIBA's investigation. Lemanis said suggestions of tanking were ridiculous and defended Australia as a nation that competes in the interest of fair play. 'We always, as Australians, compete the right way,' he said. When asked whether he accepted that some Australians would view the loss with an air of scepticism, Lemanis said: 'People will make up their own minds.' 'There's always going to be speculators. I can't control what people think.' The Boomers were chasing a fourth straight victory for the first time in World Cup history, and for most of the match were cruising before the wheels fell off. Guard Chris Goulding shot a team-high 22 points as the Boomers opened up a 15-point buffer. It was also an opportunity to see highly-rated No.5 NBA draft pick Dante Exum in action, and the 19-year-old didn't disappoint - scoring 12 points and handing out six assists in his 31 minutes on court. Despite fielding a second string team Australia was still the heavily backed favourites at $1.17 . Australia's Dante Exum takes on Angola's  Edson Ndoniema  and Yanik Moreira .

But an Angolan charge, led by dynamic young star Yanick Moreira's outstanding 38-point display, started midway through the third quarter and they cut the lead to just two at the final break. The onslaught continued thereafter as Australia carelessly gave up the ball, committing 18 turnovers, and played lacklustre defence as the clock wound down in the eight-point loss - prompting the tanking calls. Sports betting agency Sportsbet.com.au refunded $125,500 in bets placed on the Boomers to win the match in light of the allegations. The side was an unbackable $1.17 to win with Angola the $5.20 outsiders. 'Punters bet on the Aussies in good faith not knowing they would be resting a few of their guns and giving their reserves a go, so we think it's only fair that they get their money back to enjoy over the weekend,'  the agency's Shaun Anderson said. In good faith the betting agency refunded the amounts wagered on the match in light of the allegations . Former Boomer Shane Heal defended the tactics and said Australia were well within their right to want the best chance of winning a maiden medal. '[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter. 'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.' 'There's still games to be played that will determine the outcome of the pool. Australia is chasing its first medal in the history of the world cup .

A defiant Angola stole the game away in the third quarter . When pressed about  allegations of premeditated tanking tactics post match, Lemanis responded: . 'Nobody likes losing. (The loss) doesn't guarantee us third spot . He said the team had 'no control over that game.' 'That was always the case coming in.' Securing third spot would mean Australia would avoid a quarter-final show down against America and conveniently put them in a position to challenge for a maiden medal at the tournament. Former Australian basketball great Shane Heal said  if tanking was on the agenda, it was something that he supported in an effort for the Boomers to win a maiden world cup medal. '[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter. 'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.' But most shared a different view to Heal on social media - with one Twitter user comparing the match to Australia's infamous underarm bowling scandal. The strategy employed by the then captain Greg Chappel gave New Zealand no hope of winning when his brother Trevor bowled an underarm ball on the final play of the match.","FIBA investigates Australia's controversial loss over Angola .

"By . John Hall . Amazon is serious about using drones to deliver items to its customers, and is close to developing the technology to make it a reality, the company's CEO has claimed. In his annual letter to shareholders, which was made public yesterday, Jeff Bezos gave an update on the Seattle-based company's achievements in 2013 - including a reference to drone development. Bezos said testing of '5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles' was currently underway, adding that more drones - perhaps the models that will be put into active service - were in the design phase. Future: Amazon's Prime Air project is described as 'a new delivery system that will get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles' Bezos made reference to a Amazon's 'Prime Air' team carrying out the drone testing during his letter to shareholders. Amazon describes Prime Air as 'a new delivery system that will get packages into customers' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles'. Ongoing: Jeff Bezos said Amazon is continuing to develop and test technology for delivery drones . Earlier in the letter, Bezos said Amazon had made dramatic improvements to its delivery service in 2013 - including offering Sunday delivery in selected U.S. cities, introducing 'last mile' delivery networks in the U.K., and employing bike couriers in countries where deliveries could be slowed down by postal difficulties, such as China and India. He then added: 'And there is more invention to come. The Prime Air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles, and we are in the design phase on generations 7 and 8.' This brief reference to Prime Air has been enough to lead to renewed speculation over when customers can expect to have their items delivered by drone. A recent court ruling removed one not-insignificant obstacle in Amazon's quest, by removing the  Federal Aviation Administration's authority to ban small unmanned aircraft being flown over U.S. airspace for commercial purposes. This effectively gave businesses the right to fly small drones for the purposes of professional photography, journalism or farmland surveying. It also, theoretically, allows Amazon to introduce a drone-based delivery service. On their way: Jeff Bezos said testing of '5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles' was currently underway, adding that more drones - perhaps the models that will be put into active service - were in the design phase . In his letter to shareholders, Bezos remained realistic about the chances of Prime Air testing turning into an fully-fledged delivery service, however. 'Failure comes part and . parcel with invention. It’s not optional', he said. Bezos went on to explain that Amazon would continuing working on drones 'until we get it right' and it becomes 'something that is really working for . customers.' '[At that point] we double-down on it with hopes to turn it into an even . bigger success', Bezos added.","Jeff Bezos said Amazon is testing and developing drone technology .

Van Hooijdonk, who played for Nottingham Forest and Celtic during a colourful career in Britain, said: ‘I told the Mexican to ‘shut the **** up over the dive because it annoyed me. ‘I said “did you watch the first half as well when he went in and he should have had in one movement two penalties and he didn't get it?"". ‘Everyone forgets that.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He truly is a fatherly priest. John Cornelius, a husband and father of three, took a vow of chastity to become a married Catholic priest Saturday in a traditional ordination ceremony. His wife and three daughters watched from the pews as Cornelius, 64, started the ceremony wearing a white robe and later was covered in priestly garments as he swore his faith to God. Cornelius remained quiet as he was ordained, but showed his enthusiasm soon after. Fatherly father: John Cornelius, a husband and father of three, took a vow of chastity to become a married Catholic priest Saturday in a traditional ordination ceremony. ‘It’s wonderful. I feel like I’ve been working my whole life to answer God’s call and here I am,’ the former Episcopal priest told the New York Daily News. The 20-minute ordination took place in Immaculate Conception Church in Wellsville, New York, and was presided over by Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone and several other priests who prayed over Cornelius as he submitted himself. Cornelius’ wife of 33 years, Sharyl, gave her blessings during the ceremony, despite the reality that it means giving up sexual relations with her husband. She too promised to take a vow of chastity.For his part, Cornelius now has a new mission in life. ‘I’ve raised three girls already,’ he said Friday. The 20-minute ordination took place in Immaculate Conception Church in Wellsville, New York, and was presided over by Buffalo Bishop Richard Malone and several other priests who prayed over Cornelius as he submitted himself . Cornelius, who was previously an Episcopal priest for 20 years, found his new role with the support of his family. 'I have always had friends that are Roman Catholic priests and I appreciate what they've given up to serve god and the priesthood,' he told WGRZ-TV on Wednesday. 'I have such appreciation and affection for these guys, that it's just part of my own spirituality to do this...out of respect for them really.' Cornelius and his wife became Catholics after he left his former church two years ago, unhappy with its direction. But he was unable to make the move to priesthood until Pope Benedict XVI issued an order saying married former priests could be ordained a year ago. 'When they did that, I just jumped,' said Cornelius, 'I needed someplace where there was order. I've been a Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist...messed around with Bahá'í, Harikrishna...I was almost an Anarchist in college...so it's been a search, and it's really been a search for order.' Supportive: Sharyl Cornelius, center, has opted to voluntarily take a vow of chastity as well. The couple have three grown-up daughters, pictured. The couple weren't forced to make the decision to opt for celibacy but put themselves forward anyway. 'We don't have to take that particular vow,' Cornelius said, 'We have decided to do that voluntarily'. Though the decision came easy to him it was a long process to be approved for ordination - it even included a psychological examination. 'It wasn't easy. We had one dossier that went to Rome where they did research on us, and I had to go see the shrink, the psychologist, and other people,' he said. 'But even that only determined that you didn't have really bad things in your background that prevents you from being a priest...and then there was 14 weeks of intense instruction over the internet which was taught by St. Mary's Seminary in Houston, Texas.' Cornelius is now among the first 30 Episcopal priests throughout the U.S. to make the transition to Catholicism. Starting Monday he will lead the Fellowship of Saint Alban in Henrietta (Diocese of Rochester), a small community of former Anglicans who have joined the Catholic Church.

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . The former president of The George Washington University is under fire after making controversial statements on the nature of sexual assault. Dr Stephen Joel Trachtenberg made the comments in a Tuesday taping of the Diane Rehm Show, during a panel about Greek Life at U.S. Colleges. When the conversation turns to the reports of sexual misconduct by fraternities, Trachtenberg blames binge-drinking. 'Without making the victims responsible for what happens, one of the groups that have to be trained not to drink in excess are women,' Trachtenberg said. Scroll down for video . Victim blaming? Dr Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, president emeritus of The George Washington University, spoke on the Diane Rehm show on Tuesday, saying sexual assault could be prevented if women drank less . 'They need to be in the position to punch the guys in the nose if they misbehave. 'And so part of the problem is that you have men who take advantage of women who drink too much and there are women who drink too much. And we need to educate our daughters and our children in that regard,' Trachtenberg said . Following the show, George Washington University students flooded Twitter expressing their outrage at Trachtenberg for seemingly blaming the victims of sexual assault. '[I don't know] what's more concerning, the devolution of rape to ""misbehaving,"" or the idea that women are setting themselves up,' GW student Katie Bishop tweeted. Even one of the university's professors called out Trachtenberg for his offensive comments. Following the show, a flood of GWU students and teachers took to Twitter to express their frustrations with Trachtenberg's comments . 'They need to be in the position to punch the guys in the nose if they misbehave,' Trachtenberg said. Above, another tweet from a GWU student . Trachtenberg later qualified his statements, saying they were taken 'out of context' and that he doesn't believe responsibility shifts from the predator to the victim when the victim drinks too much. Above another tweet from a GWU student . 'Hey, Trachtenberg: sober women are raped, too. The ones responsible are RAPISTS,' wrote Professor Katherine Howell, of the writing department. Trachtenberg, currently serving as the university's professor of public service, later qualified some of his statements to the school newspaper, the GW Hatchet. He said his statements were taken 'out of context'. 'I don't believe that because a woman drinks, that shifts responsibility from a predator to her. What I'm saying is you want to have somebody you care about like your daughter, granddaughter, or girlfriend to understand her limits because she will be less likely [able] to fight off somebody who is attacking her,' he said Wednesday. Sexual assault has become a serious issue on university campuses nation-wide, with estimates that one in five women will be the victim or attempted or completed sex-assault while in college. The federal government has launched an effort to compile better statistics on the issue and the Education Department is also investigating how 55 schools handled sexual assault complaints.","Dr Stephen Joel Trachtenberg spoke on the Diane Rehm Show on Tuesday .

"By . Mike Dawes . Fabrizio Zanotti triumphed in the first four-man play-off in BMW International Open history to win his first European Tour title in the most dramatic fashion on Sunday. Zanotti, Henrik Stenson, Rafael Cabrera-Bello and Gregory Havret were all in with a shout of lifting the title after they could not be separated on 19 under par after the final round. It took until the fifth extra hole for Zanotti to clinch it, with Havret and Cabrera-Bello bowing out on the second and fourth extra holes respectively. Maiden win: Fabrizio Zanotti won the BMW International Open for his first victory on the European Tour . Eyes on the prize: Zanotti won the BMW International Open in the tournament's first four-man play-off . Sealed with a kiss: Paraguayan Zanotti celebrated his win with his wife Lucia at the Cologne-based tournament . VIDEO BMW International Open highlights . It means that Zanotti is now the first golfer from Paraguay to win on the European Tour and improves his previous best finishes of runner-up in the 2009 Open de Espana, 2010 KLM Open and 2012 Irish Open. Cabrera-Bello would have been the favourite in many eyes going into the titanic play-off tussle after notching an eagle and a birdie on the 17th and 18th holes already on Sunday. But Zanotti was the only player out of the four leaders to avoid carding a bogey in the fourth round and he maintained that statistic when it mattered most. 'I have really been playing very well in the last few weeks so I knew that if I had a good round I would have a good chance,' he told Sky Sports News. 'I have been working a lot and trying to bring up my confidence to get to this moment and finally I am here.' Winning smile: Zanotti (front) was the only player out of the four leaders to avoid carding a bogey on Sunday . World number two Stenson had looked to be in control on the first extra hole, with a birdie in sight, but he missed to keep all four men in the hunt. If the Swede was stewing over that opportunity as he walked back to the 18th tee he did not show it, finding an unlikely birdie to once again put the pressure on his rivals. Frenchman Havret became the first casualty, but the other two men rose to the challenge. Stenson, who won the BMW International via a play-off in 2006, looked like he knew exactly what was required to win on the third extra hole, putting himself in position to make an eagle. But he just missed his putt and all three men birdied as rain started lashing down. Close but no cigar: Henrik Stenson was one of three golfers to lose to Zanotti in the four-man play-off . The start in Cologne had been brought forward due to forecasts for storms and there were fears it might interrupt the thrilling climax at one point. Cabrera-Bello finally cracked on the fourth extra hole, finding the lake to bow out, while this time it was Zanotti's turn to wobble and miss a birdie opportunity after Stenson pitched to within a few feet of the pin from a difficult position. Back on the 18th, Stenson followed Cabrera-Bello into the water while Zanotti fell short of the green but, crucially, managed to stay dry. Sandy landing: Danny Willett attempts to play a ball out of a bunker at the BMW International Open . Stenson finally conceded after he was unable to make his shot from bunker fall to prompt celebrations from Zanotti. Englishman Simon Dyson fell just short of getting involved in the exciting finale as he finished on 18 under par overall. Dyson carded seven birdies in a fine fourth round, but was made to rue a bogey on the 12th hole that meant the play-off was agonisingly out of reach. Sweet swing: Mark Foster plays an approach shot to the second green during his fourth round on Sunday . He was joined by Welshman Jamie Donaldson, who continued his fine form over the weekend with five birdies in a blemish-free final round. Overnight leader Pablo Larrazabal slipped off the pace, dropping his first shots of the weekend with two bogeys on the ninth and 14th holes, as he fell two shots behind the four-strong leading pack.","Fabrizio Zanotti won the BMW International Open .

"Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises . A 27-year-old man who faces charges of murdering and sexually assaulting a baby, has told a Perth court that he 'never would have harmed' the child because he 'was looking after him'. Mervyn Kenneth Douglas Bell is on trial accused of abusing the baby for about 15 hours in March last year, including inflicting third-degree burns and bruises. On Thursday, Mr Bell, denied burning the child and said that he did not recall the baby having any injuries before he took him from Broome. While testifying, Mr Bell told West Australian Supreme Court the bruises on the baby's body were presumably caused when he fell out of a moving car. Mr Bell, who knew the child's mother, said he panicked and was upset. 'I was crying because he had fallen out of the car,' Bell testified. He told the court the boy was hurt so he cradled him against his chest, but did not inspect the 10-month-old baby for injuries or take him to a hospital. 'I just tried to comfort him, that's all,' he said. 'I didn't think he was that bad.' Mr Bell said the babies burns came from touching hot rocks while at a swimming spot. He said while under the water for 20 seconds he felt a kick to his leg, and when he came up, he found the baby head-first in the water. Water came out of the child's mouth and Mr Bell, who was in shock, performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, the court heard. While testifying, Mr Bell told West Australian Supreme Court the bruises on the baby's body were presumably caused when he fell out of a moving car . 'It was like he was choking,' Bell said.'I pumped on his chest a couple of times.' 'He just wouldn't breathe.' 'It just happened so fast,' he repeatedly said. Mr Bell told the court he did not think the mother took care of her baby and admitted the pair argued the evening before the baby died. He said the altercation began when the woman humiliated and slapped him. 'I may have assaulted her. I'm not 100 per cent sure,' he said. Mr Bell said he tore off her clothes but denies trying to run her over in his car. 'I wanted to humiliate her,' he testified. The judge-alone trial continues.

"By . Francesca Chambers for MailOnline . The vast majority of Americans think President Barack Obama should not go around Congress to make changes to immigration policy, a new poll shows. President Obama has promised to act on immigration by the end of the summer, regardless of Congress' progress on legislative reforms. But a survey released today by the polling company, inc./Woman Trend shows that just two in 10 Americans think Obama should bypass the deliberative body and go it alone. A resounding 74 percent said the president ought to work with Congress to repair the system. Even the majority of Democrats - 56 percent - said Obama should not take executive action. Teamwork: The vast majority of Americans think Obama should wait for Congress to act on immigration reform rather than take matters into his own hands . Even the majority of Democrats want Obama to play nice with Congress on the issue of immigration . Nearly two-thirds of likely voters said they also disagreed with the way Obama was handling immigration in general, including 55 percent Hispanics who were polled. Congress is currently out of session, and members are not slated to return to Capitol Hill until the second week of September . On the table when Congress left for its annual August recess were two immigration bills: one that would change a law that prevents the U.S. from sending immigrant children from Central America home immediately while giving agencies that handle immigration slightly more funding and another that would stop the president from using executive orders to provide amnesty to groups of illegal immigrants. Both bills passed in the Republican-led House after the Senate had already left town. Neither bill has a chance of making it to the Democratic-controlled Senate floor when lawmakers return, however. More than a year ago the Senate passed legislation that would make sweeping changes to U.S. immigration policies. However, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, has unequivocally said he will not allow the bill to come his chamber's floor. Boehner and the bulk of the Republican caucus in the House prefer a step-by-step approach to immigration reform. With the two legislative bodies unable to agree on how to fix the ailing immigration system, immigration reform is largely at a standstill unless the president makes good on his threat. Among the actions Obama is considering is providing work visas to the parents and guardians of children who are legal U.S. residents. The president also wants to expand his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, first established in 2012, that allows illegal aliens who were brought to the U.S. as children to stay in the country indefinitely. Republicans blame that policy for the flood of immigrant children who have shown up at the U.S.' southern border in the 10 months. Already, more than 57,000 unaccompanied immigrant children, many of whom are Central American, have come to the U.S. border expecting amnesty since the end of the last fiscal year. As many as 90,000 could arrive in the U.S. before October, government officials say. As the law is currently written, only children from Mexico and Canada who come to the U.S. illegally can be sent home immediately. Children arriving from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras must be processed by three federal agencies and given court dates before they can be returned to their home countries. Likely voters also think the government should send illegal immigrant children back home . Only 22 percent of Americans think the government should relocate illegal immigrant children pouring over the United States' southern border to communities across the nation . Republicans - and the Obama administration - would like to see changes to the law to allow Central American children to be deported more quickly. Today's the polling, inc. survey suggests that most Americans would support those reforms. Two-thirds of respondents said the government should send unaccompanied minors 'back to their home countries to convince stop sending their children here.' A mere 22 percent said the government should 'relocate them to communities across the United States to provide them safe shelter.' The Republican aligned polling firm also found that the majority of people of all political persuasions support both of House Republicans' immigration bills. An overwhelming number of respondents to the survey also said they did not think that immigrants who wrongly enter the country should be given legal status. A concern of many survey-takers was job security and the threat that illegal immigrants would take jobs away from low-wage American workers. A total of 74 percent of respondents said that the government has a 'responsibility' to 'protect' unemployed and low-income Americans from 'competition with illegal immigrants for jobs.'","The majority of Republicans, Independents and even Democrats think he should work with Congress to make changes to immigration policy .

"By . Sir Clive Woodward . This is a massive season for English clubs and England rugby — and with a few exceptions my interest in the Aviva Premiership is focused on how it impacts on Stuart Lancaster’s selections for the World Cup. It has to be that way. It will be different and special this season and the scrutiny and debates will start the moment Northampton and Gloucester kick off on Friday night. Now the dust has settled the truth is the three summer Test matches against New Zealand offered no answers to key questions being asked — and they all concern the backs. Ready for the battle: The 12 captains gathered for the relaunch of the Aviva Premiership at Twickenham . The England forwards are in very good shape — I would give my right arm to coach them — and the questions over the pack are all positive. Can Geoff Parling get into a second row containing Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury? Could a fit-again Tom Croft be accommodated in the back row? Where would Steffon Armitage slot in, if he became available? I have no serious issues with the pack and they will automatically make England competitive. There is depth, competition for places and their scope to improve over the next season, as a unit and individually, is very exciting. But to win a World Cup we need to score tries and lots of them. England must be dynamic and pose huge problems in the backs. Start: The Aviva Premiership has launched again for the 2014/15 season with Northampton reigning champions . RWC2015 will be exactly like the recent football World Cup. It will be the bold attack-minded teams with pace, vision and courage who prevail. I’m convinced England have the players behind the scrum, but we have not yet got them on the pitch together and in the right positions — and some aren’t yet playing to their full potential. So the Aviva Premiership this season, not least in this first tranche of games, before the England squad is announced for the November internationals, is going to be an important proving ground. All the England guys must raise their standards this season. There will be a big step up this autumn and then another step again at the World Cup itself. It will be fascinating to see if those who need to put their hands up can show us something special and whether they are given the licence to express themselves because the clubs’ primary concern is always winning league points. I hope so — there is a much bigger picture involved here. Prospect: Watson has been widely tipped to feature for England next summer but has to perform for Bath . ANTHONY WATSON (Bath) England wasted a golden chance to blood Watson against New Zealand this summer despite a cracking performance against Canterbury. So now he must make an unanswerable case with Bath on the fast early-season tracks and earn a start in the autumn. He can play anywhere in the back three but England will see him as a wing. Where will Bath start him? Powerhouse: Tuilagi is a regular starter for England with his strength and power but 'doesn't frighten the best' MANU TUILAGI (Leicester) Has great strength and power, but that doesn’t frighten the best. I want to see Manu spin passes out off both hands and put in a few chips. I want to see him looking for space, not contact. I know he can do it and it will transform his game. Manu could be the world-class inside centre England crave. He is so much more than just a battering ram. Starter: Farrell has established himself as England's No 10 as a world-class kicker and hard tackling . OWEN FARRELL (Saracens) I like Farrell. He’s a world-class goal-kicker, tackles hard, has got attitude and can play centre as well. He is in my squad every time, but do I see England winning a World Cup with Farrell starting at No 10? Not currently. I want to see more craft and devil in his kicking and passing, asking more questions of defences. His bravery without the ball is indisputable, but how bold can he be with the gain line, how flat can he play? Player to watch: Christian Wade has been troubled by injuries but is razor sharp when fit for London Wasps . CHRISTIAN WADE (Wasps) Huge season for the Wasps wing after nine months out with injury. He’s got gas, wonderful feet and scores tries for fun and, being a glass half-full person, I love that. OK, his defence might be suspect and he could be vulnerable under the high ball but this guy can terrify defenders. It is important that he quickly resumes normal try-scoring service for Wasps. Challenger: Freddie Burns will hope for a big season with Leicester to challenge for a No 10 England shirt . FREDDIE BURNS (Leicester) His game went stale while at Gloucester but the summer move to Leicester, and the confidence of playing in a team more used to winning, could re-energise him. For me Burns falls between the physicality and goal-kicking excellence of Farrell and the creative skills of an X-Factor like Danny Cipriani — but he has the platform now at Tigers to take his game to another level. Mercurial talent : Danny Cipriani (right) could yet make a late charge on Stuart Lancaster's World Cup squad . DANNY CIPRIANI (Sale) LIKE all the England No 10s could do with a fast start. Conducted himself very well throughout last season so that slate is surely wiped clean. Must be considered purely on merit now. I keep asking myself one question: ‘Who would New Zealand least like to see playing fly-half for England?’ And my answer is a properly utilised, fully motivated, Cipriani. Change: Sam Burgess of Rugby League'South Sydney Rabbitohs will switch codes and join Bath in October . SAM BURGESS (Bath) I’ve been hitting YouTube and am impressed by what Burgess could potentially offer at inside centre. Bath have said that is where they will play him initially, which is good, but I would fast-track him into the England squad anyway. I would also give him game time in the autumn internationals. We need to know sooner rather than later. DAVID HUMPHREYS (Director of rugby at Gloucester) I Know David well from London Irish days. He is a top-quality individual and one of the best young directors of rugby about. Gloucester should be one of the giants of the English club game, but the job has thwarted some of the best rugby brains around. Which is, I suspect, exactly why David has accepted the challenge. It will be tough but watch this space. All Black: Piri Weepu, a World Cup winner with All Black pedigree, will be the key for London Welsh . PIRI WEEPU (London Welsh) Weepu is not a ‘great’ All Black in the manner of a Richie McCaw or Dan Carter but he is a very good All Black — a World Cup winner — and you can gauge the whole-hearted character of the man by his opting for a team who will surely be battling to avoid the drop. There has been a huge influx of new players at Welsh and he has a big role to play in setting the standards. BRAD THORN (Leicester) Tigers fans will absolutely love this World Cup winner, and vice versa. A big tough mean Kiwi second row who wins trophies wherever he plays. Opponents absolutely hate playing against him. He’s 39 years old now, but when you have never relied on speed anyway, what does that matter? Do Leicester start games with Thorn or bring him on after 50 minutes? I’d start him.","England's World Cup 2003 winning coach  chooses his players to shine .

"By . Steve Robson . An investment manager dying from Motor Neurone Disease today called on the Government to allow people with terminal illnesses to take experimental drugs. Les Halpin, 55, was diagnosed with the degenerative condition two years ago and although the likelihood of finding a cure for him is unlikely, he is volunteering to try new drugs so that others have a better chance of surviving in the future. Mr Halpin, who previously enjoyed skiing and flying but is now confined to a wheelchair, has began a campaign for better medical advances after discovering there has been only one drug licensed to treat Motor Neurone Disease in the past 20 years. Change: Former statistician and investment manager Les Halpin, pictured with his wife Claire, wants sufferers of rare diseases to be able to take unlicensed drugs . There are currently an estimated . 3.5million people in the UK suffering from 'rare' diseases that are . considered uneconomic for research efforts by major drug companies. But Mr Halpin, from Tetbury, Gloucestershire, says the problem is made even worse by the bureaucracy that stops patients taking unlicensed drugs. Professor Stephen Hawking suffers from a type of Motor Neurone Disease . Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive illness that attacks the motor neurones, or nerves, in the brain and spinal cord. This means messages gradually stop reaching muscles, which leads to weakness and wasting. MND can affect how people walk, talk, eat, drink and breathe. However, not all symptoms necessarily happen to everyone and it is unlikely they will all develop at the same time, or in any specific order. There is currently no cure for MND and only one drug licensed to treat it - Riluzole. It is available freely on the NHS and has been shown to have a modest impact on survival. MND can affect any adult at any age but most people diagnosed with the disease are over the age of 40, with the highest incidence occurring between the ages of 50 and 70 . Men are affected approximately twice as often as women. About two people in every 100,000 will develop MND each year. Professor Stephen Hawking is perhaps the most well-known sufferer of Motor Neurone Disease. The physicist was diagnosed in 1963 and has to communicate using a computer system which detects movement in his cheeks. Because his nerves are continuing to deteriorate, the are fears that he will ultimately lose the ability to communicate completely, leaving his brain 'locked in' to his body. Source: The Motor Neurone Disease Association . Speaking to the Today programme on Radio 4 he said he was prepared to take the risk of trialling an unlicensed drug: 'Absolutely, and I think many other MND patients would be. Expert: Immunologist Sir Peter Lachmann said the current laws make it difficult for smaller companies to bring new drugs to the market . 'Obviously there are risks, but for most people in this situation they do a lot of research into the subject and they work in conjunction with their doctors and they aren't going to do anything too out of the ordinary. 'I will be dead anytime between this afternoon and a few years off. I already can't move my arms and my legs and I have trouble breathing. Before I had the condition, I would have agreed with them. But now my thinking is that there's so much more we can do. 'Let's try anything - what have we got to lose?' On average it takes £1 billion and 10 . years to bring a new drug to market – something so prohibitive that more . than 90 per cent of drugs do not make it through the system. Sir Peter Lachmann, an expert immunologist from Cambridge University, agreed there is a need for a change in the law. He said on the Today programme: 'The present drug regulations make it impossible for smaller drug companies to take drugs to the market. 'It can only be done by larger pharmaceutical companies.' Mr Halpin has now launched a petition, . which will be handed to the Department of Health, calling for . experimental drugs to be available in return for to terminally ill . patients giving up the right to sue if they experience side effects. He said: 'No new drug has been approved for Motor Neurone Disease since Riluzole was approved 20 years ago. 'For those with life threatening illnesses the risk-ratio of “doing nothing” is hugely significant and must be considered. People in this situation must be able to access all the information on a drug that they need - even if the risk of adverse effects or failure are great.'","Investment manager Les Halpin, 55, calls for drug laws to be reformed .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . The father of two Amish girls who were abducted in northern New York last week has said he feels sorry for the couple accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing his daughters. The parents of the girls, aged seven and 12, spoke to the Johnson Newspapers at their home in Oswegathcie on Sunday, two days after Stephen Howells Jr. and Nicole Vaisey were charged with kidnapping with the intent to physically or sexually abuse the girls. 'It's sad,' said the 44-year-old father, who is not being identified to protect his daughters. 'They must have ruined their whole life.' The Amish couple, who have 14 children, did not express any anger toward the suspects, while the girls' 19-year-old sister said her siblings were not speaking much about their ordeal. Arrests: Stephen Howells and Nicole Vaisey, both pictured, can expect more charges to be filed against them, the district attorney said. The couple allegedly snatched two Amish girls and sexually abused them . Their mother said she is grateful to have her girls back home, but daily life has not yet returned to normal. 'We feel relieved we have them,' the mother said. 'It's still not like it was.' They . spoke out as St Lawyrence County District Attorney Mary Rain revealed . that more charges are expected to be brought against Howells and Vaisey. Authorities collected computer hard drives and other potential evidence from their home on Sunday. Howells, a registered nurse at Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center, and Vaisey, a former dog groomer who had studied the psychology of rape at college, were arrested on Friday after voluntarily going to the sheriff's office for an interview. They . were charged with kidnapping with the intent to physically or sexually . abuse the seven-year-old and 12-year-old sisters, who were snatched from . their family's roadside vegetable stand in Oswegatchie on Wednesday . evening. Search: On Sunday, investigators continued to collect evidence from their home in Hermon, New York . Home: Three children lived at the upstate New York home with the couple, according to neighbors . Authorities say the couple had prowled . for easy targets and sexually abused the girls before letting them go . after about 24 hours. Howells, 39, and Vaisey, 25, are being held without bail and have a preliminary court appearance scheduled for Thursday. 'I 100 per cent expect more charges,' Rain told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on Sunday. She . said the new charges, which she would not detail, could come after she . meets with police investigators Monday or at the hearing Thursday. It's also possible prosecutors would have to wait for results from forensic tests. The . sisters were abducted on Wednesday from a farm stand in front of the . family's home in Oswegatchie, near the Canadian border. They were set . free by their captors about 24 hours later and turned up safe at the . door of a house 15 miles from where they were taken. 'Kidnappers': Vaisey, 25 (left), and 39-year-old Howells were arrested on Friday and remain in jail . There was no answer on Sunday at the St. Lawrence County Conflict Defender's Office, which is representing Howells. The . couple were busted after voluntarily coming in for an interview the St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office. Rain would not say if the couple . admitted to the crime, but they were arrested around 8:30 p.m. at the . end of questioning. Vaisey's . lawyer, Bradford Riendeau told The New York Times that she was in an . abusive and submissive relationship with Howells. He said she made a . 'voluntary statement' to investigators after her arrest and was . obtaining an order of protection against him. 'She appears to have been the slave and he was the master,' Riendeau told the newspaper. Rain said Vaisey is just as culpable as Howells. On Monday, it also emerged that Vaisey had studied rape psychology while she was a senior psychology major at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania in 2011. That year, she published research about the effects of watching pornography on attitudes toward rape, syracuse.com reported. Denials: Vaisey, pictured on Friday as she is escorted by a deputy from the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Department, claimed that she was in an abusive and submissive relationship with Howells . In the paper, she argued that . participants who saw sexually suggestive images would blame the victims . more than those who had not. She . graduated with honors from the psychology undergraduate program and, on . leaving, she said she was going to take time off college before heading . to grad school and becoming a psychology professor. She went on to . become a substitute teacher and then a dog groomer. A neighbor said they were boyfriend and girlfriend and that three other children lived in the house. On his Facebook page, Howells appears to be a father to three children. It's uncertain whether his girlfriend, Vaisey, is the mother. St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said the girls were able to provide details to investigators about their time in captivity. The girls are not being identified as they are victims of sexual abuse. The kidnappings touched off a massive search in the family's remote farming community. Searchers scoured the community of about 4,000 people but were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. Somber: DA Mary Rain, left, said she expected more charges to be filed against the couple. She is pictured with county Sheriff Kevin M. Wells, who has noted just how much the incident has shaken the community . The Amish typically avoid modern . technology, and the family had to work with an artist who spoke their . language, a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a . sketch of the older girl. The girls 'seem to be healthy' after being reunited with family, officials said. Patricia Ritchie, the state senator representing the region, said many families in the area are now reluctant to let their children play outdoors unattended. Ritchie said the Amish are responding in a way that may forever change a familiar feature of the local landscape: Some are taking down their roadside stands. 'This has sent a shockwave through their community,' she said. The couple could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted.","Stephen Howells, 39, and Nicole Vaisey, 25, were arrested on Friday for 'snatching the sisters, aged seven and 12, on Wednesday'

The Super Eagles pushed France hard in their second round match in Brasilia only for Paul Pogba's late header and a last-gasp own goal by Yobo to seal a 2-0 win for Les Bleus. It appears that will be Nigeria's final match under Keshi, who said: 'It's time for me to go back to my family and face fresh challenges.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch unhappy Nigeria fans after France defeat . Standing down: Stephen Keshi has stepped down as Nigeria boss after guiding the Super Eagles to the last 16 . The 52-year-old, who took over in 2011, has been linked with the South Africa job. Keshi has resigned his post once before, a day after winning last year's African Nations Cup, but was persuaded to stay on. Former Everton centre-half Yobo is also on his way out. The Fenerbahce defender became the first Nigerian to win 100 caps during the game against Les Bleus and confirmed soon afterwards he would not be adding to the landmark. 'This is it. I can look back on my career with great pride,' he told BBC Sport. 'I wanted to leave on a high for my country. Defeat by France was not the right way to go but I'm happy with all I've done for the national team. 'It's time to give a chance to other people to come through. Our football has a bright future and I am confident this team can achieve success sooner rather than later.' VIDEO Stephen Keshi steps down .

"By . Nick Purewal . Johnny Sexton has completed his four-year deal to return to home club Leinster from Racing Metro next summer. The British and Irish Lions fly-half has completed terms on a lucrative IRFU and Leinster central contract, in a clear boost to Ireland boss Joe Schmidt's Rugby World Cup 2015 preparations. Sexton had been widely tipped to return to Ireland after his second year in France, and has now made good on the rumours. Coming home: Johnny Sexton will return to Leinster from Racing Metro at the end of 2014-15 season . The 29-year-old has struggled to settle in France and Ireland bosses were frustrated by their inability to control how frequently the 45-cap outside-half sees action at his Paris club. 'It's a choice for my family, my international career and my extended family in Ireland,' said Sexton. 'I have a great rapport with everyone here, it was a very hard decision to make. I haven't spoken to any other French club other than Racing. Unsettled: Sexton had option of a third year and Racing wanted him to stay longer but he is not happy in France . 'Now, I don't want contract talk but to concentrate on Racing. I don't regret at all coming to France or Racing, it has been an incredible experience. 'I am pleased to be rejoining Leinster, the club where I started my professional career. 'I grew up playing my rugby in Leinster and always wanting to pull on the blue jersey so I am delighted to be able to return to play my club rugby in Ireland.' Sexton turned down a new long-term offer from Racing to complete his return home. The prolific goal-kicker remains in a fitness battle for Ireland's autumn Test series after breaking his jaw in Top 14 action against Toulon. Glory: Johnny sexton enjoyed a successful first seven year stint at Leinster, winning 3 Heineken Cups . Last season he was forced to play 13 games in 12 weeks after swapping Dublin for Paris, suffering a leg problem that threw his autumn series into doubt. Sexton came through that scare, but that left Ireland head coach Schmidt determined to bring his sole frontline star operating abroad - and outside of IRFU control - back to home soil. Sexton admitted last term that he was struggling to adapt to life in France and has now confirmed his impending Leinster return. Integral: The outside-half contributed to the 2013 series victory for the British and Irish Lions . Reigning champions: Sexton guided Ireland to the 2014 Six Nations crown and hopes to add to his 45 caps . 'Jonathan is one the best out-halves in world rugby and the IRFU are delighted that he will be playing his rugby in Ireland,' said IRFU chief executive Philip Browne. 'Irish rugby will benefit hugely from having a player of his calibre playing full-time in Ireland.' Ireland will now hope that Sexton's return will nudge a host of out-of-contract stars to sign new deals to remain at the country's provinces next term, for the crucial run to the World Cup. Leinster and Ireland were able to persuade the likes of Sean O'Brien and Jamie Heaslip not to follow Sexton's France switch last term.","Completes four-year deal to return to Irish side Leinster next summer .

"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . The Aviva Premiership will thunder back into action at the home of the champions on Friday night, armed with an emphatic endorsement from a Welsh Lion among the cast-list of new recruits. ‘I think it’s the best league in the world,’ said Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard, following his summer move from the Ospreys. He may just have a point. While the Premiership lacks the glitz of France’s money-laden Top 14 league, awash with Galacticos, it is a competition of compelling substance; fierce and tribal. Acclaiming it as the best league is a bold call but perhaps the right one. Across the Channel, leading Gallic sides rest star players away from home, thus damaging the credibility of their event. And the notion of ‘French flair’ is a remote fantasy amid the earthy tussle for the ‘Bouclier de Brennus’. Player to watch: Richard Hibbard is a world-class hooker who will add ballast to the Gloucester pack . Title to defend: Northampton boss Jim Mallinder will be hoping to get off to a winning start on Friday night . In the far-flung south, the Super 15 is a swashbuckling exhibition of attacking arts, but that is a cross-border extraganza and one now mired in a bewildering format and dubious expansionism. When it comes to national leagues, the Currie Cup in South Africa and the ITM Cup in New Zealand primarily serve as breeding grounds for emerging talent. Closer to home, the Pro12 has struggled for identity within four nations, while also hampered by Irish rotation policies and an exodus from the Welsh regions, not to mention endlessly shifting kick-off times and meagre attendances. So the Premiership may well be worthy of Hibbard’s tribute and this promises to be an especially spicy season – possibly a watershed too. What has been lacking for some years is the bums-on-seats impact of English clubs managing to acquire ‘A’-list outsiders to dazzle the viewing public. They flocked here in years past, before the French acquired enough financial clout to chase ‘Les Rosbifs’ out of rugby’s transfer market. The imminent arrival of Sam Burgess at Bath will serve as an antidote and provide a sideshow for the remainder of the campaign, as the titan of rugby league attempts to master the rival code with sufficient haste to force his way in to World Cup contention. In fact, players vying for places at the tournament in this country next year will be the main sub-plot of the whole season. As Sir Clive Woodward noted in these pages on Wednesday, the tussle to win favour with national coach Stuart Lancaster will be an absorbing agenda for the rugby public here to observe, but clubs are mindful of promoting their own objectives. Jim Mallinder, director of rugby at champions Northampton, has identified the threat of lost focus, saying: ‘One challenge is to keep our internationals’ heads on playing for Saints with the World Cup around the corner.’ Blockbuster: Sam Burgess switches codes in November with an eye on claiming a World Cup spot . In truth, the cut and thrust of the weekly contests will keep the World Cup on the mental back-burner, aside from fleeting thoughts of how early-season form may have a bearing on Lancaster’s delayed naming of a senior EPS squad next month. The relentless nature of the domestic season will not allow much time to dream distant dreams, not when the spectre of injury or a collapse in form hangs heavy over the myriad contenders. As Mallinder prepares to launch his team’s title defence, he expressed the familiar view that this is a league where foregone conclusions are a rarity. ‘There are no easy games in the Premiership, home or away,’ he said. ‘If you are not quite there, teams can come and get you.’ That is the Premiership’s calling card; how close it is, how tight and tense and unpredictable. Yet, the Saints expect the primary danger to come from Saracens, Leicester, Harlequins and Bath, as was the case last year. Gloucester can be added to that top-end melting pot, because no side with their array of quality players can punch far below their weight for a second successive season. Champion: Piri Weepu, a World Cup winner with All Black pedigree, will be one to watch for London Welsh . For all the talk of knife-edge uncertainty, this is a league of haves and have-nots in some ways – just not to the same extent as it is in France. While the leading clubs spend the full £5million salary cap and attract large crowds, others such as promoted London Welsh, London Irish, Newcastle, Sale, and Wasps will resume the quest to expand their support-base and their bank balances. There is also a two-tier structure when it comes to the location of Test players. The cream continues to rise to the top, leaving the rest to keep bringing young talent through their academies and hope to fend off the bigger spenders for as long as possible. The whole landscape may change after this season. A home World Cup potentially could generate a boom, leading to all manner of positive upheaval; a wider spread of wealth and renewed challenges to the established order – perhaps a salary-cap hike in time. World Cup shout : Danny Cipriani (right) could yet make a late charge on Stuart Lancaster's squad . There is a strong chance that the 2015 tournament may create English prosperity just as the 2007 edition did in France, with the knock-on effect of expensive imports returning in droves. That in turn would threaten the current status quo of squads filled with home-grown players, that is a distant conundrum. For now, it must be hoped that the forthcoming Premiership season reaches the heights of the last instalment – not least when Northampton and Leicester slugged it out in an epic East Midlands derby at the semi-final stage. The World Cup is fast approaching as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the sport here, but parochial matters can grab the attention before the global circus begins.","Aviva Premiership kicks off on Friday night with Northampton vs Gloucester .

"By . Nik Simon . Follow @@Nik_Simon88 . Behind the doors of a modest industrial unit in Brentford lies one of the world’s most advanced sports-science laboratories. Rory McIlroy, Amir Khan and David Weir have all been pushed to their limits in the space-aged facility and this summer Harlequins have been using the technology to enhance their preparations for the new season. There is no expense spared. Funded by GlaxoSmithKline, a team of technicians help elite athletes fine-tune their craft and, in return, use the data to develop their own products. The resources on offer are beyond the financial boundaries of most professional sports teams; here they do not bat an eyelid at spending £80,000 on a single running machine. The equipment is all state-of-the-art. There are pools that generate currents to replicate an Olympic 50metre freestyle final, treadmills so powerful they require three-foot deep foundations and atmospheric chambers that can recreate conditions ranging from the Antarctic to the sub-Saharan. Cognitive: Harlequins have spent the off-season trying to improve decision-making in a Brentford laboratory . Thought process: Harlequins want to make the right decisions at the right time on the pitch this season . No expense spared: Running machines worth £80,000 each are used at the state-of-the-art facility . From a sporting perspective, it is all about marginal gains in performance. Intensive testing is carried out and the results can be used throughout the season to help determine optimum procedures. Cognition is one of the six pillars of expertise and Harlequins have been working closely with the scientists to develop a brain-tuning tool. Director of rugby Conor O’Shea flew out to America this summer, where he spent time with the Philadelphia Eagles, the East Division NFL team, who are already using similar technology. It is designed to improve decision-making and O’Shea is hoping the project will help maximise the training hours spent with his squad. ‘You get less and less time with players on pitch,’ said O’Shea. ‘The hits are getting bigger and bigger, so how much contact work can you do in training? Three Test matches against the All Blacks at the end of a long season - good or bad idea? We need to make sure that we don’t get to a stage where the players are so tired that they become disposed to an injury. ‘That’s where you need to bring in things like the cognitive tool. There are always players out injured – that’s a fact, it’s a collision sport. Sometimes they don’t make any decisions for months on end, because they don’t play. We’re hoping that through technology our guys can keep working on their decisions even when they’re not playing. I’m not a scientist in any way shape or form, but it makes sense. Over in Philadelphia, even the coaches were doing it. We knew they were the one club that used the technology and they were really open to us. It’s about firing the brain.‘ . Pedigree: Famous sportspeople including Rory McIlroy (left) and Amir Khan (right) have used the laboratory . Sports science: The facility in Brentford aims to optimise the 'six pillars' necessary to improve performance . Calm: Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea is keen to improve his player's decision-making this year . Sports science is constantly spreading its influence over elite sport and Harlequins are developing their intelligence inside a darkened room at the Brentford HQ. The west London club suffered from well-documented injury problems last season but the new technology will not just be reserved for those battling with fitness problems. It can help identify individual strengths and weaknesses, as well as adjusting for jet-lag, hydration, stress and other factors. ‘By separating the brain training from the physical training, you can accumulate all that practice without the risk of injury and physical fatigue,’ said Ken Van Someren, head of research and development at the GSK High Performance Lab. ‘A lot of work has been done with baseball and American football, so the obvious transfer is into rugby, football and cricket; that’s where we’re starting. You can show a snapshot of a scenario or you can show video footage that stops at the critical time. ‘In cricket, we are filming the fast bowler and we stop it before the ball is released. By and large they recognise the shape of the bowler, what they do with their arm, recognising the pattern and making a bet based on that information. While we know that a small change in hydration status affects things like strength and stamina, we’re just starting to see that it can have a significant impact on cognition as well.’ Assessment: Harlequins front row Paul Doran Jones (right) runs on a state-of-the-art treadmill in Brentford . Facilities: The laboratory has atmospheric chambers, treadmills, cycling machines and 50metre Olympic pools . Jenson Button, the Brownlee brothers and Adam Gemili have also been put through their paces in the testing house and, by collating intelligence from a range of the world’s leading sportsmen, the staff are able to challenge the accepted theories of sports science. By testing the other five pillars of performance - strength, stamina, hydration, metabolism and recovery - the findings can be disseminated by a panel that includes James Collins, head nutritionist at Arsenal, and Dr Matt Parker, head of athletic performance at England Rugby. ‘What makes sports science so dynamic is that you have coaches that can’t afford to wait for a robust evidence base,’ said Van Someren. ‘If you’re Team A and you know that you’ve got to do everything you can to beat Team B, then as long as something doesn’t have a negative impact, you probably need to give it a go. ‘But does it all really work? Does the effectiveness of an ice bath blunt over time? There is a bit of evidence at the moment. Five years ago everyone jumped in ice baths but now we’re starting to be a little bit more circumspect; it might not all be positive. Pillars of performance: Strength, stamina, hydration, metabolism, recovery and cognition are all tested . Skipper: Harlequins prop Joe Marler has taken over the captaincy from Chris Robshaw for the coming season . ‘We’ve got a cold-water pool and a hot-water pool, with three different depths. Is it the effect of the cold or is it the hydrostatic pressure and the depth of the water? Should you stand neck deep or waist deep? The scientists at GSK can help us work that out.’ Since “marginal gains” became a buzzword under Dave Brailsford during his time as performance director a British Cycling, all elite sports teams have been searching for their own points of difference. Whether it is a case of sleeping with the same pillow on away trips, or immersing into multi-million pound facilities. ‘What distinguishes first place from fourth place?’ said John Dams, head of strength and conditioning at Harlequins, who kick off their season against London Irish at Twickenham. ‘It’s about that extra two or three per cent. It comes down to small elements and we’re trying to improve wherever we can. It’s big data. Nutrition is a key pillar in making those differences and that’s why our relationship with MaxiNutrition is important. If you don’t get the basics right, then the rest can fall down. 'You have all this information and you need to best way to process it. No one’s quite there yet, especially in rugby, but over the next four or five years I think there will be a lot more investment in data analytics.’ Wet room: The players can have their temperatures controlled in this state-of-the-art water facility .

"By . Chris Waugh for MailOnline . Follow @@ChrisDHWaugh . Another year, another Guinness Pro12 season. Well, not exactly. The 2014-15 edition of the four-nation competition promises to be the ‘most competitive, interesting and exciting’ yet, according to former Lions, Ireland and Leinster prop Paul Wallace. With the 2015 World Cup beginning in England next September, potential Irish, Welsh, Scottish and Italian representatives will be keen to showcase their credentials for their clubs and provinces. Exciting: Sky Sports pundit Paul Wallace expects the Guinness Pro12 season to be 'most competitive' ever . Favourites: Wallace believes his former side Leinster are favourites to win an unprecedented third-straight title . Prediction: Sky Sports rugby pundit Paul Wallace expects an extremely competitive Guinness Pro12 season . Rivalries: Derbies, like Glasgow-Edinburgh, will take on even greater significance in this season says Wallace . Sky Sports have acquired the rights for the Pro12 this season, and their rugby union analyst Wallace is excited to see how the season will unfold - especially with the new European qualifying system. With the Heineken Cup being replaced with the European Rugby Champions Cup for the 2014-15 season, the best placed team from each country in the Pro12 will qualify outright for the competition, as will the three highest ranked teams not already qualified. The eighth and ninth placed sides will then compete in a four-team play-off with an English and French side for the remaining European spot. And speaking ahead of the new season Wallace, capped 45 times by the country of his birth and three times by the British and Irish Lions, said: 'It’s going to be a long season going all the way through to the World Cup but certainly there is more excitement going into the Pro12 than in previous season. I think it can be the most competitive, interesting and exciting ever. 'It should get off to a cracking start with Glasgow-Leinster as that’s always a big one. A lot of the national players aren’t available but with the pressures of qualification for the European Cup it will be quite interesting to see how much the frontline players are pushed out early on in the season in particular.' Ian Madigan (Leinster) - The 25-year-old fly-half or centre 'excelled in last season's final and he can replace Brian O'Driscoll as the focal point of the Leinster side'. Time to shine: Ian Madigan starred for Leinster in last season's Pro12 final and can improve this year too . Mils Muliaina (Connacht) - The 34-year-old New Zealand World Cup-winning full-back will 'really help Connacht out and allow them to continue to become real challengers'. Pedigree: New Zealand World Cup-winner Mils Muliaina gives Connacht some much-needed experience . Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues) - The 23-year-old former Waikato Chiefs fly-half will be a 'big player for Cardiff - he is young, ambitious and talented with Super Rugby experience and he has the potential to be a truly outstanding player'. Outstanding: Gareth Anscombe is a young and exciting back who can thrive at Cardiff Blues this season . New format: Ex-Ireland prop Wallace (centre) thinks European qualification will make the league more exciting . Former Saracens prop Wallace believes every single match now takes on a huge significance, with a solitary point potentially the difference between qualification for Europe's premier competition or not. 'Derbies in Italy and Scotland are going to be huge now as it could be the difference between whether you get European qualification or not,' he continued. 'It’s very important they do get those top spaces, from a financial point of view. The distance Edinburgh are behind Glasgow on the pitch makes it a very tough season for them in particular. 'All sides like Connacht and the (Newport Gwent) Dragons will be targeting that fifth position because then you will be pretty much guaranteed a European spot. 'A lot goes down to the Welsh regions. In the past I have felt they have been happy with mid-table respectability but it puts pressure on them and the Irish sides because you cannot just sit on your hands anymore. 'Cardiff Blues, meanwhile, seem to have a new renewed ambition after the club versus country row was solved in Wales and I expect them to go well this year. There isn't much between the Welsh sides with the Dragons improving and the Ospreys weakening somewhat, so it will be fascinating to see.' Big miss: Leinster and Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll has retired but Wallace expects his old side to compete . Gone: Leinster have also lost the experience of Leo Cullen but Wallace thinks they have what it takes again . Strong: Ulster have made great progress recently and Wallace thinks they have the power to challenge again . Despite the retirement of Irish stalwarts Brian O'Driscoll and Leo Cullen, Wallace is still tipping his old side to claim an unprecedented third title in a row. He expects Leinster's main challengers to come for Ireland too, but thinks Glasgow and Cardiff could throw up a potential surprise. Wallace said: 'I think Leinster are looking very strong again. Obviously the leadership of O’Driscoll and Cullen will be missed but they have some big players like Sean O’Brien. They’re still the favourites for me. 'Ulster will be up there, as will Munster. Munster are difficult ones as there is a massive change going on behind the scenes. Glasgow as they showed last few season are a very, very consistent side. 'From the Welsh sides, I think Cardiff are looking good, particularly with the signing of Adam Jones. They have lacked consistency but they now have Reece, Gethin Jenkins and Jones. This is the year they might start becoming a contender again.' Challengers: Cardiff Blues (left) have recruited well while Munster (right) are always there or thereabouts . Success: Former Lions prop Wallace expects the 2014-15 Guinness Pro12 season to be the best campaign yet .

"By . Rob Cooper . Murder charge: David Jeffs, 36, battered Roberto Troyan to death in his Mayfair home when his fraud was about to be uncovered, a court heard . A millionaire socialite was murdered by his financial advisor who had defrauded him of £343,000 to fund his fabulous lifestyle, a court heard today. David Jeffs, 36, drove sports cars, dined at fine restaurants and stayed at top hotels using Roberto Troyan's money, it is claimed. In one night the cocaine user blew a staggering £19,500 in strip club Spearmint Rhinos as he ‘celebrated’ his imminent marriage, the jury was told. Jeffs also used the stolen money to buy two Lotus sports cars and to pay for holidays in Mauritius, Ibiza and the USA, Croydon Crown Court heard. But as his dishonesty was about to be uncovered, he battered his 63-year-old victim to death with a suitcase inside his home in a Mayfair mansion block in central London, it is claimed. The body was found by a cleaner in the kitchen of the flat in a pool of blood. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC told the jury: 'This defendant took advantage of a frail and vulnerable man for his own gains over a long period. 'As a result he was able to live the high life but all at the expense of the deceased who, when the defendant first met him, was a rich man. 'He died less rich by hundreds of thousands of pounds thanks to this defendant's dishonesty. 'When the life to which the defendant happily had become accustomed appeared to him to about to be suddenly coming to an end and that there was a real possibility that his callous acts would soon be found out, he killed him. 'Whether the murder of Mr Troyan was planned by this defendant or was committed following an argument when the deceased finally confronted him with his crime, we may never know. 'Only one person is now able to tell us and he has not done so.' Jeffs was a 'devious and clever man' who had been able to carry out his deception by making Mr Troyan rely on him, it is alleged. Mr Brown added: 'The defendant knew well the advantage he had and he used that advantage. 'But the defendant had come to rely on the deceased - or rather his wealth - for his own lifestyle. 'There were expensive sports cars, expensive restaurants, hotels, holidays and clubs, and drugs too, all that had to be paid for. 'This is what was about to come to an end and he was likely to be exposed for what he really was - the consequences were dire.' Mr Brown QC added that the biggest purchases included two Lotus sports cars. 'The reality is that the defendant spent Mr Troyan’s investments on a much more luxurious life than his legitimate earnings would ever have allowed,' he said. Scene: Roberto Troyan was found dead in his property in this mansion block in Mayfair by a cleaner earlier this year . 'He bought two expensive Lotus sports . cars. One cost nearly £20,000 - it was bought in April 2010 - when the . ink was hardly dry on Mr Troyan’s first cheque that found its way into . this defendant’s account...the second one was bought a year later in . March 2011 - by which time he had taken £140,000 from Mr Troyan - cost . £52,000. 'That second Lotus was made up of £37,000 that he paid with his credit card and £15,000 from part exchanging the first Lotus. 'There were sports occasions - . hospitality tickets obviously, it was £1,400 for two - at the rugby and . polo - £1,100 for two tickets. 'He would visit expensive hotels, . expensive restaurants. He would take expensive holidays to Mauritius, . Ibiza, USA each costing thousands of pounds. 'There were nightclubs, for example . £1,150 in one night at a club called China White, and he frequented . Spearmint Rhinos, where there was £19,500 spent in one night in March . 2011. 'This perhaps was some kind of . celebration prior to his marriage to his wife in June 2012. Again people . are allowed to celebrate how they like of course as long as it isn’t . with someone else’s money to which they are not entitled.' Battered to death: Roberto Troyan was found dead in a pool of blood by a cleaner in his Mayfair home . After the killing, Jeffs attempted to . cover his tracks by purchasing replica clothes to replace his . bloodstained ones, it is alleged. Scientists later found blood from Mr Troyan on a briefcase Jeffs was carrying when he went to the flat that afternoon. Jeffs had been employed as his . financial advisor in 2005 following the death of Mr Troyan's partner . Anthony Feldman, an interior designer whose clients included Princess . Michael of Kent and former Tory Cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken. Jeffs was to assist in the investment and management of the huge inheritance Mr Troyan received, the court was told. Mr . Brown said: 'It appears Mr Troyan's lifestyle, since his partner's . death, had been somewhat extravagant, in some ways had become chaotic, . and included consumption of alcohol and drugs at his home address often . with others. 'Mr Troyan's habits including his dependency on others, were such as to make him an easy target for financial exploitation. The relationship between the two men deteriorated in the months before the murder as Mr Troyan told friends how much money Jeffs had lost him. Mr Brown said: 'In the days and months before his death, Mr Troyan expressed to those close to him and others his disappointment at losses in his investments, for which he seemed to blame the defendant, his resentment at the financial arrangements in place to curb his spending and his distrust of the defendant in his management of his finances. 'Victim': Mr Troyan who had employed David Jeffs as his financial advisor since 2005 . 'Whatever Mr Troyan's spending and lifestyle habits, his distrust of the defendant in that regard had a sound basis.' Tax records showed Jeffs earned just under £50,000 in 2006-07, £36,460 in 2007-08 and just £6,000 in 2008-09. Mr . Brown added: 'The reality is that with the lifestyle that he had, his . legitimate earnings fell far short of what was required to keep that . high life going.' Jeffs . became a 'financial concierge' to Mr Troyan and paid utility bills, . money owed to a storage company and helped him find a flat and pay the . deposit and rent.

Exclusive neighbourhood: Police launched a murder investigation in Mayfair after Mr Troyan was discovered dead. He had been bludgeoned to death . 'During the same period there had also been attempts by way of the defendant to secure payments totaling £80,000 to Jeffs' accounts by way of cheques initially drawn but which bounced. 'Mr Troyan did understand that these significant amounts would be re-invested for him by the defendant and were not therefore intended to go into the defendant's pocket. 'It was a deception and it worked. Not a penny of the £343,000 was re-invested on Mr Troyan's behalf and it was spent by the defendant on himself and his friends.' Mr Troyan was found dead on March 8. Jeffs, formerly of Arnold, Nottingham, denies murder and fraud by abuse of position. The trial continues.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Narrow escape: The forecast by the Ernst & Young ITEM Club that the UK has avoided a double-dip recession will be welcome news for Chancellor George Osborne . The UK has narrowly avoided a double-dip recession, but will struggle for the rest of the year unless businesses stop hoarding cash and start investing, a forecaster warned today. Emergency measures from the Bank of England, European Central Bank and US Federal Reserve have boosted confidence and stabilised financial markets, pulling the UK back from the brink of recession, the Ernst & Young ITEM Club said. The ITEM Club has forecast that UK GDP growth will be a 'dismal' 0.4 per cent this year, which is half the 0.8 per cent estimated by the tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before rising to 1.5 per cent in 2013 and 2.6 per cent in 2014. The UK economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year and is broadly expected to have just avoided a technical recession by eking out around 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2012. The figures contradict those issued by global think-tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) at the end of last month which claimed Britain has suffered a double-dip recession and will be welcome news for Chancellor George Osborne, who predicted growth in his Budget speech. Boosted confidence: The UK was pulled back from the brink of another three months of recession by emergency measures by the Bank of England (above) Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club, said the UK will not prosper again until businesses invest stockpiled cash. He said: 'Business investment has picked up nicely in the US, but UK companies remain extremely risk averse, which is sapping strength from the economy.' The cash balances of private non-financial companies are worth more than £754 billion, the ITEM Club said, 50 per cent of GDP, but business investment last year only increased by 1.2 per cent. In contrast to big business, households . remain under intense pressure, the ITEM Club said, with private sector . companies finding it increasingly difficult to create the jobs to offset . losses in the public sector. Shell out: Businesses have been urged to stop hoarding and start investing if the UK economy is to pick up again . Unemployment is expected to approach 9.3 per cent of the UK's total workforce by the middle of next year, with just short of three million people out of work, before beginning to fall back, the ITEM Club said. Mr Spencer continued: 'Households remain under the cosh and UK unemployment is set to go even higher by the end of the year. 'But there is a small glimmer of light at the end of the dole queue. For the first time in years, the gap between wage growth and inflation should start to close, before reversing in 2013.' ITEM forecasts that disposable income will fall by 0.2 per cent in 2012, while consumer spending will increase by 0.8% before accelerating to 1.1 per cent in 2013 as household incomes gradually strengthen. Elsewhere, the ITEM Club has predicted that the UK's export performance should pick up despite shipments to the eurozone being restrained. Depressing: Britain's economic slump Economic slump is the longest in a century . Exports of goods increased by 5.1 per cent in volume terms in 2011, while services were up by 3.9 per cent. The UK is expected to put in a similar performance this year, the ITEM Club said, with exports growing by 4.5 per cent and net exports adding 0.3 per cent to GDP. Mr Spencer said: 'The UK has so far avoided the dreaded double dip, but a lot still hangs in the balance. 'After three business-friendly Budgets and more tax cuts in the pipeline, it is now up to corporates to play their part in the UK's recovery. 'The business community needs to grasp this opportunity quickly or face the consequences after the next general election.'","Forecasters warn of 'dismal' 2012 unless firms invest .

"Seven internet service providers have launched legal action against GCHQ after accusing it of illegally accessing 'potentially millions of people’s private communications'. Britain’s intelligence centre has been accused of carrying out 'targeted operations against internet service providers to conduct mass and intrusive surveillance.' The complaint has been filed at a London . court by ISPs Riseup and May First/People Link of the US, GreenNet of . Britain, Greenhost of the Netherlands, Mango of Zimbabwe, Jinbonet of . South Korea and the Chaos Computer Club of Germany, plus campaigners . Privacy International. The Government Communications HQ (GCHQ) has been accused of carrying out 'targeted operations against internet service providers to conduct mass and intrusive surveillance' The revelation comes after leaks by fugitive NSA worker Edward Snowden showed GCHQ was a key player in covert US surveillance operations globally. It also comes after German magazine Der Speigel ran a series of reports in which they claimed to detail GCHQ’s 'illicit activities'. They include allegedly targeting a Belgian telecommunications company, Belgacom. The report claims staff computers were infected with malware in a 'quantum insert' attack to secure access to customers. The legal complaint says this was 'not an isolated attack' and alleges violations of Britain’s Human Rights Act and the European Convention of Human Rights. The revelation comes after leaks by fugitive NSA worker Edward Snowden showed GCHQ was a key player in covert US surveillance operations globally . 'These widespread attacks on providers and collectives undermine the trust we all place on the internet and greatly endangers the world’s most powerful tool for democracy and free expression,' said Eric King, Privacy International’s deputy director. Britain’s Foreign Office did not immediately comment. GCHQ, which stands for Government Communications Headquarters, employs around 5,500 people and is housed in a giant doughnut-shaped building in the sleepy town of Cheltenham, southwest England. Snowden’s leaks claimed that the NSA had been secretly funding GCHQ to the tune of £100 million ($160 million, 120 million euros) over the last three years.","Accused of carrying out 'targeted operations on internet service providers'

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for the Daily Mail . Follow @@riathalsam . Like a leaking roof, it was always going to get worse. With Shane Long transferring from Hull to Southampton for £12million, the ceiling has finally caved in. This is the summer when transfer spending escalated from mildly crazy to pants-on-the-head bonkers. The Premier League has always had big deals and strange transfers, but this summer looks set to break the mark of £630m spent ahead of the 2013-14 campaign, which in turn bettered the £500m record established in 2008. Staggering: Shane Long joined Southampton from Hull for £12million in August . Value for money? Long (centre) scored four league goals in 17 appearances for Hull last season . With the Premier League's £5.5bn media deal, it should come as no surprise. But some of the individual transactions have made for incredible viewing. Long, of course, is a good forward. When he joined Hull from West Brom for £7m seven months ago it was a bargain. But to add £5m to the 27-year-old’s value after four goals in 17 games is extreme. A player’s value, as they say, is like the value of a house – it’s all about how much someone is willing to pay. Southampton’s number of departures this season meant their necessity for players was perhaps greater than most, with the world knowing how much cash was stuffed under their mattress. Big deal: Luke Shaw (left) joined Manchester United for £30million from Southampton . They, in turn, have benefited from that market this summer. Luke Shaw going to Manchester United for £30m is a staggering transaction. The fact Shaw is a talented left back of excellent promise is not in doubt. But the amount paid by United has raised eyebrows across the game. As Huw Jenkins, the Swansea chairman, told a supporters’ forum on Thursday night: ‘Southampton have probably overpaid to get Shane Long. Obviously they need to bring in players because they're selling them. As they're getting big fees in for their players, they are, in my opinion, overpaying to bring players back in.’ After raising a reported £97.6m from selling players, Southampton have since spent a reported £9m on Graziano Pelle, £10.9m for Dusan Tadic, £7m for Florin Gardos, £12m for Long and £10m for Fraser Forster. Ryan Bertrand has come in on loan. New recruits: Southampton have spent a combined £19.9million for Graziano Pelle (left) and Dusan Tadic (right) But this summer has been about far more than Southampton. To replace Long, Hull are understood to be considering a £10m move to sign Troy Deeney, from Championship club Watford. Deeney is also a fine player. He scored 24 league goals last season, with four assists, and returned 19 goals in 2012-13. He has one goal from one game for this campaign. But this move would rate him just outside the top 10 of Britain’s most expensive strikers in history – territory already reached by Ross McCormack, who moved to relegated Fulham from Leeds for £11m this summer. On the ball: Hull have been linked with making a £10million move for Watford striker Troy Deeney . Massimo Cellino, the Leeds chairman, reacted to the offer like this: ‘Ross McCormack is a beautiful player. I didn’t come to Leeds to sell Ross McCormack. But for him I was nothing, a new owner, he’s got a lot of money from Fulham, the chance to live in London. What can I say? I love you McCormack, stay with me? ‘He doesn’t give a f***. He didn’t show up to training. He didn’t fly with the club to pre-season. I was so p***** off that when Fulham called me I asked them for £10m to make them not buy the player. They said yes! Bloody hell.’ Pastures new: Ross McCormack joined Fulham in a £11million deal from Leeds United . That deal falls outside of the Premier League, but that in itself highlights the situation. In context, in January 2013, Daniel Sturridge was transferred from Chelsea to Liverpool for £12m. By then he was an England international with the added premium of being homegrown and having more than a year on his contract; by now he is one of the country’s brightest lights and younger than McCormack, Deeney and Long. International pedigree: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge cost £12million from Chelsea in January 2013 . Perhaps the biggest surprise was David Luiz, a player that never seemed to have the full confidence of Jose Mourinho, was still able to attract an accepted offer of £50m from PSG. Mad, bonkers or whatever Cellino might say. The window doesn’t close for two and a half weeks. Who knows what will happen next?","Premier League clubs spending power has escalated to ridiculous levels .

Mauricio Pochettino has identified the Argentina international centre-back as a potential signing and talks are underway over a deal. However, his former club River Plate are in dispute with Villarreal not just over Musacchio but over deals involving other young players. Villarreal own 35 percent of the player, River Plate have 35 per cent and his agent has 30 per cent. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Musacchio train with Villareal before taking a dip in the pool . Wanted: Tottenham are closing in on a deal for Mateo Musacchio, who is rated at £20million . Villarreal have tried to buy out River Plate's percentage before but the Argentine club have not budged. As a result, Villarreal want at least £21million from Tottenham to cover the cost of replacing the 23-year-old. President Fernando Roig does not wish to lose the defender but Musacchio has had his head turned by the prospect of playing for countryman Mauricio Pochettino and a salary which would almost treble his current £20,000 a week. Tottenham have interest from Lazio in Younes Kaboul, 28, but are yet to receive a formal bid, they will listen to offers for Michael Dawson while Vlad Chiriches, who has attracted interest from Roma, is one of the names being proposed to Southampton as a potential makeweight in a deal for French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Apple is preparing to offer instore hardware repairs for its latest iPhone handsets, according to rumours. Staff at Apple stores are set to be able to replace several parts of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets on site, including the handsets' touchscreens. If a broken phone is under an AppleCare warranty, the repair will be free of charge and owners of the phone could be able to wait in store while their handset is fixed, under the new plans. Staff at Apple stores are set to be able to replace several parts of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets instore, including the smartphones' touchscreens . Sources told 9to5Mac that special machinery will be installed in Apple stores which will enable staff to be able to fix touchscreens and other defects on site. The machines are said to be designed to calibrate iPhone displays and are rumoured to have begun arriving in some stores along with replacement parts and training manuals for staff, indicating instore repairs could be offered in the near-future. Currently Apple replaces damaged and problematic smartphones that are under warranty with completely new handsets, but the new initiative could let customers get repairs while they wait. While customers with smartphones under warranty are set to get free replacement parts if damage is caused by manufacturing defects, owners whose handsets are not covered will be able to pay $149 for a new screen, if the rumours prove true. Sources told 9to5Mac that special machinery will be installed in Apple stores, which will enable staff to be able to fix touchscreens and other defects on site. Here, customers queue up to purchase the latest iPhone at the Apple flagship store in Sydney . Currently there is no news of how much a UK service might cost, but the price is significantly cheaper than buying the least expensive handset as a replacement phone, as a new 16GB iPhone 5C costs £469. The website's sources also said Apple staff will be able to replace broken volume buttons, cameras, speaker systems and vibrating motors on the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets. However, while staff will be able to replace the home button on the colourful iPhone 5C models, they will not be able to swap the complex Touch-ID home button on the more luxurious iPhone 5S headsets. Replacement parts are said to vary in price, but a battery for the handsets is set to cost $79, while a new home button for the iPhone 5C, is rumoured to be $29. Apple began offering screen replacements for iPhone 5 handsets instore earlier this year, which typically take between 30 minutes and an hour. If the rumours prove true, instore . repairs could a win-win for customers and Apple, as customers could save . time and money, while Apple will not have to replace so many iPhones.

"By . Ian Sparks . The French fear a new serial killer is on the run after a gunman claimed the life of his fourth victim yesterday before fleeing on a motorbike. The murders have chilling echoes of Muslim fanatic Mohamed Merah’s killing spree in south-west France last month. An urgent hunt is underway for the new killer who killed his first victim with a shot to the body, while his next three targets died from a bullet to the head. Probe: Forensic officers investigate after a 47-year-old woman was shot in the head by a gunman who fled on a motorbike. He has been linked with another three killings . Police said the new killer has used the same 7.65mm handgun each time having carried out the four killings in the space of six months. District prosecutor Marie-Suzanne Le Queau said that witnesses had also seen a man ‘staking out’ the building where the latest killing took place today. A neighbour of the latest victim, said: ‘There were at least four loud bangs and then terrible screaming. There were people standing around saying “He killed her – he killed her”. ‘The man was tall, and he was white. After the shootings he leapt on to the moped and drove off at high speed.’ Murder: The same killer is believed to have shot three other people over the last six months in Grigny, Paris . The killings have drawn instant comparisons with murders carried out by Toulouse Al-Qaeda fanatic Merah. He shot seven people dead before he was shot himself by marksmen. The latest victim of the new killer was a 47-year-old mother who was killed yesterday outside her home in the suburb of Grigny. The murderer, who was wearing a crash-helmet, then made his escape. In at least two of the previous shootings between November and April - all in the same southern Paris district - the killer had also fled on a bike. Similarities: The serial killer has drawn comparisons with Toulouse Al-Qaeda gunman Mohammed Merah who killed seven people . The 23-year-old Al-Qaeda follower shot dead three soldiers in Montauban, then days later gunned down a rabbi and three children at a Jewish school in Toulouse - always escaping on his Yamaha T-Max scooter. He died in a hail of gunfire while leaping from a window after a 32-hour siege at his flat. Interior minister Claude Gueant said today: 'This series of killings is worthy of our attention and we have put all our energies into the investigation.' The first victim was a young woman shot as she was parking her car outside her flat in the suburb of Juvisy-sur-Orge on November 27. That murdered woman’s neighbour was then shot and killed in the street on February 22. An 81-year-old man was killed as he entered his apartment block in the nearby suburb of Ris-Orangis on March 17. Then a 47-year-old mother was shot in Grigny yesterday. Asked if he believed the killings were linked, Mr Gueant replied today: 'Yes, this is a concern.' Investigation: Police probe the killing of a 47-year-old woman in Grigny, France, who was shot in the head by a gunman . Mr Gueant also said in a separate interview that Islamist groups in France may now be plotting to to seek revenge for the death of Merah. He told Europe 1 radio: 'We have noticed a renewed enthusiasm and a desire to avenge the death of Mohammed Merah. 'Some radical Muslims may follow in his footsteps and try to become a martyr. We have to be vigilant.' French news media stressed that the first two killings pre-dated Merah’s murders in south-west France, but LCI TV news added: 'The similarity of the modus operandi is both striking and frightening.' A Paris police spokesman added today that they did not yet have any ‘political or religious profile’ of the person responsible for the latest spate of shootings.","Murders have chilling echoes of Muslim fanatic Mohamed Merah's killing spree .

"By . Tamara Cohen . School milk must be offered to all pupils from the New Year, it emerged last night. Officials believe it forms a key part of a healthy diet. They also hope the measure will slash pupils’ consumption of fruit juices, with their high sugar content. The change comes in new school food standards released today. The overhaul of school meals was announced as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was joined by TV chef Lorraine Pascale at Foresters Primary School in London . Under then changes, pupils will be offered three types of fruit a week, but fruit juice will be limited . They will specify that semi-skimmed milk ‘must be available for drinking at least once a day’ in all primary and secondary institutions. However, it will not be free for all. Reinstating the place of milk in daily school life is a remarkable turnaround for the Conservatives. It has been an emotive issue for the party since the then Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher was nicknamed the ‘milk snatcher’ in 1971 for scrapping the free drink for the over-sevens. Four years ago David Cameron had to stop his higher education minister’s plans to axe it for under-fives to cut costs. The food standards to be unveiled by Education Secretary Michael Gove today aim to clamp down on sugary and fried products. The milk will also help address concerns about low calcium levels in children. Currently, schools are only encouraged to offer ‘healthy drinks’ to pupils and many do not offer milk at all. Milk must be offered to all schoolchildren under the new food standards . Obesity campaigners welcomed the measure but said they would have gone further in trying to cut juice consumption. The under-fives will continue to get their milk for nothing but older pupils will be  charged, except for those on free school meals  –  but it is hoped making small cartons available will encourage more pupils to make a habit of drinking it. A Department for Education source said: ‘This is new. We hope making low fat milk regularly available at least once a day will help encourage children to have healthier diets’. The return of milk follows a review of school dinners by restaurateurs Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent. That came after the high-profile campaign begun by Jamie Oliver in 2005 to improve pupils’ food. They concede meals have improved  dramatically over the years since the celebrity chef’s crusade against fast food horrors such as Turkey Twizzlers – which were later banned. But officials say the guidelines brought in by New Labour– which forced schools to submit meal plans and samples to a laboratory to check their nutritional content were too complex and bureaucratic. Under the guidelines, fruit juice will be restricted to one 150ml glass per day from January amid growing evidence of the damaging effect of its rich natural sugars on children’s developing teeth. Many nutritionists now recommend that children are only allowed one small glass of fruit juice per week as a treat. The new guidelines will specify portions from particular food groups as opposed to dictating precise menus. Children must be offered three different types of fruit a week and only two portions of food cooked in oil such as chips, battered fish or  chicken nuggets. Wholegrain carbohydrates such as brown rice are approved, while refined foods such as white bread are out. The new rules are intended to make meals more ‘creative’ than under the current system which calls for them to contain specific levels of nutrients such as zinc, vitamin A and folic acid. The food standards to be unveiled by Education Secretary Michael Gove aim to clamp down on sugary and fried products offered to children . Newly created academies and free schools will also have to follow the food guidelines. Until now, academies – free from council control and set up post-2010 – had been free to make their own rules. This caused controversy last year when research showed nine out of ten academies were selling pupils chocolates and crisps which are banned in other state schools. Existing academies will be encouraged to follow the new guidelines. The Department for Education said the new standards would be easier to enforce and allow schools to be more ‘creative’ in what they serve and make food preparation a ‘joyful’ experience. Henry Dimbleby said: ‘This is about encouraging healthier habits and we are trying to encourage milk and water as drinks of choice. Fruit juice is as sugary in many cases as canned soft drinks.’ Mr Gove will say today: ‘These new food standards will ensure all children are able to eat healthy, nutritious meals at school. ‘We now have a clear and concise set of food standards which are easier for cooks to follow and less expensive to enforce. Crucially we have achieved this without any compromise on quality or nutrition.’ Tam Fry of the National Obesity Forum welcomed the crackdown on sugary juices, but said he would have gone further in restricting it to one small glass per week. Mr Fry said: ‘Fruit juice is known to be really laden with sugar, and it needs to be a treat not an everyday occurrence. The preference in schools should be water which is hugely beneficial.’","Milk must be offered to all schoolchildren from New Year under new rules .

"By . Jason Groves . Close: Michael Gove pictured with Dominic Cummings in the background . Michael Gove’s closest ally launched a withering attack on David Cameron last night – and accused him of holding back vital school reforms. Dominic Cummings said the Prime Minister lacked ‘the slightest sense of purpose’ and had failed to give Mr Gove the backing he needs to drive through reforms aimed at revolutionising school standards. He mocked Mr Cameron as a ‘sphinx without a riddle’, and warned the Prime Minister is ill-served by ‘sycophantic’ advisers who fawn over him and refuse to challenge him when he is wrong. ‘To get anything done you have to have priorities, and there are no priorities,’ he said. ‘Everyone is discouraged from telling the truth to important people. There’s no grip, no focus.’ The incendiary claim will infuriate Downing Street, which is losing patience with Mr Gove following a series of bruising rows that have damaged the Government. Earlier this month, Mr Gove was forced to issue a written apology to Mr Cameron and a senior Home Office official after briefing against Theresa May’s approach to countering extremism in schools. In one of the worst bouts of Coalition blood-letting, Mrs May was forced to sacrifice her special adviser Fiona Cunningham after she leaked a letter in which Mr Gove hit back at the Home Secretary. Mr Cummings, a frequent critic of the Coalition, quit as Mr Gove’s special adviser in January but continues to visit the Department for Education to offer advice. Friends describe the pair’s continuing partnership as being ‘like Batman and Robin’. In an interview with the Times, Mr Cummings said he regretted the fact that the Government’s education reforms had not moved ‘faster, further, better’. Mr Cummings, who had frequent rows with civil servants while in post, laid the blame for slow progress mainly on a ‘dysfunctional’ department. But he said Mr Cameron lack of vision and support had also contributed. Dominic Cummings said David Cameron (pictured) had failed to give Mr Gove the backing he needs . ‘As Bismarck said about Napoleon III, Cameron is a sphinx without a riddle,’ he said. ‘Everyone is trying to find the secret of David Cameron but he is exactly what he appears to be – there’s no mystery to him. He had a picture of [Harold] Macmillan on his wall – that’s all you need to know.’ Mr Cummings, who spent six years working alongside Mr Gove, said many of the Prime Minister’s most senior advisers were ‘far out of their depth’, had ‘no grip’ and were out of touch. Mr Cameron’s Old Etonian chief of staff Ed Llewellyn was described as a ‘classic third-rate suck-up-kick-down sycophant presiding over a shambolic court’. Mr Cummings was also scathing about Mr Cameron’s director of communications Craig Oliver, a former BBC journalist. The Gove and Cameron families are close, but the Prime Minister is said to be becoming exasperated with his old friend’s growing habit of becoming involved in unnecessary rows. Downing Street reluctantly accepts there is little Mr Gove can do to control Mr Cummings’s outbursts. But the personal and high-profile nature of his latest attack will cause anger.* In a separate development last night, it emerged that children as young as five are to be taught about business in a bid to produce a generation of entrepreneurs. Mr Cameron is expected to support plans for a major overhaul of the curriculum to promote business. The changes, proposed by Tory grandee Lord Young of Graffham, will include teaching children about the importance of profit and encourage them to be more entrepreneurial.","Dominic Cummings said Prime Minister lacked 'slightest sense of purpose'

"By . Beth Stebner . A frail 79-year-old man who recently emigrated from China pleaded not guilty yesterday in the brutal slaying of his elderly wife. On Thursday, police in the quiet New England town of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts found Jieming Liu in a rocking chair ‘covered in blood’ on his hands, mouth, and face in his modest condominium. According to police, his 73-year-old wife, Yuee Zhou, was found in a rear bedroom with severe injuries to her arm, lying in a pool of blood. Liu’s son told police that his father – who is only 5ft2 and 75 pounds - had no idea of what he was doing at the time, and kept repeating: ‘This is not your mother.’ Scroll down for video . Gruesome murder: Jieming Liu, 79, was in the Westborough, Massachusetts, District Court yesterday, where he faced a murder charge in the death of his wife, Yuee Zhou . Horrific: His wife was found in a pool of blood in this Shrewsbury apartment complex . At the arraignment yesterday in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, Assistant District Attorney Michael D. McHugh told the court that police were notified around 4:30pm Thursday that a woman was not breathing. When officers arrived to the condo, he said, officers found Liu drenched in blood and surrounded by pieces of his wife’s flesh. Court records state he kept telling his son, ‘This is not your mother,’ in Mandarin Chinese. He was charged with murder in conjunction with the gruesome death. Mr McHugh told the court: 'He may have been eating her flesh.' Dazed and confused: Liu appeared in court looking befuddled; according to the police report, he is only 5ft2 and 75 pounds . Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. also said that Zhou was missing most of the flesh on her badly-mutilated left arm. Police also found a few fingers scattered around the condo. Mr Early called it a ‘very gruesome scene. A very tough scene’ it’s a very disturbing scene,' telegram.com reported. According to the DA, Liu claimed that he was acting in self-defence. His attorney, public defender Michael Hussey, told the court that he may be suffering from Alzheimer’s or dementia. He said: ‘Mr Liu doesn’t seem to have any recognition for what is going on here. He’s completely befuddled, I don’t even think that he has a good understanding that police brought him here and for what reason.’ Not guilty: At the arraignment, a not guilty plea was offered on his behalf; he will undergo a psych evaluation later this week . According to the Boston Herald, Liu was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for psychiatric evaluation.

"By . Robert Hardman . Some predicted death from ‘sulphurous’ fumes, others that the capital would collapse. Many warned of ruinous costs which would never be recouped (they weren’t wrong on that point). But thanks to a handful of indefatigable, high-minded Victorians, one of the most ambitious engineering projects in history not only went on to shape London, it has since been copied by almost every major city on the planet. More than that, the London Underground has become part of the DNA of Britain, a symbol of national creativity and resilience. In war, it protected hundreds of thousands. In peace, it created the suburban dream for millions of families. Scroll down for video . A Victorian steam train, typical of those used in the Tube, was driven through Baker St Station to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first London Underground journey in January this year . And, tomorrow morning, an international crowd of VIPs will assemble to recreate the very first Tube journey as the Underground marks its 150th birthday. Led by Mayor Boris Johnson, they will board an original London Underground train — leather and velvet in first class; benches in third — and travel three and a half miles from Paddington Station to Farringdon Street. But what makes it an even more historic journey is the workhorse at the front — an original Undergound steam locomotive. There hasn’t  been a steam-powered passenger journey on the Underground since Edward VII reigned. Victorian: Robert Hardman takes a late night journey on the underground steam engine which will carry a group of VIPs on Sunday . Of course, anyone who has actually used the Tube — and a record 1.17 billion people did so last year — will immediately ask themselves the same question: how on earth did the Tube cope in the age of steam? It can be fetid enough today in a modern electric carriage. Funnily enough, it is not that unpleasant. There’s plenty of white wispy smoke, of course, but I’d rather breathe this than the exhaust fumes at a busy road junction. I have managed to secure a seat for the trial run ahead of tomorrow’s big occasion. Clouds waft in through the open windows of my eight-seat compartment, but there’s just a scent of bonfire. I have shared Tube carriages with more objectionable takeaway meals. What is overwhelming, though, is the atmosphere. It is getting on for 2am. Transport for London can only test all this renovated rolling stock on an empty network. So the only onlookers are a few diehard steam enthusiasts. None of them has seen anything quite like this, though. What a gloriously incongruous feeling it is to chuff-chuff through familiar London landmarks, past advertisements for airlines and wi-fi and mobile phones, in a maroon first class carriage built for Victorians, with adverts for soap and day trips to Middlesex. By day, these stations are heaving. Now, they are closed, half-lit, eerily silent. It’s as if a ghost train from Dickensian Britain has sneaked back to revisit old haunts. We trundle through Baker Street. The very same lightwells which poured daylight and fresh air down on that original Tube line are still in the walls. Pure Sherlock Holmes. We clatter through Euston Square — or Gower Street as it was called back then — and on through King’s Cross. Shiny signs on shiny walls direct passengers to Eurostar trains heading for the Continent. Yet the Battle of Waterloo was still in living memory when this track was built. Here and there, maintenance workers stop to give us a standing ovation or film it on their phones. The capital is fast asleep but the driver of Metropolitan Steam Locomotive Number 1, Geoff Phelps, 45, cannot resist the odd blast on his whistle. ‘You’d have to be completely heartless not to be excited by this,’ says Sir Peter Hendy, London’s wide-eyed Transport Commissioner, as we stop at Moorgate to take on water and check the dials. It’s taken years to restore this train. Back in time: The Metropolitan Locomotive No. 1 will pull the Metropolitan Railway Jubilee carriage No 353 . Some of the volunteer helpers have been invited along for the ride, so excited they can hardly speak. At around 3am, a whistle orders us all back on board for the return. I sit next to Sam Mullins, director of the London Transport Museum and co-author of ‘Underground’, an absorbing new history of the Tube. Tonight’s speed is around 20mph but Sam points out that everything was much slower on opening day, 1863: ‘It was chaos and the journey took about two and a half hours.’ The story of the Tube is full of pioneers and crooks, but it had a nobility of purpose from the start. For that, we can thank Charles Pearson, the City of London’s solicitor, who argued passionately that the lot of the ordinary Londoner would be much improved with a subterranean railway (he died before he could see the result). Another Tube author, Emily Kearns, recounts hostility to the idea in her new book, Mind The Gap. ‘The forthcoming end of the world will be hastened by the construction of the railways burrowing into infernal regions and thereby disturbing the Devil,’ wrote the Rev Dr John Cumming in 1860. Yet there was only one notable absentee from the euphoric opening on January 9th 1863. The Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, explained that, at 79, he would prefer to remain above ground a little longer. The new Metropolitan Railway was an instant hit. Opened to the public, it carried nearly 40,000 on its first day. But with so many steam engines operating in a confined space, the cumulative effect was alarming. That same day, a porter was hospitalised due to the ‘vitiated atmosphere’ and several people were left ‘insensible’ from fumes. Ticket to ride: An early Metropolitan Railway third class ticket . Legacy: This Victorian steam-powered vehicle remained in service until the 1960s . Still, a rival soon emerged. The Metropolitan District Railway — known as the District Line — started taking shape from Westminster to Kensington. Eventually, the two railways linked up to create the ‘Inner Circle’ around central London, while both companies furiously maintained their independence. As they stretched further out to London’s rural fringe, an explosion of housebuilding followed. But another player really shook things up in 1890. The new City and South London line, running under the Thames to link the southern suburbs with the City, had only one class, to the dismay of papers like the Railway Times: ‘We have scarcely yet been educated to that condition of social equality when lords and ladies will be content to ride alongside Smithfield butchers’. More important, the new line ran on electricity. The death knell for steam was the dazzling new Central Line, opened  in 1900. It had snazzy new electric carriages, a fixed fare and it opened up London’s great shopping and theatre districts. It also had the Daily Mail to thank for an immortal phrase — ‘the Twopenny Tube’. Thereafter, the entire Underground would be known, for ever, as ‘the Tube’. Everyone wanted to be a part of the new line. When American retailer Gordon Selfridge opened his Oxford Street store in 1909, he fought — in vain — to get Bond Street station renamed ‘Selfridge’s’. Then and now: A traveller at Baker Street Station this week - the station shares the 150th Anniversary of its opening on January 10th, 2013 with the London Underground . By 1905, the Metropolitan and District Lines had surrendered to electricity. There would be no more steam-powered passenger trains —until this week (although some steam engines continued to haul goods). Within a year, the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines completed a huge Edwardian electric network. But it was still something of a disjointed mess until the arrival of one of the most pivotal figures in British transport history. Frank Pick was the master of detail who gave the Tube its own identity, from station design to lettering to posters to its eternal symbol: the red and blue ‘roundel’. He also paid ten guineas to a draughtsman called Harry Beck for a new map. The result, first printed in 1933, remains a masterpiece. In a 2006 BBC poll, the Beck map was beaten only by Concorde as the greatest British design of all time (and Concorde was half-French). Yet Beck’s name was removed from the map in 1959 and he died a bitter man in 1974. There is an equally unhappy ending to the Frank Pick story. At the outbreak of war, he was masterminding  London’s evacuation strategy but fell out with his colleagues and with Winston Churchill and left. He died from a brain haemorrhage two years later. In charge:The Queen's visit underground in 1969 was her second time experiencing the Tube. Her first trip came as a 13-year-old in 1939 with Princess Margaret and her governess Marion Crawford . Going underground: The Queen was pictured riding on an escalator in the British Pathe footage filmed at Green Park station in 1969 . The war was, arguably, the Tube’s finest hour. Yet, at the start of the Blitz, the management tried to stop people sheltering from bombs, fearful that they would never leave and frustrate the Underground’s sacred duty: keeping the capital moving. By October 1940, the authorities relented. Beds, sanitation and refreshments were introduced. At its peak, there were 177,000 sleeping in the Underground. Tragedies were glossed over: 79 blown apart at Sloane Square, 68 drowned at Balham after a bomb ruptured a water main. Worst of all was a crush at Bethnal Green which killed 173, mostly women and children, in 1943. With peace came nationalisation, decay and division. It took the 1987 King’s Cross fire to reverse the long-term culture of decline. The advent of the London mayoralty and colossal public/private partnerships would help revivify the network to the point that it is busier than ever, carrying 4 million a day, double the 1982 number. It remains an endearing paradox. We love to complain about the Tube. And yet, we love it dearly. We’re like an old married couple, bickering yet devoted. ‘You’re not running a rail network,’ says managing director Mike Brown as we chug along. ‘You’re looking after an institution.’ It’s been quite a journey. Happy 150th, you smelly old thing. Old-fashioned: The interior of an all-steel London underground train is pictured around 1920 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . George Osborne today faced calls to rein in his multi-billion mortgage guarantee scheme to only cover homes worth less than £260,000. The Help to Buy scheme risked creating ‘distortions’ without changes the head of the OECD economic think tank warned. Critics have warned the scheme to make it easier for people to buy a home is helping to fuel demand, pushing up prices across the country by 10 per cent. Under the £3.5billion equity loan scheme, introduced in April last year, first-time buyers and home movers can get help to buy a property worth up to £600,000. Around 35,000 homes have been bought using it so far, amid claims Britain is not building enough houses to cope with rising demand. But Angel Gurría, the OECD's secretary general, has called for it to be more than halved to prevent a new property price bubble. He suggested cutting the threshold to the average house price of £262,000 before ‘winding it down’ altogether, The Times reported. Mr Gurría said: ‘It was a good idea and it worked. Now the economy is back on track. The price of houses has gone double digit. ‘Do you still really need the mechanism? You need to think about moving towards normality before distortions set in.’ ‘I would lower the cap. I'd take it down to the average [house price].’ UK house prices rose by 10.5 per cent in the year to May, according to the Office for National Statistics. It includes a 20.1 per cent rise in London, although ministers insist the biggest beneficiaries of the Help to Buy scheme have been outside the capital. In May, house prices paid by first-time buyers were 11.3 per cent higher than a year earlier, compared to a 10.1 per cent increase for those already on the housing ladder. Downing Street insisted David Cameron remains behind Help to Buy for 'supporting responsible lending'. A spokesman said the average house price paid under the scheme is £190,000 compared to the UK average of £262,000. 'It is clearly helped first-time buyers and others to get on the property market,' the spokesman added. The government is remaining vigilant about the scheme and the Chancellor has asked the [Bank of England's] Financial Policy Committee to keep an eye on this.'","Economic think tank says it is time to rein in the state-backed loan scheme .

Rocked by sex scandals: Former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn (above) flew to Athens for discussions with ministers about how to solve Greece's financial crisis... then went clubbing until 5am with a mystery blonde . Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to be hired by Greece to help rescue the bankrupt nation’s collapsing economy. The disgraced French economist jetted to Athens to meet with government ministers last week, it has been reported. And the 63-year-old - whose career has been wrecked by a catalogue of sex scandals - is set to become an ‘advisor’ on how to solve the country’s financial chaos, Greek newspapers said. But despite the official nature of his visit, the self-confessed swinger still found time to cavort in a nightclub till 5am with a mystery blonde. France’s Europe1 radio station said: 'The Greek media is convinced he has been hired as a debt advisor. 'As the former head of the International Monetary Fund, he certainly has the qualifications. 'His financial wizardry has never been in doubt, despite the problems in his private life.' The radio station added: 'But it wasn’t all work. He went there with some Parisian friends last Wednesday and spent the early evening his his hotel bar. 'Then they went to the exclusive discotheque, The Rich Club, where he, his blonde girlfriend and friends stayed until 5am.' Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a string of sex scandals since he was arrested for allegedly trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

"By . James Chapman, Political Editor . Tough stance: Home Secretary Theresa May is to insist Britain must pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights, to deport dangerous foreign criminals . Theresa May is to insist Britain must pull out of the European Convention on Human Rights, to deport dangerous foreign criminals. The Home Secretary is advising David Cameron that complete withdrawal, freeing Britain from Strasbourg judges’ edicts, is the only credible option, say Government sources. The move came as it emerged the number of foreign criminals avoiding deportation rose by 50 per cent last year despite government efforts to clamp down on the problem. The Conservatives are finalising plans to curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights in the UK, due to be unveiled at the autumn party conference and included in its manifesto for next year’s general election. Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court and convention – former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke – were sacked in the Prime Minister’s reshuffle earlier this summer, removing the main internal obstacles to reform. But senior Tories are understood to be split into those who favour a straightforward withdrawal from the convention and others who are arguing for a ‘halfway house’. Options include a temporary suspension of Britain’s membership, or attempts to establish pre-eminence for the UK Parliament and Supreme Court, allowing them to override Strasbourg rulings. But Mrs May is telling Mr Cameron the Tories should commit to leaving the convention altogether, according to government sources. ‘There are people in Downing Street who talk about some kind of halfway house,’ one source said. ‘Theresa is convinced that won’t work and is expected to back complete withdrawal.’ The convention, enshrined in British law by Labour’s Human Rights Act, has become increasingly unpopular with many Conservatives. Critics say the Strasbourg court has gone well beyond its remit and created rights not included by the convention’s founders. Mr Cameron is understood to be convinced that a good proportion of voters’ anti-EU sentiment is due to Strasbourg rulings preventing the removal of foreign-born criminals and terror suspects – though the convention and court have nothing to do with Brussels. The ECHR has been invoked by dozens fighting deportation. They argue that its provisions mean they are entitled to various rights, including to a family life. Obstacles: Two of the Government’s biggest defenders of the court and convention - veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke (left) and former Attorney General Dominic Grieve (right) - were sacked in the Prime Minister’s reshuffle earlier this summer . It emerged yesterday that the number considered for removal but not sent home rose by 50 per cent last year to 1,310, up from 890. Criminals not thrown out included 15 murderers, five guilty of manslaughter, 15 rapists and 140 robbers. Foreign convicts are now avoiding deportation in one in three cases – often as a result of the Human Rights Act. In the past, use of this law has led to terror suspects being allowed to stay in the UK due to having family here. Mrs May succeeded in sending the radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada back to Jordan after more than a decade of legal battles – and accused the Strasbourg court of having repeatedly ‘moved the goalposts’ by establishing new legal grounds for blocking his deportation. Deported: Mrs May succeeded in sending the radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada (pictured behind bars at the Jordanian military court) back to Jordan after more than a decade of legal battles . The Conservatives plan to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights, which would enact most of the ECHR’s provisions in a more flexible way and give Westminster and the Supreme Court the ultimate say. The Prime Minister said last year he was willing consider full-scale withdrawal to ensure Britain can remove foreign criminals. He said: ‘It may be that that is where we end up. Whatever that takes, we must deliver that outcome.’ Last year former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said the court was undermining Parliament’s sovereignty and must ‘stop here’. Mr Clarke and Mr Grieve, backed by Labour and Lib Dems, have warned against leaving the ECHR, claiming it would damage Britain’s reputation and give succour to other regimes which do not recognise basic human rights.","Home Secretary Theresa May advising Cameron to withdraw from European Convention on Human Rights, Government sources say .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . People who suffer obsessive compulsive disorder are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, new research has  warned. File picture . People who suffer obsessive compulsive disorder are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, new research has today warned. And children of parents with OCD are also more prone to the mental health illness as they grow up. A team of Danish scientists found sufferers are more at risk of both schizophrenia and related spectrum disorders. The two conditions are distinct but do, at times, overlap, studies have shown. To explore the links between the two condition, researchers from Aarhus University analysed Danish databases involving three million people born between 1955 and 2006. They were then followed up from 1995 to 2012. The scientists used incidence rate ratios (IRRs) as a measure the relative risk to establish the potential relationship between the two disorders. The findings, published online in JAMA Psychiatry, found a total of 16,231 people developed schizophrenia and 447 (2.75 per cent) of them had a prior diagnosis of OCD. A total of 30,556 people developed a schizophrenia spectrum disorder and 700 (2.29 percent) of them had a prior OCD diagnosis. Dr Sandra Meier said: 'We observed a specific association with OCD. 'Although a psychiatric hospital contact per se increased the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, a prior diagnosis of OCD explained some additional variation in the disease's susceptibility. 'Other childhood-onset disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism and bulimia nervosa did not increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders as much as OCD, indicating a specifically strong effect of OCD on the disease's susceptibility. 'In addition we observed an effect of parental OCD on the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. 'This effect of parental OCD on the risk of developing schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders was not explained by a parental history of other mental disorders leading to psychiatric contact. 'Interestingly the enhanced risk of children with parents diagnosed as having OCD developing schizophrenia or a schizophrenia spectrum disorder reported in this study can be considered comparable to the risk of second and third-degree relatives of patients with OCD developing OCD. Children of parents with OCD are also more prone to the mental health illness as they grow up, the Danish researchers found. File picture . 'Despite the fact that our results indicate putative overlapping etiological factors of OCD and schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, they do not necessarily suggest that these disorders should be aggregated into one global diagnosis. 'However, given these findings and the fact that OCD and schizophrenia co-occur with one another at a higher rate than would be expected in the general population, the phenotypes of these disorders are potentially more similar than currently acknowledged. 'Further research is needed to disentangle which genetic and environmental risk factors are truly common to OCD and schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders.'","Danish study found obsessive compulsive disorder raises the risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia .

"Reality star and Kanye West have 'left hospital with baby girl' New rumours couple have decided against 'K' name . By . Amelia Proud . She suffered throughout what she described as a difficult and painful pregnancy. But in the few days before she was rushed to hospital with suspected preeclampsia, there was a sanguine beauty about Kim Kardashian as she relaxed in Los Angeles sunshine. The 32-year-old looked beautiful as she showed off her expectant form in a pretty Inca bikini while relaxing by a pool with friends. Looking swell: Kim Kardashian looked radiant as she showed off her baby bump in a pretty bikini by Inca just days before being rushed into an early labour . She gained a substantial amount of weight during her pregnancy and Kardashian is apparently already trying to shift those pounds. Meanwhile it's been revealed that the baby's name does NOT start with a 'k': 'They're not quite ready to announce the name yet,; a source close to the couple tells Us Weekly. 'But the name definitely does not start with a K, despite all the rumors that have been out.' The reality star is reported to have just left hospital following the birth of her daughter in the early hours of Saturday morning according to Hollywood Life. And according to reports she can’t wait to get back in the gym and regain her slim figure. ‘She’s already looking ahead to when she can exercise again,’ a source told Us Weekly. Another added: ‘She really wants to get back into shape. It’s important to her.’ Perfect form: Kim showed off her beautiful form in the snakeskin two piece . Proud: Kim said she didn't enjoy being pregnant but she looks comfortable with her swollen form . The eye of the storm: Little did Kim know she would be delivering her daughter in just a few days . Kim, 32, was working with trainer to the stars Tracy Anderson throughout her pregnancy, but the publication also claims she is considering hiring Gunnar Peterson. Gunnar is responsible for helping Kim’s younger sister Khloe, 28, with her recent 25lbs weight loss. While she is not able to start exercising just yet, Kim is allegedly already watching what she eats. The magazine claims that the star’s hospital room is chock-a-block with flowers but she has insisted well-wishers are not allowed to bring any tasty treats for her to eat. ‘She has over 30 bouquets from loved ones,’ a source said. ‘She told everyone not to bring sweets – she said she doesn’t need any temptations.’ Putting her feet up: Kim looked happy and relaxed as she soaked up the Calirfornia rays . Girl time: Kim made the most of some chilled time with her ladies . Ready to pop: Kim thought she was due to give birth in July . It is believed that Kim and her daughter, whose name is yet to be revealed, will stay in hospital until the baby, who was born five weeks prematurely, reaches five pounds. While Kim and the little one are getting some rest, the baby’s father Kanye West has apparently been hard at work. The rapper’s creative juices have been flowing since he welcomed his daughter into the world. ‘He's been really inspired by the birth,’ a source told Life & Style. ‘He's written four songs already.’ The insider added that while Kanye, whose album Yeezus was released on Tuesday, has been busy with his music, he has also been very attentive to his two girls. ‘Kanye is actually really being good right now,’ the source said. Lost in thought: Kim stared into the mid distance at one point, perhaps contemplating the task ahead . In proportion: Kim's figure looked gorgeous in the sleek bikini . Catching up: Kim's girlfriends gathered to support the reality star . Kim is unsurprisingly enamoured with her child and gushed to a friend that the little one ‘is so cute and sweet’, according to Us Weekly. But she had a stressful time during the birth over the weekend. Warned by doctors that she was most likely suffering from the life-threatening condition preeclampsia, Kim was forced to deal with going into premature labour on Friday night to save the life of her baby girl. With her 'blood pressure skyrocketing' and 'the baby in distress' according to reports, the TV favourite was forced to grit her teeth and get on with the delivery. And the curvy brunette was so brave in dealing with the terrifying ordeal that her often absent beau, 36, is now desperate to marry her as soon as possible. Taking it easy: Kim dipped her swollen feet into the pool with care . Ever stylish: Kim looked as well put together as always in her swimwear . 'They'll start planning their next project, a wedding, sooner rather than later,' a source told People. 'He definitely wants to marry her, he hasn't left her side.' While their recently purchased $9million Bel Air home is being renovated, Kim and baby will be staying with her mother Kris Jenner and Kanye has also agreed to move in. A source told HollywoodLife.com that the New Slaves hitmaker thinks the move is 'a good idea'. The insider added: 'All that's going to happen is that the family is going to wait on Kim hand-and-foot and do everything around the house while she and Kanye just chill with the baby. That sounds like a deal. It's like first class service all the way at Kim's mom's house.' The source also said: 'They want to take their girl home and love her and begin this journey together. They're very thankful for the way they've been treated, and the hospitality [at the hospital] is amazing. But it's nothing like being at home, in your own space, with your own things.'","Reality star and Kanye West have 'left hospital with baby girl'

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Blank cheque: Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said the Human Rights Act has given courts a blank cheque to make up the law . The Human Rights Act has given courts a blank cheque to make up the law, a senior judge said yesterday. Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said the Act effectively gave the views of the judiciary precedence over Parliament. He said this extra power for judges was a good thing – because it kept governments in check. British judges have increasingly defied ministers since the Act was passed by Labour in 1998. The Appeal Court shot down rules to prevent sham marriages by ruling they discriminated against immigrants. And judges have used the Act to dismantle attempts to control terror suspects. In his landmark speech, Lord Neuberger cited a key judgment from June in which the Supreme Court declared it had the power – so far unused – to tell the Government to legalise assisted suicide. The 1961 Suicide Act makes clear that helping someone to die is a serious crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. But judges and prosecutors have opened up a defence for those who act out of compassion – defying Parliament’s wishes and effectively wiping out much of the meaning of the law it had laid down. Lord Neuberger’s intervention comes at a time when the future of the Human Rights Act and the supremacy over British courts of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights are being questioned. David Cameron’s July reshuffle shifted opponents of constitutional reform out of the Government and replaced them with eurosceptics who want to end the power of Strasbourg to give votes to prisoners or prevent the deportation of terror suspects. They also want to rein in British judges who use human rights to establish new law on privacy or assisted suicide. The reshuffle has led to speculation that the next Tory manifesto will promise repeal of the Human Rights Act and its replacement with a British bill of rights. Lord Neuberger is the leader of the 12 judges who have the final say in Britain on how the laws set by Parliament are interpreted. He said in a speech given to lawyers in Melbourne, Australia, that the Human Rights Act allows courts ‘to interpret statutes in a way which some may say amounts not so much to construction as to demolition and reconstruction’. Powerful: In his landmark speech, Lord Neuberger cited a key judgment from June in which the Supreme Court declared it had the power - so far unused - to tell the Government to legalise assisted suicide . Uncertain: Lord Neuberger’s intervention comes as the future of the Human Rights Act and the supremacy over British courts of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights (pictured) are being questioned . ‘We can give provisions meanings which they could not possibly bear if the normal rules of statutory interpretation applied,’ Lord Neuberger said. ‘Parliament has written us judges something of a bank cheque in this connection.’ He said that ‘this new judicial power of quasi-interpretation can be said to involve a subtle but significant adjustment to the balance of power between the legislature and the judiciary’. He added: ‘The UK approach can be seen as effectively conferring a law-making function on the judiciary.’ He said the European human rights convention had become ‘something of a whipping boy for some politicians and newspapers’ but that ‘this appears to many people to be unfortunate’. Very few Strasbourg court decisions were misconceived, he said. ‘You only have to look at the history of Germany over the last 100 years to see how valuable it can be for judges to be given a substantial role, supported by the rule of law, in protecting individuals against the might of the modern state.’ The British government, Lord Neuberger said, is very powerful, with its power ‘reinforced by what can sometimes appear to be the relative lack of independence of a legislature which can be said to be controlled by the head of the executive, namely the prime minister.’ Lord Neuberger’s speech also asserted the supremacy of British judges over the European Court of Human Rights. He said they should not follow their traditional common law training, in which judges usually follow precedents set in earlier cases.","Lord Neuberger says Act gives judiciary views precedence over Parliament .

The lanky teen, whose grandad died in 1980 after starring in Bullit and The Great Escape, has also been playing for London Tigers FC, an Ealing-based team . The glovesman was given a chance between the sticks by Lee Williamson, the director of Cheshunt FC, and manager Omer Riza. Chase said: 'It has always been a dream of mine to come to England and play. There's no better place in the world. 'It's a great sport all round and footballers are the greatest athletes. The feeling when you get on the pitch is like nothing else.' Chase started his footballing career at the Hollywood All-Stars, before leaving America to play at the academy of Croatian team Dinamo Zagreb. Cheshunt manager Omer Riza, whose team play in the Isthmian League Division One North, said: 'He is a good young player. He holds himself well and gets on with his job.' Chase said he wanted to 'write his own path' rather than following in the footsteps of his famous family - and wants to play in the Premier League. King of Cool: Steve McQueen starred as Detective Frank Bullitt in the film Bullitt, 1978 . Speaking earlier this month, the teenager said he didn't want to go into Hollywood, like grandfather Steve McQueen or actor and producer dad Chad, who starred as Dutch in The Karate Kid. His brother Steven R McQueen is also actor, starring in TV show The Vampire Diaries and movie Piranha 3D. Chase, however - a huge fan of US keeper Brad Friedel and Tim Howard - moved from the sun-kissed beaches of Malibu to play in non-league football to carve out his own legacy between the sticks. He said: 'I wanted to write my own story - I wanted to make my own path. 'Acting and trying to live up to my grandfather's legacy wouldn't be fair to me. Nobody could ever live up to what he has done with his life.' He told the US-based International Soccer Network: 'I want to be playing in the Premier League in five years. That's the goal.' Chase initially fell in love with basketball, but switched to football to play as glovesman while at Malibu High School. There he met goalkeeping coach Edi Mujic, a former pro from Germany, who started to mentor the young keeper. Mr Mujic said of Chase: 'Chase's development in the past three years has been equivalent to any other double in time. 'His potential is deeper as well. His passion is tremendous and his work ethic is absolutely remarkable.' Chase joined the Dinamo Zagreb Academy in Croatia, the Hollywood All-Stars, and now Cheshunt FC in Herts, where he is currently on load to London Tigers FC. Omer Riza, the manager of Cheshunt FC, and a former Arsenal and West Ham player, said: 'I'm always open to looking at players as it doesn't hurt and you never know what can be unearthed, maybe a diamond in the rough. 'Chase worked hard throughout preseason and has given a good account of himself both as a player and an individual.' 'I've also had the pleasure of meeting his family in brief and they thanked me for looking after Chase. My reply was 'he has looked after himself and is a credit to you guys. 'This is very true, a young guy who has it all and didn't need to come to the UK and try and make something of himself.'","Chase McQueen, 19, arrived in the UK earlier this year from Los Angeles .

"By . Freya Noble . The parents of Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe, who was abducted and killed in 2003, have told how a meeting with the parents of Madeleine McCann gave them strength during their toughest times. In an interview with Today on Wednesday morning Denise and Bruce Morcombe spoke of a dinner they shared with Kate and Gerry McCann during a holiday to England in July 2011. The McCanns' daughter Madeleine vanished from their holiday apartment at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007. She has never been found. 'You know it was really just like looking in the mirror', Mr Morcombe revealed. Scroll down for video . Gerry McCann, Kate McCann, Denise Morecombe and Bruce Morcombe met in England in 2011 and the Morcombes said it was incredible how well they got along . '[They were] truly ordinary people and it was amazing how quickly we communicated even though that was the first time we'd ever met,' he told host Karl Stefanovic . Mr Morcombe also revealed that during the meal the two families compared their experiences with media, police, 'the frustrations of no news' and how they dealt with everyday life and commitments. 'We sat down and had dinner and about three or four hours later it felt like five minutes had passed and they were really lovely people,' Mrs Morcombe said. The families said their experiences with media, police and everyday life were parallel . The couples bonded over the disappearance of their children, Madeleine (left) who went missing in 2007, and Daniel (right) who vanished in 2003 . The two families had been in contact for many years before through email, but the dinner was their first encounter face to face. On Today the Morcombes also told of how proud and excited they were for the upcoming wedding of their son Bradley, Daniel's twin brother, and revealed how they dealt with their grief and the unknown. Mr Morcombe said it was too easy to wake up each day feeling anger, and said it was much more beneficial for he and his wife to put their energy into helping others. Kate McCann and Denise Morcombe's shared experience of losing children meant they had been in contact for many years before they met . Daniel's twin brother Bradley (left), now 24, is getting married to his highschool sweetheart next month . 'It was much better to get up every day and try and do something positive', Mrs Morcombe added. On Tuesday the Sunshine Coast couple launched a book which details their ordeal over the past decade, titled Where Is Daniel? The Family's Story. Daniel was abducted and murdered on December 7 2003, but it was not until March of this year his killer, Brett Peter Cowan, was found guilty of the crime that the Supreme Court Judge at the sentencing branded 'entirely abhorrent'. Denise and Bruce Morcombe told of how proud they are of their sons, and released a book about Daniel's disappearance on Tuesday . He is survived by two brothers, Bradley and Dean, and Bruce Morcombe said they are incredibly proud of their boys. 'I think we've done a pretty good job - They've both got nice girls and both got their own homes and good job and they've turned out pretty well,' he said. Daniel's remains were discovered in 2011 around the time his killer was charged. The whereabouts of Madeleine still remain a mystery.","The Morcombes and the McCanns met in July 2011 in England .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A jealous boyfriend left his girlfriend covered in blood and convinced her top lip had come off when he bit her during a kiss. Rhys Culley, of South Shields, Tyneside, had asked Chanttelle Ward if she loved him before he sank his teeth into her face during the horrific attack. Prosecutors said the 23-year-old had been jealous and insecure about what the 18-year-old could get up to while he was working away when he decided to disfigure her. Jurors at Newcastle Crown Court saw pictures of teeth marks in Miss Ward's upper lip after the attack, during which he smeared her own blood around her face and forced his tongue in her mouth.

Culley, who had been in a relationship with Miss Ward for more than two years, denied wounding with intent but was found guilty after a trial. He will be sentenced next month and has now been remanded in custody. Greame Cook, defending, applied for the shopfitter's bail to be allowed to continue while he awaits sentence but Miss Recorder Wigin refused. The judge said: 'The sentence will inevitably be custody.' Jurors heard Culley bit down on the victim's lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm thick piece of rubber. As well as the gruesome 'very deep' injury to her mouth, Miss Ward had bruising and scratches to her head and body after the attack, which started after a row about Facebook. Chanttelle Ward, who was left disfigured following a horrific attack when her boyfriend Rhys Culley sank his teeth into her face, leaving her convinced he had bitten her upper lip off . Miss Ward told jurors during the trial Culley had tried to kiss her and asked her if she still loved him before the bite. She said: 'He put his whole mouth around my lips and pulled, I thought that my whole lip had come off. There was blood everywhere.' The court heard trouble had flared at Miss Ward's home after a night out, when he chased her from room to room and attacked her. Prosecutor Emma Dowling said Culley kicked and punched Miss Ward, pulled her hair, threw her into furniture and threw things at her before finally launching the frenzied facial attack. The attack happened on February 22 this year, after the young couple had been out at the County Public House in South Shields. Miss Ward suffered not only the injuries to her mouth, but bruising to her arms and body, a scratch to her left breast and bruising of the face and ear . Jurors heard Culley, of South Shields, Tyneside, bit down on the victim's lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm thick piece of rubber . They had been celebrating Miss Ward's mother's birthday and at about 10.30pm Miss Ward, the defendant and her aunt Susan Stewart shared a taxi home, dropping her aunt off first. When the defendant and his girlfriend got back to her house, the mood of the night changed. The defendant brought up a conversation that his girlfriend had had with another man on Facebook earlier in the month. The defendant then took Miss Ward's phone off her in a bid to look through her Facebook messages. After Culley had bitten his victim, he 'rubbed his face in hers, smearing the blood across her face and then he stuck his tongue into her mouth . The court heard how when he found that the messages were no longer there he became angry and started to shout at Miss Ward accusing her of having something to hide. At this point, Miss Ward told the court, she realised that something was wrong and that this wasn't a 'normal' argument for the pair, who had been together for almost two and a half years. She became scared and lifted her phone to call the defendant's mother to ask her to come and get him. But Culley is said to have taken the phone from his victim, he also locked the doors so that she couldn't escape. Later, when her phone was left unattended she made an emergency call but Culley again took the phone from her. Miss Dowling said that after Culley had bitten his victim, he 'rubbed his face in hers, smearing the blood across her face and then he stuck his tongue into her mouth'. 'When the police arrived they saw that they both had blood on them and over their faces.' Culley was arrested and Miss Ward was taken to hospital to have her injuries examined. She suffered not only the injuries to her mouth, but bruising to her arms and body, a scratch to her left breast and bruising of the face and ear. During his evidence Culley said he did not mean to harm his 'beautiful' girlfriend, who he knew he was lucky to have.","Rhys Culley sank his teeth into Chanttelle Ward's face during the attack .

The body of Agnes Wanjiru-Wanjiku, 21, was found stuffed inside a septic tank at a hotel where she plied her trade as a sex worker.
