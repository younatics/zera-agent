"When Sue Burton’s teenage son Martin died from a brain haemorrhage, she and her husband Nigel made the courageous decision to donate his organs. It was a move that saved the life of Scottish teenager Marc McCay as he lay fighting for life in hospital in a race against time for a new heart. The couple’s gift meant that Marc, then aged 16, received their son’s heart, and is able to live life to the full. Now, after a friendship which began with an emotional thank you letter, Marc has met the Burtons for the first time – and Mrs Burton has once more been able to feel her son’s heart beating. Special bond: Marc McCay’s life was saved by Sue Burton’s move to donate her son’s heart . Tragic: Martin Burton died from a brain haemorrhage aged just 16. His mother said of her decision to donate his organs: ‘To stop another mother having the heartbreak of losing her son was the only good that came out of us losing Martin' Mrs Burton, 55, who lives in Grantham, Lincolnshire, with her husband, formerly of the RAF, said: 'It was the most poignant moment, to put my hand onto Marc’s chest and feel my son’s heart beating there. ‘He reached for my hand and placed it there and it was so emotional. I shed a bucketful of tears. ‘It was so wonderful to meet Marc and his mum Linda. We have been talking through letters and emails, but to meet them both in person was amazing.’ Marc, who is now 27, has three brothers and a sister and lives in Paisley, Renfrewshire. He was taken to hospital as a teenager after a virus attacked his heart, causing it to enlarge dangerously. He said: ‘I’d just returned from a holiday in Ibiza and started to feel unwell. I thought I’d just got a stomach bug but I quickly went downhill. 'I was admitted to my local hospital but I quickly became unconscious and I was rushed to hospital in Edinburgh.’ Doctors discovered his heart was enlarged and he was immediately put on the list for a heart transplant at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. He only had hours to live. A donor heart became available just in time thanks to the brave decision made by the Burtons. Their son Martin, also 16, had collapsed at home after suffering a brain haemorrhage. He was taken to hospital in Nottingham and put on a life support machine but doctors told his parents he had suffered irreparable brain damage and nothing could be done to save him. Mrs Burton, who also has a son Christopher, 32, said: ‘It all happened so quickly, we were just in complete shock. ‘The day before he’d been absolutely fine, until that night when he staggered into my bedroom and collapsed on the bed. ‘Just hours later he was on a life support machine and we were told there was nothing that could be done. Reunited: Eleven years on, Mr and Mrs Burton recently met with transplant recipient Marc McCay and his mother Linda (both in centre) after exchanging letters and emails . ‘We were asked about donating his organs – and as a mother it’s a decision that you never think you will have to make. ‘I can’t begin to describe the shock and the pain at losing our son. But we also knew that he had been young and healthy and it was only his brain that was damaged. ‘We knew that by donating his organs we could save other lives.’ Martin’s heart was taken to the Freeman Hospital where surgeons transplanted it into Marc. Mrs Burton said: ‘We knew that his heart had gone to a young lad, which was very meaningful. ‘I would have given anything that day to save my son’s life, but I knew it wasn’t possible. ‘To stop another mother having the heartbreak of losing her son was the only good that came out of us losing Martin.’ Grateful: Marc  said he can't thank Mr and Mrs Burton enough for making the brave decision that saved his life . Marc made a good recovery after his heart transplant and was allowed home after two months. His mother Linda, 51, then wrote to the Burtons, thanking them for their decision ten years ago. They have since written and emailed each other regularly – and finally met for the first time during a charity trip to Canada. Mrs Burton said: ‘The trip had been organised by the Donor Family Network and we were both invited along. It was an amazing opportunity to meet for the first time. ‘When Marc stepped off the train we were waiting on the platform, and we just hugged. We were both crying, it was such an emotional moment.’ It was at their next meeting, which took place last week, that Marc took hold of Mrs Burton’s hand and placed it on his chest. She said: ‘When I felt my son’s heart beating in his chest it was such an amazing moment and such a comfort to me after losing Martin. ‘We were very honoured to have met Marc. He’s such a lovely young man and we couldn’t have asked for Martin’s heart to have been given to a nicer person.’ Marc said: ‘I was nervous about meeting Sue and Nigel in person, but it was like we’d known each other forever. It was a very emotional moment. 'I couldn’t thank them enough for saving my life.’","Sue Burton’s teenage son Martin died from a brain haemorrhage aged 16 .

"Boris Johnson's latest attempt to present himself as a global statesman hit a glitch today as a walkabout in Boston left him knee-deep in snow. The London Mayor already faces a chilly reception when he returns to the UK, amid claims he is neglecting the capital while using international trips to boost his foreign affairs credentials ahead of a potential bid to become Tory leader. But his six-day visit to the US has coincided with an extreme cold snap hitting the country's eastern seaboard, with almost five feet of snow being dumped on Boston in just over two weeks. Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson toured the streets of Boston in a London Underground hat as he faced criticism for his international globetrotting . Despite being well-warned of the dire weather, Mr Johnson was pictured tramping around in smart black leather work shoes with not a wellington boot in sight . Forecasters warn that the four-day storm that has sat over the region is set to intensify. The morning commute for many was hellish while schools were closed and flights cancelled. In the middle of it all, Mr Johnson was trying to promote the idea of building roads underground 3,000 miles away in London, where temperatures are much milder at 9C. Despite being well-warned of the dire weather, Mr Johnson was pictured tramping around in smart black leather work shoes with not a wellington boot in sight. To keep his head warm, and his famous blonde hair covered, he had at least remembered to pack a London Underground wooly hat. Mr Johnson, who is hoping to return to parliament at the general election, has insisted his visits are to promote London. In his second trip across the pond in three months, he will this week hold talks with Hillary Clinton in New York City, as well as visiting Harvard University in Boston and a Congressional reception in Washington DC. After braving sub-zero temperatures for a walkabout in the snow, Mr Johnson announced plans to run more of London's roads through tunnels to improve air quality and free up land. Forecasters warn that the four-day storm that has sat over the region is set to intensify . Streets in Boston are all-but deserted as people choose to stay indoors after forecasts for an extra two foot of snow . City officials are at a loss over where to put all of the snow after five feet fell over the last two weeks . NOV 2012 – India – six-day tour including visit to Delhi . OCT 2013 – Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, China - week-long tour . OCT 2014 – Umbria, Italy - three-day stay paid for by Evening Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev . NOV 2014- New York City, USA – tour to promote his book on Winston Churchill . NOV 2014 - Singapore, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur – six-day Far East tour . JAN 2015 – Kurdistan, Iraq – visited British troops helping to train local fighters in war against Islamic State (IS) FEB 2015 – Boston, New York City and Washington DC, USA – six-day east coast tour . Parts of the A13, A3, A316, A4 and A406 could be diverted underground, he said. Mr Johnson told LBC: 'Because of the huge growth of white vans as a result of internet shopping, congestion on our roads with the growth we've got is going to get worse and worse unless we put in mitigating measures. 'We're going to do a lot. We're working to get lorries off the roads at the peak, we're doing all sorts of things to manage the traffic, but in the end, you've got to start thinking laterally and thinking bigger.' He tried to win over the locals by taking a trip on the T underground line. But after chatting with passengers the journey had to be abandoned when services were cancelled, and Mr Johnson headed outside in search of a bus. The visit to the US comes two weeks after a trip to Kurdistan – where he was pictured with an AK-47 while meeting British troops training local fighters in the war against the Islamic State (IS) - and trips to the Far East and USA last November. He also made high-profile international visits to China and India earlier in his mayoralty. Mr Johnson tried to press ahead with his planned engagements in Boston, designed to promote London investment in science and technology . A planned ride on Boston's T line service had to be abandoned where the service was cancelled . Eventually the London Mayor admitted defeat and returned to the street level to continue his journey on foot . Labour claimed the Conservative mayor, who is not standing for re-election when his term as mayor ends in 2016, has 'mentally checked out' of City Hall, while Green Party peer Jenny Jones, who is also an Assembly Member, said other people were being left to run the city. 'I feel he is lining himself up to be a global statesman when what we need is a London mayor on the case,' Baroness Jones said. Christian Wolmar, who wants to be Labour's mayoral candidate, said Mr Johnson had become a 'part-time mayor'. As well as campaigning in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he is standing to become MP, Mr Johnson carried out 95 party political visits in 10 months last year, including campaigning for Conservative candidates in Bath, Swindon and Staffordshire. Labour has called for Mr Johnson, who is paid a salary of £143,911 to reimburse London taxpayers for the days he is absent from the city during the general election campaign. Mr Johnson, who has dual US and UK nationality as he was born in New York, began his visit with a speech in Boston on how innovation can help the poor. Mr Johnson, picture on Monday, walks through snow drifts on the streets of Boston as he started his six-day visit to the US . Soon after arriving in Boston, Mr Johnson was posing for selfies with business leaders at the Institute of Contemporary Arts . On the first day of his trip, the Mayor announced plans to run more roads underground in London, more than 3,000 miles away . The message was interpreted as Mr Johnson positioning himself as a 'one nation' candidate for the Tory leadership when David Cameron steps down. He will meet former US secretary of state Mrs Clinton on Wednesday to discuss terrorism and the war in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State. Mr Johnson will also hold meetings with Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, his predecessor Michael Bloomberg, as well as the British stars of Broadway and New York fashion week. In November, Mr Johnson conducted a tour of television studios in New York promoting his book on Winston Churchill. The Mayor's official spokesman dismissed the criticism, insisting overseas visits were often at the invitation of Governments or city leaders. 'Each trip is focused on driving investment for London and for British business and have delivered substantial results for London and for UK plc,' the spokesman said. 'The U.S. trip will focus on tech, life science, policing, higher education, Foreign Direct Investment, city to city co-operation, business engagement and investment, theatre, film, culture and tourism. 'The Mayor will be accompanied by senior leaders in tech and life science and a variety of SMEs in the sector seeking new business in the United States. 'Their association with the Mayor's export programme opened new opportunities in the Far East recently and we hope to do the same here.'","London Mayor accused of using his trips to improve his global image .

"A mother-of-three who fell into the path of a van following a row with another woman outside the school gates has now died. Robyn McHale, 28, was airlifted to hospital after she fell in front of the van outside Forres Primary School in Hoddeson in Hertfordshire. Friends and relatives have claimed that Miss McHale, a former beauty queen, had previously complained she was being bullied outside the school gates.

"A South Korean woman got a rude awakening when she left her robot vacuum to do the cleaning while she took a nap. Instead of waking up to a spotless home, the 52-year-old, from Changwon city, had to be rescued by the fire department. The vacuum cleaner reportedly mistook the woman for dust, locked on to her hair and tried to suck it up. Scroll down for video . A South Korean woman had to be freed from her robot vacuum cleaner by paramedics after it sucked up her hair while she was napping on the floor of her home in Changwon city . The vacuum's suction was far from gentle, and wretched the woman from her slumber. The woman's hair then became entangled in the cleaning device. The woman, who has not been named, was unable to free herself  and called the fire department with a 'desperate rescue plea'. She was later freed from the vacuum by paramedics, according to the Guardian. The woman was not seriously injured. It is not known if she has retained the futuristic cleaning device. Korean Biz Wire reported that people from cultures where sleeping on the floor is normal - such as Korea - are at risk of being rudely awoken by their robot vacuums . Robot vacuum cleaners are slowly becoming commonplace. U.S firm iRobot has sold more than 10 million of its circular Roomba vacuum since it came on market in 2002 and Panasonic recently released a triangular rival called the Rulo. The vacuums use sensors to navigate around obstacles and avoid falling off surfaces, while sucking up dust and debris. They can also be programmed to find a recharging dock. Korean Biz Wire reported that people from cultures where sleeping on the floor is normal - like Korea - are far more likely to come into conflict with their robot vacuums.","The woman woke up when the robot vacuum latched on to her hair .

"A Florida special education teacher died Monday in childbirth just after bringing her fourth child into the world after opting to carry him to term, a decision she knew had the potential to kill her. Suzanne Mazzola, who suffered from a sever form of a condition called placenta accreta, gave birth to a healthy son named Owen via Cesarean. Emergency surgery followed, but even a team of 15 doctors couldn't save the 34-year-old. Now her friends and family have crowd funded tens of thousands to help her grieving husband and children in their time of need. Sad: Suzanne Mazzola, who suffered from a sever form of a condition called placenta accreta, gave birth to a healthy son named Owen via Cesarean. Emergency surgery followed, but even a team of 15 doctors couldn't save the 34-year-old . Bereaved: Several fundraisers have already raised over $60K for Mazzola's husband Joe and their four children . Left behind are Suzanne's husband Joe and their children Matteo, 7, Ella, 5, Luca, 2 and Owen. Just days after Suzanne's death, members of their Tamarac community have already raised over $60,000 for the family. On just one of several crowdfunding sites set up for the family--a YouCaring page that by Sunday evening had raised an impressive $59,753 of a goal of $100,000--Suzanne's aunt Janet writes: . 'We all said our goodbyes with smiling faces, never imagining it would be the last time we would see her.' According to Janet, doctors told Suzanne she could deliver Owen early--itself a risky proposition for the baby--but she refused. 'Being the wonderful strong woman and mother that she was and understanding the personal risk, she chose to wait until 35 weeks when the baby would be strong enough to survive,' Janet writes. That decision ultimately cost Suzanne her life, while it potentially saved Owen's. Suzanne was rushed into surgery following the delivery. With placenta accreta, the placental blood vessels grow too deeply into the mother's uterus and sometimes into surrounding organs. Giving birth with the condition is usually followed by the removal of the uterus and surgery to stop any hemorrhaging that can occur as the blood vessels are severed. In Suzanne's case, the heroic efforts of a team of 15 doctors at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood were unable to save her and she died in surgery. Life threatening: Suzanne suffered from a condition called placenta accreta in which the blood vessels of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterus, causing life threatening hemorrhaging at childbirth . Suzanne knew the risks but chose to carry the baby to term in order to ensure he'd be born healthy . Suzanne Mazzola died after childbirth because of a serious case of a condition known as placenta accreta, which affects as many as 1 in 533 pregnant women--and can be fatal in as many as 7 percent of those affected. The Mayo Clinic defines placenta accreta as: . A serious pregnancy condition that occurs when blood vessels and other parts of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterine wall... Typically, the placenta detaches from the uterine wall after childbirth. With placenta accreta, part or all of the placenta remains strongly attached. This can cause vaginal bleeding during the third trimester of pregnancy and severe blood loss after delivery. It's also possible for the placenta to invade the muscles of the uterus (placenta increta) or grow through the uterine wall (placenta percreta). If extensive placenta accreta is suspected during pregnancy, you'll likely need a C-section delivery followed by the surgical removal of your uterus (hysterectomy). Despite the risks, no one expected to lose Suzanne. 'She often mentioned how scared she was,' her co-worker Grace Duran told the Sun-Sentinel. 'We always told her to have faith and be positive. But we never thought this would be the outcome.' And with any such terrible turn of events, the family was left unprepared for the fallout, as Suzanne's aunt Janet writes. 'We never think the worst will happen and don't plan well enough for something like this. Suzanne’s four children and husband Joe need our support, as there isn’t any financial safety net. Please honor Suzanne by helping support her family in their time of need.' Suzanne's aunt Janet is helping raise thousands to help out the family. The last time she and many others saw the 34-year-old was at her baby shower (pictured). 'We all said our goodbyes with smiling faces, never imagining it would be the last time we would see her,' Janet said .","Suzanne Mazzola, a 34-year-old Florida special ed teacher, died Monday after becoming a mother once again to a healthy baby boy, Owen .

"'I am sure there are brilliant teachers who are nuns': Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt was forced to admit he backed nuns as teachers . Labour's education spokesman yesterday refused six times to say nuns can be good teachers before finally admitting that they can do a ‘fantastic job’. Tristram Hunt caused fury when he appeared to doubt their abilities during an appearance on the BBC’s Question Time last week. Yesterday, he was repeatedly asked on the Andrew Marr Show whether nuns could be good teachers, but kept avoiding giving a direct answer until the host demanded for a seventh time that he answer the ‘very straightforward question’. The former TV historian eventually conceded: ‘I am sure there are brilliant teachers who are nuns who are doing a fantastic job.’ Last week he was accused of ‘denigrating’ Roman Catholicism and being ‘ignorant’ and ‘arrogant’. During a debate over Labour’s policy of requiring all teachers to have official qualifications, Mr Hunt clashed with Cristina Odone, former editor of the Catholic Herald. The political commentator said some of her most inspiring teachers did not go to teacher training college and taught ‘real values’. But Mr Hunt said: ‘These were all nuns, weren’t they? … I know about your religious schooling and there’s a difference, I think, between a state education system having qualified teachers in the classroom.’ Miss Odone later told her former publication: ‘Tristram Hunt’s comments on nuns last night were arrogant and ignorant. Why is it acceptable to denigrate anything Catholic but bleat tolerance about every other religion? 'To know he and Labour stand a chance at the next election makes me fear for the 7,000 brilliant faith schools in this country.’ The shadow education secretary’s remarks led to outrage on Twitter. Tory MP Conor Burns wrote: ‘Absolutely shocking, sneering comments by Tristram Hunt about Catholic schools and nuns.’ Furore: Former Catholic Herald editor Christina Odone, left, was outraged after Mr Hunt, right, said there was a difference between nuns and properly qualified teachers in the state education system . Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride added: ‘My mum spent most of her career teaching in a convent school, working alongside nuns. They gave incredible educations.’ Nadine Dorries, a Tory MP, said it was an ‘arrogant, sneering, intolerant remark’, adding: ‘If Labour had any chance of holding on to its Catholic Glasgow seats, it lost it last night with Tristram Hunt’s remarks.’ Fellow Conservative MP Henry Smith pointed out that Mr Hunt had taught history in schools ‘despite not being qualified’. Yesterday, Mr Hunt said: ‘If I offended nuns in any way, that certainly wasn’t my intention. My point was that we need a highly effective, qualified teacher cohort in our schools.’","Labour education spokesman infuriated faith-school fans last week .

"A giant explosion which rocked the Ukrainian city of Donetsk sparked fears of a 'tactical nuke' after pro-government forces shelled a rebel-held chemical plant. Mobile phone footage captured the moment of the explosion, which turned the night's sky orange and was so powerful it could be heard as far away as downtown Donetsk, almost four miles away. The blast came as diplomats predicted that Russia could target other Baltic states, if they are allowed to hold on to eastern Ukraine. Mobile phone footage captured the moment a huge explosion rocked the Ukrainian city of Donetsk speaking fears of a nuclear weapon attack . The blast caused the night's sky to light up orange and was so powerful it could be heard as far away as downtown Donetsk . Last night, locals posting on social media speculated it could have been caused by a nuclear weapon due to the ferocity of the shelling and the impact on the chemical plant. It also temporarily caused a mushroom cloud to hang over the city with the bombing shattering windows and shaking building foundations. However, pro-Russian rebels said that the huge explosion was caused by Ukrainian artillery shell hitting the chemical plant, which lies in the middle of the Ukrainian industrial heartland in Donetsk. It has long been feared that shelling would hit industrial units causing a huge explosion such as this. Luckily, no damage or injuries were caused in the blast but the conflict between Russia-backed separatists and government forces has now killed more than 5,300 people and displaced more than a million. Pro-Russian rebels said that the huge explosion was caused by Ukrainian artillery shell hitting the chemical plant, which lies in the middle of the Ukrainian industrial heartland in Donetsk . Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and pro-government forces loyal to Kiev has intensified in Ukraine's south east region since the new year, even though the two sides agreed a truce in September. And now diplomats are warning that Russia could be planning to target other Baltic states with Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves comparing appeasing president Vladimir Putin to that of when Nazi Germany was allowed to seize parts of the former Czechoslovakia in 1938. He said he had no fears about a Russian invasion of his country but accepted the security environment in the Baltic area had 'dramatically changed'. A woman cries out in anger after her apartment block in Donetsk is set on fire as a result of shelling. Fighting between the two sides in Ukraine has intensified in recent weeks . An elderly woman has to be helped to her feet after discovering that the apartment block where she lives has been damaged by shelling . He told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'We don't have to jump right ahead to being afraid of being invaded. That's far ahead of what we are concerned about today which is reckless and irresponsible behaviour throughout our region.' But asked how important it was that a firm or even firmer line continue to be taken against Russia's behaviour, he replied: 'We certainly think that if you appease right now in Ukraine, we know from history that appeasement will never satisfy those that are being appeased. 'Munich '38 I think should be a lesson to all of us even today.' Firefighters work to extinguish the blaze at the residential block. It comes as diplomats are warning that Russia could be planning to target other Baltic states . People carry bags of their possessions away from the burning building as shelling and artillery fire intensifies in Donetsk . The agreement, widely viewed as a failed attempt at appeasement, allowed Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia, creating an area referred to as the Sudetenland. And asked whether being a member of Nato was comforting in the context of the Russian threat, the Estonian president added: 'That's one reason why we first of all worked very hard to qualify for membership. 'And why we along with the UK and another one or two countries are the only ones in Nato in Europe that fulfill the two per cent defence expenditure.' Meanwhile John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine has called for military intervention in the country. Pro-government forces unload Grad rockets from a truck before launching them towards pro-Russian separatist forces outside Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine . Rockets are fired towards separatist forces in Ukraine. Nine Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and 26 wounded in the last 24 hours . Fighting between pro-Russian rebels and pro-government forces loyal to Kiev has intensified in Ukraine's south east region since the new year . He told the Independent: '[Putin’s] statements, his provocations against the Baltic states, against Kazakhstan, indicate his goals are greater than Ukraine. If we don’t stop Mr Putin in Ukraine, we may be dealing with him in Estonia. 'I’m not saying we will, but he has given indication that this could happen. The most important national security challenge in the world today is a rogue Kremlin and we need to stop him and Ukraine is the place to do it.' The comments come after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Vladimir Putin is behaving like a 'mid 20th-century tyrant' with the illegal annexation of Crimea. He said the Russian President will pay a 'political and economic price' for what he is doing in the region but ruled out Britain offering arms to Ukraine.

"The number of men having breast reduction surgery on the NHS has over doubled since 2009, new figures reveal. Cruelly dubbed ''moobs' - or man boobs - 200 men in the last five years have been so distressed by their chests that they have undergone operations on the NHS to reduce their size, according to data which emerged during a response to a parliamentary question. Between 2009 and 2010 only 18 operations were performed on the NHS but by 2013 to 2014 the number had risen to 39. Many more procedures are believed to have been carried out privately. The number of male breast reductions performed on the NHS has doubled since 2009 . Speaking to FEMAIL, consultant plastic surgeon at the Liverpool Women's Hospital, Kevin Handcock, explains that moobs, which are technically called gynaecomastia, can occur for two reasons. 'The two types are known as 'true gynaecomastia' and 'false gynaecomastia'. 'True gynaecomastia is when a man actually develops breast tissue, and usually presents in teenagers and young adults. Occasionally it can also occur later in life as a side-effect of drugs for various conditions. 'Where as in false gynaecomastia, no real breast tissue has developed and the appearance of breasts is purely down to fat.' It is easy then, with the knowledge that the UK obesity crisis continues to get worse, to assume the rise in the number of 'moob' reductions is purely due to more overweight men developing fatty chests. Tam Fry, spokesperson for the National Obesity Forum told FEMAIL: 'Obesity is starting to get out of control in the UK. Though men still only account for one in ten plastic surgery patients, figures are rising . 'This sort of thing will only increase in the future. We will see increase in treatments of many of the other conditions associated with obesity. It is something that specialists in this area are extremely worried about.' However,  consultant plastic surgeon Kevin Handcock says this might not be the only reason for the increase. 'People are becoming more aware that there is treatment available for this,' he explains. 'Men who in the past would have suffered in silence, hiding under baggy T-shirts now feel able to come forward and do something about it.' Now that there is less stigma attached to men having cosmetic surgery, it seems we might begin to see numbers of all procedures rise, although men still only account for one in ten cosmetic procedures according to the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.","Figures of male breast reductions have doubled since 2009 .
Last year 39 procedures were performed on the NHS .
Thousands more were performed privately .
Rise thought to be down to rise in obesity and lack of stigma for men ."
"An abandoned newborn was rescued by a homeless man after he discovered her wrapped in a blanket lying in grass, not far from a busy California intersection. The man, known only as Mark, heard the baby girl's cries and spotted her behind a brick wall on a curb near Lakewood Center Mall, where she is believed to have been born, according to police. A woman, 35, who said she witnessed the birth was found bleeding and was taken to hospital where doctors concluded she had recently given birth. She is the suspected mother of the baby girl. The homeless man, known only as Mark, heard the baby girl's cries and spotted her behind a brick wall on a curb (above, the area where authorities believe the child was born as blood stains were visible in the grass and on the curb) near Lakewood Center Mall in California . Mark was on the way to the hospital when he ran into his friend Vance Cobb (right, pictured with his partner, left), who is also homeless. Vance told him to take the newborn to the nearby fire station . Mark was cycling past while looking for recycling items when he found the baby near Hardwick Street and Lakewood Boulevard, according to CBSLA. After he discovered her, he attempted to carry her to the hospital when he ran into his friend Vance Cobb, who told him to take her to the nearby fire station. Vance, who is also homeless, said the baby girl was only a few hours old as she still had blood on her. He said: 'Mark told me that he had found something just wouldn't believe it when I see it, I was like oh my God. It was a baby.' Items were left behind in the area and blood stains were visible on the curb, grass and part of the street which makes authorities believe the mother gave birth there, according to myFoxLA. He transported the baby on his bike to the Los Angeles County Fire Department where she was treated and then transferred to Miller's Children Hospital in Long Beach. The newborn was found lying in a patch of grass near the intersection of Hardwick Street and Lakewood Boulevard (above) Mark transported her on his bike (above) to the fire department where she was later transferred to Miller's Children Hospital in Long Beach . While police were at the scene, a 35-year-old woman approached them and said she witnessed the birth and helped the mother cut the umbilical cord. During questioning at the station, detectives noticed the woman, who denies being the mother, had blood on her chair when she stood up and was taken to Long Beach Memorial Hospital for treatment. While at the hospital, doctors examined her and concluded that she recently gave birth, as the placenta and partial umbilical cord remained inside of her. The suspected mother might also be homeless and living on the streets, according to ABC7. A woman, 35, approached police and said she witnessed the birth, but after she was questioned at the station, investigators realized she was bleeding. Doctors at Long Beach Memorial Hospital (above) concluded she recently gave birth. Detectives believe she is the mother . Under California's Safe Haven Law, a newborn can be dropped off at a designated 'safe surrender site', which usually includes hospitals and fire stations, within the first 72 hours without any questions asked during that time frame. The investigation into this incident is ongoing as police are possibly considering it as a child endangerment case. It will be submitted to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for review and possible prosecution. The suspected mother is set to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, and results from a DNA test are pending.","The man, known only as Mark, found baby girl behind wall near Hardwick Street and Lakewood Blvd in California .

"The Deputy Director of the Secret Service has been reassigned within the Department of Homeland Security, the agency said Monday. A 29-year-veteran of the government's security arm, A.T. Smith is stepping down from his position as the second-highest ranking Secret Service officer in the latest shake up at the agency as it reinvents itself in the wake of numerous high-profile security breaches involving the president. At least five other Secret Service officials have been ordered to seek other positions within DHS or retire in the last several weeks, and the director of the Secret Service was dismissed last fall. OUT: A 29-year-veteran of the government's security arm, A.T. Smith is stepping down from his position as the second-highest ranking Secret Service officer in the latest shake up at the agency as it reinvents itself in the wake of numerous high-profile security breaches involving the president . Smith, who had been deputy director since 2012, was in charge of day-to-day operations at the agency and managing its 6,500 employees. 'Deputy Director Smith has had an exceptional law enforcement career,' Acting Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said in a statement on Monday. 'His contributions to the agency have been invaluable. I salute his distinguished service to the Secret Service and the nation.' Clancy and Smith were scheduled to update the House Government and Oversight Committee on Thursday on the agency's ongoing review of internal operations. In light of today's news, the committee's chairman, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, and ranking member, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, said in a joint statement the hearing had been postponed. Chaffetz, a Republican, had called for Smith's firing over departmental issues, including an incident detailed in an October inspector general report in which Smith pulled agents off the White House and sent them to the Maryland home of an agency employee feuding with a neighbor. 'Last week, we met jointly with the White House Counsel and the Department of Homeland Security and expressed our shared conviction that the Secret Service needs to turn the page with respect to its senior leadership,' Chaffetz and Cummings said in their statement today. 'We commend the Department for its numerous personnel actions last month, as well as its recent decision to transfer the Deputy Director out of the agency.' The congressmen said they were pushing Thursday's committee hearing to give Clancy more time and 'to ensure that he is able to focus on bolstering the Secret Service’s core mission of protecting the President, his family, and numerous other officials and dignitaries.' 'We thank the hardworking men and women of the Secret Service for remaining committed to their incredibly important work,' they added. A member of the Secret Service's Uniformed Division sits in his car on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House on January 26. A small aerial drone was found on the grounds of the White House earlier that morning. The drone posed no threat but the incident dredged up concerns about White House protection among lawmakers . In January, Clancy gave four assistant agents pink slips, allowing them to obtain other employment in Homeland Security, the parent department of the Secret Service, within in the next month rather than firing them outright. The four officers - Mark Copanzzi, Paul Morrissey, Jane Murphy, and Dale Pupillo - oversaw the agency's missions of protection, investigations, technology and public affairs. Another assistant director, this one in charge of the Secret Service's training wing, Vic Erevia, opted to retire. DHS is still reviewing candidates to serve as permanent director of the Secret Service. Clancy, a retired agent who previously served in the president's detail and is currently on leave from a job in the private sector, is reportedly in the mix of candidates to succeed Julia Pierson, the disgraced former head of the agency who resigned last year a man wielding a knife jumped the fence outside the White House and made it inside the building. According to the New York Times, other interviewees for the top post include Sean Joyce, a former deputy director of the FBI, Terrance Gainer, the former chief of the Capitol Police, and Cathy Lanier, an officer with the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. While Clancy, who was hand picked by President Barack Obama to lead the agency after Pierson's departure, may appear to be the obvious choice for director, a DHS report following the security lapses last year recommended an agency outsider be brought in to make reforms. Homeland Security Secretary Eric Holder said Sunday that a decision would come 'pretty soon.' Just last month a man was able to crash land a drone on the 1600 Pennsylvania lawn in the middle of the night. The drone's owner said it was accident, and the White House immediately confirmed that the two-foot long quadcopter posed no threat. But the incident dredged up concerns about White House protection among lawmakers.","A 29-year-veteran of the agency, A.T.

"The Lord Mayor of London's 17th century country mansion where Samuel Pepys was invited for dinner has been put on the market for £45million - but it still needs another £10million to turn it into a home. Swakeleys House, a Grade I listed Jacobean building set among 25 acres, was originally built for Sir Edmund Wright as a palatial retreat within easy reach of the City of London. It was later acquired by another wealthy businessman, Sir Robert Vyner, who invited the famous diarist Samuel Pepys to dinner. He described the grand property in Ickenham, Middlesex, as 'a very pleasant place'. The Lord Mayor of London's 17th century country mansion where Samuel Pepys was invited for dinner has been put on the market for £45m . Swakeleys House, a Grade I listed Jacobean building set in 25 acres of land, was originally built for Sir Edmund Wright as a palatial retreat . Wright, a successful merchant, bought the estate in Ickenham, Middlesex in 1629 and commissioned the grand, H-shaped Jacobean mansion . But the 20,000sq ft property has not been used as a residence for more than 80 years. It now has planning permission to be turned into one of the country's finest family homes - if the prospective buyer pumps in millions of pounds of repairs. When restored, the fixer-upper could boast 23 en-suite bedrooms, along with a party pavilion for 200 guests. There will also be a separate 22,000sq ft office building. Wright, a successful merchant, bought the estate in 1629, before becoming the Lord Mayor of London in 1940. After buying the land, he commissioned the grand, H-shaped mansion but it took nine years to complete. The property was inherited by Wright's daughter Katherine, who then sold it to the rich financier, Sir Robert. In the diary entry written by Pepys, he described the property as 'not very modern' but with 'some things to excess'. He wrote: 'It is a place not very modern in the garden nor house, but the most uniform in all that ever I saw; and some things to excess. The property was later acquired by businessman, Sir Robert Vyner, who invited the famous diarist to dinner. He described it as 'very pleasant' Despite being located inside the M25 and within a 20-minute drive of central London, Swakeleys House has 25 acres of private garden . The property could be one of the capital's most impressive private homes, but will need around £10 million spent to get it into shape . The screen in the property's great hall, which boasts crests of arms, was installed by Sir James Harington, the husband of Sir Edmund’s daughter, Katherine. Pepys wrote about the screen in his diary when he visited the palace to dine with Sir Robert Vyner . 'The window-cases, door-cases, and chimneys of all the house are marble.. and after dinner Sir Robert led us up to his long gallery, very fine, above stairs (and better, or such, furniture I never did see).' He also commented on the Harington screen, which was installed in the mansion's great hall by Sir James Harington, the husband of Sir Edmund's daughter Katherine. The grand stairwell inside the Grade I listed property, which has mainly been used as offices over the past 100 years . He wrote: 'Pretty to see over the screen of the hall (put up by Sir J. Harington, a Long Parliament man) the King’s head, and my Lord of Essex on one side, and Fairfax on the other; and upon the other side of the screen, the parson of the parish, and the lord of the manor and his sisters.' When Sir Robert died, the property was passed through his family, before being acquired by Reverend Thomas Clarke in 1750, in whose family it remained until 1923. That year, the property was taken over by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office, which sold it in 1955. Since then, the ownership of the property has been unclear, although its current owner is thought to be a Briton living abroad. It has mainly been used for offices. Despite being located inside the M25 and within a 20-minute drive of central London, Swakeleys House has 25 acres of private garden. The advert also describes the property as being 'Built for a Lord Mayor of London' and 'Fit for a King'. English Heritage describe the home as an 'important example of artisan mannerism'. Once the restoration is complete, the main property would feature a great hall, family dining, sitting and breakfast rooms, as well as a kitchen, study and music room. The estate will also feature a stable block with a long gallery, family room, library and dog wash facilities. There will be numerous detached, single storey buildings with guest accommodation. Despite the eye-watering price-tag, it is thought there has been plenty of interest, particularly from the Middle East and Asia. Henry Pryor, who helps the wealthy buy property, said: 'It is very rare but not unheard of for properties like this to come to the market. '25 acres within the M25 is very unusual indeed and must contribute a great deal to the agent's guide price believed to be around £45m. 'The distant drone of the A40, the planes landing at Northolt would put most of my clients off but there may be an ego to whom the house appeals.' Charles Godfrey, a partner at the agency GN2, which is selling Swakeleys House, described the estate as one of London's best kept secrets. He said: 'It is an incredible place and, in total, has around 70,000sq ft of space as well as 25 acres of land. 'The property is a very well kept secret. The amount of times I've driven past and not know it is there. 'It is one of only a few buildings which has a royal crest of arms and is insured for north for £50 million. It is also in a good condition. 'Like many buildings of its type, it has been used for offices. However, it now has planning permission for the main house to be restored to its former glory. 'The new construction will have the spa, guest accommodation and an indoor and outdoor swimming pool. 'We have had a lot of interest in it particularly from the Middle-East and Asia. It is one of London's great assets.'","Swakeleys House, a Grade I listed building set in 25 acres, originally built for Sir Edmund Wright as a palatial retreat .

"A woman accused of leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can near Salt Lake City is not mentally competent to stand trial, a Utah judge ruled today. Court-ordered evaluations found that Alicia Englert, 23, is mentally disabled and has an IQ too low for her to legally stand trial on a felony attempted murder charge, lawyer Josie Brumfield said. Utah law says a defendant must have an IQ of 70 to face trial. In a Wechsler IQ Test, an 'average classification' score is between 90 and 109. Scroll down for video . Court-ordered evaluations found that Alicia Englert, 23,  is mentally disabled and has an IQ too low for her to legally stand trial on a felony attempted murder charge for allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can near Salt Lake City . Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial . Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial. Englert had a difficult childhood, Brumfield said. Her mother went to prison when she was about 18 months old, and though she was able to finish high school, a single in-depth conversation shows she didn't function at typical adult level. 'She kind of got lost in the cracks, really didn't get any help or treatment,' Brumfield said. An attorney for Englert's parents called for the charge to be dismissed. 'She doesn't understand the gravity of what took place, and the finding of incompetency confirms that,' Jessica Peterson said. Alicia Englert has not entered a plea. She appeared in court with her parents wearing a black jacket and green blouse, and did not take questions from reporters. She remained free on bail after Monday's hearing, and state authorities will evaluate Englert to decide what form her treatment will take, Brumfield said. Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26 . Prosecutors say the infant would have died if she had not been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a cat purring in the garbage. She was suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection when she was found . Her father, Robert Englert said at the time of the incident that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby . Prosecutors will take another look at the case to decide what happens next, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said. In some cases, defendants are able to face charges after treatment, but sometimes the setback for prosecutors is permanent, he said. Englert's daughter was taken into custody and has recovered from the horrifying incident. She is now five months old and being adopted . Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26.

Englert's father, Robert said at the time that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby. Her baby was flown to a hospital and placed on a ventilator, but she recovered and is being adopted. Judge Hruby-Mills granted a supervised 90-minute goodbye visit for Englert and her family in December, a fairly common allowance for parents whose rights are terminated after their children are taken into state custody. Fox13 previously published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said. Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said. But Robert Englert, said in September that his daughter had only just started to realize what she had done. 'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.'

"Most children have tried to tackle an entire lollipop without crunching it, but few have succeeded. Now scientists have managed to calculate quite how long it takes to achieve such a feat - and it's a lip-smacking 2,500 licks. By placing a variety of boiled sweets into flows of water, researchers were able to watch how they dissolved over time. They calculated that it would take around 1,000 licks of the tongue to dissolve 1cm (0.4 inches) of candy. Scroll down for video . The scientists took time lapse photographs of lollipops as they dissolved in flows of water with the images above showing how a sphere of 6 cm looked after an hour (image a). They found that the turbulence created in the flow of water (images b and c) caused the back of the candy to flatten and the top to be smooth (d) This means that the average Chupa Chups lolly - which measures around 2.5cm (one inch) in diameter - would take about 2,500 licks to dissolve. Researchers at the National University of Singapore have created a 'digital lollipop', which uses electric currents to transmit virtual tastes straight to your tastebuds. The device has echoes of Roald Dahl's fictional Everlasting Gobstopper, which never runs out, and the Chewing Gum Meal, which had several different flavours packed into one piece of gum. All of the four major taste groups - sweet, salty, bitter and sour - can be mimicked through a silver electrode which makes contact with the tongue. The gadget also makes tiny adjustments in temperature to simulate tastes more convincingly. Dr Leif Ristroph, a mathematician at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences who led the study, said lollipops also tend to be sculpted into similar shapes by the flow of liquid like saliva over the surface. He said: 'We find that different initial geometries are sculpted into a similar terminal form before ultimately vanishing. 'How flowing fluids generate unique shapes through erosion or dissolution is complex and fascinating. 'As a whimsical application, this scaling allows us to address the following long-standing question: ""How many licks does it take to get to the centre of a lollipop?"".' Dr Ristroph and his colleagues placed candy lollipops ranging from 1 cm to 10cm (0.4-4 inches) into flows of water moving between 0.22mph and 2.2mph. The researchers used simple candy shapes such as spheres and cylinders, monitoring how they dissolved using time lapse photography. The scientists found that lollipops all dissolve into the same regular shape no matter their original size . They found that regardless of the initial shape of the candy and the speed of the water, it formed consistent shapes over time with about 1cm dissolving each hour. The back of the lollipop, closest to the stick, flattens relatively quickly while the front stays dome shaped and any irregularities are smoothed away. The front and back faces then slowly grow closer together as they dissolve away. Experts found that regardless of the initial shape of the candy and the speed of the water, it formed consistent shapes over time with about 1cm dissolving each hour (diagram pictured) Writing in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, the scientists said that turbulence created at the back of the lollipop helps to dissolve the back and make it flat. While the action of a tongue on the candy may also alter the way a candy dissolves, the scientists say that reliably measuring this as it happens will be difficult. Their findings do also have some serious applications with dissolution of materials being an essential process in many chemical and pharmaceutical industries. It could also help to explain some of the processes that occur during erosion of rocks by rivers and the sea.","Scientists at New York University claim it takes 1,000 licks per cm of candy .
They placed lollipops of different sizes and shapes into slow moving water .
They took time lapse photographs as the lollipops dissolved in the flows .

"With two Grammy nods and a nomination for an Academy Award, it's no surprise that singer John Legend has been chosen to grace the cover of Los Angeles Confidential's latest issue. To celebrate his magazine cover, the title is hosting a big bash on Thursday at the Beverly Hills Hotel - yet, Legend has opted to decline the invitation. His decision to boycott is in response to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, owner of the hotel chain, and Brunei's Sharia law that allows for the stoning, amputation or flogging of those found guilty of adultery or homosexuality. Taking a stand: John Legend (left) has refused to attend a party being held in his honour at the Beverly Hills Hotel in protest at the hotel owner, the Sultan of Brunei's, support of harsh anti-gay legislation (right) Despite the singer's boycott, the magazine has stayed strong in their decision to hold the party in the hotel's Pink Palace Crystal Ballroom . Several of Hollywood's most prominent A-listers, such as Jay Leno, Elton John and Ellen DeGeneres, have also made their protest against the hotel known. 'These policies, which among other things, could permit women and LGBT Bruneians to be stoned to death, are heinous and certainly don't represent John's values,' his publicist, Amanda Silverman, said in a statement defending his choice to skip the party. 'John does not, in any way, wish to further enrich the Sultan while he continues to enforce these brutal laws.' Model Chrissy Teigen (L) looked striking in white as she attended the Grammy's with John Legend . Star turn: The talented singer performs at the Grammy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Sunday night . The celebrity favourite has come under fire in recent months with some A-listers boycotting the hotel . The Sultan first enacted the laws in October 2015 and as of April, celebrities had already begun calling for a widespread boycott via Twitter. In May, the Feminist Majority Foundation organised a protest across the street, which was attended by Jay Leno and Francis Fisher, among others. In response to Los Angeles Confidential's decision to throw a party on site, the Human Rights Campaign also sent a letter, urging them to 'reconsider their decision.' Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres is among the stars who have spoken out against the Sultan of Brunei for his country's homophobic laws . Still, the magazine has stayed strong in their decision to hold the party in the hotel's Pink Palace Crystal Ballroom. CEO Katherine Nicholls of parent company Niche Media, which owns the magazine, said: 'To boycott all companies and hotels with affiliations and ownership in nations that do not share our beliefs would cause serious financial harm and damage to the Los Angeles community and the American economy.'","The extravagant bash is due to be held on Thursday night .

"A Muslim family have been left fearing for their safety after discovering a number of racist notes in their letterbox. Since receiving the intimidating letters on Wednesday, a Brisbane mother-of- three has admitted that she is too afraid to let her children, who are all under the age of six, play outside. Illustrated with swastikas and the letters 'KKK', the mail was addressed to 'Muslim c***s*' and 'terrorist c***s' and threatened to 'kill your women and children'. They were also inscribed with the words 'white power coming soon' and said 'we know where you live… this is the beginning.' A Muslim family living in Brisbane found the pictured three racist notes in their mailbox on Wednesday . A mother-of-three who received the notes said she was too afraid to let her young children play outside . 'We reported it [to police], but not sure anything will come of it...I will not let my children play outside any more... so disgusting and extremely uneducated,' the mother, who preferred to remain anonymous, wrote on the Islamophobia Register of Australia's Facebook page. 'My in-laws visit often [and] they all wear hijab...my husband's cousin also got the same letter she too doesn't wear hijab. 'Both our families have young children and that's what this letter is threatening! I've taken it serious[ly] and I am scared.' Her husband told Daily Mail Australia he had no idea why his family had received the letters, saying that they mostly kept to themselves. 'I pray regularly at home, but I don't go to any  local mosques,' he said. 'They probably didn't see a Christmas tree over Christmas and thought ""he must be Muslim"".' Her husband said he was unsure why his family had been targeted as they kept to themselves, adding that he believed the note's writer to be a local . The man said believed the writer of the note was someone from his neighbourhood, adding: 'It's someone who lives in the area, a local, definitely.' 'We've got CCTV cameras at home and we've seen them do it [insert the letters] the night before at 7:30pm.' A spokeswoman for Queensland police told Daily Mail Australia that they had received the complaint and  confirmed that an active forensic examination of the notes was under way. Mohammed Yusuf, the former president of the Islamic Council of Queensland, said  there had been an increase in anti-Muslim sentiment following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. 'There is a lot of this happening. I have personally received emails – not threatening, but abusive - so it's nothing new,' he said. 'It's a concern because you don't know what the next step could be; it could be an actual physical incident.' The notes were reported to police and to the Islamophobia Register of Australia . The founder of the Islamophobia Register of Australia, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia that threats like the one received by the Brisbane family were not  common, but admitted that the nature of the incident was concerning. Founder of the register, Mariam Veiszadeh, said incidents like this were common following acts of terror and public conversation about national security . 'Incidents of Islamaphobia are common following periods of increased hostility such as the Sydney siege or more particularly, following the raids in Sydney that targeted Australian Muslims,' Ms Veiszadeh said. 'While targeted threats like this one are not widespread at the moment, given the nature of the threats - targeting their children and given that it was left in their letterbox, suggesting that someone was observing them – it is quite worrying. 'Having spoken to the mother who received the letter, she was incredibly frightened that evening and she was struggling, so it is something that impacts families and communities.' The register was launched in 2014 following the police raids and anecdotal evidence of Islamophobia began to surface. 'There wasn't any comprehensive reporting on what was happening and we wanted to capture it in a meaningful way, provide a forum to discuss anti-Muslim sentiment and provide support for the victims and speak on their behalf to police to ensure they were being taken seriously,' Ms Veiszadeh said. 'We are also interestingly getting reports from non-Muslim Australians who are witnessing incidents. It's encouraging and shows that slowly there can be a shift in attitudes.' Ms Veiszadeh (pictured speaking to media about the federal government's proposed counter-terrorism laws) said she spoke to the mother who received the notes and described her as being frightened and distressed .","A mother of three young children discovered the notes in the mailbox of her Brisbane home .

"Bystander: Anthony Diaz, 13, was shot dead Sunday night on the northwest side of Chicago while he was filming a fight between two groups of high school-age girls . A 13-year-old boy in Chicago was shot to death Sunday night as he filmed a fight between his older sisters and another group of  girls which was sparked by an online feud. Anthony Diaz, 13, left his home on the north west side of the city after 10pm with his 15- and 16-year-old sisters. As he was filming the fight about a block away from their home, someone approached and shot him. Paramedics rushed the Belmont Cragin Elementary School student to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was later pronounced dead at 11:30pm. Police have not yet released a description of the shooter, who remains at large. Diaz's stepfather Ralph Otero, an Evangelical preacher, says he saw the teen leaving the house with his sisters and went to wake his wife because he didn't like them going outside so late. He estimates they were gone for no longer than five minutes when Diaz's 17-year-old sister called hysterically, saying he had been shot. '(Anthony's mother) was telling me ""They shot Anthony, they're telling me they shot Anthony."" So when I got there he was already laying on the ground,' Mr Otero told the Chicago Tribune. 'And the paramedics were working on him.' 'When I got there, I knew it would be bad ... they said they shot him over 7 or 8 times. They came right next to him and I guess when he fell, they came and kept on shooting,' he added. Scroll down for video . Fued: Diaz and his two older sisters, 15 and 17, left their house after 10pm to meet a rival group of girls about a block away. An unidentified gunman approached Diaz and shot him several times . On the loose: Diaz was rushed to Mount Sinai hospital where he was pronounced dead at 11:30pm. The gunman remains at large . Diaz's sister Jennifer Sosa told ABC 7 that the fight was sparked by disrespectful comments on social media. 'She was dissing our gang. We came, we fought. They just got out of hand. They jumped all of us and they ended up shooting my brother,' Ms Sosa said. She says they expected to get into a brawl, but did not think anyone would bring a gun. Mean comments: Diaz's sister Jennifer Sosa pictured above. Ms Sosa told reporters that the fight started on social media . Meeting: Above, a screen shot of a Facebook post Diaz's sister wrote just before the fight late Sunday night . The shooter allegedly shot Diaz once, and then stood over the victim while continuing to fire several more rounds. Police found at least four casings in the snow next to where Diaz was found struggling. They also were able to retrieve Diaz's phone, and the video files of the fight. Mr Otero said his stepson excelled in school and loved basketball - especially hometown team the Chicago Bulls. 'He’s a good student, he’s not a gangbanger. He didn’t give us any headaches,' Mr Otero told NBC Chicago. 'He was a handsome kid. Very smart. I love him with all my heart, I don't know what I'm going to do without him,' Diaz's mother Laura Otero told ABC 7. The family also just moved to the area in hopes that it would be safer for their children. Diaz was one of six siblings. Mourning: Diaz's mother Laura Otero cried as she spoke with reporters early Monday morning.

"Wanted by police: Mehmet Berker is said to have set fire to a cat and then posted a photo of its charred remains on social media . Police in Turkey are hunting a thug who set fire to a cat and then posted a photo of its charred remains on social media - offering a prize to anyone who could 'identify the animal'. Vile Mehmet Berker, 24, uploaded the sickening image of the scorched body onto his Facebook account encouraging his friends to take part in his sick game. Along with the picture, he wrote: 'If you can guess which animal this is, I will pay you 50 Turkish Liras [the equivalent of £12].' He then wrote: 'I don't know why I did this, but, hey, it's a bit of a challenge and no one will miss it coz it was a  stray. Come on then, who's up for it.' The account was quickly disabled by Facebook management but not before the image had been shared and tweeted hundreds of times. Horrified viewer Murat Nas, 25, said: 'I was simply disgusted when I saw what he had posted. 'We aren't proper friends, only on Facebook. But how can anyone be so sick as to do this. 'I don't know if he actually set the poor cat on fire himself, but his comments certainly suggest he did. 'But either way it's still absolutely abhorrent. What sort of person would do this?' Police are now looking for Berker and say although his Facebook account did not say where in Turkey he lived, he should be easy to locate. A police spokesman said: 'Experts have analysed the photo and have concluded that it is a cat. 'When the offender is found and if he is guilty of killing the animal he will be fined as mistreating animals is merely a misdemeanor rather than a crime.' Vile post: Along with the picture, he wrote: 'If you can guess which animal this is I will pay you 50 Turkish Liras.

"When little Myla Lawrie was brought home from hospital four months ago, a veritable sea of pink greeted her, with clouds of balloons filling the sitting room, along with cards, bunting and ribbons in every shade of girliness. For this was a very special event in the Lawrie family. When Myla was born in October, she was the first girl to be born in her family since 1809. The last time a midwife announced ‘It’s a girl’, the Napoleonic war was still being fought, the motorcar was yet to be invented, and ‘mad’ King George III was on the English throne. Oh boy, we've done it! Hannah and Mark with baby Myla and brothers Ben, nine, Zac, seven and Mason, three . No wonder her proud parents — Hannah, a 26-year-old midwife, and Mark, a 33-year-old professional golfer turned coach, from Maidstone in Kent — wanted to celebrate. ‘When Mark and I first got together, he told me how everyone in his family, for five generations, had produced boys,’ explains Hannah. ‘He warned me that the chances of us ever having a daughter were pretty remote.’ True to form, when Hannah became pregnant in 2012, no one was surprised when Mason, who’s now three, was born. Looking back over the family tree, Hannah could see why everyone was so convinced. The last girl to be born in the Lawrie family was Mason’s great-great-great Aunt Bessie, born more than 200 years ago in the same year as Charles Darwin. Bessie and her brother had had sons, and so the pattern had continued, all the way down to Mark and his brother Glenn. Mark has two other boys, ten-year-old Ben and seven-year-old Zac, from a previous relationship, while Glenn had one son, Reece, who’s 14. ‘I even questioned whether there could be a genetic condition that meant Mark produced only male sperm,’ says Hannah. Warm welcome: Myla, pictured with her motehr Hannah, is the first girl to be born in her family since 1809 . ‘I asked numerous doctors and consultants in the hospital where I work if this was the case, but was told time and again that it wasn’t. Every time a baby is conceived, the chances of it being a girl are 50/50, they told me — but in Mark’s family, for some reason, it never was.’ While it has been long suspected that men who come from families with plenty of males have higher odds of fathering boys, and that for men with many sisters, it is vice versa, there has never been any stong scientific explanation as to why. In a study published in the journal Evolutionary Biology, the researcher, Corry Gellatly, examined the histories of more than 900 American and European families, dating back to 1600, involving more than half a million people. A child’s sex is always determined by the father. While women produce eggs that carry an X chromosome, male sperm cast the deciding chromosome — either an X or a Y. Mr Gellatly found evidence that men carry a gene that determines the percentage of X and Y chromosomes in their sperm. One version of this gene produces mostly X chromosomes, another mostly Y, and a third yields equal numbers of both. But even carrying a gene that predisposes men to more sons or daughters is no guarantee of the sex of a baby — in the same way that rolling a rigged die with a six on four of its faces is no guarantee of landing a six. Desperate to improve their chances of having a girl, Hannah came across the Shettles Method, developed by an American doctor in the Sixties, which claims the timing of conception can help determine the baby’s sex. This is based on evidence that male sperm (Y chromosome) are faster, weaker and have a shorter lifespan than female sperm (X chromosome), which are slower but survive for longer. This means that having sex before ovulation, rather than during, should increase the likelihood of conceiving a girl, as only the female sperm will survive long enough to penetrate the egg. Hannah used ovulation kits to work out when she was ovulating. Love-making was allowed only early on in Hannah’s cycle. As soon as the kit showed she was approaching ovulation, intercourse was banned for the rest of the month. Hannah admits it was far from romantic, but says she wanted to give it their best shot. Surrounded by boys! Myla, who was born in October, pictured with her brothers Ben, Zac and Mason . Hannah fell pregnant straight away but was convinced the technique hadn’t worked and that she was expecting another boy. The couple even sorted out all Mason’s clothes into age order ready for when the new baby was born. ‘I spent £65 on a gorgeous cot mobile with blue and green cars and lorries, and we’d bought a blue buggy and a blue car seat.’ As a midwife, Hannah has delivered more than 200 babies and admitted to feeling pangs of envy every time it was a girl. She says: ‘I adore the boys, but I’d write up my notes, while listening to the new mum bonding with her daughter, and be filled with longing, wishing it could be me one day — yet truly believing it never would be.’ Hannah has always been extremely close to her own mum, Tracey Hayden, and craved the same kind of relationship with a daughter of her own one day. Then, at the 20-week scan, they received the astonishing news that they were expecting a girl. ‘I was in a state of disbelief,’ says Hannah. ‘I kept asking the sonographer if she was sure. ‘Mark was so emotional he was in tears, crying that it was a gift from his Dad — who, sadly, passed away just before I fell pregnant. He’d told us he’d love a granddaughter.’ Despite the sonographer’s assurances, Hannah spent the rest of the pregnancy struggling to accept that her desire for a daughter really was about to come true. ‘I must have had about 16 scans,’ she says. ‘Whenever I’d finish a night shift, I’d beg one of the doctors to give me another one, just to make sure,’ she says. But it was only when her baby was finally placed on her chest following an emergency Caesarean at 39 weeks, that she truly believed it. ‘The first thing I asked was: “Is it definitely a girl?”’ And while it’s often hard to tell the sex of young babies once they’re dressed, there has never been any mistaking Myla’s gender. The little girl has, Hannah admits, a wardrobe to rival a Disney princess, with dozens of flowery dresses, patterened tights, butterfly hairclips, frilly tutus and pink fluffy slippers. Myla never leaves the house without wearing a headband — pink, of course — and Hannah has traded in Mason’s blue buggy and car seat for pink ones. The nursery glistens with every shade of pink, from the marshmallow rug to the candyfloss chest of drawers and changing table. A powder-pink gingham bumper surrounds the cot, teamed with a pink blanket with embroidered hearts. The cars and lorries mobile has been replaced by one with pink elephants and giraffes. There’s even a canvas, surrounded by fairy lights, with Myla’s name which lights up in pink — a gift from Hannah’s sister, 23-year-old Ellie. She's a genius! When Mark, 33, met Hannah, 26, he told her their chances of having a daughter were 'remote' as his family had produced boys for five generations . Of course, there is still an abundance of cars, tractors, Thomas the Tank Engines, Lightning McQueen and golf equipment around the house. Hannah loves her boys as much as she loves her daughter, but she can’t resist the urge to splash out on pretty things, and has sold bundles of Mason’s outgrown clothes on eBay to fund her newfound love of all things pink. She says: ‘I know it’s over-the-top, but I can’t resist.’ Mark is equally besotted. ‘He thinks I’m a genius for producing a daughter,’ says Hannah. With three big brothers to look after her, Myla is never going to be short of protectors. Hannah says they are all very protective, but especially Mason, who tells people who pick up his precious sister to put her back immediately. Hannah’s biggest worry now is that her daughter will turn out to be a tomboy. Mark teases her, saying she’s bound to end up a professional golfer, but Hannah already has plans to sign her up to ballet classes on her second birthday. ‘I really enjoyed dancing when I was a child, and I’d love for Myla to do the same,’ she says. Hannah is also looking forward to the days when Mark and the boys go off to play 18 holes, and she is able to enjoy shopping trips with her daughter. One thing she’s certain of, though, is that her family is complete. ‘If I’d had another boy, I might have had another shot at a girl. But now that I’ve got one of each, I’ve got everything I’ve ever wanted.’ Hannah will never know if her ovulation kits did the trick. But whether by luck, or science, the 200-year Lawrie family boy spell has finally been broken.","Myla Lawrie was the first girl to be born in her family since 1809 .

"These lovable little owls can't seem to get enough of each other after they were seen snuggling up together on a tree branch.

After a few weeks, the owlets became used to his presence, and were soon so unafraid of him that they allowed him to come close enough to take these images. Mr Kogan said: 'There were seven fledglings all together but these two seemed never seemed to leave each other's side.

"Smiling for the camera in relief, these are the hikers who were rescued in a 10 hour operation after becoming stranded 9,000 feet up a Californian mountain. The group from a UCLA hiking club set off on a hike up the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles but conditions quickly turned treacherous, with snow and ice. And while five members of the group managed to find their way out of the forest, the remaining eight became lost with some starting to experience hypothermia. The rescued students from the UCLA hiking club stop and pose for a selfie with their rescuers after being lowered to safety when they became stranded on a mountain . Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue teams were called with rescuers forced to look for the group in drifts, which caused the snow to become knee-deep. But 10 hours after going missing, the group were finally found near Throop Peak by the Montrose Search and Rescue Team from Crescenta Valley Station. The students were then lowered to safety down the icy slopes with harnesses and ropes to prevent them from falling. Luckily, none of the group needed to have medical treatment but they were so elated to see their rescuers, they all stopped and posed for a selfie. Reserve Deputy Mike Leum told ABC News: 'I've been doing this 20 years as a volunteer and I never seen anybody so happy to see us. ' The students were then lowered to safety down the icy slopes of the San Gabriel mountains, pictured, with harnesses and ropes to prevent them from falling . The treacherous conditions which caused the hikers to become lost were caused by the same storm system which wreaked havoc on northern California in recent days. The storm dropped 10 to 15 inches of snow at higher elevations of the Northern Sierra, according to the National Weather Service. Meanwhile a fresh storm yesterday is thought to have brought as much as another 14 inches of snow. Snow is more important than rain because snowpack supplies about a third of the water needed by residents, agriculture and industry. The treacherous conditions which caused the hikers to become lost in the mountains near Los Angeles, pictured, were caused by the same storm system which wreaked havoc on northern California in recent days . Meanwhile strong winds fanned a wildfire that pushed across a swathe of land at the edge of the Sierra Nevada, which destroyed 40 homes and filling the sky with a hellish combination of smoke and fire. Around 250 people were forced to evacuate in the small California towns of Swall Meadows and Paradise as flames engulfed vegetation across 11 square miles, officials say. Authorities say the wildfire began on Friday near a highway that runs east of the Sierra Nevada before winds caused the blaze to spread.","A UCLA hiking group set off up the San Gabriel Mountains in Los Angeles .

"A teenage drug dealer was caught by police after ordering 500 Ecstasy tablets online under his own name before having them delivered to the home he shares with his parents. Harry Doherty, 19, bought the haul of tablets online from a supplier in the Netherlands with the intention of selling them around clubs in Manchester. But he was rumbled when he requested for the package to be addressed to himself at his real address. Drug dealer Harry Doherty, 19 (left and right) requested for 500 Ecstasy tablets to be delivered under his real name to the home he shares with parents in Levenshulme, Manchester . When police later raided Doherty's bedroom and asked if he had any drugs in his possession, he even told them that he had ordered drugs online, but it had not yet arrived. Doherty, now 20, was jailed for two-and-a-half years at Manchester Crown Court after admitting importing Class A drugs, possession with intent to supply and possession of cannabis. The court heard how Doherty's crime had been one of 'crass stupidity' but that drug dealing was a 'serious business'. Sentencing, Recorder Robert Crawford said: 'This is crass stupidity but a serious business and you understand that. The court heard Doherty (pictured) had committed an act of 'crass stupidity' 'I think this is a tragedy. A 20-year-old lad like you who has never been in trouble before, now facing serious charges. You have been stupid and naïve.' The court heard how the parcel had been quickly intercepted by customs officials at Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre in Berkshire. They had opened the container after being  suspicious of the package's contents. When they checked the destination, they found it was addressed to Doherty's parents' home in Levenshulme, Manchester. Officers later asked Doherty if there were any drugs in the house, to which he replied: 'Yes, I ordered a parcel off the internet but it hasn't arrived.' But they went on to find almost 4g of MDMA concealed in a Kinder Egg, as well as 12 further packages of the drug at 90 per cent purity, with a street value of £932. They also retrieved £1,140 in cash, scales and a small amount of cannabis. The court heard Doherty, who works as a chef at a café, thought of himself as being part of the Manchester rave scene. He took Ecstasy himself but had started drug dealing purely to make money, the court was told. Prosecuting, Simone Flynn said: 'On June 21 2013 Her Majesty's Customs officials intercepted a package at Heathrow Distribution Centre in Berkshire and when they opened it they found a container with 500 tablets. 'The package was addressed to this defendant, Harry Doherty, at his home address in Levenshulme. GMP were contacted and informed and following communication a drugs warrant was executed at the home address. The young chef even told police who raided his home (pictured) that he had ordered a pile of drugs from the internet but that they had not yet arrived . 'Officers attended on July 9, when they arrested the defendant and asked whether drugs were in the house his response was ""yeah, I ordered a parcel off the internet but it hasn't arrived"". 'That's because the police had intercepted it.' She added: 'On interrogation of one phone there were numerous incriminating drug dealing messages. The defendant played a significant role and was clearly motivated financially by way of the texts.' In mitigation, defence counsel Anthony O'Donnell said: 'He was involved in that scene, the rave scene, and was taking ecstasy himself. 'As regards to being sophisticated, you only have to look at the fact his name and address were on the envelope. The word ""naivety"" springs to mind.' At Manchester Crown Court (pictured), the defendant was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution after admitting importing Class A drugs and possession with intent to supply . He added: 'In chatting with him it is simply unbelievable that he is here. He is a very intelligent young man who has worked since he was 14. He has never brought any trouble to his parents' door.' Doherty, dressed smartly in a shirt and blazer, puffed out his cheeks as the judge Mr Crawford said he had no option but to send him to a young offenders' institution. He said: 'There are many things that can be said constructively in your favour and I will give you a great deal of credit. This sentence is as short as it possibly can be in light of my public duty. I have been extremely lenient. 'My hands are tied in a case like this. You can't import ecstasy on this scale and not be dealt with by a custodial sentence.'","Chef Harry Doherty, 19, bought the haul to sell around clubs in Manchester .

"A collection of rare stamps which have been collecting dust in an attic for more than 100 years are now set to fetch at least a quarter of a million pounds at auction after being discovered. The 35 Chinese stamps, which were originally bought by an English missionary in Shanghai in 1882, were recently uncovered in an old cigar box in the attic of a property in the Cotswolds. They were sent to an auction in Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire, where they were given an estimated value of between £800 and £1,000. However, they were snapped up for an astonishing £79,000 by international stamp dealer Allan Grant, who received a tip-off that the stamps could be worth a fortune. He now plans to sell them overseas for a whopping £250,000. The 35 rare Chinese stamps, which were originally bought by an English missionary in Shanghai in 1882, were recently discovered in an old cigar box in the attic of a property in the Cotswolds and sold at auction . Winning bidder Allan Grant snapped up the stamps, which had an original estimated value of up to £1000. Mr Grant (pictured) paid £79,000 for the stamps after being tipped-off and now wants to sell them for £250,000 . Three other bidders for Lot 94 - 'A Cigar Box of Early Chinese Stamps' – knew the uncut stamps were valuable, and bidding rose rapidly in thousands, to the amazement of locals at the auction, where most items fetch under £100. Mr Grant, owner of philatelic firm Rushstamps, which is based in Lyndhurst in Hampshire's New Forest National Park, now plans to sell the rare stamps in Hong Kong and believes they will fetch at least £250,000. The lot is particularly valuable because within the collection is an uncut sheet of nineteen ultra-rare 'candarin' stamps, which had been kept by the English missionary for 'day to day postage use'. The rather insignificant-looking unused yellow stamps, printed on very thin paper, were bought in Shanghai in 1882 and feature a dragon design. They are known in the stamp world as '5 candarin ochres'. Auctioneer Nicholas Granger, owner of British Bespoke Auctions, said the original owner of the Chinese stamps wishes to remain anonymous but says the seller was 'stunned but delighted' by the huge amount he received for them. The rather insignificant-looking unused yellow stamps (pictured), printed on very thin paper, were bought in Shanghai in 1882 and feature a dragon design. They are known in the stamp world as '5 candarin ochres' The stamp collection was discovered in an old cigar box (pictured) in the attic of a property in the Cotswolds. They were brought back to the UK by an English missionary and have been undiscovered for over 100 years . Mr Granger, a retired Saville Row tailor, said: 'All I could glean about the history of these stamps was that they were purchased by an English missionary who brought them back to England on his retirement over a century ago.' The find is being described by experts as 'incredible and unparalleled'. Winning bidder Mr Grant said the demand for early Chinese stamps now is 'unprecedented'. He added: 'Finding unused examples in such superb condition, still on a sheet, is incredibly rare. 'Eventually it was between myself and one other bidder. 'With the buyer's premium added, the total I paid was £79,000. 'This is a most incredible find and will cause huge excitement amongst philatelists. 'There has never been anything like this.' Winning bidder Allan Grant (left) has now gone into partnership with Larry Gibson (right), co-chairman of U.S.-based Daniel Kelleher Auctions, to sell the stamp collection in Hong Kong where it should fetch £250,000 . American stamp dealer Larry Gibson, co-chairman of Connecticut-based Daniel Kelleher Auctions, flew to England today to collect the stamp sheet from Mr Grant. The pair are going into partnership to sell the stamps in Hong Kong, because they believe the collection will fetch a far higher sum overseas. Mr Gibson said: 'I've had a long career specialising in Chinese stamps. And this is by far the biggest and most unparalleled find of my life. 'It is absolutely amazing. I have never known anything like it. I think bidding will easily be in excess of £250,000. 'They will create a sensation in China, with millionaires vying with each other to buy their culture back. They will be desperate to get these marvellous stamps.' Before the Hong Kong auction, the stamp sheet will briefly return to the UK, to be exhibited at the British Design Centre in London from May 13 to 16.","Collection of rare Chinese stamps found hidden away in attic in Cotswolds .

"A rare autographed photo of Shoeless Joe Jackson - the Holy Grail of baseball signatures - could fetch more than $100,000 at an upcoming auction. Jackson, who was tossed out of baseball for throwing the 1919 World Series and remembered in the movie Field of Dreams, was illiterate and rarely signed anything but paychecks and legal documents, making his autographs among the rarest in sports. How many Jackson signatures are in existence isn't clear, but most experts agree that it's probably fewer than 100. A rare autographed photo of Shoeless Joe Jackson - the Holy Grail of baseball signatures - could fetch more than $100,000 at an upcoming auction. Jackson, who was illiterate, rarely signed anything but paychecks and legal documents . Photo holder Sharon Bowen thought her late husband was a bit crazy for buying a scrapbook filled photos of Cleveland baseball players from the 1900s, including Jackson (left), Christy Mathewson (center), and Nap Lajoie (right). After her husband died in April, she decided it was time for someone else to enjoy the pictures . Photo holder Sharon Bowen, of Cleveland, Ohio, thought her late husband was a bit crazy for buying a scrapbook filled with black and white photos of Cleveland ballplayers from the early 1900s — but not anymore. It turns out that book holds what may be the only autographed photo of the famed outfielder. This is the first signed photo authenticated by autograph experts, according to Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, which is handling the sale of the century-old photograph this month. ‘If I were a betting man, I'd say the chances of another one surfacing would be highly unlikely,’ said Joe Orlando, president of Professional Sports Authenticator, which validated the signature and photo. Jackson, an outfielder for Cleveland, was tossed out of baseball for throwing the 1919 World Series and remembered in the movie Field of Dreams. His autograph is one of the rarest in baseball . Bowen's husband, Bill, first saw the scrapbook about ten years ago. It was stored in a barn near Cleveland and belonged to a couple whose family was friends with Frank W. Smith, a photographer with The Plain Dealer newspaper. He shot the photo of Jackson along with those of Hall of Famers Christy Mathewson and Napoleon Lajoie during spring training in 1911. The family offered to sell the scrapbook five years ago to Bowen's husband because they knew how much he treasured the 60 photos. The price tag: $15,000. ‘I told him “absolutely not,""’ Bowen said. ‘Luckily for me, I lost that argument.’ Her husband kept the book in a trunk, looking at it almost every day and showing it off to friends. As a collector all his life, he appreciated its history and connection to his hometown. But not knowing the book's sky-high value, they never locked it up or worried about keeping it out of sight. ‘It wasn't an investment,’ Bowen said. Her husband died at age 67 last April, and the family decided someone else should enjoy the photos. The signed photos of Jackson and other members of the Cleveland Naps, the team that later became the Indians, will be sold in New York City on February 21. The photo of Jackson — taken the year he became the only rookie to hit over .400 — had an online bid of $42,000 as of last week. A baseball bearing Jackson's shaky signature brought $78,000 in 2011. Even a scrap of paper with his autograph sold for $23,100 nearly 25 years ago. The experts at Heritage Auctions were skeptical when the Bowen family contacted them. ‘We get calls and emails on a daily basis about stuff that turns out to be reproductions or they're not authentic,’ said Chris Ivy, the company's director of sports auctions. That changed quickly once they saw the images. They sent the photos to Professional Sports Authenticator whose sports memorabilia experts looked at them from all angles. The 1911 photo of Jackson, being held by Chris Ivy, director of sports auctions at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, was taken the year he became the only rookie to hit over .400 . Bowen said her husband Bill originally bought the scrapbook for $15,000,  but she recently discovered the 60 photographs could be worth thousands more . ‘Our job is to be the skeptic, especially if it is too good to be true,’ said Orlando. They first set out to determine that the photographs were originals and from the early 1900s, and they looked at the story behind the scrapbook and its origins. And they verified the autographs — not an easy task when it comes to Jackson's childlike signature. It's known that Jackson more or less signed his name by mimicking a pattern that his wife had made. She often signed his name, too. The experts at PSA looked at the pen pressure and the spacing of the Jackson signature while comparing it to other examples. ‘The stars aligned,’ Orlando said. Mike Nola, official historian for the Shoeless Joe Jackson Society and a board member of the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum in Greenville, South Carolina, said he can't remember seeing another signed photo of Jackson. There are more than four dozen legitimate Jackson signatures that he knows of, including several bats and at least a dozen baseballs, he said. ‘That's still pretty rare, especially by today's standards when guys are signing everything,’ Nola said.","Cleveland baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson was illiterate and rarely signed anything but paychecks and legal documents .

"Australians sit well on the worldwide dating scene, with the accent alone being ranked as the fourth most attractive on the planet. And just after the city of love Paris, Melbourne in Victoria has the best dating scene, according to respondents to Time Out’s Global Dating Survey. The study also concluded that Sydney has the happiest singletons, with 31 per cent ‘proudly single’ while the opposite was true in New York, where 45 per cent of respondents declared themselves ‘sad to be single’. Australians have been ranked as having the fourth best accent in the world, according to a new survey . Meantime French has lost its place as the language of love – to English. A British accent was chosen as the most attractive by 26.7 per cent of people answering a global survey of 11,000 people in 24 cities - followed by American, Irish and Australian accents. French was chosen as the sexiest accent by just 7.7 per cent of respondents to the survey, coming in at fifth place. Sydney has the happiest singletons it was revealed . Melbourne was ranked as having the second best dating scene, just after Paris . And Parisians answering the survey were among the respondents most likely to fall for someone with a British accent, along with those from New York and Sydney. But Gallic aficionados could still take some cheer from the survey. Paris was ranked as the city with the best dating scene, followed by Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Chicago – with London coming in at a lowly sixth. Meanwhile, 53 per cent of people said they kissed on the first date and one in ten believe sex on a first date is acceptable. On average, couples had 3.53 dates before having sex - but still considered it acceptable to see other people until reaching six dates. Paris, featuring the love locks of the Pont des Arts (pictured), had the best dating scene . Technology is also important for modern-day lovers, with 58 per cent admitting to checking a prospective date's credentials on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Answers to a question about the best and worst aspects of the local dating scene threw up some surprising results. One was how the presence of 'infinitely more men than women due to an overabundance of military and security personnel' in Kabul made it easy for women to find a potential suitor. But a respondent from Bogota, Colombia, complained: 'The guys are ugly and girls very beautiful. It's difficult'.","British accent triumphed in poll of 11,000 people's favourite in English .

"David Osborne said consent must be considered in rape cases even if given when 'blind drunk' A senior barrister has caused outrage after saying that men should be cleared of rape if a female victim claimed to be too drunk to consent to sex. In a blog entitled She Was Gagging For It, David Osborne, 71, condemned new Crown Prosecution Service guidelines which put the onus on men to seek explicit consent from drunken partners. The married father-of-four made a point of referring to women in rape cases as ‘complainants’ rather than victims, and said the guidelines could result in ‘everything possible in the trial process’ being ‘bent towards the conviction of the accused’. Mr Osborne wrote: ‘Consent is consent, blind drunk or otherwise, and regret after the event cannot make it rape. I have a simple solution. ‘If the complainant (I do not refer to her as the victim) was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, when she was “raped”, this provides the accused with a complete defence. End of story and a victory for fairness, moderation and common sense!’ ‘My considerable experience tells me that there are basically two defences to an allegation of rape: either “it wasn’t me gov”, or “she was gagging for it”.’ The blog has prompted a furious response from victims’ organisations and rape victims. His remarks were also condemned as ‘simply wrong’ by the leading barrister in the area where Mr Osborne operates. In media interviews over the weekend Mr Osborne said rape statistics would fall if women who ‘trollop around with their t*ts out’ stopped getting ‘legless’ and ‘covered up’. He claimed women who dress provocatively ‘send out certain signals’ and give ‘lads the opportunity to think, “She looks like a goer”.’ Mr Osborne made the controversial comments in a blog post titled 'She was gagging for it' on his website . Yesterday Mr Osborne told the Daily Mail he believed the ‘Government and prosecution service are going too far the other way’. Speaking at the large bungalow he shares with wife Sally, 63, in Combe Florey, Somerset, he added: ‘It does happen where the girl says she’s up for it – she wants a quickie – and then it is unpleasant and torrid and terrible. ‘There are no violins playing, it’s round the back of the community centre. The next morning she wakes up and feels ashamed. It’s very easy for her to convince herself that she did not actually consent.’ Last month, the CPS announced that new guidance on rape cases and the issue of consent would be issued to police forces. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said: ‘Consent to sexual activity is not a grey area – in law it is clearly defined and must be given fully and freely. ‘We want police and prosecutors to make sure they ask in every case where consent is the issue – how did the suspect know the complainant was saying yes and doing so freely and knowingly?’ But Mr Osborne – nicknamed the Barrister Bard after once delivering his final speech to a trial jury entirely in verse – said: ‘My experience says that the jury gives the evidence the attention it requires and if they are sure then they convict. We don’t need to manipulate the system for rape witnesses.’ Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said sexual consent was not a 'grey area' Mr Osborne worked as a criminal defence barrister for almost 40 years and was last involved in a rape trial three years ago. He is a member of the Western Circuit of barristers and now concentrates on civil law. His blog has been roundly condemned. Sarah Green, director of End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘I find it hard to believe this is not a sick joke. He is suggesting the opposite of the law.’ Louise Pennington, of campaign group Ending Victimisation, said: ‘He is saying that men are incapable of controlling their own urges when they see a woman in a short skirt.’ Andrew Langdon QC, leader of the Western Circuit, said: ‘I have spoken to David Osborne and told him that I consider his blog to be offensive. ‘Most of what he says is simply wrong. The views he articulates are not remotely representative of barristers who prosecute and defend these cases in practice.’ One victim, a 45-year-old female jogger who was abducted and repeatedly raped at knife-point by a career criminal out on licence from prison, said: ‘Rape is rape, when a woman or a man does not give consent for sex to occur despite the fact that drugs or alcohol have been consumed. ‘If a man or woman takes advantage of the opposite sex in this reduced state of awareness, it is a predatory action.’ Mr Osborne’s blog is written under the masthead ‘witty, incisive comment on the law today’. Last night he planned to republish an edited version of the controversial blog entry – after being warned by the Circuit that the original piece may be considered to bring the profession into disrepute if it remained online. A Bar Standards Board spokesman declined to comment.","Men should be cleared if rape victim is too drunk to consent, says barrister .

"From teas to curries, the Indian spice turmeric is back in vogue, popping up in smoothies, juices and fruit crumble. While health fads come and go, using herbs and spices for medicinal reasons is one trend with staying power. Here are some of the most popular herbs and spices and how they could improve your wellbeing: . TURMERIC FOR JOINTS . Studies have suggested that turmeric can ease joint pain and improve the memory of Alzheimer’s patients . Unlike many traditional remedies, turmeric has some medical muscle behind it. The main benefit comes from curcumin (a natural substance that also provides the bright orange colour), which contains powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. Some studies suggest turmeric alleviates joint pain, improves the memory of Alzheimer’s patients by helping to repair brain stem cells, delays diabetes, kills cancer cells and shrinks tumours. It can even help prevent heart attacks in those who have undergone a bypass by reducing inflammation. SAGE FOR MEMORY . Some research has concluded that sage can improve memory skills . Old wives’ tales have long proclaimed sage — the star ingredient in most stuffings — to be good for your memory. New research has shown they were right. The herb is thought to protect the chemical messengers that carry information in the brain and are essential to memory. Researchers in the Medicinal Plant Research Centre at the universities of Newcastle and Northumbria have completed the first clinical trials of this herb and found those taking sage oil capsules performed better in memory tests. GINGER FOR NAUSEA . Ginger can aid digestion and ease motion and morning sickness . Part of the family that includes turmeric and cardamom, ginger heats the body from the inside and encourages sweating, which is why it helps fight colds and flu. It aids digestion and alleviates nausea (including motion sickness, morning sickness and hyperemesis gravidarium — the most extreme form of morning sickness that affected the Duchess of Cambridge). It also helps expel excess gas from the digestive system, reducing bloating. Some sufferers of osteo-arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis say that when taken regularly, ginger can reduce joint pain and discomfort. Researchers believe this is due to its potent active anti-inflammatories. CINNAMON FOR BLOOD SUGAR . Cinnamon has been proven to reduce our body’s demand for sweet things by regulating blood sugar levels . Trying to give up sugar, but suffering with sweet cravings? Reach for powdered tree bark — or cinnamon — which has been proven to reduce our body’s demand for sweet things by regulating blood sugar levels. Cinnamon has been shown to lower blood lipid levels including LDL cholesterol (the unhealthy type) and fat in the blood. Add it to cereal, porridge, coffee and yoghurt or use as a marinade for meat. CAYENNE FOR GOOD DIGESTION . Cayenne can improve circulation and also help lower moderately high blood pressure . Anyone who has eaten a curry will be familiar with the punch of cayenne pepper — and how it affects digestion. Health advocates say it improves sluggish gut movements and boosts metabolism, which explains why it’s popular with celebrities on the lemon juice and cayenne diet. It’s lauded for improving circulation and has been shown to help lower moderately high blood pressure, by dilating blood vessels. If spicy food isn’t to your taste, you can buy capsules that release capsaicin (the plant’s active compound) when it gets to your digestive system, meaning it bypasses your tastebuds. MUSTARD FOR ASTHMA . Mustard seeds can help to alleviate the symptoms of asthma . The mustard plant — a variant of the brassica family — has been used for medicinal reasons since ancient times. Brassicas contain naturally occurring compounds called glucosinolates, chemicals that have been proven to slow down the growth of cancer cells, particularly those in the lung, gut and colon. Mustard seeds are rich in selenium and magnesium, which help to alleviate the symptoms of asthma. NUTMEG FOR BRAIN POWER . Nutmeg should be used sparingly as it can have hallucinogenic effects if consumed to excess . This fragrant nut packs a punch in the health stakes. While it’s been recommended for years as a natural sleep aid (grate a touch into a cup of warm milk if you’re looking for a natural sedative), nutmeg is also thought to help keep the brain sharp and guard against denegerative conditions such as dementia, thanks to an active compound contained within it called myristicin. Nutmeg is a good source of hard-to-get trace minerals such as copper, potassium, calcium, manganese, iron, zinc and magnesium. Use nutmeg sparingly, as it can have hallucinogenic effects if consumed to excess. Don’t eat more than a quarter of a teaspoon in one go.","Using herbs and spices for medicinal reasons is a longstanding trend .

"A Chinese girl with a rare medical problem has the appearance of a child - despite being 19-years-old. Zeng Yushan was born in June 1994 in the township of Huzhu in Fushun County in south-western China's Sichuan Province. At seven years old, she stopped growing and was diagnosed with a tumour on her pituitary gland, which caused a deficiency in growth hormones. Zeng Yushan, 19 (left), has the appearance of a seven-year-old as she stopped growing at this age due to a rare tumour on her pituitary gland. This gland releases growth and puberty hormones . Instead of going to school, Zeng was used as a child beggar due to her young appearance. After her father died in 2013, leaving her alone, she was taken in by a couple who have taken her to the doctor. They hope to take her to a specialist soon to see if anything can be done about her condition . The pituitary gland is found behind the bridge of the nose and below the base of the brain, and is about the size of a pea. It releases  hormones  growth  and puberty hormones, among others, directly into the blood stream. Tumours on the pituitary gland - though rare - can stop people growing and developing normally, said Ashley Grossman, professor of endocrinology at Oxford University. He told MailOnline: 'If you've got a pituitary tumour, it can stop growth hormones being released. 'You end up like a Tom Thumb person that looks small but is perfectly formed. 'Without treatment this woman won't grow at all, but she would age normally. 'Some say such children may even live longer than expected but that is uncertain. 'But in China, treatment for pituitary problems is not routinely available unless you pay for it. 'Pituitary patients often don't get the help they need.' This was the case for Zeng's parents, who couldn't afford to pay for treatment. They argued bitterly about the disease before finally divorcing, leaving Zeng with her father Yul Wei, 43. Ashley Grossman, professor of endocrinology at Oxford University, said of Zeng's condition: ‘If you’ve got a pituitary tumour, it can stop growth hormones being released. ‘You end up a tomb thumb person, that looks small but is perfectly formed. ‘Without treatment this woman won’t grow at all. This woman would age normally, some say such children may even live longer than expected but that is uncertain. The pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland found found behind the bridge of the nose and below the base of the brain . ‘In China treatment for pituitary problems is not routinely available unless you pay for it. 'Pituitary patients often don’t get the help they need. ‘This wouldn’t happen in the West, as paediatricians would be vigilant towards it. Pituitary tumour in childhood are very uncommon. One in 1000 adults has one and they are less common in children, he said. Some have a gene defect or a faulty gene. He added: ‘Now we have artificial growth hormones, that can be injected once a day, to treat this condition. ‘If you lose growth hormones you lose other hormones and you don’t ever go through puberty so you can have side effects like losing hair. But shortly after the divorce, her father was also diagnosed as being seriously ill. Unable to pay any of their bills, the pair ended up on the streets begging, travelling from their home  to the cities of Zigong, Chengdu and Guiyang. Instead of going to school, Zeng was used as a child beggar due to her young appearance. In 2013, Zeng's father died from gastric cancer, leaving her alone. After she was spotted begging, a warm-hearted couple who had two grown-up daughters of their own, agreed to take her in. Guo Liu, 50, said that when they first saw her, he and his wife were unsure if she was a boy or girl because she had no hair, and had suffered horrific physical problems because of her medical condition. She is now getting regular medical care and although she is 20, still looks as if she is seven or eight-years-old and has the mental ability of a child aged around five or six. Mr Gui said: 'We plan to take her after the Spring Festival to a doctor in the capital Beijing who might be able to help her. 'For the moment she is okay with us, but we want to try and get into a position where she might be able to do something for herself when we are no longer able to look after her.' Zeng  has made it clear she is hugely attached to her new parents. Her biggest wish is to be able to go to school, even though no schools at the moment will take her because of her real age rather than her apparent age. Commenting on the photographs and the story, Professor Grossman told MailOnline: 'This wouldn't happen in the West, as paediatricians would be vigilant towards it. 'Pituitary tumours in childhood are very uncommon. One in 1,000 adults has one and they are less common in children. 'Some have a gene defect or a faulty gene. 'We used to treat people with this condition with pituitaries from cadavers and dead people, but that led to complications. 'But luckily now we have artificial growth hormones, that can be injected once a day. 'If you lose growth hormones you lose other hormones and you don't ever go through puberty, so you can have side effects like losing hair. He added that any treatment administered now to help her grow may not be successful. He said: 'Whether anything can be done for her now is unclear. It depends on her bone age. 'I assume she didn't go through puberty so she didn't make sex hormones. 'In that case her bones will have fused. 'If the bones have an age of 8 or 9, she could respond to treatment, if she has bones that have an age of 14, she probably won't grow anymore. 'It would certainly be worth trying. 'She'll have to be investigated for all the other hormones the pituitary gland makes too.' Zeng Yushan was born in June 1994 (her identity card is pictured) but looks like a young child. 'In China, treatment for pituitary problems is not routinely available unless you pay for it. Pituitary patients often don't get the help they need,' said Ashley Grossman, professor of endocrinology at the University of Oxford .","Zeng Yushan, 19, stopped growing at the age of 7 due to a pituitary tumour .

"President Obama made an appearance at the Grammys to deliver a plea for artists to inspire others to recognize and speak up against sexual violence. 'It's on us, all of us, to create a culture where violence isn't tolerated,' Obama said. 'Where survivors are supported and where all our young people - men and women - can go as far as their talents and their dreams will take them.' The president was plugging a campaign launched last fall by the White House called 'It's On Us,' urging Americans to take incidents of sexual assault on college campuses seriously. Scroll down for video . PSA: President Obama made an appearance at the Grammys to deliver a plea for artists to inspire others to recognize and speak up against sexual violence . Survivor: Brooke Axtell, a survivor of domestic violence, spoke after President Obama as well as performing at the show . 'Right now, nearly one in five women in America has been the victim of rape or attempted rape,' Obama said. 'And more than one in four women has experienced some form of domestic violence.' A survey on sexual violence by the Centers for Disease Control released last year found that 19 percent of female respondents had experienced rape or attempted rape in their lives. The same poll found nearly 2 percent of male respondents had been a victim of rape or attempted rape. The CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey from 2010 found that 30 percent of women had been slapped, shoved or pushed by a partner in her lifetime. The survey also found that 24 percent had experienced severe physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner. Obama urged viewers to 'take the pledge,' a promise to keep men and women safe from sexual assault and not to be a bystander, according to the campaign's website. The president was followed by Brooke Axtell, who urged those victimized by domestic violence to seek help. The 'It's On Us' campaign was launched in September, framing sexual violence as an act that destroys not only the victim's piece of mind, but their ability to pursue a meaningful education. 'For anybody whose once-normal, everyday life was suddenly shattered by an act of sexual violence, the trauma, the terror can shadow you long after one horrible attack,' the president said. The campaign launch was followed up with ads calling for more people to speak up against sexual assault, including one with actors such as Daniel Craig and Benicio Del Toro.","Obama spoke during a video message at the Grammys .

"A 25-year-old man has been charged with assault and intent to rob following the attack on 4ft 6in disabled pensioner Alan Barnes. Richard Gatiss, 25, was arrested early this morning and he will appear at Gateshead Magistrates' Court tomorrow. Frail Mr Barnes, 67, was pushing his bin outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, earlier this month when he was knocked to the ground, breaking his collar bone as he landed. The committed Christian, who weighs six stone, said at the time: 'Someone just jumped on me. It all happened in a very short time. I would like to see him caught because he might do it again.' Scroll down for video . Katie Cutler set up a fund to help disabled pensioner Alan Barnes after he was attacked in the street . The fund exceeded all expectation and has now been stopped at the request of Mr Barnes and his family after it topped more than £329,526 . Following the assault 21-year-old beautician Katie Cutler set up an online fund which generated £330,135 for Mr Barnes and the pair have since become friends. The disabled pensioner, who  has suffered from sight and growth problems since birth, said he was overwhelmed by the response from well-wishers across the globe. 'I am totally overwhelmed and incredibly grateful to Katie for what she has done for me,' he said. 'The youth of today don't always get portrayed in a positive light, but I won't ever forget what this young woman has done for me. This is the best thing that has ever happened to me. 'I always knew there were good people in the world, and this has confirmed it.' The donations mean he can buy a house of his own for the first time and not count the pennies to get through the week. Alan, pictured in 1967, can't read books, can barely make out newspaper headlines and struggles with TV . More than 24,748 well-wishers donated at an average of just over £13 each, but the appeal has now been halted. Ms Cutler wrote on the Alan Barnes Fund page last week saying: 'Good morning, after speaking with Alan & his family, they have asked me to stop any further donations to his fund. 'He is very grateful for all your love, support & donations. We will be having a little presentation to hand him his cheque so i'll keep you all updated.

"Terror experts believe a Canadian woman dubbed 'Toronto Jane' could be a senior ISIS leader after she was tracked visiting all of the terror group's stronghold over the past three weeks. The mysterious jihadi, who is thought to have only left Canada in late-November, uses the Twitter name Lama Sharif al-Shammari, although counter-terror analysts refer to her as 'LA'. They have been able to follow her visiting ISIS' Syrian strongholds of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor in recent weeks, as well as the Iraqi city of Mosul, because she has left geocoding activated on her mobile phone, effectively tagging every Twitter message she posts with details of her location. Although hundreds of Western women have joined the terror group, the locations she has visited and the speed with which she moves around is unprecedented for a female ISIS jihadi and suggests she has quickly risen through the ranks of the terror group. Scroll down for video . Restricted: Although hundreds of Western women are known to have travelled to join ISIS, then the majority marry a fighter and settle into a life of cooking, cleaning and childbearing . The Florida-based Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium have been tracking al-Shammari since her arrival in the Middle East, using the geocodes she inadvertently attaches to every tweet to follow 'LA's' movements around the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under ISIS' control. The experts say they have never seen a female ISIS fighter moving so frequently and so rapidly, which suggests 'LA' is operating in a senior capacity, possibly in surveillance or spying role. Another option is that she is a messenger or courier for the terror group's leadership and is used to pass covert operational and security details between senior militants who are reluctant to risk having the information intercepted by internet or phone taps. Whatever the reality, it is clear that 'LA' - who is understood to be a Canadian national of Saudi descent - has made an unprecedented rise within ISIS since her arrival in Syria on December 8. Before her departure, terror experts had simply considered her a terror sympathiser thanks to her penchant for posting pro-ISIS messages on Twitter from Toronto. It is not known how she arrived in Syria, but she is thought to have left Canada sometime after November 23. Within days of her arrival she had changed her Twitter banner image to a shocking photograph of the severed head of a Syrian soldier, according to National Post. She also started posting brazen messages celebrating atrocities by the terror group. Some woman do join ISIS all-female police force known as the Al-Khansa Brigade. However these women still stay in the city in which they operate and do not travel around ISIS-held territory particularly frequently . Speaking of her unexplained rise, TRAC's Veryan Khan told Fox News: 'What is really surprising is that in a very short period of time, L.A. appears to have taken an extremely active role with ISIS.' 'We have never seen someone move about this rapidly...  What makes it even more unusual is that she is newly traveled to Islamic State. Having only been there since Dec. 8, it is odd that she would become so active so quickly once arriving,' he added. 'Based on 'LA's' locations and congruent battles in these locations, it is been assumed that she is conducting, at least on some level, surveillance for the Islamic State,' he went on to say. Although hundreds of Western women are known to have travelled to join ISIS in the Middle East, the vast majority of them marry and fighter and settle into a life of cooking, cleaning and childbearing in whatever city they are instructed to settle down. Most will leave their homes only rarely after marriage and even then usually only to go shopping, so they idea that one woman is buzzing around ISIS' territory suggests she is a high ranking militant. Another possibility is that she married a militant of such prominence that the usual expectation of settling her family in one place is unrealistic, as the home would immediately become a target for Western and Arab airstrikes. Tool: Although leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) does not have a Twitter account, several prominent ISIS commanders do maintain a social media presence. The internet has  proved an invaluable tool for ISIS . 'LA' has only used her Twitter account to send 131 Tweets and is understood to have just 145 followers, meaning her social media presence pales in comparison to that of other Western jihadis. All of her messages are in Arabic and their content suggests she is a member Al-Shamry tribe of Saudi Arabian origin. She often posts hate-filled messages about the Saudi royal family. Despite the seeming innocuity of her messages, TRAC have been able to locate the exact homes from which many of them have been sent - proving many of the messages were sent from properties known to be used by 'key players' within ISIS. It is not possible for geocoding to be faked, and many people are unaware that their phone is always giving off information about their whereabouts unless the function is manually turned off. Although ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi does not have a Twitter account himself, several prominent ISIS commanders do maintain a social media presence. The internet has so far proved an invaluable tool in ISIS' campaign of terror, with the militants using social media to recruit fighters and jihadi brides and to distribute propaganda, including the horrific murder videos of Western hostages.","Mysterious female jihadi tracked to home of several top ISIS commanders .

"Labour's policy on university tuition fees is in chaos after a plan by Ed Miliband to slash fees to £6,000 a year blew up in his face. The party leader had sought to curry favour with students by announcing that a Labour government would reduce the maximum annual cost of £9,000 by a third. But he refused yesterday to say if the plan would be in Labour’s next election manifesto and his higher education spokesman John Denham announced that a graduate tax was still only a ‘long-term aspiration’. Pledge: Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would slash university tuition fees by £3000 . Mr Miliband made the eye-catching . pledge at the start of a difficult party conference at which his . leadership is under scrutiny and polls suggest he is deeply unpopular. He was immediately accused of a cynical U-turn, reversing his previous . opposition to any tuition fees which cost more than the current £3,000 a . year. The new policy would be paid for by . forcing graduates earning more than  £65,000 a year to pay a higher rate . of interest on their student loans and by axing the Government’s . proposed corporation tax cut for the banks. The announcement was designed to . court Liberal Democrat voters and hard-up students who felt betrayed by . Nick Clegg’s decision to back a tripling of fees from £3,000 to £9,000 a . year. Meet and greet:  Miliband arrives at Liverpool Echo Arena for the annual Labour Party Conference . But the plan was summarily rejected . by the National Union of Students as of no benefit to the poor, since . only graduates earning more than £35,000 would benefit. In an interview with two Sunday . newspapers Mr Miliband said he wanted to make it easier for people to go . to university and not feel burdened by debt. 'Parents up and down the . country are incredibly worried about their sons and daughters,' he told . The Sunday Mirror. Under . the plans, graduates earning more than £65,000 a year would pay higher . interest on their student loans to help fund the lower cap. The rest . would be found by cancelling the government's cut in corporation tax for . banks. Mr Miliband told the conference he would tax bankers and top-earning graduates to fund the cut, which would cost the public purse £1billion . Mr Miliband . told The Observer that David Cameron and Nick Clegg risked destroying . the ambition of a generation by 'loading the costs of paying off the . deficit onto our young people'. Ditching . the government's proposed cut in corporation tax from 28 per cent to 23 . per cent was 'fair' because 'we shouldn't be cutting taxes for the . banks at the moment', he said. But . according to coalition sources the corporation tax cut for banks was . already offset by the bank levy and suggested better-off graduates would . find ways to get around the higher rates. Universities . minister David Willetts said Labour's proposals represented a cynical . u-turn. 'Ed Miliband promised a graduate tax and now he's accepting fees . have to increase to finance universities in tough times,' he said. Tessa Jowell said the previous Labour government lost the . confidence of voters because it was addicted to the 'crack cocaine' of . courting the media . 'So why should students trust anything he says? He says one thing to become leader and within a year does a u-turn. 'It makes Labour's vote last year against fee increases look completely cynical.' Ministers . initially claimed that fees over £6,000 would be the exception but . official figures show more than a third of English universities have . been granted permission to charge fees of £9,000 from 2012. Students starting degree courses from next year face average tuition fees of almost £8,500. Mr . Miliband also told the BBC this morning that the coalition's austerity . measures were 'not working' and he urged the government to change . course. He accused the . coalition of failing to meet their deficit reduction plans and called . for a temporary cut in VAT to help boost the economy. Mr Miliband told the Andrew Marr Show: 'I . think we've seen a big change over the last year, which is a year ago . there was a contested argument about whether the government strategy . should work. ""It's . not working, it's not working for Britain because unemployment is going . up, and it's not working even to cut the deficit because unless you . grow the economy you can't cut your deficit.' In . an interview with the Independent on Sunday shadow Olympics Minister . Tessa Jowell said the previous Labour government lost the confidence of . voters because it was addicted to the 'crack cocaine' of courting the . media rather than listening to the public. She . said that Labour should have taken a harder line with Rupert Murdoch's . News International following allegations of phone hacking when her party . was in power. Ms Jowell . said: 'What we've got to accept is that in the country more widely, . nobody is listening. The biggest battle that Labour has at the moment is . to be relevant and to be heard... For so many people, it's just white . noise. 'I think that . the mistake that we made - it's a bit like the crack cocaine of . politics, isn't it? Getting a good write-up, or the horror of a bad . write-up.' But former deputy Prime Minister John Prescott took a pop at Ms Jowell's comments on Twitter. 'Tessa. So Labour was addicted to Murdoch like 'crack cocaine,' he tweeted and . added, 'You spent Xmas Eve & Boxing Day with Rebekah Wade! Any more . NI dos?' Stance: Mr Miliband claims the coalition's austerity measures are 'not working' and he urged the government to change course . Harriet Harman said the party will back public sector strikes if the Government remains 'unreasonable' in talks with trade unions over efforts to secure agreement over pension reforms. Ed Miliband urged the government to engage in 'serious' negotiations but refused to say whether he would support industrial action. He urged ministers not to act as if they were 'spoiling for a fight' with the unions amid anger over proposed changes to public sector pensions. Miliband spoke out against a strike by teachers and civil servants in June and  would not be drawn on if he would support a fresh wave of action, telling BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I'm not interested in ifs.' But he added: 'Strikes are a sign of failure, we've got to avoid them and there is a big responsibility on Government to stop them happening.' Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, one of several unions planning to ballot workers for strikes later this year, said the Government was attacking the retirement incomes and pension rights of millions of workers over its controversial plans to increase contributions by 3.2 per cent. Frankly, if the Labour Party cannot stand up and support people defending themselves and their families, then what does it stand for?' Mr Miliband . also announced that he would be championing a package of internal . reforms already approved by the Labour Party's ruling National Executive . Committee. The changes, which party members will . be voting on at the upcoming conference, include giving non-member . 'registered voters' the right to have a say in party leadership . elections if they reach 50,000 in number. The NEC has also agreed to review conference voting arrangements and the weight given to union votes. Ed Miliband arrives at the Labour Party Conference with his wife Justine and their sons Daniel and Samuel . Mr Miliband said: 'I want to change our party to make us more outward-looking, so we spend our time talking to the public and not ourselves.' In his keynote speech on Tuesday Mr Miliband will outline proposals to force energy firms to pool electricity they produce to encourage smaller firms to join the market and force down spiralling fuel bills. Several senior Labour politicians, including former cabinet members Alan Johnson and John Prescott and shadow health minister Diane Abbot have signed a letter in The Observer today urging the leadership to back the Labour Diversity Fund campaign which would encourage more people from working class backgrounds to become party candidates. 'If the Labour Party is to continue to be the true people's party into the 21st century and wishes to win back the five million predominantly working class voters it's lost since 1997, then it has to reflect those who it wishes to represent,' they said in the letter.","Leader Ed Miliband says the government risks 'destroying the ambition of a generation'

"It has long been debated whether humans are responsible for the extinction of the woolly mammoth. Now, a new study  suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago. By studying the bones of mammoths, horses and reindeer, the experts ruled out climate change and food shortages as the reason for the population plunge. A new study suggests that hunting did significantly deplete mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago, adding weight to the argument that humans are to blame for the creature's extinction. An illustration of a woolly mammoth is shown . Researchers from the University of Tübingen, Germany and the Senckenberg Nature Research Society in Frankfurt, analysed bones, teeth and mammoth ivory from the Gravettian era between 30,500 and 22,000 years ago. They found that woolly mammoth numbers declined, but that climate conditions as well as food and water supplies for the giant herbivores remained stable. The woolly cousins of modern elephants roamed northern Eurasia and North America beginning 300,000 years ago, but some 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, all but a few of the isolated island populations disappeared. By studying bones, researchers found that numbers of woolly mammoths declined, but that climate conditions as well as food and water supplies for the giant herbivores remained stable, indicating that hunting is the main cause. A depiction of a hunting party using a pitfall trap is shown . Since the 1700s scientists have debated what caused the demise of mammoths. All but a few isolated island populations disappeared between 20,000 and 10,000 years ago. One popular theory, bolstered by this study, is that Ice Age people hunted most of the mammoths out of existence. However, some experts argue that global warming helped make the giant creatures extinct between 20,000 and 25,000 years ago. Other researchers argue that an impact of extraterritorial objects in North America 13,000 years ago, led to rapid climate change, eventually wiping out the mammoths. Today, it's thought that a combination of factors led to extinction. The study, led by Biogeologist Dr Dorothée Drucker, which was published in Quaternary International explains that finds of mammoth bone or ivory artefacts become rarer throughout the Gravettian era. She focused on finds from Germany’s Swabian Jura region and the Dordogne valley in south western France. Together with experts from the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris, Dr Drucker found evidence that the slow disappearance of mammoths was linked to intense hunting by humans. The team analysed the composition of stable isotopes in mammoth, horse and reindeer bones – a technique that is used for gathering dietary and environmental information from extinct species. The relative amounts of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen isotopes provide indications of the stability of the animals’ environment. All three species showed a mainly stable concentration of isotopes during the Gravettian era, meaning that their environment didn’t change much, ruling out climate change as the reason for the decline of mammoths. In the early 20th century, 11,000-year-old cave paintings of woolly mammoths were found in France, suggesting that the creatures once lived side by side with humans. While this is now accepted, experts are still trying to solve the chilling question of whether humans are responsible for mammoths' extinction. This image shows a prehistoric rock painting of a mammoth . But the researchers found that the concentration of 15N nitrogen isotope in the remains of horses from the Swabian Jura, increased during the Gravettian. Based on this information, they believe that horses in the region were taking over the ecological niche of receding mammoth populations. They measured levels of the oxygen isotope 180 to investigate whether climate change may explain the movement. But Dr Drucker said there were no signs of major climate changes in that epoch, ‘so it is highly likely that the decrease in mammoth populations in south western Germany was caused by humans.’ Scientists said last March that they have taken a step towards cloning the extinct woolly mammoth and there is a 'high chance' it will happen. Experts expect to extract ‘high quality DNA’ from a 43,000 year old carcass found in Siberia. Woolly mammoths finally died out in eastern Siberia around 4,000 years ago. Radik Khayrullin, vice president of the Russian Association of Medical Anthropologists, said: ‘The data we are about to receive will give us a high chance to clone the mammoth.’ But he called for responsibility in bringing the ancient beast back to life, urging that competing teams seeking to win a race to clone the mammoth, not to play God for the sake of it. ‘We must have a reason to do this, as it is one thing to clone it for scientific purpose and another to clone for the sake of curiosity,’ he said. A cloning attempt would involve a female elephant – the closest living relative of the mammoth - acting as a surrogate mother.","Researchers in Germany have found that hunting significantly depleted mammoth populations in Western Europe around 30,000 years ago .

"Jury selection begins on Monday in the trial of the man accused of fatally shooting a former Navy SEAL who was depicted in the Oscar-nominated film American Sniper. More than 260 potential jurors reported to district court in the Texas town of Stephenville, southwest of Fort Worth this morning. Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh is charged with capital murder in the deaths of 38-year-old Chris Kyle and Kyle's friend, 35-year-old Chad Littlefield, two years ago at a luxury resort's shooting range in a rural area about 25 miles southeast of Stephenville. The trial is expected to start on Wednesday. Eddie Ray Routh (pictured left in uniform and right) is the former Marine accused of killing 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield on February 2, 2013 . Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL and author of the book American Sniper, pictured in 2012. Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were fatally shot at a shooting range southwest of Fort Worth, Texas in 2013 . The film American Sniper is based on Kyle's 2012 memoir. He left the Navy in 2009 after four tours in Iraq. Judge Jason Cashon told potential jurors during a jury qualification process last week that they wouldn't be dismissed just for seeing the movie or reading the book. The judge decided on Monday that there were too many potential jurors in court to allow the media to take photographs. Instead of a typical Erath County jury pool of 175, about 800 jury summonses were sent out, district clerk Wanda Pringle has said. Several hundred people who weren't eliminated due to exemptions or other factors took part in last week's screening. The group was narrowed during that process after potential jurors were dismissed for a variety of reasons, including some who said pretrial publicity had already led them to a decision in the case. Defense attorneys plan to pursue an insanity defense. Prosecutors won't seek the death penalty, but will ask for a sentence of life in prison without parole if Routh is convicted. Family members have said Routh, 27, struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder after leaving the Marines in 2010. The small arms technician served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti. Kyle took Routh to the shooting range after Routh's mother asked if he could help her son. About two hours after they arrived at Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on February 2, 2013, an employee discovered the bodies of Kyle and Littlefield at the remote range. In the meantime, authorities say Routh drove to his sister's house in Kyle's truck, telling her and her husband that he'd killed Kyle and Littlefield. His sister told police that Routh 'was out of his mind saying people were sucking his soul and that he could smell the pigs'. Eddie Ray Routh, an Iraq war veteran who was battling post-traumatic stress disorder, is scheduled to stand trial in the slayings of two men at a gun range near Stephenville, Texas (pictured) Eddie Ray Routh and his mother, Jodi, in an undated picture.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott is being haunted by his own, damning words, in a video that has resurfaced today. The embattled Liberal leader this afternoon tried to shrug off the fact nearly 40 per cent of his own colleagues voted for a leadership spill, insisting 'this matter is now behind us'. But he wasn't nearly so forgiving when 31 of former prime minister Julia Gillard's colleagues voted against her leadership in February 2012. The video from parliamentary Question Time shows Mr Abbott questioning how Ms Gillard could continue as leader, considering her lack of party support. Scroll down for video . In the video, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott asked how Ms Gillard could claim a mandate as Prime Minister . Ms Gillard responded by reminding Mr Abbott he won the leadership off Malcolm Turnbull by a single vote . 'My question is to the Prime Minister,' Mr Abbott said, rising to address the House of Representatives. 'Given that one third of her parliamentary colleagues, and a quarter of her cabinet colleagues have expressed their lack of confidence in her, how can she claim to have a mandate to continue as Prime Minister?' Ms Gillard had just defeated Mr Rudd in the second of four leadership spills during that era between the pair by a margin of 71 to 31. The then prime minister rebuked him - 'he comes into this Parliament having survived his leadership issues by one vote!' - but he wasn't done. Contrition: Mr Abbott said 'good government starts today' - some sixteen months into his prime ministership . Pained: More than half of his backbench colleagues voted to spill the leadership . Changed times: Mr Abbott (left, with wife Margie) today defeated a leadership spill motion by 61 votes to 39 . Mr Abbott (flanked by parliamentary colleagues) survived the motion but was politically wounded by the internal dissent of the past few weeks . Mr Abbott arrived at today's party meeting with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop - touted as a potential leadership contender herself - by his side . 'Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. 'How can the Prime Minister claim to be leading a united team when the former Prime Minister and former foreign minister said that the Prime Minister had 'lost the trust of the Australian people' and 31 of her caucus colleagues backed the former prime minister?' Years on, it is Mr Abbott himself who is damaged by a lack of support from his own colleagues, with 39 Liberals voting for his leadership to be re-considered. And history does repeat itself. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today asked Mr Abbott: 'Now that one third of his parliamentary colleagues have today expressed their lack of confidence in him, how can (Mr Abbott) claim to have a mandate?' As Mr Abbott knows, that's a dangerous line of questioning.","2012 video of Tony Abbott questioning Julia Gillard in Parliament resurfaces .

"Leon Brittan has been buried after a 'very private' funeral with cemetery staff told not to reveal his grave's location amid vandalism fears, it has been claimed. In accordance with Jewish tradition, the former home secretary is said to have been interred in an simple plot without flowers in Golders Green Cemetery, north London. However, staff at the facility say they have been asked only to allow people to visit the site when granted permission by Lord Brittan's widow Diana, according to investigative website Exaro. Leon Brittan has been buried in an undisclosed location in a north London cemetery amid concern his burial site could attract vandals, his family said . Following his death last month, critics feared the truth over whether or not Lord Brittan  deliberately withheld evidence from police would never surface. The 75-year-old died on January 22 before ever being questioned over accusations he concealed a dossier of evidence that incriminated senior politicians in the sexual abuse of boys in the 1980s. The alleged abuse at a luxury block of flats in central London is now the subject of a Home Office inquiry. According to Exaro, Lord Brittan was buried on Wednesday, January 28. An employee at Golders Green Cemetery told the website: 'It is an unmarked grave. I need the permission of his family to take anyone down to the grave. 'We have to respect the family's wishes.' It is customary not to visit a grave until after an initial period of mourning, and a headstone is unveiled up to a year after death. Lord Brittan served as Home Secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government between 1983 and 1985. During this time he is accused of witnessing the murder of a boy by two politicians at an apartment in Dolphin Square, the setting of the alleged routine sexual abuse of children. In 1984, he was said to have been given a dossier of evidence by campaigning MP Geoffrey Dickens which incriminated several senior politicians in a paedophile ring. Lord Brittan has been buried at Golder's Green Jewish Cemetery (above) following a 'very private' funeral . The politician was Home Secretary in Margaret Thatcher's government between 1983 and 1985 . Lord Brittan was accused of deliberately covering up a dossier of evidence handed to him by Geoffrey Dickens (right) in 1984. The documents were alleged to incriminate senior politicians in child abuse . Lord Brittan insisted he passed the documents on to the relevant authorities, though they have never been found. Following fresh accounts from men claiming to have been abused as boys at the property, an inquiry into an alleged Westminster paedophile ring was launched. It has been repeatedly delayed as officials struggle to find an appropriate person to lead proceedings. Lady Butler-Sloss, the first appointed chairwoman, was forced to resigned in July last year. She is the sister of Sir Michael Havers who served as attorney general in the 80s. Fiona Woolf was selected to replace her but stepped down after admitting she lived on the same street as Lord Brittan and his wife. This week the Home Office announced that Lowell Goddard would take her place. Previously Simon Danczuk, the MP who exposed Cyril Smith as a paedophile after being contacted by his victims, said Lord Brittan's death could impede the inquiry. 'Lord Brittan’s death will make it that much harder for the truth to come out about the missing “Dickens dossier” and the alleged cover-up of a Westminster paedophile ring in the 1980s,' he said. Lady Butler-Sloss (left) resigned over her relation to former attorney general Sir Michael Havers while Fiona Woolf (right) stepped down after admitting she used to live on the same street as Lord Brittan .

"Choosing the right outfit for an awards ceremony is a task riddled with possible pitfalls. Despite armies of stylists, hairdressers and free designers goodies at their disposal, stars often get their red carpet look terribly wrong. At tonight's BAFTAs in London's Covent Garden, many missed the mark with ill-fitting gowns, too much cleavage and skint-tight satin all featuring on the list of fashion fails. Some celebrities tripped up by being over zealous with their accessories and hairdos - Anne Marie Duff's curling irons will be needing a well-deserved rest after creating her poodle perm this evening while Natalie Dormer's lace finger-less gloves were a nod to Madonna that should have stayed in the Eighties. Other stars floundered with their choice of colour - Sarah Jane Crawford was washed out by her pale pink gown and Sienna Guilroy's dress sparked memories of creamed spinach in the school canteen. But some of the biggest offenders came down to a lack of effort, as demonstrated by the singer Mica Levi, who arrived in a baggy PVC raincoat. Here FEMAIL round-up the worst dressed... Scroll down for video . British singer Mica Levi might have been prepared for the chilly British weather but her baggy coat and PVC creepers were underwhelming . Sara MacDonald, pictured here with Noel Gallagher, wore a baggy dress that swamped her petite frame . IT girl Hofit Gola's red carpet outfit would have been more appropriate on a showgirl, left, while she looked like she'd been inspired by Big Bird with this bright yellow gown she changed into for the Weinstein Company afterparty, right . Captain America star Hayley Atwell suffered a wardrobe malfunction as her dress ripped at the seam under her arm . The shade of Homeland Nimrat Kaur's pink dress would have been better suited to a five-year-old girl, left. She didn't fare much better when she changed for the afterparty, right, and wore this unusual graphic print dress that will make your eyes go funny if you look at it for too long . I'm A Celebrity contestant Nadia Forde's satin gown was ill-fitting and looked cheap . Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman wore a dress with too fussy floral print with an unflattering cut away section at the midriff . TV presenter Sarah Jane Crawford wore a shade of pink that made her appear washed out . Sienna Guillory wore a shade of green often used in 1970s bathrooms . Anne-Marie Duff's curly hairstyle was similar to a shaggy poodle . Natalie Dormer wore a beautiful dark blue gown but her look was ruined with lacy finger-less gloves . Actress Romola Garai looks like she wore a size too big for her as she's swamped by the fabric in this clashing pastels outfit . TV presenter Charlie Webster, who attended with her Downton Abbey and Imitation Game boyfriend Allen Leech, choose a bizarre one sleeved dress that was half lacy number and half folded stain that she accessorised with a chunky silver necklace . We know it was a cold evening but that's no excuse for Rachel Riley to wear this thick faux fur scarf that made her dress look less elegant . Nick Cave's wife Susie Bick wore a questionable sheer and red velvet grown with a furry black scarf . MyAnna Buring's blue T-shirt dress was too plain for such a glamorous event . Kara Tointon's gold dress looked like it could have been a leftover from her Strictly Come Dancing days . Angelina Jolie was ridiculed for flashing her leg on the Oscars red carpet in 2012 with a black dress slashed to the thigh - it looks as though Alice Eve has stolen the look as she attended the Baftas, pictured left and right . Monica Bellucci's black gown was elegant but had a touch of Morticia Addams about it along with the actress's long, straight black hair . Amy Adams was one of the best dressed on the red carpet in a white gown - so why did she change into this bra flashing black suit for the Weinstein afterparty which made it look like she'd forgotten to wear a blouse?

"The West must not threaten Russian president Vladimir Putin, above, over a solution to the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin warned today; Putin is pictured above speaking before the start of the winter Olympics last week . The West must not threaten Vladimir Putin over a solution to the Ukrainian crisis, the Kremlin warned today. The demand came as Ukraine accused Moscow of deploying new troops and military hardware to rebel-held regions. Ukraine claims 1,500 Russian troops and convoys of military hardware entered their territory over the weekend, something Russia denies. America is considering supplying arms to Kiev, while a senior British defence official, Nick Gurr, head of international security policy, was said to today be in Kiev to discuss 'cooperation in the military sphere'. Ukrainian officials said he was meeting defence minister Stepan Poltorak and would discuss reforms in Ukraine's defence system. A Putin spokesman said: 'Nobody has ever talked to the president in the tone of an ultimatum, and could not do so even if they wished to.' Putin blames the West for the current bloodshed in eastern Ukraine and shows no signs of compromise. The EU wanted to 'tear off' ex-Soviet states and force them into an 'artificial choice' between Russia and Europe, he has claimed. 'We repeatedly warned the USA and its Western allies about the harmful consequences of their interference in Ukrainian domestic affairs but they did not listen to our opinion,' he told an Egyptian newspaper. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama met German Chancellor Angela Merkel today in a public display of unity despite a potential split over arming Ukrainian fighters to wage a more effective battle against Russian-backed separatists . Putin sees Ukraine as part of Russia's sphere of influence in eastern Europe. President Barack Obama met German Chancellor Angela Merkel today in a public display of unity despite a potential split over arming Ukrainian fighters to wage a more effective battle against Russian-backed separatists. That was the unstated point of the White House meeting, where Ms Merkel was to brief Mr Obama on upcoming talks aimed at reviving a peace plan for besieged Ukraine. At issue is not only Putin's support for the separatists but the revival of the Soviet Cold War strategy of trying to create a critical division between the U.S. and its NATO allies, Germany in particular. Ms Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met with Ukrainian leaders and Putin last week and have announced a new summit meeting for Wednesday in Minsk. French and German leaders are to sit down with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Putin in an attempt to breathe life into a much-violated September peace plan. The U.S. will not be at the table. Ms Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met with Ukrainian leaders and Putin last week and have announced a new summit meeting for Wednesday in Minsk; The French and German leader are pictured above with Putin in Moscow . That meeting in the Belarusian capital takes place with Ms Merkel and Mr Hollande deeply opposed to arming Ukraine in its bid to push back the separatists that NATO and the U.S. insist are being armed by Russia, which also has troops fighting in the eastern Ukraine. The White House has let it be known that Mr Obama, who had resisted calls to send arms, was now considering doing just that. Opponents of arming Kiev believe that could open a proxy war between Washington and Moscow. Merkel and Hollande insist the only way to end the conflict is through diplomacy. Former U.S. presidential candidate John McCain warned Ukrainians 'are being slaughtered, and we're sending them blankets and meals. 'Blankets don't do well against Russian tanks.' More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April, according to a U.N. tally; the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks; a pro-Russian separatist fires a machine gun towards the eastern Ukrainian city of Debaltseve, in the Donetsk region, last month . The EU has vowed to put new sanctions against Russia on hold ahead of last ditch talks to end the conflict. On the table is a plan to create a demilitarised zone of between 30 and 45 miles around the current frontline. At the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Vice President Joe Biden stopped short of explicitly addressing possible arms deliveries. He said: 'We will continue to provide Ukraine with security assistance not to encourage war, but to allow Ukraine to defend itself.' More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April, according to a U.N. tally; the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks.","Demand comes as Ukraine accuses Moscow of deploying more troops .

"An enormous fatberg of built-up grease from takeaways and rubbish on one of Britain's busiest party streets has been found. The 3ft-wide mass was blocking sewers beneath Mill Lane in Cardiff, a popular nightlife spot with scores of fast food restaurants. Photographs taken by a camera robot sent underground to investigate the water blockage revealed the buildup which has likened to Jabba the Hutt. Scroll down for video . A fatberg of built up grease from takeaway food and waste was found blocking sewers beneath Mill Lane in Cardiff (above) The 3ft-wide mass also contained make-up and nappy wipes. It had been blocking water flow beneath the busy city centre street . Alongside congealed fat from kebabs and burgers were wet-wipes, nappies and chewing gum. Passers-by used to spending their nights in the street's many clubs and bars were horrified to see what had been beneath their dancing feet. Office worker Michelle Morgan, 24, said: 'That is just so disgusting. It is horrible to think that is just lying there. 'It just shows that all the fat and rubbish has to go somewhere. I’ll never eat another kebab here again!.' Shopper Adrian Smith, 27, added: 'It looks like Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars mixed with a rancid mountain of lard. It is appalling.' Welsh Water urged revellers not to throw litter in the street or down toilets and sinks to avoid such blockages . Passers-by likened the buildup of fat to 'Jabba the Hutt mixed with rancid lard' when shown photographs . Welsh Water, who claim to spend millions every year removing waste from sewers, encouraged revellers not throw rubbish down their sinks and toilets. 'It is pretty disgusting. In Cardiff alone, 80 tonnes of rubbish including dental floss, chewing gum, nappies and plasters are removed from sewers every month,' a spokesman said. 'We want to change customer behaviour when it comes to putting things down the toilet and disposing of fat, oils and grease.' Among the most common causes of drain blockages are make-up and nappy wipes, fat and grease, chewing gum, dental floss, plasters and building debris. Over the festive period waste experts warned against pouring turkey and goose fat down kitchen sinks. It came after a 15-tonne fatberg was found in London in 2013. A sewage worker took three weeks to clear the mass which threatened to spill out onto streets.

"After raking in a signing bonus of $2million four years ago, a Blue Jays pitching prospect immediately splurged on his dream car. But for Daniel Norris, 21, it was both a car and a home when he purchased 'Shaggy', a 1978 mustard yellow, Volkswagen Westfalia van that he lives in during the off season. As a love of the outdoors runs his family, the left-handed pitcher from Johnson City, Tennessee spends his time camping in mountains and driving on the open road when he is not playing baseball. After raking in a signing bonus of $2million four years ago, Blue Jays pitching prospect Daniel Norris (above) immediately splurged on his dream car - a 1978 mustard yellow Volkswagen Westfalia van . The left-handed pitcher from Johnson City, Tennessee spends his time camping in mountains and driving on the open road with Shaggy when he is not playing baseball (above the player gets ready for bed as the sun sets) Norris, who made his major-league debut in September, even started the tradition of driving a 1,100-kilometer trip from his hometown to Dunedin, Florida where he and his teammates train in the Spring, according to the National Post. It is during long trips like this on the open road that helps him find peace within. He said: 'I love my teammates and family but I'm not the kind of person who likes to be around a ton of people. I'm a thinker, I like to be alone with my thoughts. 'When I'm out there, it's just me, Shaggy and God and I can really connect with myself. It's very peaceful.' He has documented his travels on the road on Twitter, where he posts pictures of himself cooking and getting ready for bed as the sun sets. The 6 foot 2 player found Shaggy, which was named after the Scooby-Doo character, through his dad's friend as it was not initially for sale. After convincing the owner to let him buy it, Norris purchased the van and added solar panels and a bed, according to GrindTV.

After convincing the owner to let him buy it, Norris purchased Shaggy and added solar panels and a bed . And for Norris, his unique splurge comes in line behind a trend of other decisions and traits that have led him on a road less traveled, which has seemed to remain a theme in his life. He said that he has always been different from wearing 'weird' shoes in high school to not ever talking that much. His background has also been rooted in the outdoors, and in his childhood, he was taught how to live a simple life. As he was growing up, his parents and two older sisters would go rock climbing, camping, bike riding on the weekends, and eventually he picked up kayaking and backpacking during the first two off seasons his pro baseball career. When he has time to travel on the open road, Norris, who can throw a fastball that can reach 95mph, does not have a particular plan. But his time includes surfing, hiking, self-reflection and tucking into the overhead bunk bed at night for bed.

"Plans for a massive new Grand Canyon development which would feature an IMAX theatre and gondola tram have sparked a bitter land dispute. The proposed project would be built on the eastern rim of the Arizona canyon on an untouched plateau and would be linked down to the canyon floor by the tram. The site for the proposed development is called 'the confluence' and is where the Colorado River meets the Little Colorado River on the canyon's east side  - and according to the Navajo creation story, is the spot where their people first emerged. Developers Confluence Partners want to provide visitors to the Grand Canyon National Park with a new 420-acre attraction (pictured) which would feature an IMAX theatre, shops, hotels and a gondola tram .

The Grand Canyon National Park attracts more than five million tourists every year. But it is also spiritually significant to the Hopi, Zuni, Acoma and Laguna Navajo tribes. Renae Yellowhorse, a member of the Navajo Nation, said: 'It is my church, it is where I say my prayers. It is where I give my offerings. It's where I commune with the holy ones, the gods that walk along the canyon,' she told NBC News. The developers have also outlined plans for a 'Riverwalk' on the canyon floor which would include  walkways, restaurants, a tramway station, toilets, a terraced seating area and a wastewater package plant. Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma said the confluence is the 'final spiritual resting place' for Hopi ancestors, and building the project 'would severely compromise access and our ability to practice religion' on the site . Those supporting the project argue it will allow tourists to see the canyon in a different way. At the moment the shortest path down to the canyon floor is seven miles of scrub path - the proposed gondola would make the trip just 10 minutes. The National Park Service has said the Grand Canyon is 'in danger' under the project and Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Dave Uberuaga branded the plans 'a travesty'. But Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly said he will support the project and the $65 million required from the tribe for road, water and communication facilities. He said he sees the plans as an 'opportunity' for the Navajo. 'I want my people to have a better life. I want them to have jobs, they need homes, good homes. They need better education,' he told NBC. When Mr Shelly was asked about those Navajo tribal members who do not want the development he said: 'Some of them want to go back to the old ways. But you can't go back.' Renae Yellowhorse (pictured) a member of the Navajo Nation, opposes plans to develop on the sacred site . Mr Shelly added the Navajo suffer from high unemployment and suicide rates. Business opportunities on the land are scarce because for 40 years development on 1.6 million acres of tribal land was halted by the government under  'The Bennett Freeze'. It was intended to prevent both the Hopi and Navajo tribes from building on the land, because the tribes disputed its ownership. Members of the Hopi tribe are opposing the project and have said the proposed development is too close to one of their sacred sites, the Hopi Salt Trail. Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma, Director for the Hopi Tribe's Cultural Preservation Office, said the confluence is the 'final spiritual resting place' for  Hopi ancestors, and building a tourist destination 'would severely compromise access and our ability to practice religion' on the site. But Navajo Albert Hale, one of Confluence Partners' developers, argues the project will allow his tribe to profit from their land while giving visitors to the area a breathtaking view. He claims the tribe could receive up to 18 percent of gross revenue from the development. Mr Shelly is expected to sign a proposed resolution authorizing the project soon, and developers hope to begin the project as early as the spring of 2017 - but tribe members say they will not stop opposing the development. They have founded a group called 'Save the Confluence' and are spreading their message with stickers and painted signs across the Navajo reservation. Mr Kuwanwisiwma said: 'These landscapes and the canyon and the confluence today are still very, very important to the Hopi people and we'll never let that go. 'We're not going to give up on being good stewards of these lands. Never.' The National Park Service said the Grand Canyon (pictured) is 'in danger' under the proposed project .","Proposed project would build 420-acre multimedia complex on plateau .

"A Playboy model caused a stir by sharing images of her curvaceous behind with her fans only to be caught in a Photoshopping row. Peruvian beauty Tilsa Lozano, 32, uploaded a series of seductive snaps - that she insisted were raw, unretouched images - to Twitter in December to show her ex-boyfriend exactly what he was missing. But she was left red-faced after a magazine editor claimed that the images had been tampered with and published several 'un-doctored' images of the model's behind - revealing cellulite on her bottom and thighs - to prove it. Scroll down for video . These allegedly un-doctored images of Playboy model Tilsa Lozano were published by a magazine. Tilsa has responded by saying she is proud of her cellulite . Tilsa posted a message online aimed at her ex, footballer Juan Vargas telling him that love was about more than just looks. She then followed this up with sexy swimwear shots in which she posed in thong and heels, showing off her curvy bottom to best advantage. The model is justly proud of her bottom having been crowned Miss Playboy TV Latin America in 2008. She insisted the pictures were taken behind the scenes of a calendar shoot and were 'raw' images and hadn't been edited. But she was forced to defend herself when  Magaly Medina, 51, the editor of Magaly TeVe magazine, disputed this and revealed unflattering shots of the model's bottom, that showed the tell-tale signs of orange peel skin. Playboy model Tilsa Lozano wanted to show ex-boyfriend Juan Vargas there was more to her than just her looks so shared this 'raw' image of her online with fans . The pictures Magaly found are taken from behind of Tilsa wearing a tiny pair of denim hotpants worn with a tight white crop top. It appears that Tilsa was snapped  at a show as she's seen dancing in one of the pictures. Despite Magaly's 'proof' that Tilsa had edited her Twitter snaps, Tilsa denied that her bikini shots had been retouched and furthermore, added that she was proud of her cellulite, The Mirror reported. In fact the row over the pictures prompted Tilsa to deny trying to deceive her Twitter fans about her natural figure and to reveal her pride about her natural physique. The glamour model claimed  the images were unetouched but a Peruvian magazine, Magaly TeVe, disputed this and responded by publishing images it claims are un-doctored . She said: 'Yes, I do have cellulite, but that shouldn't come as a surprise as I haven't made a secret of it.' The model followed the admission with several more 'belfies' which she posted online claiming that her cellulite was not as bad as Magaly had claimed. In one particular heated moment the exchange between the two women became personal as the model reportedly compared the editor to Frankenstein, in a reference to the amount of cosmetic procedures that she is alleged to have had. The model says none of her pictures have been airbushed  and claims  she has never tried to hide her cellulite . Tilsa (right) recently posted this photo of herself and a friend on her Twitter suggesting she has not been phased by her recent row with the magazine . In one Tweet she said: 'I've just got out of a TV show with these clothes on. Frankenstein will be envious.' The feud between the two women took place on Twitter with fans fighting the model's corner and responding to the dispute with montages of Tilsa's derriere. The model continued her dismissal of critics by posting an image of herself with a friend holding a sign that reads 'I don't care what you think' on Saturday.","Tilsa Lozano, 32, shared 'raw' images of herself in a bikini last month .

"British motorists caught speeding in Europe face being tracked down and fined, under controversial new EU rules. At the moment, drivers caught by a speed camera while in their own car abroad cannot be fined because EU police forces do not have the power to trace people abroad. But the European Parliament is expected to back new measures giving foreign police forces the power to send fines to British addresses and pursue motorists through the UK courts if they do not pay. Motorists caught by speed cameras abroad face being tracked down and forced to pay a fine, under new EU rules . Motorists can already be traced if they are were driving hire cars or caught by police officers on the side of the road. The new rules, which are expected to be easily passed by the European Parliament, will allow motorists to be fined for speeding, ignoring a red light, drink and drug driving and driving while using a mobile phone. If a driver commits an offence in another country, the police will be able to use their car's registration number to track them down. They will be given the power to send out a letter in the driver's own language, demanding payment and threatening court action if they do not pay the fine. British police will also be able to pursue foreign motorists driving in Britain for any traffic and speeding fines they have accumulated in the UK. If approved, the Bill will apply to member states from May – but the UK will have two years to enforce the new law. The move, which is backed by ministers, has been welcomed by road safety campaigners. Ed Morrow, from the organisation Brake, said: 'For a driver who puts lives at risk to escape prosecution because their vehicle is registered in another country is both insulting and incomprehensible for victims. Illegal driving crosses borders, so enforcement must cross borders too.' AA president Edmund King (right) criticised new rules allowing British motorists caught speeding on holiday in France, Germany to be traced . The Department for Transport added: 'It's not right that foreign drivers have gone unpunished for speeding offences in the UK, and we are pleased this is set to change. 'But it mustn't be easier for British drivers to be prosecuted abroad than for foreign drivers to be prosecuted in the UK. We have made this clear from the outset of the negotiations.' Ines Ayala Sender, a Spanish MEP and the EU Parliament's negotiator on the issue, said the move would help cut road deaths by 50 per cent. He said: 'Citizens are, of course, never thrilled to receive a letter telling them they have been caught committing a traffic offence, but they do welcome the fact that everyone in the EU will be treated equally, no matter where their vehicle is registered.' But, Edmund King, the AA president, said: 'In theory, tracking down drivers who break the law driving in other countries might sound like a good idea in terms of road safety but in practice it could be a nightmare. 'Different European countries have significantly different motoring laws and indeed penalties. If UK drivers receive a penalty notice for using a ""restricted lane"" in Spain they may wish to contest it but this would prove impossible in most cases as often photographic evidence is not provided. Returning to Europe for a court case is prohibitive in terms of cost.'","Currently, drivers caught by speed cameras  abroad cannot be traced .

"The glaciers that accompanied ice ages are responsible for carving out enormous swathes of rock on Earth, but these periods of cold weather may have built up its crust too . Colder spells caused water to be drawn up into glaciers, and in turn this caused sea levels to drop, allowing more magma to seep out from underwater eruptions. This, scientists believe, caused thicker sections of crust to emerge during the same period. UK researchers say lower sea levels caused by glaciers (stock image shown) made the crust thicken. During ice ages, sea levels could be up to 330ft (100 metres) lower. This is because water is drawn up into the glaciers and ice sheets. In turn, this reduced pressure on the ocean floor, allowing more magma to seep out . The theory - published in the journal Science - suggests that during an ice age, increased amounts of water are taken up into glaciers, causing sea levels to drop by up to 330ft (100 metres). This reduces the pressure on the ocean floor, allowing magma to erupt more easily and spread across the ocean floor more easily. At the surface, Antarctica is a motionless and frozen landscape. Yet hundreds of miles down the Earth is moving at a rapid rate, research in May last year showed. The study, led by Newcastle University and published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, explains for the first time why the upward motion of the Earth's crust in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula is currently taking place so quickly. GPS data collected by the international research team, including experts from Newcastle University, Durham University, and the University of Colorado  revealed that the land in this region is rising at a phenomenal rate of 0.6 inches (15 mm) a year. The effect is due to the glaciers thinning, allowing the land underneath to 'spring' upwards relatively quickly. Evidence for magma erupting is known from seafloor spreading centres, reports Science Magazine. This is where plates of ocean crust move apart, allowing magma to erupt outwards into the water. On the bottom of the oceans, this forms so-called 'abyssal hills', which are ridges hundreds of metres long, separated by valleys, on plates moving away from each other. It suggests that climatic effects on the surface of Earth can have previously unknown effects on other parts of the planet. Such is the effect that the oceanic crust can thicken by about 2,625ft (800 metres) during an ice age, about 10 per cent of its total thickness. 'We know that volcanism has an effect on climate,' said Dr Richard Katz, a geophysicist at the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the authors of the study, in Nature . 'What we're seeing is that climate cycles are also affecting ocean volcanism.' They also found that, during warmer times such as today, the production of new crust was stunted. The theory - published in the journal Science - suggests that during an ice age, increased amounts of water are taken up into glaciers, causing sea levels to drop by up to 330ft (100 metres). This reduces the pressure on the ocean floor, allowing magma to erupt more easily and spread across the ocean floor more easily (illustrated) Evidence for magma erupting is known from seafloor spreading centres, illustration shown. This is where plates of ocean crust move apart, allowing magma to erupt outwards into the water. On the bottom of the oceans, this forms so-called 'abyssal hills', which are ridges hundreds of metres long . The researchers noticed the effect in chains of 'hillocks - knolls or small hills - in the seas between Australia and the Antarctic. They examined two areas of a mid-oceanic ridge between the two regions, surveyed in 2011 and 2013, by the Korean icebreaker Araon. Here, a chain of hills about 655ft (200 metres) high lines the sea floor. These have been formed by a mixture of seismic activity, sedimentation, volcanoes and sea-floor spreading. But a pattern of crustal thickness variations was found to synchronise with 23,000, 41,000 and 100,000 year glacial cycles - known as Milankovitch cycles. Using a computer model to test their idea, the researchers found the decreased pressure on the mantle would increase the rate of mantle melting. More magma would be spilled onto the sea floor, explaining the formation of thick abyssal hills underwater. 'We know that volcanism has an effect on climate,' said Dr Richard Katz, a geophysicist at the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the authors of the study, in Nature. 'What we're seeing is that climate cycles are also affecting ocean volcanism.' Shown is a stock image of lava forming underwater . 'Step back and think about this: Small variations in the orbital parameters of the Earth - tilt and eccentricity and wobble - are recorded on the sea floor,' said Dr Katz to Science Magazine, referring to ice ages. 'It kind of blows my mind.' Furthermore, the research may also explain another puzzle about ice ages - why they start gradually but end suddenly. It's possible that increased seafloor eruptions by the decrease in pressure releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This would warm the atmosphere and ultimately cause the ice sheets to melt. 'It's a very seductive idea, and an interesting one,' said Dr David Lund, a paleoceanographer at the University of Connecticut, Avery Point, in Science Magazine. 'The ice sheet gets so big that it seeds its own destruction.'","UK researchers say lower sea levels caused the crust to thicken .

It comes as the French Prime Minister Manuel Valls was due in Marseille later today to talk about security as crime levels in the city have dropped. He had not yet arrived in the city before the shooting, and it is thought he will still go ahead with his visit. Referring to today's attack, a police source said: 'Shots were fired at police vehicles. 'Roads in and out of the estate have now been blocked, and officers are dealing with the situation. There are no reports of casualties so far. ' La Figaro also reported Mr Bourniquel, went to the area but his car was shot at by fighting gang members as it approached. 'The police commander who was with him had to lie on the floor,' said the newspaper. 'The car was not hit but bullet holes were found two or three meters away from the vehicle in an embankment.' Early indications say the shooting appears to be gang-related rather than a terror attack. Armed elite troops have been sent to the scene with the area evacuated as a precaution.

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria have publicly beheaded a man for allegedly practicing witchcraft - the latest in a long line of barbaric executions carried out by the terror group. The unknown man was photographed being killed by a masked executioner in a village just outside ISIS' stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa while a large crowd looked on. Precise details of the victim's so-called crime are not known, but the charge of witchcraft and 'invoking magic', and the use of an axe and wooden chopping block to carry out the beheading do little to counter claims that ISIS are little more than murderers with a Dark Age view of the world. Scroll down for video . Brutal: The unknown man was photographed being killed by a masked executioner in a village just outside ISIS' stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa while a large crowd looked on . Horror: The man was led to the execution site by militants, including one who appears to be a teenager . The beheading of the man, who has a long grey beard, bald head and appears to be in his 60s, took place in a rural area named Aldbsa, to the west the city of Raqqa. Photographs of the execution and the crowds who watched it were released by ISIS-affiliated media, and were reported by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently - an anti-ISIS activist group based in the city who document the terror group's barbarism in its de facto capital. One image shows the elderly man being led to the execution site by militants, including one who appears to be a young teenager. Around the group are masked militants wielding assault rifles. Another image shows a bearded cleric reading out the charges against the man, before a third photograph shows him kneeling on the floor with his arms bound behind his back, his head resting on the chopping block and the axe just millimetres from his neck. A fourth and final image shows a crowd of dozens of onlookers pressed up against metal railings so they can get a closer look at the gruesome scene.

The witchcraft execution came just days after images were released on a blindfolded man was seen being thrown to his death from a building inside Raqqa after being accused of homosexuality. The shocking images appeared to show ISIS militants hurling the man off the seven-storey building in the town of Tal Abyad in Raqqa, supposedly in punishment for him having a 'homosexual affair'. The man apparently survived the fall, but was stoned to death by a waiting crowd at the foot of the tower block. Photographs of the incident appear to show the man - who is thought to be in his 50s - sat on a white, plastic chair while blindfolded. He is surrounded by at least two masked militants, who are dressed in black clothing and army fatigues. The man is then thrown from the top of the tower block and one photograph shows him falling towards the ground, head first.","Elderly man is seen being brutally executed for 'practicing witchcraft'

"David Cameron today convened an urgent meeting to prepare for the possibility that Greece could crash out of the eurozone. The Prime Minister chaired an hour-long meeting of officials from the Treasury, Foreign Office and the Bank of England about the threat to the UK economy. New Greek PM Alexis Tsipras last night used his inaugural speech in parliament to insist his demand for restructuring the country's debt is 'irrevocable.' Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured today visiting Upton Heath Coutny primary school in Chester, chaired an hour-long meeting of officials from the Treasury, Foreign Office and the Bank of England about the threat to the UK economy posed by Greece defaulting on its debts . Senior officials from across Whitehall were called to the Cabinet room in Number 10 this morning amid concerns about the risk of 'contagion' to Britain. It included Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson, and officials from the Department for Business, Foreign Office and the financial regulatory arm of the Bank of England. Most of Greece's national debt is held by eurozone institutions and not by Britain, which could limit the impact if it defaults. But Mr Cameron's official spokesman warned: 'There do remain risks around contagion and uncertainty and so it is important to look at all of those.' Today's meeting mirrors contingency planning carried out in 2012, at the height of the last threat to the Greek economy. New Greece PM Alexis Tsipras last night used his inaugural speech in parliament to insist his demand for restructuring the country's debt is 'irrevocable' Foreign Office officials briefed Mr Cameron on the political situation while the Bank of England and Treasury gave details of the risk of economic instability spreading across the continent. It was agreed that contingency planning should continue to be stepped up, said Downing Street. Mr Cameron's spokesman stressed that there are some 'obvious differences' with the 2012 crisis, including the fact that bond yields on the debts of countries such as Portugal, Ireland and Spain are not so high. The spokesman said: 'We have the clear positions from the new Greek government about staying in the eurozone and the comments from eurozone countries around maintaining that eurozone unity. We need to underline the determination of the eurozone countries and Greek government have signalled with regard to the euro. 'But we need to look at the risks of pressures in financial markets as potential uncertainty grows, as clearly there are difficult discussions going on between the Greek government and the eurozone countries and in that context, we need to look across the full range of issues.' Asked whether the City of London was exposed to uncertainty in Greece, the Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'Greek bonds are overwhelmingly held in the eurozone because the ECB has been providing capital and liquidity into Greek financial institutions. 'Clearly there are global economic interdependencies and London is a major global financial centre, so it is something we need to be vigilant about.' George Osborne warned that a eurozone stand-off over Greek debt is becoming the biggest risk to the global economy after meeting Greece's new finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in London last week . Athens has until the end of this month to secure around £5billion of financing to keep the Greek economy running. Failure to do so could cause the country to default on its debts and pull out of the single currency. Both Greece and other eurozone countries have stressed that they do not want to see exit from the single currency. But the country's ruling far-Left Syriza party has vowed to ditch austerity, setting the nation on a collision course with the rest of the single currency bloc. Mr Tsipras has pledged to write off some of the country's debts and renegotiate the terms of its £185billion bailout package — a deal that Germany has already said is 'too generous'. Chancellor George Osborne said yesterday: 'This stand-off between Greece and the Eurozone is increasing the risks every day to the British economy. 'A Greek exit would cause real ructions. We must have an international effort to resolve the stand-off.' Mr Cameron is due to meet Mr Tsipras for the first time on Thursday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels. Hours after Syriza's election triumph last month, Mr Cameron warned it would 'increase economic uncertainty across Europe'.","Prime Minister convenes urgent meeting in Cabinet room inside No. 10 .

"A father-of-26 dubbed 'Britain's most feckless father' claims he had his enormous brood after a string of casual conquests as a nightclub bouncer. Peter Rolfe said he could have 'the pick of the women' when he worked as a doorman in London and had sex with 'a different woman every night'. Now the 64-year-old, who has 14 daughters and 12 sons by 15 women and claims around £46,000 a year in benefits, says he regrets his former lifestyle because he let his children down. Scroll down for video . Womaniser: Father-of-26 Peter Rolfeclaims he had his enormous brood after a string of casual conquests as a nightclub bouncer. But he regrets his former lifestyle, saying: 'I've let down my children and I'm ashamed' 'If I would have been responsible, which I should have been, I would not have fathered this amount of children,' he said. 'I was a doorman and you get to pick the ""pick of the ladies"" if you like, or whatever you want to call it, and any doorman will tell you that. 'You could go home with a different woman every night and I'll be honest, I did for a while. 'But I regret that lifestyle very much because I have lost contact with a lot of my children which I'm not happy with that. I think about those children every day.' Rolfe - whose lengthy criminal record includes drink driving, handling stolen goods and drug possession - was cleared of bigamy when a 2003 case was dropped for lack of evidence. Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe once branded him Britain's most feckless father and said he did not deserve a tent, let alone a council house. Rolfe's ex-wife has claimed 'he will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough' Brood: Rolfe - who moved into the house with seven of his children and two grandchildren (pictured) - has always dodged prison sentences partly by claiming he needs to look after his children . He prompted controversy when he moved into a five-bedroom taxpayer-funded home in Newport with seven of his children. Rolfe, who now has one eye and walks with a stick, told council officials the property he had moved into in September 2011 was 'too small' for his family. He appeared on ITV's This Morning and a Channel 5 documentary last year saying he wanted a house big enough for his offspring. But despite having several convictions since 2000 including handling stolen goods, threatening behaviour and having .22 calibre bullets without a licence, Rolfe claims he changed long ago. 'In 2000 I turned my life around and tried to look after these children,' he said. 'I'll hold my hands up, I do admit, I've let down quite a few of my children and I'm ashamed of that. 'I made the decision to not go around chatting up the women or taking the pick of the women from the pubs and clubs I worked in. 'I did decide to try and settle down a couple of times but I didn't work. Lineage: Rolfe has a lengthy family tree - and many of his children and partners remain unknown . 'I have a criminal record for violence and stuff like that, I'm not disputing that. But I turned my life around back in 2000.' Ex-wife Claire Drake, 43, who had six children with Rolfe in seven years after meeting him in 1992, has described how she could not bear living with him any longer. The barmaid said previously: 'I had to get away. He's just evil. He should be castrated. He will carry on having more kids if he finds anyone stupid enough. 'It is absolutely disgusting the amount he receives in benefits while I am working for a roof over my head. 'I have nothing but hate for that man. When I watched him on This Morning, I was shaking; my legs were going; and I was sweating. He makes my skin crawl.'","Peter Rolfe, 64, has children by 15 women after working in London .

"These are the crumbling wrecks of condos which trapped residents of a Florida condo community are forced to call home. Many of the boarded-up homes have been condemned by authorities, while even those deemed technically habitable are plagued by broken pipes, rats running up and down the walls and poor electricity supply. But people living in the condos, just outside of Orlando, Florida, claim they are stuck with no money to go anywhere else and forced to live in crumbling  unsafe homes managed by landlords who refuse to make repairs. Boarded up: Some homes in Tymber Skan, near Orlando, Florida, have been deemed uninhabitable . Problems: Residents have complained of broken windows and splintered wood in the 1970s homes . Beaten up: Some reports say the homes have yet to be repaired after damage from hurricanes years ago . Smashed: As seen in the images above, broken windows are often the norm in the beleaguered community . Those who live in the 1970s condos, many of which were bought up by investors, also face a further threat of losing their water and power altogether. Owners demand rent while refusing to make vital repairs, even as local officials condemn the still-occupied houses, according to theOrlando Sentinel. Jerletha Cosby moved to the Condo community with her four young children in hope of a new home. But, she told the newspaper, when she arrived she was greeted by a house full of exposed wires, rats running up the walls and thin plywood covering holes in the wall. Her two-year-old narrowly escaped being hit by a falling closet door and her fiance is making repairs to the home because the landlord won't listen. Residents complain that, partly because of the dire housing situation, they lack the means to go anywhere else. Another concern for those living in Tymber Skan is the threat to their water and electricity supply because of a local utilities supplier threatening to cut supply because of unpaid bills. The total debt stood at $95,000 as of June 2014, according to local TV station WESH. 'Slum lords': Occupants have hit out at their landlords, whom they say refuse to make vital repairs . Broken: According to charities in the area, many residents cannot afford to go anywhere else . A spokesman for the Heart of Florida charity told the Sentinel: 'People get into a situation like Tymber Skan and they can't get out, because they don't have the first month's rent, last month's rent, utilities and deposit to go someplace else.' 'It's a perfect storm for those who want to exploit low-income people, because they have no other options.' The Blackwell family, who rent one of James Hurley's 36 condos in the community, say they feel trapped by him. Leon Blackwell said: 'Once he gets you in here, he doesn't care anymore.' His wife added: 'He's the worst slum lord I've seen - he's still coming around threatening to serve people with eviction notices.' Many residents have refused to pay rent in protest. Authorities have demolished a handful of buildings which had no hope of being repaired - but according to local news station WFTV, that costs $70,000 per condo. As well as the cost, they are reluctant to continue doing so, because it often leaves residents in an even worse position. Problems: As well as crumbling homes, residents risk losing water and power from their supplier .","Tymber Skan, near Orlando, Florida, is full of crumbling and broken condos .

"A couple who began their relationship after 'meeting' on Facebook have discovered that they have known each other since primary school and had even visited each other's houses as children. Saidee Bailey and Beau Samuelson were two years apart at Westbrook Hay Prep School in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, where they sat for a group photo in 2001. They barely knew each other and went on to separate secondary schools before starting their careers. Newly-engaged Beau Samuelson (left) and Saidee Bailey (right) discovered that they have known each other since childhood after reconnecting on Facebook . When Saidee, 24, joined Facebook as a teenager she added lots of people from her primary school as 'friends' including her future husband. In 2013 out of the blue Beau, 25, asked her for a date after telling her he found her Facebook updates interesting. It was after visiting Beau's house for the first time that Saidee began to get déjà vu. She realised they had met before after spotting a rocking horse and remembering playing on it as a child. Beau (top left) and Saidee (bottom right) had attended the same prep school and discoverd this photograph of them together after visiting their old maths teacher . Beau began messaging Saidee on Facebook after he found her status updates interesting . When Saidee visited Beau's house for the first time she realised she had visited it as a child after recognising a rocking horse she had played on . 'We found out that I had been to this house before because one of my best friend's knew his sister and my mum took us both round to play once. 'And the first time I went to his house I saw a rocking horse and I remembered playing on that.' The rocking horse now has great sentimental value to the pair who hope to give it their own child one day. 'We've now bagsied it so we can have it in our home and our kids can plays on it' added Saidee. In school Beau was a few years above Saidee and they hadn't had much interaction explaining why they hadn't recognised each other immediately . The couple pieced their link to each other when they went to the home of a family friend who was also their former primary school maths teacher. While they were there the couple saw an old photo of them both together in their uniforms - just a few pupils apart. In the picture Saidee around 10 years-old and Beau is about 12. Nutritionist Saidee, who is doing a PhD in obstetrics and gynecology, said that their immediate attraction might be explained by their shared history. The couple moved in together just a few months after meeting . 'We just got on so well, everything just felt right from the start. 'It was really strange we started talking and he said ""where do I know you from"" and I think I must have added him because I recognised his name from school. 'We realised we both actually went to the same school, but he was two years above me so we never actually interacted with each other much.' Construction worker Beau said that he was instantly attracted to Saidee and their joint past was just added bonus. 'I had her on Facebook and I kept seeing her statuses about what she was studying and I was really interested by them. Beau proposed to Saidee in December last year under the Christmas lights . 'I thought she looked really nice, so I decided to send her a message. 'It was really strange to find out we went to school together and we started to find out a lot more things, like her coming round my house when she was younger. 'We had so much in common as well, it was just really nice and it just went from there. Everything just felt right from the beginning.' The couple, from Hemel Hempstead, Herts, moved in together several months after meeting and in December last year Beau proposed in their home under the Christmas lights. Their old maths teacher Peter Makower who taught both of them in separate classes, said he was thrilled for the pair. 'I'm really happy for them. It's quite amazing really. 'We've had teachers get together but because we're a prep school we've never seen pupils get together.'","Saidee Bailey and Beau Samuelson reconnected on Facebook .

"Astronomers have spotted glimmers of 'Galaxy X' – a giant, almost invisible galaxy lurking just outside our own. The mysterious galaxy is made up mostly of dark matter and has previously only been detectable by its large gravitational pull. Now, a cluster of young, pulsating stars discovered at the far side of the Milky Way have marked the location the dwarf galaxy, which is hidden behind clouds of dust. Astronomers have spotted glimmers of 'Galaxy X' – a giant, almost invisible galaxy lurking just outside our own. Pictured is a supercomputer simulation showing how galaxies may have dark matter satellites (shown in yellow and orange) such as Galaxy X . Learning more about Galaxy X could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter, as well as the Big Bang. Existing theories correctly predict the distribution of distant galaxies. But the same theory also predicts hundreds of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way. Up until now, only only a few dozen have been found. Galaxy X could help uncover even more. A team, led by Sukanya Chakrabarti from Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, looked at four young stars 300,000 light years away. These young stars are Cepheid variables–'standard candles' that astronomers use to measure distances. According to Professor Chakrabarti, these are the most distant Cepheid variables found close to the plane of the Milky Way. The stars appear to be associated with a dwarf galaxy the team predicted in 2009 based on her analysis of ripples in the Milky Way's outer disk. Radiation from the Cepheid variable stars allowed the team to find out accurate distances and test an earlier prediction of its location. 'These young stars are likely the signature of this predicted galaxy,' said Professor Chakrabarti. 'They can't be part of our galaxy because the disk of the Milky Way terminates at 48,000 light years.' Scientists had previously predicted that despite largely being made up of dark matter, Galaxy X should have a sprinkling of dim stars. Learning more about Galaxy X could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter, as well as the Big Bang.  Scientists had previously predicted that despite largely being made up of dark matter, Galaxy X should have a sprinkling of dim stars . But finding these had proved difficult as the dark matter galaxy lies in the same plane as the Milky Way disk. 'The discovery of the Cepheid variables shows that our method of finding the location of dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies works,' she said. 'It may help us ultimately understand what dark matter is made up of. Invisible particles known as dark matter make up 23 per cent of the mass of the universe. The mysterious matter represents a problem in astronomy because it is not understood. '[The study] shows that Newton's theory of gravity can be used out to the farthest reaches of a galaxy, and that there is no need to modify our theory of gravity,' Professor Chakrabarti added. Learning more about Galaxy X could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter, as well as current understanding about the Big Bang, the researchers claim. Existing theories correctly predict the distribution of distant galaxies. But the same theory also predicts hundreds of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way. Up until now, only only a few dozen have been found. Galaxy X could help uncover even more.","Galaxy was previously spotted by ripples in the Milky Way's outer disk .

"Taylor McDonnell, 21, (pictured outside an earlier court hearing) is accused of being 'grossly distracted' on her phone when she knocked down grandparents Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86 . A hairdresser was 'grossly distracted' using her mobile phone behind the wheel when she knocked down and killed a retired couple who were walking arm in arm, a court heard. Taylor McDonnell, 21, was driving her blue Toyota Aygo through the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales, when she ploughed into grandparents Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86. Newport Crown Court heard how McDonnell spent 18 minutes of her 20-minute drive making a series of phone calls while behind the wheel. Retired RAF airman Denis and teacher Joyce – who were married for 54 years - died from their injuries after being hit by McDonnell's car. They had been walking arm in arm during an evening stroll. The court heard how McDonnell was driving in slippers on her way to see her boyfriend when she hit the elderly couple. Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said McDonnell made 'four or five' phone calls while driving. She told the court: 'She was grossly distracted by her telephone. 'She wasn't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important.' The court heard how Mr and Mrs Drew were seen walking slowly together – both using walking sticks - on November 13, 2013. They were side by side as they walked across the quiet 30mph road outside a well-lit pub. Miss Crowther told the court: 'They had very nearly finished their crossing when they were hit by the blue Toyota Aygo being driven at around 30mph by the defendant. 'Mrs Drew was flung onto the bonnet and windscreen and part of her body struck the side of the car before she was thrown onto the verge. 'Mr Drew was hit by the car and run over. 'His legs were trapped underneath the car and he was dragged along the road for more than 16 metres until the car was stopped. 'The defendant didn't brake her car until she hit Mr and Mrs Drew. 'She didn't take any action to avoid the couple. 'She stopped her car and ran into the nearby public house for help.' The court heard that McDonnell thought she had hit a woman on her own and didn't realise Mr Drew was stuck under her car. Drinkers in the Star Inn recalled her running hysterically into the bar and screaming for help while clutching her iPhone in her hand. The court heard she said: 'I was driving along the road, I didn't even see her until she hit my windscreen.' Grandparents Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, were out for an evening stroll in the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales, when they were struck by McDonnell's blue Toyota Aygo and knocked to the ground . McDonnell denies two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and is on trial at Newport Crown Court . The crash happened on a quiet 30mph road in the village of Ponthir, near Caerleon, South Wales (pictured) Family and friends of the elderly couple wept as they listened to the heroic efforts of other motorists to comfort the stricken pair as they lay seriously injured on the ground. One driver discovered Mrs Drew lying on the verge with her 'clothes in disarray' and covered her with a fluorescent jacket. Miss Crowther said: 'The gentleman gave her basic first aid and could tell she was still alive. 'He stayed with her and talked to her and stroked her hair and held her hand. 'He comforted her, just to do what he could for someone clearly in extremis. 'As he did that he heard a groaning and could see Mr Drew was trapped beneath the car.' The court was told Mr Drew was able to speak to police officers and paramedics fighting to free him. 'He spent all the time asking about his wife,' Miss Crowther said. McDonnell (pictured left outside court, and right) was driving in her slippers and was on her way to visit her boyfriend, the court heard. Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said McDonnell made 'four or five' calls while driving . The prosecution said McDonnell (pictured), a hairdresser, admitted speaking on her telephone while driving but said she had been using the loudspeaker function when the crash occurred on November 13, 2013 . Mrs Drew died of her 'massive injuries' in Royal Gwent Hospital just a few hours later. Mr Drew was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures, lacerations and deep bruising he suffered, and he died in the same hospital six days later. Miss Crowther said McDonnell admitted speaking on her telephone but said she had been using the loudspeaker function when the crash occurred. However, she said the driver insisted she had been 'driving carefully and paying attention to the road' and there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision. Miss Crowther said: 'She said in essence she thought Mrs Drew had run out into the road ahead of her. 'We say her driving fell far below the standard of a reasonable and competent driver. McDonnell (pictured) insists she had been 'driving carefully and paying attention to the road' and there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision. Mr and Mrs Drew both died in hospital from their injuries . McDonnell (pictured), of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, was said to have run hysterically into a nearby pub and started screaming for help while clutching her iPhone in her hand following the crash, the court heard . McDonnell denies the charges against her and the trial at Newport Crown Court (pictured above) continues . 'Had she been paying attention to the road the least she could have done is slow down and try to avoid them, or have done something. 'But if you are on the telephone it makes it very hard to look out of the windscreen and see anything.' McDonnell, of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, denies two counts of causing death by dangerous driving.

"Rapist: Jason O’Dell was jailed two years ago after imprisoning his terrified victim for two weeks . A rapist serving a life sentence in prison managed to post an advert in a lonely hearts column, it was revealed today. Jason O’Dell was jailed two years ago after imprisoning his terrified victim for two weeks - repeatedly raping her, beating her and leaving her with broken ribs and a broken nose. The 45-year-old from Wymondham, Norfolk, stubbed out cigarettes on her body before forcing her to clean her own blood off the floor and dye her hair in a bid to cover up the assault. O’Dell - who has a long history of violence against women - has now sparked further outrage by announcing he is looking for love in the small ads of a biker’s magazine. Under the name ‘Biker Bloke’, the advert said: ‘45, Stocky build, serving life in prison, looking for penfriend, interests are live music, camping & rallies. ‘Write to Jason O’Dell, A7324AR, HMP Bure, Norwich, Norfolk, NR10 5GB.’ The Prison Service said an investigation had been ordered and the advert in ‘Back Street Heroes’ had now been removed. But this was not before it was first spotted by a woman whose friend was killed in a horrific murder - and she alerted the magazine. The woman said: ‘I know the people who run the magazine and told them about it. They were very concerned and won’t allow it to go in again. ‘I think it’s disgusting this man may leave prison with 100 addresses. I find it insulting to his victims that he has been allowed to do this.’ Looking for love: Under the name 'Biker Bloke', the advert said: '45, Stocky build, serving life in prison, looking for penfriend, interests are live music, camping & rallies' A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Any prisoner wishing to participate in a pen pal scheme must seek permission from the governor of the prison before they can do so. ‘There are clear instructions on the content of any correspondence, which can also be monitored. ‘If a member of the public receives unwanted mail from a prisoner and complains, we can and will prevent any further attempts to contact that person. ‘Robust measures are taken against anyone who flouts the rules. An investigation is being conducted into this instance and the advert has been removed.’ HMP Bure in Norfolk: The Prison Service said a probe had been ordered and the advert had been removed . O’Dell was convicted of three rapes, two counts of actual bodily harm and two counts of assault by beating at Norwich Crown Court. He was also found guilty of affray and damaging the victim’s property and was ordered in March 2013 to serve a minimum of nine years in jail. His victim told the court she had lost her job as a result of her ordeal and been forced to move away from her home. She said: ‘I only met him in July last year. I didn’t plan to get into a relationship with him but I was helpless against his mind games. ‘From the moment I met him, I had a feeling deep down that something bad was going to happen but didn’t know what to do to stop it. ‘I’m a strong person but he completely messed my head up.’ The court heard O’Dell had 20 previous convictions for 79 offences. In 2006 he was jailed for three years for regularly beating up another ex-girlfriend.","Jason O’Dell was jailed in 2013 after imprisoning victim for two weeks .

"While there's no prehistoric land hidden at the centre of our planet, as author Jules Verne imagined, the Earth's core may not at all be like what scientists have led us to believe. Geologists have discovered that the Earth's inner core - previously thought to be a solid lump of iron - may in fact have its own even smaller core within it. Using the seismic waves that reverberate across the planet after earthquakes, researchers have been able to gain new insight into what lies at the centre of our world. Researchers have found that the Earth's inner core has an interior structure of its own made of iron crystals that point in different directions, as can be seen marked by the blue lines in the diagram above . The findings could mean that our understanding of Earth's interior, and its history, will need to be rewritten. Scientists found that rather than a solid ball of iron lying within the molten mass of the outer core, the inner core changes in structure about half way through. They discovered a distinct inner inner core that is about half the diameter of what was believed to be the solid inner core, which is about the size of the moon. The Earth is made up of three major layers - the crust, the hot layer of magma known as the mantle and the core. Geologists have known for some time that the core is made of a liquid outer core of iron and nickel and a solid inner core. It is thought that the liquid outer core, which reaches 4,000 to 5,000 degrees C, is responsible for controlling the Earth's magnetic field and helps protect the planet from charged particles from the sun. Temperatures in the inner core, which is around 750 miles thick, reach between 5,000 and 7,000 degrees C, although the extreme pressures there means that the iron it is made from is solid. In 2004, scientists discovered that the inner core rotates in the liquid of the outer core surrounding it far faster than the Earth itself spins. They calculated that every 400 years or so it overtakes the spin of the rest of the planet and may help to explain why the north and south poles have 'wandered' over time. However, more recent research in 2011 has suggested that the inner core may spin slower than this - gaining just one degree on the rest of the Earth every million years or so. This easterly spin also helps to drive the rotation of the outer inner core in the opposite direction. It is this strange dynamic that generates the geomagnetic field that deflects potentially harmful particles from our planet. Professor Xianodong Song, a geologist at the University of Illinois, said the structure of two inner cores could help reveal new details about how the Earth first formed. He said: 'Even though the inner core is small - smaller than the moon - it has some really interesting features. 'The fact that we have two regions that are distinctly different may tell us something about how the inner core has been evolving. 'For example, over the history of the Earth, the inner core might have had a very dramatic change in its deformation regime. 'It might hold the key to how the planet has evolved.' The science fiction author Jules Verne speculated that there could be a hidden world, frozen in time, lying beneath our feet in his novel Journey to the Centre of the Earth. However, geologists have established that the Earth is made up of three major layers - the crust, the hot layer of magma known as the mantle and the core. They have known for some time that the core is made of a liquid outer core of iron and nickel and a solid inner core. But in the latest research, Professor Song and his colleagues from the Nanjing University in China, found that even this inner core is more complex than previously believed. While the iron crystals in the outer layers of the inner core are aligned in a north south direction, within the inner inner core they point roughly east to west. The researchers used the 'echo' of seismic waves that bounce around the planet after an earthquake to build up a picture of the Earth's interior. Arrays of sensors in locations around the world, including Venezuela and southeast China allowed the scientists to measure delays in the time it took for these to travel through the planet. The scientists used seismic data detected by sensors around the world shown above after earthquakes . Magma bursting to the surface like in the lava fountain above on Erta Ale, Ethiopia is from only the second layer of the Earth's interior but the planet has a complex structure with a solid metal core at its very centre . Rotating liquid and solid cores at the centre of the Earth create the planets magnetic field, illustrated above . They found that seismic waves that passed through the very centre of the planet showed interference very different from those that travelled through the rest of the core. They also found that the iron crystals in the inner-most core may also have very different crystal structures, meaning they have different properties. Professor Song said that it was likely that tectonic changes early in the Earth's history led to these different structures in the core. He said: 'It may tell us about how our planet formed, its history, and other dynamic processes of the Earth. 'It shapes our understanding of what's going on deep inside the Earth.'","Geologists have used earthquakes to study the interior of the Earth's core .

"Germany has rejected Greece's demands for £120billion in reparations for Second World War damages – adding there is ‘zero’ chance they will pay. New Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in his first major speech to parliament, yesterday said his country had a 'moral obligation' to claim repayment for a forced wartime loan and other reparations. Tsipras's anti-austerity Syriza party claims Germany owes it around 162billion euros ($183 billion) -- or around half the country's public debt, which stands at over 315billion euros. Scroll down for video . Germany has rejected new Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's  demands for £120billion in reparations for Second World War damages . The issue risks aggravating already strained ties between Athens and Berlin, as Tsipras bids to reverse austerity measures imposed by its international creditors. Greece had 'a moral obligation to our people, to history, to all European peoples who fought and gave their blood against Nazism,' Tsipras said to parliament. 'Our historical obligation is to claim the occupation loan and reparations'. But Germany's economy minister rejected the call today, insisting the matter was concluded with a signed treaty 25 years ago. Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Germany's vice-chancellor, said today: 'The likelihood is zero.' Germany's economy minister Sigmar Gabriel, left, with Chancellor Angela Merkel, said there is 'zero' chance Berlin will pay the reparations . Speaking at a gathering of his Social Democrats in Brandenburg state near Berlin, he added a line had been drawn under 'all these issues' in legal terms, 'at the latest' when the two former Germanys signed a treaty with the Allies in 1990 - which is considered the formal end of World War II. 'There's no sense continuing down this road,' he added. During the war, the Nazis occupied Greece for four years and forced the Greek central bank to give the Third Reich a loan that financially ruined the country. Figures from some sources in Athens put the amount still owed by Germany at around 162billion euros ($183 billion) - more than half the level of debt that Greece is currently struggling with. The demand for compensation was revived by a previous Greek government in 2013 but not pursued. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis (left) applauds Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras during his policy speech before the parliament in Athens . Prime Minister David Cameron has chaired a meeting about a possible Greek exit from the eurozone, while George Osborne last week warned the situation poses a risk to the UK's economic recovery . The two countries share a complex history that has complicated the debt debate. Greece was occupied by German troops in World War Two, an issue that has resurfaced since it has been forced to endure tough reforms in return for a financial bailout partly funded by euro zone partners. Many Greeks have blamed euro zone heavyweight Germany for the austerity, leading to the revival of a dormant claim against Berlin for billions of euros of war reparations. As part of a wider appeal to Europe for solidarity, Greece's new finance minister has suggested a parallel between his country and the rise of Nazism in a bankrupt Germany in the 1930s, referring to Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party. Gabriel referred to the ""Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany"", also known as the ""Two plus Four Treaty"" signed in September 1990, by the former West and East Germanys and the four World War Two allies just before German reunification. Greek soldiers gathered round captured Italian war supplies after the . fall of Koritza in 1941 . Nazi Germany launched a dual invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. Pictured, inhabitants from Salonique acclaim a German tank in April 1941 . Under its terms, the four powers renounced all rights they formerly held in Germany. For Berlin, the document, also approved by Greece among other states, effectively drew a line under possible future claims for war reparations. Germany thus denies owing anything more to Greece after the 115million deutsche marks it paid in 1960, one of 12 war compensation deals it signed with Western nations. But Athens has said it always considered that money as only an initial payment, with the rest of its claims to be discussed after German reunification, which eventually came in 1990. A finance ministry spokeswoman told reporters today that there was nothing new to add from the German side on the issue. By the end of April 1941, Axis forces had officially occupied Athens. Pictured, Greek Navy troops in 1942 . King George II of Greece, left, and Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas, right . At the outbreak of the war, Greek Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas tried to maintain neutrality, but Greece was increasingly subject to pressure from Italy. Greece entered the Second World War on October 28, 1940 after Italian dictator Benito Mussolini invaded in a bid to emulate Hitler's conquests. The conflict, known as the Greco-Italian war lasted until April 1941. Italian forces invaded the country after  Metaxas rejected Italy's demand to occupy Greek territory. As the Italian invasion stalled, Nazi Germany intervened and launched a dual invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia on April 6, 1941. By the end of April, Axis forces had officially occupied Athens, signalling the end of resistance from Greece. King George II and his government-in-exile fled to the Middle East a recall of food supplies caused in a terrible famine during the winter of 1941/19442, in which as many as 100,000 people died. In 1943, almost the entire Jewish population of Greece was deported to German death camps. Some 60,000 Greek Jews — more than three-quarters of the nation’s Jewish population — were rounded up and sent to their deaths in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. As was the case in European nations invaded by the Germans, the cost of the occupation was paid by the occupied country. Hitler’s troops helped themselves to everything, stealing goods and food to such a degree that hundreds of thousands of Greeks were left destitute and starving - and at least 300,000 Greeks died. Greece's economy was plundered through forced exports. This led in devastating inflation and a radically lower standard of living for Greeks. Then the Third Reich forced the Greek National Bank to lend Hitler's Germany 476million reichsmarks interest-free, bleeding the country dry. On March 14, 1942, a team of German and Italian lawyers, in the absence of any Greeks, signed an agreement obliging the Bank of Greece to provide Germany with the ‘war loan’. After Germany's defeat, the Allied powers organized the Paris Conference on Reparations in the autumn of 1945 where Greece laid claim to $10 billion.

"If someone asked you to name the only occasion lawmakers are permitted to drink alcohol in the British House of Commons, what would you say? Most Americans probably wouldn't know the answer. But one man will never forget it after he guessed incorrectly on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire - and lost $225,000. Journalist Justin Peters, whose episodes aired this week, wrote about the life-changing experience in a first-person column  for Slate. Scroll down for video . Journalist Justin Peters wrote about how losing $225,000 during Who Wants to be a Millionaire? changed his life by showing him he could take the risks needed to pursue his dreams . The night before the competition Peters told his sister that 'under no circumstances' would he quit and walk away with the money. It was million or bust. But that didn't make the defeat any less crushing . From the moment he decided to audition, Millionaire was a breeze for Peters. He had first appeared on the popular ABC game show as an in-studio lifeline for a friend who was competing on the show last summer. Producers loved the pair's banter so much that Peters sailed through the preliminary rounds - a trivia test, an interview and a practice game - when he decided to take a crack at the show for himself months later. Peters said he wasn't thinking about money when he decided to tryout for a spot in the hot seat. He just wanted to have some fun. And that's not much of a surprise. As the writer notes in his article, nobody has won a million dollars on the show since 2009. So it was easy for Peters to promise his sister the night before his appearance that he wouldn't quit and walk away with the money if he didn't know the answer. It was million or bust. As he talked out the choices with host Terry Crews, Peters decided the right answer had to be 'crowning a royal' because it was a 'celebratory occasion' But when it came time for Peters to play the game, he was a pro. He said the questions only seemed to get easier as the possible sum getting added to his bank account got higher. And as the love for Peters from the audience, producers and host Terry Crews continued to grow, so too did his confidence and excitement. 'At $100,000 I started laughing uncontrollably. At $250,000, I fell to the floor,' he wrote. 'In 15 minutes, after answering a couple of questions, I had become rich.' 'And now I was only two questions away from $1 million.' And then came the $500,000 question: 'Drinking alcohol in the British House of Commons is strictly forbidden at all times, with the single exception of a lawmaker doing what?' Peters said he immediately eliminated half of the choices, which was 'declaring war' and 'taking the oath of office'. But he was wrong - the only exception to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in the House of Commons is during the passing of a budget. Peters would only receive $25,000 . Peters said he realized that taking the gamble when there was such high stakes was a life lesson. And when he re-watched his performance on screen, he saw just how well he could command an audience and work a stage . That left him with only two more: 'crowning a royal' and 'passing a budget'. Peters would later find out that only two people have lost the $500,000 question in 10 years, noting 'it's very hard to justify gambling $225,000 on a hunch'. But Peters said he knew he was always going to gamble. What he didn't know at the time was that he was about to become the third person to lose the question. As he talked out the choices with Crews, Peters decided it had to be 'crowning a royal' because it was a 'celebratory occasion'. The host tried to remind Peters what he would lose if his guess was wrong but Peter's response was to ask, 'unreasonably cocky' he notes, what he would win if his guess was right. 'Let's make this a game, Terry,' he told Crews. Final answer? He was wrong. The only exception to the prohibition of drinking alcohol in the House of Commons is during the passing of a budget. Peters was out $225,000 in seconds. He would only receive $25,000. As the producers led Peters out of the studio they praised his engaging, fun and TV-worthy performance. Peters, an aspiring comedic actor and screenwriter, will use part of his winnings from the show to fund an upcoming tour with his comedic improv duo . One producer told the writer he was 'more of a man' that anyone she knew, before admitting he was the best contestant she'd ever had. But all Peters could think about was what he had just lost. An aspiring screenwriter and comedic actor, he had been hoping to use the money as a cushion so that he could finally pursue the dreams he'd put on the back burner for so long. Peters was so upset the night of the loss that he drove from New York to Boston to be with family. But he said it was the next day, as he walked around and ruminated on the experience, that he understood it was not about what he had lost - but what he could gain. Peters said he realized that taking the gamble when there was such high stakes could be a life lesson. It has proved to him that he had the courage to take risks, the kind that he had been too scared to take so far in his career. And when Peters re-watched his performance on screen, he saw just how well he could command an audience - how he could work a stage. Peters has decided he will spend the entire sum he received from Millionaire pursuing his dreams. For starters, he's taking his improv duo on tour.","Slate Journalist Justin Peters lost on a question about what occasion lawmakers were allowed to drink in the House of Commons .

"Ed Balls faced calls to 'come clean' about Labour's failure to tackle tax evasion while he was City Minister in the wake of revelations HSBC helped 7,000 wealthy Britons avoid millions of pounds in tax. Britain's biggest bank is alleged to have used its Swiss private banking arm to help their super-rich clients, including celebrities and royalty, to evade tax and also advised them how to stay one step ahead of UK tax law. The Tories and Lib Dems seized on the revelation to question the role of Mr Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007. But Labour responded with questions about why former HSBC boss Stephen Green was appointed a Tory peer and trade minister by David Cameron. The Tories and Lib Dems said the revelations raised questions about the role of Labour's Ed Balls, who was City Minister from May 2006 to June 2007. The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government . The banking documents which form the expose have now become the biggest banking leak in history, The Guardian reported. Among them are the revelations HSBC's Swiss bank allowed its clients to withdraw bricks of cash, allowed clients to conceal undeclared 'black accounts' and gave accounts to criminals and corrupt businessmen. HMRC says that £135million in tax, interest and penalties has now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. HSBC claims that since the documents were leaked, it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007. It was revealed after a whistleblower leaked details of 30,000 accounts holding £78billion between 2005 and 2007, with a quarter said to be held by Britons. Hollywood stars, royalty, Europe's richest families as well as relatives of dictators and people implicated in cases of African corruption are also said to held an account to help them evade tax. In one example, HSBC's Swiss bankers were prepared to help Emmanuel Shallop - a man later convicted of dealing in blood diamonds. Coalition ministers sought to pin the blame for the failure to act on the last Labour government, pointing the finger at Mr Balls. And former Labour minister Margaret Hodge appeared to admit there had been less enthusiasm for clamping down on tax avoidance under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown because there was no shortage of money. Speaking during a visit to Chester, David Cameron said: 'Stephen Green was an excellent trade minister, he did a good job. But I'd also add no Government has done more than this one to crackdown on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. 'I put it absolutely at the head of my G8 agenda, to make sure there's more tax transparency, the big companies pay their taxes properly and that we raise money from people previously evading and avoiding tax and will go on doing that as a Government.' Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today at Upton Heath County Primary School in Chester, defended his Government's record on tackling tax evasion . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'I think it would be great if Ed Balls for once or Ed Miliband would get up and admit that they let the banks run riot on their watch. ‘Ed Balls went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive to suck up to the banks and they now have the brass neck to somehow constantly accuse this government of not doing enough.’ The Lib Dem leader claimed his party had warned Mr Brown and Mr Balls that the lack of proper bank regulation was 'going to end in a car crash'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Ed Balls went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive to suck up to the banks, yet they now have the brass neck to somehow constantly accuse this government of not doing enough when we've done considerably more to try and straighten out the banks than Labour ever did. Labour MP Margaret Hodge said there was less pressure to tackle tax avoidance when the public finances 'were not under such tension' 'So, actually, I think it would be very helpful if he actually for once came clean and was honest about the fact that the banks went awry on all sorts of fronts during Labour's term in office.' Conservative Treasury minister David Gauke said Panorama 'throws a spotlight on the opportunities for tax evasion on the eve of the financial crash in 2007'. ‘Clearly HSBC have got questions to answer,’ he said. ‘In terms of Stephen Green, I don’t think there is any suggestion or any evidence that he was involved or engaged in some of the behaviour that occurred in the subsidiary in Switzerland.’ He added: 'It is for HSBC to explain what they did to ensure their clients complied with the tax law. But it is for the City Minister in years up to 2007, Ed Balls, to make an urgent statement about what he knew about all this and why the then government allowed tax avoidance and evasion to take place on such a scale. 'Since 2010 we have closed many of the loopholes exposed in this report and specifically taken action to get back money lost in Swiss Bank Accounts.' Mrs Hodge, the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said HMRC had not been sufficiently determined in tackling dodgy practices. She told BBC Radio 4': 'If it had been a benefit cheat it would have been up for court years ago. Now we have had only one tax cheat taken before the British courts.' But she admitted that many of the activities took place while Labour was in power. 'I think that times have changed and we have to move on. You have to remember in times past public finances were not under such tension, there weren't so many demands on them, you didn't have the deficit.' The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative Peer and appointed to the government. Lord Green was made a Minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a Minister of Trade and Investment until 2013. Lord Green told Panorama: 'As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.' Mr Balls said: 'There are very serious questions for George Osborne and David Cameron to answer today. 'Why, in the five years since this government was first given information about how HSBC helped people evade tax, has there only been one prosecution out of 1100 individuals identified? 'And why did they appoint the Chairman of HSBC as a Tory Minister eight months after the government was told about the bank's activities? 'Nobody will fall for yet more desperate distraction tactics from George Osborne and the Tories when it is clear that this information was first given to the government in 2010. 'That is why the Chancellor should come to the House of Commons and answer questions about this today.' In an urgent question in the Commons, shadow treasury minister Shabana Mahmood asked what information the Government had sought from him about the claims of tax avoidance made in 2010 before he was made a minister. Any failure to do so would be an 'inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility', she told MPs. She said: 'We need much more detail ... as to what the Government has been up to since they were made aware of this information.' Who had seen it in 2010, she asked, and what was done with it? Were ministers informed, she continued, and if not why? 'Any failure by this Government to question him [Lord Green] before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility,' she went on. Labour leader Ed Miliband told Sky News: 'I think this is a very serious situation and the Government has some serious questions to answer.' Mrs Hodge claimed Lord Green faced 'serious questions'. 'Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices,' Mrs Hodge said. 'Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer.' However, Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves insisted revelations about HSBC did not emerge until 2010, so it was not something that Mr Balls could have taken action on. HSBC is alleged to have helped wealthy customes hide their cash and assets from the government to avoid paying their full tax bills . Shadow financial secretary to the treasury Cathy Jamieson said: 'HMRC were made fully aware of these practices back in 2010. There are serious questions for the Chancellor to answer about why just one person out of over a thousand have been prosecuted in five years. 'And why the Government's Swiss tax deal has been such an embarrassing flop, raising a fraction of the amounts initially boasted of by ministers.' 'Tax avoidance and evasion harms every taxpayer in Britain, and undermines public services like the NHS.' Offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from HM Revenue and Customs. However, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is illegal. But even though 1,100 people who had not paid what they should have done were identified,  five years later only one person has been prosecuted. HSBC has today admitted wrongdoing in Switzerland but said that it has now 'fundamentally changed' since then. Claims the bank routinely used its Swiss operations to help clients shield their true value from the taxman were revealed by a BBC Panorama investigation. It found HSBC helped clients to hide money from domestic tax authorities in secret 'black' accounts. Accounts were held by the rich and powerful, as well as criminals and corrupt businessmen. Bank's staff allowed clients to withdraws large bundles of cash and emails reveal they were aware the account holders did so because they were 'under pressure from the  tax authorities'. Panorama will air on BBC1 tonight and has seen thousands of leaked accounts showing how bankers helped clients – nearly 7,000 of them British – to avoid taxes. Some account details were stolen by a computer hacker in 2007 and were presented to HMRC in 2010. Panorama spoke to a whistleblower who said HSBC had still failed to implement changes when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley, who was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg, said: 'The verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice.' She was sacked after raising concerns and an unfair dismissal tribunal ruled in her favour.","Tories and Lib Dems question role of Ed Balls who was City Minister 2006-7 .

"It's long been thought that chillies can help us lose weight. Now, new research has proved the fiery food can aid weight loss by speeding up metabolism. A study found capsaicin – the ingredient that gives chilli peppers their heat - could help burn off fat in the body. The temptation to eat fatty foods is often so strong that, for many, they can't resist eating fatty or sugary foods even if they are trying to cut down on calories. Scroll down for video . Feel the burn: A chemical compound found in chilli peppers could help prevent obesity - as it speeds up metabolism and helps the body burn off fat, researchers found . Now, researchers believe capsaicin could provide a solution to this problem; speeding up the metabolism without the need to restrict the diet. University of Wyoming researchers found capsaicin may stimulate the body to burn energy and create heat (a process known as thermogenesis) – burning off calories in the process. It does this by activating receptors in the body which set off the process of energy burning. These receptors are found in white and brown fat cells. In the body, white fat cells soak up calories and store them as fat – the dreaded type visible in pot bellies, love handles and wobbly thighs that is the enemy of dieters. It is known as ‘bad’ fat for this reason. Brown fat, found in small amounts on the shoulders and neck, actually burns fat to heat the body – and is therefore known as ‘good’ fat. The researchers found that capsaicin in the diet was able to stimulate a receptor called potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel protein. Activating this receptor suppresses obesity associated with a high-fat diet, the researchers found. They believe this is because it induces ‘bad’ white fat cells to become energy-burning ‘good’ brown fat cells. The researchers carried out the study on one group of wild mice, and another group of mice who had been genetically engineered to lack the TRPV1 Receptor. Metabolism-boosting: Capsaicin, which gives chilies their heat, sped up metabolism by inducing 'bad' white fat to turn into 'good' brown fat, which creates heat and burns calories . They fed both mice a high fat diet, 0.01 per cent was made up of capsaicin. Capsaicin prevented the weight gain associated with eating a high fat diet in the wild mice, but not the mice that lacked TRPV1. It did this without having any effect on how much food or water the mice consumed. ‘It did significantly increase the metabolic activity and energy expenditure in wild type mice fed a high-fat diet, but not for mice that genetically lack TRPV1,’ researcher Vivek Krishnan, of University of Wyoming’s School of Pharmacy said. This is because the fiery ingredient induces ‘bad’ white fat to become ‘good’, energy-burning brown fat and also stimulates the body to create heat, he added. A chemical compound found in spicy curries could help reduce the risk of developing bowel cancer, a study has found. Researchers gave capsaicin, which gives chilli peppers their heat, to mice genetically prone to developing multiple tumours in their gastrointestinal tract. The capsaicin triggered a pain receptor in the cells lining their intestines, setting off a reaction that reduced the risk of growing colorectal tumours. Scientists found that the treatment extended the lifespan of the mice by more than 30 per cent. These steps burn off calories and counteract obesity. This may help to prevent and manage obesity and other related health complications such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular diseases, the researchers said. However, they added this effect has not yet been demonstrated in carefully-controlled clinical trials. Next, the researchers want to further understand the mechanism by which capsaicin prevents obesity, and carry out more trials to further prove that it can help manage weight. They will concentrate on developing drugs which activate the TRPV! Receptors, to help prevent obesity – and carry out human clinical trials - they said. They are even developing a ‘nanoparticle-based sustained-release formulation of capsaicin’ in the laboratory currently, and have submitted a patent application for this. A third of the world’s population is currently overweight or obese, according to World Health Organization’s estimates. This staggering statistic has made finding ways to address obesity a top priority for many scientists around the globe. The research was presented during the Biophysical Society’s 59th Annual Meeting in Baltimore, U.S.","Capsaicin - which gives chillies their heat - could help prevent obesity .

"Hundreds of parents have been forced to miss work to look after their children after a flagship academy school announced it would be closing for three days because so many of its teachers are off sick. St Aldhelm's Academy, in Poole, Dorset, closed with just a few hours' notice on Thursday because nine members of staff – which equates to a quarter of the teaching staff – called in sick. Most of the absent teachers have been affected by 'winter viruses' while 'one or two' are suffering from stress, the school said. It added that it would not open until Wednesday at the earliest - meaning it will be closed for at least three school days. St Aldhelm's Academy, in Poole, Dorset (pictured), closed with just a few hours' notice on Thursday because nine members of staff called in sick. The school has said it will not re-open until Wednesday at the earliest . The school, which last year lost £1.1million after falling for a simple email scam, closed to all but its Year 11 and Sixth Form pupils because of the shortages, forcing disgruntled parents to arrange last-minute childcare. A text message was sent to parents at 9.45pm last Thursday warning them of the following day's closure. Yesterday, parents were told the school - which caters for 469 pupils aged 11 to 19 - would not reopen to students until Wednesday at the earliest. It also emerged that several Year 11 students who did turn up on Friday were sent home because they weren't wearing school uniform. A spokesman for school sponsor the Diocese of Salisbury said it had taken the decision to shut the school after 'exhausting all other options'. The spokesman added that the Diocese of Salisbury was merely an interim sponsor of the school until a new, permanent sponsor came forward. He said: 'At present, nine staff are absent due to illness. We are working hard, with the support of the Department for Education to recruit supply teachers to ensure the school reopens fully. 'Our primary concern has always been the welfare and attainment of students at the Academy, and we remain committed to working with any future permanent sponsor to ensure as smooth a transition as possible.' However, parents slammed the academy's administration at an emergency meeting organised by residents' group Bourne Valley Action Group. Dawn Cummings, whose 15-year-old daughter Kyra Bartlett attends the school, said: 'I think it's disgusting. It's Kyra's GCSE year and she is willing to knuckle down and study but gets to school and there are no teachers. 'There has been lots of empty promises and meetings but they've all come to nothing. It's so frustrating because it's totally out of my hands. I can't send her to a different school because it's her last year.' Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West (right), joined furious parents at a hastily-arranged meeting in which they slammed the academy's administration and its decision to close the school over teacher sickness . The school, which is one of the worst performing in the country and faces calls for permanent closure, said it had been forced to close after 'exhausting all other options'. Pictured above: Interim principal Amanda Bibby . Parents have also taken to message boards to vent their anger and frustration at the school, which is one of the worst-performing in the country. Kerry Forward said: 'This is unbelievable, this school is failing all its pupils.' Jenny Garry wrote: 'Have some clever students hacked this account lol - surely they can't have that many staff off sick!' And Matt Moses added: 'The school is so unorganised (sic), they need to sort themselves out and start doing some teaching.' A letter to parents from Gerry Lynch, spokesman for the Diocese of Salisbury, which was sent yesterday, said: 'I regret to inform you that, as a number of staff remain absent due to illness, Years 7-10 at St Aldhelm's Academy will remain closed on Monday 9 February and Tuesday 10 February. 'Year 11 and the Sixth Form will remain open as normal. 'I apologise for the inconvenience this will undoubtedly cause many of you. It is a decision we have only taken after exhausting all other options. 'We will review the state of play on Tuesday and I will write to you early on the afternoon of Tuesday 10 February to keep you informed of further developments. St Aldhelm's Academy students Kyra Bartlett, 15 (left) and Courtney Sherman, 16 (right), with Kyra's mother Dawn Cummings (centre) who found out about the closure via a late night text message . 'In the meantime school work can be downloaded from the learning links on the academy website.' The school was one of the first in the country to be given academy status in 2012 by former education secretary Michael Gove. However, it is now facing permanent closure following a string of setbacks. It was first was put into special measures in 2000 when it was known as Rossmore Community College. Inspectors warned it to improve in 2008 following an unsatisfactory report and in 2011 it recorded the country's worst GCSE results, with just three per cent of students scoring the bench-mark five A*-C GCSE grades including English and maths. The school improved its scores in 2012 and 2013 but it was put into special measures in December last year after inspectors gave it the lowest possible rating. They said performance at the school had 'declined substantially since the previous inspection' and slammed staff for teaching up to five different lessons in the same classroom at the same time. Last year the school sensationally lost £1.1million when finance staff fell for an email scam asking for details of its bank account. The staff sent the details without questioning the email, allowing the con-artist to withdraw money from the account. Bournemouth University was a co-sponsor of the school alongside the Diocese but pulled out in June last year. Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, has now called for new governors to be installed at the school in a desperate bid to turn it around - but said closing the school permanently must be considered. He said: 'We need ground zero now. We must step right back and refocus on the situation. Every option has got to be on the table, whether it's closure, splitting the campus so St Aldhelm's becomes a studio school or bringing in a new sponsor. 'There is no difference in my judgement between the calibre and talent of the students who go into the Bourne Academy and those who go into St Aldhelm's. Something is fundamentally, unacceptably wrong there. 'What we need is a new governing body, because the old governing body are inextricably linked to the previous failure, and a new sponsor who is absolutely committed to the academy and it just needs to happen quickly.' A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We are aware that the Diocese of Salisbury has temporarily closed St Aldhelm's Academy. 'The regional schools commissioner is working closely with the school and its sponsor to ensure that an appropriate plan is in place so that pupils' education can resume as soon as possible.' Dame Sally Coates, who is now a government adviser, rewarded teachers who took no sick days by giving them bottles of wine and book tokens . A former headteacher cracked down on the number of sick days taken by staff at her school by offering them bottles of wine and book tokens for good attendance. Dame Sally Coates, who is now a government adviser, rewarded teachers who took no sick days by giving them incentives as part of her crackdown on recurrent absences. While working at Burlington Danes Academy, in Hammersmith, west London, she also cut a third of the teaching staff and vowed to cut the £150,000-a-year bill for supply teachers – who were drafted in to cover sick days. Prior to her taking over running of the school, staff had been told to ring a dedicated 'cover phone' if they were going to be off sick. However, Dame Sally immediately pulled the plug on the phone and advised all staff they would have to phone the senior vice-principal before 7am if they planned to have the day off ill. She said it allowed her to overhear their reasons for being off ill, and clamped down after hearing some of the excuses. She told The Times: 'I would hear him [senior vice-principal] negotiating with staff. Often he would ask just how sick they were. 'How severe a headache? Have you taken a paracetamol?

"Hilary Devey has claimed the £1,250 a day she was paid for appearing on Dragons' Den was a 'pittance' Dragons' Den star Hilary Devey has claimed the show paid its dragons a 'pittance' of £1,250 a day and the money was not enough to cover her expenses while working on the programme. Devey was a dragon on the BBC show from 2011-12, but has bemoaned the pay rate of £15,000 for 12 episodes and claimed the only way to make money was through the investment opportunities the show offered. The 57-year-old, who launched her freight distribution company Pall-Ex in 1996 to fund her son Mevlit’s education, made her first million within three years and is now worth an estimated £100million. When asked how much she was paid for her work on the programme, she told The Telegraph it was a 'pittance'. She said: 'I can’t remember precisely but it’s something like £15,000 to do 12 episodes – and each episode means a 14 to 15-hour day. 'It doesn’t even cover your expenses. You make your money out of what you invest in.' A payment of £1,250-a-day would equate to a rate of £89 an hour if earned across a 14 hour day. But despite her complaints, the entrepreneur admitted she would consider returning to the show if asked. She said she hoped to extend her investment portfolio - but added it would depend on who the other dragons were. The show's current dragons are Deborah Meaden, Duncan Bannatyne, Kelly Hoppen, Peter Jones and Piers Linney. However, Hoppen, Linney and Bannatyne are all stepping down at the end of this season. It has now been claimed lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone is set to star in the show as a replacement for one of the three vacant seats. A show source has said the timing is finally right for her to join the BBC business programme. The  source told the Sunday People: 'It's never been the right time for Michelle to join Dragons' Den, she's always had too much going on to devote her full attention to the show. 'But now she feels it's the right time to finally say yes to the role. The news is music to BBC bosses ears. 'They are desperate to bring on board a big name like Michelle.'

"Gone are the Hollywood waves of award seasons past as last night's BAFTA and Grammy awards saw many celebs opt for a chin-skimming hairdo. Kim Kardashian led the charge, swapping her long ebony locks for a  side-parted, messy shoulder-length 'do that framed her perfectly made-up face. And Rosamund Pike, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry were all among the red-carpet starlets to forsake their flowing tresses in favour of the fuss-free wavy bob, dubbed the 'wob'. Scroll down for video . Kim Kardashian abandoned her famous ebony tresses in favour of a sultry 'wob' at the Grammy awards . Katy Perry gave the trend a pop of colour with her bright lilac coloured tresses at the Grammys and British beauty Jenna Coleman kept hers practical at the BAFTAs by pinning the stylish bob but letting tendrils fall around her face. Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike - who recently showcased an undercut beneath her wob - swept her hair to the side, and tucking one side behind an hear. The flattering hairstyle perfectly accessorised with her simple black halterneck gown and showed off her emerald and diamond earrings. The wob look has already seen several A-listers convert from their flowing hair to short and sweet and Beyonce and Sienna Miller were early adopters of the low-maintenance 'do. Taylor Swift has long been a convert of the bob and was championing the trend at last night's Grammys, while fellow blonde Rosamund Pike joined the trend for the choppy hair style at the BAFTAs . Katy Perry made the wob trend personal by dying tresses a bold lilac and sweeping hair over to one side . Cut to chin-length, the red carpet crop is easily identifiable by its loose, textured waves, rather than a sleek, polished finish. Luke Hersheson, who created Sienna Miller's cut, told The Times how he achieved the  actress's new style: 'I didn't want it to look like she'd been to an expensive hairdresser. It almost looks as if it has grown into itself and become that way without the help of a hairdresser.' Built on an undercut, wob tendrils are chopped to look like torn, untreated ends, which can then be scrunched up to create messy waves. Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman kept her wavy bob practical by clipping it back at the BAFTAs . British presenter Claudia Winkleman (left), added her signature heavy fringe to her wob hairstyle and French actress Lea Seydoux (right) also favoured the un-fussy look at the BAFTAs last night . The deliberately messy, soft cut is a far cry from the sleek bob or elaborate up-dos we're used to seeing on the red carpet. One of the pioneers of loose hair textures and messy chic is Alexa Chung who rarely wears her scruffy-chic style below her chin. George Northwood, the man behind Alexa's wob, said: 'Women want to look like they've made no effort. 'A good, undone cut is the secret - chopped into, so it's easier to manage.' To create the red carpet wob at home, he recommended trying salt spray or touching up the bottom pieces with a curling iron for that coveted tousled look. Other celebrity fans of the laid-back hairstyle include Dame Helen Mirren (left) and Beyonce (right) Kristen Stewart (left) and Lily Collins (right) sport the youthful  choppy style, perfect for red carpet dressing . Alexa Chung and Kerry Washington model the hairstyle which is identifiable by its loose, textured waves .

"A Singaporean national faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted of smuggling exotic fish worth more than $300,000 into Australia. Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) busted the plan to bring the fish into Adelaide when they inspected the traveller's luggage, uncovering up to 20 plastic bags. The investigation began when officers apprehended the suspect at Adelaide Airport, on a flight from Singapore. Inside each bag they found a number of live and dead endangered fish listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). A plastic bag containing seven rare fish which was allegedly found inside the luggage of a Singaporean man . According to The Adelaide Advertiser, Kuok Weai Alex Chang appeared in the local Magistrates Court by video link. The publication reported that prosecutor Elim Chan told the court: 'There are international investigations under way and the current charges may well not be the final ones' she said. A statement from Customs said that 'officers referred the fish to officers from the Department of Agriculture, who valued the fish at over $300,000'. A joint operation involving the local police and environmental authorities conducted further investigations, revealing that 'the man had wider links to this trade'. Raids were undertaken at two more Adelaide premises, where more prohibited fish were uncovered, including one Asian Arowana, valued at almost $30,000. Police prosecutors will allege that the man's luggage contained up to 20 plastic bags filled with fish, some alive and others dead. They're believed to be worth up to $300,000 . The owner was arrested and was bailed to also appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court. ACBPS Regional Commander Central Region, James Watson, said illicit wildlife trafficking was a horrible trade, but that working together with partner agencies was the best way to stop it. 'These arrests should send a strong message to anyone involved in wildlife smuggling; Customs and Border Protection is serious about working with our law enforcement partners to target you,' Mr Watson said. Department of Agriculture’s Compliance Division head Raelene Vivian said any importation of live animals increased the bio-security risk that exotic pests and diseases could be introduced that would damage Australia’s environment, fisheries and economy. 'When Australia’s import rules aren’t followed then risks go unchecked and put our precious aquatic and marine life as well as our $2.3 billion fisheries industry in real jeopardy,' Ms Vivian said. 'Our bio-security officers are always on the lookout for intentional non-compliance and when we detect it we work across government to put an end to it.'","Singaporean man caught allegedly trying to bring in $300,000 worth of exotic fish in his luggage .

"Resplendent in a revealing black corset, a pair of fishnet tights and a racy pair of thigh-high boots, the red carpet at last night's Grammys provided Madonna  with the opportunity for yet another headline-grabbing stunt. Never one to shy away from flashing the flesh, the mother-of-four turned and cheekily hoisted her Givenchy skirt for the benefit of waiting photographers before sashaying off. Once inside Los Angeles' Staples Centre, the 56-year-old began posting snaps on her Instagram page, posing happily with Jay-Z and rapper Nas before sharing a risqué shot of her cleavage. Scroll down for video . Risque: Madonna picked a typically revealing ensemble for her appearance at last night's Grammys . Like Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Katy Perry, Madonna is a past master at generating publicity but, unlike the twenty-something starlets, at 56, the Queen of Pop is a middle-aged industry veteran with a career that stretches back to the 1980s. She is also a mother of four, with an eldest child, Lourdes, now 18, who has just begun studying music, theatre and dance at the University of Michigan. Son Rocco, from her second marriage to British film director Guy Ritchie, is now 14 and no stranger to controversy himself, having caused a storm in October when he posted a video purporting to show IS terrorists executing children on his Instagram page. His mother, in typically bombastic fashion, hit back at critics, telling the world that she was 'proud' of the teenager who was, she added, 'fighting for freedom'. Such antics, while unsurprising in a teenager, have also become a feature of Madonna's own forays into social media, along with scores of racy photos. Typical: Aged 56, Madonna has no intention of hanging up her corsets and fishnets just yet . Cheeky: Madonna took the opportunity to generate a few headlines with a bottom-flash for the paps . The latter proved the source of the most recent Twitter storm to engulf her, after she caused fury by posting pictures of iconic public figures such as Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela with bondage tape photoshopped onto their faces. In the ensuing furore, she was accused of both racism and narcissism - both of which she took to social media to deny. 'I'm sorry. I'm not comparing my self to anyone. I'm admiring and acknowledging there Rebel Hearts (sic)'. She added: 'This is niether a crime or an insult or racist! I also did it with Michael jaclson and frida khalo and marilyn monroe (sic).' 'Am I saying I am them NO I'm saying they are Rebel Hearts too. And I didn't do it My fans did And I just re posted those photos My fans aren't racist either If they put me in the same category as these other people Thank you.' Racy: The 56-year-old star posted this cleavage-baring snap from inside the Staples Centre . Established: Unlike Miley Cyrus and co, Madonna, pictured with Jay-Z (l) and Nas (r), doesn't need publicity . 'I'm very flattered and I hope one day to live up to 1 100th of what those people accomplished.' But while Madonna's forays into social media are sometimes ill-advised, when it comes to her wardrobe, the 56-year-old remains as outrageous as she was in the 80s. The video for her most recent single, Rebel Heart, saw her gyrating in the midst of a group of horned dancers wearing the skimpiest of sequinned corsets. Last week, she was spotted shopping in New York wearing yet another corset, this time a sheer black lacy number that left little to the imagination. Just before Christmas, the 56-year-old went even further and posed topless for Interview magazine,  trussed up in a front-less bra and yet another corset. Ironically, the shoot was unveiled shortly after she criticised Kim Kardashian for doing the same thing, a week earlier, in Paper magazine. Posting yet another topless photo of herself on Instagram, she added: 'Its confusing. Nipples are considered forbidden and provocative but exposing your ass is not. #flummoxed (sic).' All very Miley Cyrus, the twenty-something popstar who has made her name by twerking enthusiastically in a variety of revealing outfits, while sharing her (often) controversial views with her followers on Twitter. Family: Madonna is mother to four children, including Lourdes and Rocco (left) and David Banda (right) Controversial: She recently caused a Twitter storm after posting a photo of Princess Diana in bondage tape . Striking a pose: Just before Christmas, she starred in a topless photo shoot for Interview magazine . But Madonna is no twenty-something, however much she might like to be, and in David Banda, nine, and Mercy James, eight, has two very young children at home. Their lives have been shared with a succession of boyfriends, few of whom have lasted more than a year or two, and all of whom have been considerably younger. Just before her 56th birthday last August, Madonna split with the latest - 26-year-old Timor Steffens who had, rather unromantically, likened her to his mother. The eight-month fling with Steffens followed a three-year relationship with another backing dancer, 26-year-old Brahim Zaibat. Zaibat, like Madonna's most famous ex, Guy Ritchie, was slammed by the singer on one of the tracks on her latest album. In the song, entitled Unapologetic B***h, she allows herself a chuckle at the dancer's sexual prowess as well as mocking his lack of wealth. Controversial: Madonna with Miley Cyrus, who has managed to pull off several controversies of her own . Quirky: She has always had an eclectic approach to getting dressed and has no intention of toning it down . Scanty: For her on stage appearance at the Grammys, Madonna chose yet another revealing outfit . Inspiration: The short red number was seemingly inspired by Spanish matadors . The song contains the lyrics: 'I know you'd like it if I stayed home and cried. But that ain't gonna happen, here's the reason why: When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied. Another line boasted: 'I'm popping bottles that you can't even afford. I'm throwing parties and you won't get in the door.' The track has a reggae-themed chorus, which Madonna ends with an expletive-filled rant against her former lover, with the line: 'You know you never really know how much your bulls**t cost me, but f**k you.' So will the Queen of Pop ever change? Based on  recent comments about being obsessed with death and wanting to live in the moment, it would seem unlikely. 'I became very obsessed with death,' she confided in the December issue of Interview Magazine, 'and the idea that you never know when death will arrive. 'So one has to do as much as possible all the time to get the most out of life.' And, whether it means never-ending corsets, regular social media spats or hordes of toy boys, Madonna is certainly doing that. From the moment she burst onto the scene in 1985's Desperately Seeking Susan, Madonna has never been afraid to raise eye-brows with a raunchy outfit. Here are some of the most memorable: . First look: Madonna debuted her love of short and sweet ensembles in 1985's Desperately Seeking Susan . Enter the corset: Madonna, seen performing in Leeds during her 1987 Who's That Girl tour, loves a corset . Iconic: Her Jean Paul Gaultier corset, created for the 1990 Blonde Ambition tour, has become iconic . Naughty: Madonna's love of a skimpy outfit was well established as her 1993 Girlie Show tour got underway . Spot the difference! Madonna's red carpet style, seen here in 2013 (left) and 1991 (right), is little changed . Skimpy: Stage outfits, including those from the 2008 Sticky and Sweet tour, remain as racy as ever . Favourite: As with each of her tours, the publicity pictures for Sticky and Sweet saw Madonna don a corset . Raunchy: In 2009, Madonna branched out, teaming her thigh-high boots with a see-through shirt instead . Shocking: In 2012, Madonna, back in her corset, shocked when she was seen swigging bourbon on stage . Old favourite: Last night's Givenchy get-up was typical of Madonna, as were the fishnets and boots .","Madonna flashed her bottom at photographers during Grammy appearance .

"On trial: Brustholm Ziamani, 19, was arrested while carrying a 12-inch knife and a hammer and planned to behead a soldier because he idolised Lee Rigby's killers, the Old Bailey heard today . A teenager who idolised Lee Rigby’s extremist killers was caught with a hammer and knife on his way to behead a soldier, a court heard yesterday. Muslim convert Brustholm Ziamani, 19, had already been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences but was released on bail to roam the streets. Just weeks later he was found in East London with a 12-inch knife and a pick hammer wrapped in an Islamic flag after boasting to his ex-girlfriend how he was going to ‘kill soldiers and government people’ in ‘another Lee Rigby’. Following his arrest Ziamani is said to have laughed about the Rigby atrocity and later calmly told prison officers: ‘I was on my way to kill a British soldier at an Army barracks. I was going to behead the soldier and hold his head in the air so my friend could take a photograph.’ He claimed he ‘loved’ Michael Adebolajo and once handed out leaflets with the murderer who hacked Fusilier Rigby to death outside Woolwich barracks in May 2013, jurors at the Old Bailey were told. Ziamani, said to be obsessed with the video war game Call of Duty, was initially arrested on June 27 last year at his home in Camberwell, South London, after trawling websites on martyrdom and researching ‘military targets’, it was alleged. Officers found a chilling five-page letter that the Muslim convert had written for his Christian family he had turned his back on, boasting that he planned to ‘do a 9/11 and 7/7 and Woolwich all in one day’. He warned: ‘You want war you got it. British soldiers heads will be removed and burned, u cannot defeat the Muslims. We love to die the way you love to live.’ He wrote to his ‘beloved parents’ saying he had become a ‘changed person’ weeks after converting to Islam, adding: ‘I will wage war against the British government on this soil, the British Government will have a taste ov there (sic) own medicine they will be humiliated. 'This is ISIB, Islamic States of Ireland and Britain.’ A court sketch of Ziamani made today as the prosecutors told the jury of a series of posts the teenager made appearing to glorify Islamic extremism . Copycat: Ziamani's 'ambition' was to allegedly carry out an attack like one one in Woolwich carried out by extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, left and right, who killed Drummer Rigby . The court heard Ziamani researched the locations of Army barracks across south London . He added: ‘HAHAHAHAHAHA Looool [laugh out loud]!! Lee Rigby is burnin in hell. Woow I’m dying good for him. This is what you get for voting Cameron and democracy. My brothers who are Lee Rigby’s killers are in prison getting food, clothes and shelter and its being paid for by Lee Rigby’s family. HAHA.’ Police found Ziamani had spent hours looking at the London Irish Rifles Association in Camberwell and Lewisham Army Cadets in Blackheath and had allegedly posted a series of Facebook rants about the conflicts in Iraq and Syria. Yet officers released him on bail and just three weeks later on August 19 he was stopped by police by chance in Whitechapel, East London. The court heard efforts by the Government’s counter-terrorism programme Prevent to engage with Ziamani failed as he told officers it was ‘too late’ to stop him being radicalised. Research: Ziamani researched the murder of Lee Rigby (pictured) and saw one of the Fusilier's killers as a 'hero', the court heard . While on bail, jurors were told, he continued to post online messages, saying: ‘You can sit at home and play Call of Duty or you can come out here and respond to the real call of duty… the choice is yours.’ On July 25 last year he allegedly wrote: ‘It’s a shame Hitler never finished his job.’ Yesterday his ex-girlfriend told how the ‘sporty and adventurous’ youth who enjoyed parkour – also known as free running – changed just weeks after they first met through Facebook in March last year. She described how Ziamani had ditched his jeans for Islamic robes and ranted about wanting to die a martyr and referred to Adebolajo as a ‘legend’, she claimed. Frightened, she broke off their relationship but he turned up at her home hours before his arrest in August to show her a black rucksack containing a knife and a hammer, saying he was planning ‘another Lee Rigby’, she said. The 17-year-old girl told the court: ‘I asked why he had these and he said he was planning to kill a soldier or a member of the Government. He said, “Me and the brothers are planning a terrorist attack.” ’ Ziamani also showed her videos named ‘ISIS Terrorist Post Hollywood Style Killing Spree’, it was said. Detectives discovered Ziamani had researched how to get to France via the Eurotunnel, despite strict bail conditions. He also told officers he admired radical preachers including Abu Hamza and Anjem Choudary. Annabel Darlow, prosecuting, said Ziamani saw Adebolajo as a ‘hero and role model’. She added: ‘His [Ziamani’s] hatred of non-believers, extreme beliefs and interest in violent jihad began to crystallise into a plan to attack a member of the British military forces.’ Ziamani denies planning a terrorist attack. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Brustholm Ziamani, 19, researched  army bases to find victim, court told .

"This was the satellite photo which shamed North Korea by showing how the people of the hermit kingdom endure inky blackness at night. But now the hermit kingdom's propaganda machine has hit back, proclaiming that the stoic workers of the People's Republic have no need for 'flashy lights'. A recent editorial in the Rodong Sinmun, North Korea's tightly leashed newspaper of record, also says the photo represents the future of the U.S. - 'an old superpower that is meeting its sunset'. Conspicuous by its absence: North Korea is clearly visible by its lack of lighting at night-time, in this image of the Korean peninsula taken from the International Space Station and circulated by Nasa last year . The famous photo, in circulation for more than a year, captures the bright lights of South Korea and China, including South Korean capital Seoul as the brilliant splash of white and sodium orange close to the border. By contrast, North Korea's city lights are conspicuous by their absence, with the whole country appearing to vanish at night save for a small blob shining from Pyongyang, the seat of power. The Wall Street Journal's Korea Realtime blog unearthed Rodong Sinmun's reference to the picture, in a 4,000-word editorial that reporter Alistair Gale describes as 'a standard hyperbolic North Korean screed'. Under the heading 'Right in front of our eyes' - a reference to a quote from Kim Jong Un, of course - the Rodong Sinmum exhorts North Korea's workers to follow the orders of their leaders to build a great and prosperous nation. 'They [North Korea’s detractors] clap their hands and get loud over a satellite picture of our city with not much light, but the essence of society is not on flashy lights,' it declares, according to WSJ's translation. It points out that the U.S. is beset by problems including massive debts, the Occupy Wall Street protests and the uprising of Black Americans following the shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. Those failings, according to the paper, show that 'an old superpower that is meeting its sunset may put up a face of arrogance but it can’t avoid its dark fate.' Bright lights, big city... Youths march in Pyongyang to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of Korea's 'revolutionary armed forces'. Pyongyang is the only North Korean city visible from space at night . First published in January last year, the satellite photo snapped from the International Space Station provoked comment on North Korea's failure to light its territory, compared to its highly developed neighbours. A Nasa Earth Observatory spokesman said at the time: 'North Korea is almost completely dark compared to neighboring South Korea and China. 'The darkened land appears as if it were a patch of water joining the Yellow Sea to the Sea of Japan. Its capital city, Pyongyang, appears like a small island, despite a population of 3.26 million (as of 2008). The light emission from Pyongyang is equivalent to the smaller towns in South Korea. 'Coastlines are often very apparent in night imagery, as shown by South Korea’s eastern shoreline. But the coast of North Korea is difficult to detect.' The Nasa statement went on to point out the difference in per capita power consumption between the two countries, with South Koreans consuming nearly 14 times as much as their cousins north of the DMZ. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un talksto officers during his visit to a dockyard: Satellite pictures have also been used to keep track of North Korea's nuclear weapons programme, which experts fear has restarted . Satellite pictures have not only been used to point out the lack of development in North Korea. Last month experts cited newly relesed images to suggest the country may be attempting to restart its main nuclear bomb fuel reactor. When fully operational, the five-megawatt facility is reported to be capable of producing about six kilos of plutonium a year - enough for a nuclear bomb. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests, and recently threatened a fourth amid tensions over fresh U.S. sanctions and UN moves to censure Pyongyang for its human rights record.","Hermit kingdom hits back at satellite image a year after its first publication .

"Airlines should be forced to warn passengers when someone with a nut allergy is on board, the government will be urged today. Ministers are facing calls to introduce mandatory pre-flight announcements about allergies of passengers alongside warnings about wearing seatbelts and emergency exits. Campaigners believe most passengers would be willing to avoid eating nuts and other food which could trigger an allergic reaction, but do not know unless airline staff tell them. DUP MP Ian Paisley (left) will use a Commons debate tonight to call on aviation minister Robert Goodwill (right) for mandatory warnings to be issued on all domestic flights and those arriving in the UK . Fears about the impact of passengers eating nuts mid-flight have been raised after a number of cases in which young children have gone into anaphylactic shock. Some airlines will make an announcement to passengers but it can vary between carriers, and even depending on flight attendants. DUP MP Ian Paisley will us a Commons debate tonight to call for the government to act to force airlines to issue standardised warnings on all domestic flights and those arriving and leaving Britain. It follows a campaign by his constituent Helena Erwin, whose daughter Emily has a severe nut allergy. She wants allergy warnings to be a legal requirement, and has called on the Civil Aviation Authority to act. Mr Paisley told MailOnline: 'About one in 50 people have some sort of allergy. On that basis, we need to get some consistency in the way announcements are made. 'If you are going on a flight, if you are a parent on a flight with a child with an allergy, I want those announcements to be made. 'There should be standard message in the same way as seatbelts and safety. 'I have never heard of a case where someone has eaten nuts in front of people who have an allergy, unless you are a particularly repulsive person. 'Nuts appear to be the big problem the only way you can avoid it is to get away from the environment, but on a plane you cannot do that.' Last month schoolboy Daniel Levitan was barred from boarding a U.S. plane after his mother Judith asked for a tannoy announcement advising fellow fliers not to eat nuts . He will use a debate in the Commons tonight to challenge aviation minister Robert Goodwill to instruct airlines to respond to passenger requests for a warning message to be player. Speaking ahead of the debate, Mr Goodwill said: 'Allergies can pose a serious risk and the health and the safety of passengers is our first priority. But we need to ensure any new regulation is proportionate and genuinely reduces the risk posed to travellers. 'If further action is needed, we would push for this to happen at an international level.' Last month schoolboy Daniel Levitan was barred from boarding a U.S. plane after his parents asked for a tannoy announcement advising fellow fliers not to eat nuts. An American Airlines staff member refused to make the announcement, despite a pilot being willing to do so, according to his mother Judith, from St Albans, Hertfordshire. The family's flights were cancelled and they had to stay another two nights in Florida and spend £200 on phone calls rearranging flights for two days later. Staff agreed to make a warning announcement when IT consultant Howard, 46, dental practice employee Judith, 41, Daniel and his brother Joel flew out from Heathrow to Fort Myers via Dallas on Boxing Day. However, Mrs Levitan said she was 'warned' by an AA cabin crew member on the outbound journey: 'Americans have the right to eat nuts'. In August four-year-old Fae Platten suffered a life-threatening allergy attack at 30,000ft after an airline passenger ignored repeated warnings not to eat peanuts. 'She had to be revived with an anti-allergy adrenaline injection and was taken to hospital for treatment after the Ryanair plane landed at Stansted. Life-threatening: Four-year-old Fae Platten went into anaphylactic shock on a Ryanair flight . Airlines are more aware than ever of the danger of nut allergies - and for good reason. Last August four-year-old Fae Platten went into anaphylactic shock on board a Ryanair budget flight from Tenerife to London after a fellow passenger opened a bag of nuts against official advice. It was a rare event. According to the website Allergy UK, no one is ever known to have died of a peanut allergy on a plane and symptoms are usually restricting to streaming eyes and wheezing. However, the website adds: 'Once the packets are opened, the peanut dust erupts into the air and is circulated around the aircraft cabin. 'Not every person with peanut allergy reports having a problem, but when it does occur, it can be extremely distressing.' Due to concerns over allergies, many airlines have long since stopped serving packets of peanuts on board. These include United, easyJet, British Airways and even American Airlines. They cannot prevent individual passengers from bringing their own packets of peanuts on board, although they can make announcements advising passengers not to. The Allergy UK website adds: 'If you plan to negotiate the removal of nut snacks on your flight, take a non-confrontational stance. Use a softly softly approach. 'Try not to worry the airline so much they refuse to carry you or your party. Make it clear that you have a problem and need help.'","MP wants standardised message on flights where passenger has allergy .

"A funeral was held for a 16-year-old Pennsylvania boy who authorities said was shot by a classmate who took a selfie with his body. Family and friends gathered at Sacred Heart Church in Jeannette this morning for the funeral mass of Ryan Mangan, who was found fatally shot in his home on February 4. Around 250 people attended to show their respects, and a private burial immediately followed at the Sacred Heart Cemetery. Family and friends gathered at Sacred Heart Church in Jeannette this morning for the funeral mass of Ryan Mangan (above), 16, who was found fatally shot in his home on February 4 . Around 250 people attended the funeral mass to show their respects, and a private burial immediately followed at the Sacred Heart Cemetery . Maxwell Morton (above), 16, of Jeannette has since been arrested and charged with criminal homicide, first-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a minor . Maxwell Morton, 16, of Jeannette has since been arrested and charged with criminal homicide, first-degree murder and possession of a firearm by a minor. He was identified as the shooter after he took a selfie with Mangan's body on Snapchat and sent the image to a friend, according to police. The image showed Mangan in the same position and condition that authorities found him, with a single gunshot wound to the face, in his mother's home last Wednesday evening. Morton's friend saved the image before it deleted itself, as SnapChat lets users send images that are removed from the recipient's phone after a few seconds. Morton was identified as the suspected shooter after he took a selfie with Mangan's body on Snapchat and sent the image to a friend. The image showed Morton with Mangan, who was in the same position and condition that authorities found him, with a single gunshot wound to the face . Mangan was found by his mother in her home (above) last Wednesday evening . Both of the boys attended Jeannette High School. Police are continuing to look for a motive in the case . The friend's mother, who first alerted police about the picture from Morton, also said her son received messages from him that said: 'I told you I cleaned up the shells' and 'Ryan was not the last one'. Following a search at Morton's home, he confessed to shooting Mangan after police found a 9mm handgun hidden under the basement steps that matched the shell casing found at the scene of the murder, according to Triblive. In the ongoing investigation, Morton's phone will be examined for any other evidence and police are continuing to look for a motive in the shooting. The Jeannette School District delayed classes by two hours because of the funeral (above Sacred Heart Church), and said grief counselors will be available during the next few days . A GoFundMe page was created to help contribute to Mangan's burial cost and nearly $6,000 were raised in donations. In four days, 169 people contributed $5,925 to the funeral fund. A post written on the page said that Mangan leaves behind devastated parents, a brother, niece, extended relatives and many friends. The Jeannette School District delayed classes by two hours because of the funeral, and said grief counselors will be available during the next few days, according to the Post-Gazette.

"An urgent review of stealth speed cameras has been ordered to determine if they should be painted yellow, roads minister John Hayes has said. It was reported last month that the devices - dubbed 'stealth cameras' by critics - have caught almost 700 drivers in just two months on the M25 in Kent. Unlike traditional speed cameras, the gantry devices are painted grey, making them harder to spot for drivers. Scroll down for video . Stealth speed cameras such as the one circled have caught almost 700 drivers on the M25 in Kent in just two months . The camera technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 (pictured) and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6 . But this may yet change, with a review of the initiative now underway in order to determine if they should be more clearly signposted and coloured yellow. Mr Hayes said: 'I have been concerned about ""stealth cameras"" and have ordered a review as a matter of priority to look at exactly where they are, what they are being used for and how they are signed,' The Daily Telegraph reported. 'I think it's important that people know where speed cameras are. The suggestion that stealth is involved is not reasonable.' Transport minister John Hayes (pictured) said the suggestion that speed cameras were using stealth to catch motorists was 'not reasonable' The technology uses front and rear-facing cameras to verify a vehicle’s speed. And, while conventional devices have to be trained on only one lane at a time, the digital cameras can scan four. They are similar to cameras used during roadworks but do not work on the basis of calculating an average speed over a fixed distance. The camera technology is being introduced on a northern section of the M25 and also parts of the M1, M3, M60 and M6. Motoring groups claim the devices will see thousands of drivers facing at least £100 in fines and points on their licence for straying marginally over the 70mph limit. The Association of Chief Police Officers recommends drivers are not charged unless they exceed 79mph in a 70mph limit zone. In 2013 the number of people fined for speeding peaked at more than 115,000 - the highest level since 2009. Ministers said the rise was largely due to the increased number of speed cameras that were in operation for 24 hours a day. In total 115,549 motorists were fined more than £100 that year. It was also announced last year that the maximum fines for motorway speeding that could be imposed by magistrates would rise from £2,500 to £10,000. The technology uses front and rear-facing cameras to verify a passing vehicle's speed . The grey cameras being installed across Britain's busiest motorways can track dozens cars across four lanes in the heaviest of traffic. Conventional cameras can only scan one lane and are usually painted yellow - but these are grey. Attached to the motorway gangway - front and rear-facing cameras are used to verify a vehicle's speed. The same camera system is also used to grab the vehicle's number plate and match it up with the national vehicle registration database. They enforce variable speed limits and also the standard 70mph speed limit if needed.","Stealth speed cameras may be painted yellow to ensure they're identifiable .

"John O'Neill's bad temper and foul mouthed rants have seen him locked up more than 50 times . A man dubbed 'Britain's rudest pensioner' has been jailed once again after drinking whisky, smoking cannabis and abusing passers-by. John O'Neill's bad temper and foul mouth has seen him locked up more than 50 times. The 71-year-old Scotsman, who claims to be a science graduate, terrorised people with his rants over everyday life - including one tirade launched at a mother feeding her child. In 2009 he was issued with a five-year ASBO after causing misery in the Didsbury and Rusholme areas of Manchester. Council officials in Manchester took action after complaints about his behaviour in a string of shops and restaurants including M&S, Café Rouge, Lidl, Tesco Express and retail outlets at Manchester Airport. Locals complained about him swearing and shouting aggressively, urinating on a vehicle and even defecating on a lawn in front of horrified passers-by. One member of staff at a shop transferred to another branch to avoid having to deal with him. Last Friday O'Neill, who has clocked up 235 offences since 1968, was hauled back to court after police tackled him over an incident at a bakery in Crumpsall, Manchester. A PCSO who found him slumped on a park bench was told by the OAP: 'F*** you, I will put bullets in your f*****g head. Are you bomb proof? Because I will f*****g bomb you.' At Manchester Crown Court, O'Neill of Chorlton, Manchester admitted breaching his ASBO and was jailed for three months. Prosecutors said he has a 'voluminous' criminal record' and was once described by a judge as a 'thorough nuisance' who was 'foul mouthed, aggressive and had no respect for authority or for Police, shop keepers and members of the public.' Manchester City Council provided evidence of 53 incidents involving O'Neill which also included shop lifting and being in possession of cannabis and having a knife. At the time the ASBO banned O'Neill from using abusive, insulting, offensive, threatening or intimidating language or behaviour in a public place or in any place to which the public has access. He was barred from urinating or defecating in a public place or in any place to which the public has access - except for designated public toilets - and taking property belonging to someone else without paying or without the consent of the owner. The 71-year-old Scotsman, who claims to be a science graduate, terrorised people with his rants over everyday life - including one tirade launched at a mother feeding her child . He was also excluded from a large area of south Manchester, including the airport unless he has a valid ticket for travel. But last year O'Neill shouted at a young mother at a Costa coffee shop in Chorlton, claiming her 'hoity toity' and 'snooty' attitude set him off. The woman was breaking a biscuit to feed her son when O'Neill turned to the two-year-old and said 'she'll break you into pieces next'. He then told the boy, 'don't take any of that bull****, you will be taking that your whole life.' When the mother confronted him about his language, O'Neill began screaming, calling her a 'f****ing balloon' and a 's*** mum.' The pensioner was in such a fury that he could be heard across Chorlton precinct, leading nearby shopkeepers to step in and restrain him. During other incidents he flew into a violent rage on a bus, and pushed over a shop worker. At Manchester Crown Court, O'Neill of Chorlton, Manchester admitted breaching his ASBO and was jailed for three months. Prosecutors said he has a 'voluminous' criminal record' and was once described by a judge as a 'thorough nuisance' who was 'foul mouthed, aggressive and had no respect for authority' Last July he was given a nine-month community order, with a plea from a judge to start behaving himself. But on January 15, he entered a bakery in Crumpsall, Manchester, and began to abuse staff to the point they called in the police. Among his 'monumental' list of crimes, O’Neill has been prosecuted for: . Prosecuting, Justin Hayhoe said: 'Staff at the bakery in Crumpsall saw the defendant, who was highly intoxicated and being abusive. 'They tried to eject him and a PCSO attended and saw the defendant slumped in a seat. 'They engaged him and he was abusive towards them. 'He has a voluminous antecedent record, with a plethora of convictions for dishonesty, some violent, several involving alcohol. 'He has received a variety of sentences including discharges, fines, community orders and custody. He has habitually and repeatedly breached ASBOs.' In mitigation, Robert Smith said: 'The defendant accepts he had consumed whisky and cannabis and has no memory of what has happened. Perhaps his biggest mitigation is he has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.'","John O'Neill's bad temper and foul mouthed rants earned him ASBO .

"Japanese industrial designer Kenji Ekuan, whose works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser, has died, aged 85. His office, GK Industrial Design Group, said Monday that Ekuan died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday. A former monk, Ekuan crafted his iconic tabletop bottle, as familiar as the classic Coca-Cola bottle, for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. He won international popularity both for the handy, flask-shaped dispenser and of course for the salty brown condiment that flavored many Asian cuisines. Japanese industrial designer Kenji Ekuan, whose works ranged from a bullet train to the red-capped Kikkoman soy sauce dispenser, as familiar as the classic Coca-Cola bottle, has died of a heart problem at a Tokyo hospital early Saturday, aged 85 . Ekuan, who is a former monk, crafted his iconic tabletop soy sauce bottle for Kikkoman Corp. in 1961. He went on to design the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan . The Tokyo native has said he wanted to design a small bottle because of his childhood memory of his mother pouring soy sauce from a big half-gallon bottle to a tabletop dispenser. His dispenser has been used ever since, according to the New York Times. More than 300million bottles have been sold worldwide. Other of his renowned works include the Yamaha VMAX motorcycle, the Komachi bullet train connecting Tokyo and northern Japan, the Narita Express airport liner, as well as audio equipment and company logos. His designs originate from the sights of Hiroshima’s devastation after the U.S. atomic bombing of the city 70 years ago. He heard the voices of street cars, bicycles and other objects mangled and abandoned and wished they had been utilized more, he is quoted as saying in a company pamphlet for his Hiroshima exhibit last year. His design principle was a ‘democratization’ of goods and beauty, to make them accessible for everyone. He wanted to become a maker of everyday things. Before entering the design world, however, Ekuan became a monk at a Hiroshima temple to succeed his father, who died due to radiation from the atomic bombing. But he eventually changed his path. He graduated from the prestigious Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1955 and went on to get a degree from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. Other of his renowned works include the Yamaha VMAS motorcycle, the Komachi bullet train (pictured) connecting Tokyo and northern Japan, the Narita Express airport liner, as well as audio equipment and company logos . He founded his design studio in 1957, now called GK Design Group, which is made up of twelve firms - four of which are international - that provide product, transportation, environmental and communication design, according to Huffington Post. Last year, Ekuan received a prestigious Italian industrial design prize, the Golden Compass Award, after winning several other international awards. When telling Japan Times about his designs in 2001, he said: 'Design to me has always meant making people happy. 'Happy in the sense of creating items that provide comfort, convenience, function, aesthetics and ethics. 'I used to do a lot of research, fieldwork, wanting to understand the psychology of human needs and response.’ He also designed Yamaha motorcycles, like the one pictured above.

"Former foreign secretary Jack Straw is being lined up for a seat in the House of Lords after he steps down as an MP in May. The former Foreign Secretary is understood to be open to accepting a peerage and could even take up his place on the red benches before his role in taking Britain to war against Iraq is laid bare in the long-delayed Chilcot report. A senior Labour source told MailOnline the Blackburn MP is 'on his way down the corridor to the other place' after he leaves the Commons. Jack Straw was instrumental in taking Britain to war in Iraq in 2003, as Tony Blair's long-serving foreign secretary . It comes amid growing anger at the four-year delay of the Chilcot Inquiry's report, which is now facing a race against time to be published before 2016. The revelation that Mr Straw could be handed a peerage before the Chilcot report is likely to anger anti-war campaigners who attacked his support for the 2003 invasion during a fiery Commons debate last week. Mr Straw – who was foreign secretary from 2001 to 2006 – is expected to be rebuked by Sir John Chilcot when he finally published his report after the election. Well-placed sources have revealed 'approximately 30' people have been sent letters by Sir John warning them that they will be criticised in his report into the invasion, including Mr Straw. Downing Street insiders expect the report to be a 'devastating' indictment of the Blair Government and large sections of the Whitehall establishment. Mr Straw, who gave evidence to the Chilcot inquiry three times, has insisted suggestions the report it being delayed by witnesses were 'wholly without foundation'. He told MPs it was in his interest for the report to be published as soon as possible. Mr Straw also suggested that criticism of the delays to the Chilcot inquiry could lead to the panel producing conclusions that were 'more starkly drawn than the evidence'. During his evidence sessions he expressed his 'deep regret' about the war and said he supported the decision to attack Iraq 'very reluctantly'. He acknowledged he could have forced Blair to think again had he objected, but rejected advice from Foreign Office legal experts that to attack UN support 'would amount to a crime of aggression'. Sir John Chilcot was last week summoned before Parliament to explain why his report had been delayed again . Sir John was last week summoned before Parliament to explain why his report had been delayed again. He was asked by MPs last week to say how many people had been told they will be criticised in the report, but he refused point-blank. 'At the risk of being obdurate, I mustn't. If I start to give numbers people can work out who might be involved.' He told MPs he would deliver his report 'as soon as we possibly can' but renewed his assertion that he saw 'no realistic prospect' of it being finished before May's general election. He said he had accepted a summons to explain the hold-ups because he recognised the 'exceptionally high level of parliamentary and public interest in our progress'. Prime Minister David Cameron has been among those expressing frustration that the report has yet to be finalised, more than five years after the inquiry, which took evidence from its last witness in 2011, was launched. The inquiry took evidence from its last witness in 2011 - but Sir John has confirmed its task will not now be completed until after the general election.","The former Foreign Secretary is open to accepting a peerage .

"Father: Marc Traylor, 40, was fighting for his life in hospital today after being shot by police in Kent . A 40-year-old father was fighting for his life in hospital today after being shot by police after his teenage daughter was stabbed. Police firearms officers and negotiators went to the home in Hersden, Kent, late last night and laid siege to the property in a stand-off that ended with Marc Traylor being shot. The daughter  was also in a critical condition this afternoon after being stabbed during the stand-off in the village - and two knives have since been recovered from the scene. Retired fireman Peter Johnson, 54, who lives opposite the house where the shooting happened, said that a dramatic two-hour period last night began with the sound of a huge crash. He told MailOnline today: 'I went to bed, and probably about half an hour after I heard something make a noise almost like a car had hit something - then a bit of a commotion. ‘The lady opposite who was involved was standing by her gate. Approximately ten minutes later the police turned up – with about ten police vehicles. When they turned up I thought “what’s going on”? ‘They went in, did their bit - and about half an hour more vehicles turned up including armed response. They went in and about 20 minutes after that there was a few shots. ‘Police came out onto the road shouting for the ambulance to come quickly. About five minutes after that they brought a young lady out and carried her up towards the ambulance . ‘Another half an hour later they brought the man out on a stretcher. After that, it looked like it was all over, but they’re still outside - they’ve got forensics there.’ Dramatic stand-off: Police firearms officers and negotiators went to the home in Hersden, Kent, late last night . Probe: One witness said a dramatic two-hour period began last night with the sound of a huge crash . He said he did not know the man or woman at the property, as they generally did not speak to other neighbours – in contrast to most other people on the road. And Ruby Miller, 21, who lives opposite the house, told Kent Online: ‘I looked out of my window at about 11.15pm and saw about 20 officers piling in to the house. No one's telling us anything.’ Kent Police said that the matter had been sent to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation. A police spokesman said: ‘At 11.20pm on Sunday, Kent Police received a call to attend an incident in Hersden. Local officers initially attended, followed by firearms officers and police negotiators. ‘A young woman inside the house received stab wounds and a 40-year-old man was shot by a police officer. The man was taken to hospital where he is in a critical condition. Officers: A police patrol van and forensic investigation vehicle were both parked outside the house today . ‘The young woman is also in hospital in a critical condition. They are members of the same family. ‘As this is a police shooting, the matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is mandatory.’ A spokesman for the force on Twitter added: ‘We dealt with an incident in Hersden overnight that has now been resolved. There was no threat to public safety.’ A police patrol van and forensic investigation vehicle were both parked outside the house today. An IPCC spokesman said: ‘We have had the matter referred to us and have started an independent investigation.’ The incident happened on The Avenue, a road with an average house value of £175,000 which lies almost five miles north-east of the nearest city, Canterbury.","Police firearms officers and negotiators went to home in Hersden .

"An 11-year-old girl has been charged with beating a two-month-old baby to death while her mother was babysitting the newborn. The unnamed pre-teen appeared at the Lake County Juvenile Court in Ohio on Monday to be formally charged with murder in connection to Zuri Whitehead's death last Friday. Photographs captured by WOIO show the 11-year-old sitting silently and with her head down in the court room as the judge addresses her. She had been on a downstairs couch with her mother, 39, and Zuri when her mother fell asleep around 3am on Friday, Wickliffe police Chief Randy Ice said at a news conference on Monday. The mother was awakened less than an hour later by her daughter, who was holding the badly injured infant. Scroll down for video . Accused: The unidentified 11-year-old girl is pictured in court in Lake County, Ohio on Monday after she allegedly beat a two-month-old baby to death on Friday as her mother cared for the newborn . Tragic: Zuri Whitehead, pictured, was badly beaten while she was being watched by a friend of her mother's on Friday. Police say that the babysitter's 11-year-old daughter beat the baby, who later passed away . Ice said the 11-year-old had taken the infant upstairs while her mother slept, and when she returned downstairs, the infant was bleeding and her head was badly swollen. The 11-year-old's mother immediately called 911, Ice said. She told the dispatcher that Zuri was having trouble breathing and that her eyes were closed, according to WOIO. Zuri was flown to Lake West Hospital and later transferred to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland but passed away during surgery on Friday morning, police said. The baby had suffered 'massive brain injuries, severe damage to the liver, spleen and kidneys, and extensive internal bleeding,' Ice said. 'An autopsy performed by the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office determined that the cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma to the head and torso,' police said in a statement. 'The death has been ruled a homicide.' The mother of the 11-year-old and Zuri's mother, Trina Whitehead, had known each other for five or six years but weren't related, Ice said. Trina Whitehead has three other children and had the girl's mother keep Zuri overnight to give her a break. Juvenile: A judge ordered the girl to undergo a competency trial, which will be carried out over the next month . Heartbreaking: Zuri had been staying in an apartment in the 1500 block of Ridgewick Drive, Wickliffe (pictured) overnight on Thursday to Friday to give her mother, who has three other children, a break for the night . The 11-year-old girl's is not facing charges at this time, Ice said. Neither Ice nor a Lake County juvenile court official could recall a murder suspect being as young as 11. Court administrator Chris Simon said 13 is the youngest age that children are typically detained at the county's juvenile detention center, where the girl is being held. Juvenile Judge Karen Lawson entered a not guilty plea for the girl at a detention hearing Monday and ordered that she undergo a competency hearing, which will likely be held over the next month. The girl cannot be tried as an adult. A child must be at least 14 years old in Ohio to be turned over to adult court. An 11-year-old can, however, be sentenced to a state Department of Youth Services facility until age 21. The middle school the girl attends had called police about the girl on one occasion for a non-violent incident, Ice said. The girl and her mother have been questioned. Probe: The Wickliffe Police Department says the 11-year-old girl is responsible for the newborn's death . The girl did not show any remorse, Ice said. 'I'm not sure she appreciated the gravity of what she did,' he said. The girl's public defender declined to comment on Monday. Ice is considering counseling for the officers who responded to the scene. 'We're having a hard time getting (our) heads around this,' he said. 'You don't see stuff like this.' Neighbor Devyn Woods called the situation 'absolutely heartbreaking'. He said: 'All I saw was four cop cars lined up and I knew something was happening. But I didn't know to the gravity of the situation. It's terrible.'","Zuri Whitehead was being watched by  mother's friend on Friday when she awoke to find her 11-year-old daughter holding the injured baby .

"A family missed a wedding in India after they and other passengers had to wait more than 48 hours for a flight at Birmingham Airport. More than 230 passengers had been due to fly out on Air India on Friday night but discovered their flight had been delayed due to a technical fault. But their frustration turned to misery when they were told their flight had then been cancelled completely. More than 40 passengers then spent two nights in local hotels waiting for an Air India flight bound for Amritsar via Delhi. The delay meant some will miss a family wedding today, while another family will be unable to attend a funeral. Sunny Rai, pictured on the far left, missed the wedding of a cousin after Air India cancelled his flight out of Birmingham. Pictured are fellow irate passengers . Sunny Rai, a 26-year-old trainee financial adviser from Smethwick, his mother Charanjit Kaur, 50, and 54-year-old father Balkar Singh, were looking forward to attending a cousin's wedding. Instead, the weary family, who had nine suitcases and paid £480 each for their ticket, were still waiting for a flight last night. Mr Rai said: 'I was at the airport and checked in at 5.30pm on Friday and they suspended us there and then. They said there was a technical issue and asked us to 'bear with us'. 'We hung around the Air India desk and were then told the flight had been cancelled. 'They told us to board a bus to the Holiday Inn just off the A45 near the airport. 'It was a full flight, about three or four coaches went to the Holiday Inn. 'I got on the fourth one but some passengers chose to go home.' After the Friday cancellation the passengers gathered again at 9am the next morning in the lobby of the hotel. Mr Rai added: 'I found out that the Air India people had come and said they would take 15 people to fly from Heathrow. The Air India plane was found to have a technical fault on landing at Birmingham Airport which then led to the flight out to India being cancelled . 'They served us lunch and when I came back Air India said there were now 50 seats available to fly from Heathrow and they had enough people.' Mr Rai went back to Birmingham Airport via taxi and was surprised to learn that some of the passengers had got onto a flight due to leave that evening despite being told there was no space. He claimed that when they went back to the Holiday Inn they were told that Air India had not paid for a room so they returned to the airport where they were taken to the Novotel Hotel instead. Mr Rai said: 'It was chaos. There is no way we are going to make it.' Kam Singh, aged 32, from Coventry, said his parents had also been travelling to a wedding and had been left stranded. The Singhs were travelling to India to attend a week-long wedding that begins today, but the family feared if they did not get a flight by last night they would miss the start. Some passengers were stranded at Birmingham Airport for 48 hours, meaning many missed appointments . 'They were meant to fly out on Friday and they were told that a stone had hit the plane - there had been some sort of technical fault - so the plane could not depart,' their son claimed. He said the service they had received from Air India had been inadequate, despite spending £1,200 on the flights. 'Even when they transported people from the airport to the hotel there was no help with luggage,' he said. 'My father has got arthritis and he had a heart bypass a few years ago, and he had to lift four cases into the hotel. 'They were told they were being sent to London for a flight but midway through the journey they were told that plane was now full.' The Singhs hoped to leave on a flight last night, though they had been warned it too was delayed by six hours until 2am this morning. An Air India spokesman apologised for the inconvenience. He said around 233 passengers had been affected, with 42 still awaiting a flight late last night. The spokesman said: 'There was a technical glitch because of which the flight got grounded.

"Just as it looked the gay marriage would come to pass in Alabama, the state's chief justice has intervened to try and keep the state's unconstitutional same-sex marriage ban in place. Chief Justice Roy Moore sent a letter Sunday evening that ordered probate judges to turn away same-sex couples seeking marriage licenses. 'Effective immediately, no probate judge of the state of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with (the Alabama Constitution),' Moore wrote. Justice: One couple camped outside the Montgomery County Courthouse hopeful to get a marriage license, in spite of a desperate letter for the state's chief justice ordering probate judges not to issue licenses . One couple had already set up camp in front of Montgomery's courthouse in order to be the first to get a license Monday morning. 'It's about time,' said Shante Wolfe, 21, who hugged her partner Tori Sisson in the tent they'd pitched. Moore, an elected official who has written that he believes the 'Judeo-Christian God (is) the sovereign source of our law,' also once called homosexuality an 'evil' in a 2002 custody ruling. Still, Susan Watson, executive director the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, said Moore was 'grandstanding' and would not likely delay same-sex marriage. 'We will see marriage equality in Alabama tomorrow. I don't think the probate judges in Alabama are going to defy a federal court judge's order,' Watson said Sunday. The ACLU has set up a phone line for couples to call if they've been denied a license and Watson said the organization would visit courthouses through the state. Happy couple: Shante Wolfe (left), 21, called the possible end of the state's ban on marriage 'about time' and hoped to get a marriage license with partner Tori Sisson . Early risers: The couple pitched a tent in front of the courthouse, hoping to be the first in the state to get licenses . 'I think it will really pretty simple. Hopefully we will be able to hand out a lot of wedding favors,' Watson said. The state's ban on gay marriage was ruled unconstitutional last month by US District Judge Callie Granade who later ordered the state's probate judges to issue licenses out of legal duty to the US Constitution. Some probate judges disclosed they would deny licenses until the courts further clarify the implications of Granade's ruling. It's unclear what grounds Chief Justice Moore will have to enforce his directive, which also threatened that Governor Robert Bentley could punish elected officials who fail to follow the law. A spokeswoman for Bentley said she was unaware of Moore's letter and did not comment on it. At least some of the state's judges have said they were expecting to follow through with Judge Granade's ruling. 'With all due respect to Chief Justice Moore, he’s on the Alabama Supreme Court, and he’s not a federal judge,' Jefferson County Probate Judge Alan L King said last week, reported the New York Times.","Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore sent a last-minute directive to the state's judges ordering them not to issue marriage licenses .

The star did not shed any more light on what he was at the medical center for, but those around him are keeping a tight-lip about the matter. He added:  'Friends have assisted who know my spiritual convictions and have been most sensitive and kind for the extra effort in making sure there’s minimum gossip and silly talk. 'I am praying for a speedy return to the boards as they say. God bless you all and please don’t worry. Love and deep affection , Val.' However, according to TMZ, 'Doctors performed surgery and he's currently recovering.'

"Actor Bill Nighy has revealed he measures his life in Champions Leagues and has an obsession with his own mortality which sees him 'think about death 12 times a day'. The 65-year-old, famed for his roles in Love Actually and State of Play, said he hoped not to retire, but to instead one day go to bed and not wake up. An avid football fan, he has also revealed how he spends his free days drinking coffee and walking through London before settling in to watch recorded football matches on Sky Plus. Scroll down for video . Actor Bill Nighy, pictured with Dame Judi Dench in their latest film The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, has said he measures his life in Champions Leagues and thinks about death '12 times a day' In an interview with The Observer, he was asked if he could imagine ending up in a retirement home like that depicted in his latest film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. He replied: 'I’m hoping not to retire. What do we hope for? Go to bed and don’t wake up, I suppose.' He added: 'I probably think about death 12 times a day. I measure my life in Champions Leagues. How many do I have left?' His latest film, The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, follows on from the slow-burning success of 2012's The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Nighy stars in the movie alongside Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel and Richard Gere, and plays one of several pensioners who have moved to a retirement hotel in India run by Patel's character Sonny. Nighy found a new audience in 2003, playing the ageing singer Billy Mack in the film Love Actually, in which Keira Knightley and Hugh Grant also appeared. Since then, he has been inundated with film work including roles in the Pirates Of The Caribbean and The Girl In The Cafe. In 2008, he split from his long-term partner, actress Diana Quick, after 27 years. The two met while Nighy was performing at the National Theatre, in 1981 and have one daughter together. Although they never married, Ms Quick once described him as her 'de facto husband' or POSSLQ - Person of the Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters. The Golden Globe winning actor  hopes to one day go to bed and not wake up, rather than retire . Nighy is set to star as Sergeant Wilson in the highly-anticipated upcoming film adaption of Dad's Army. Filming is currently underway for the contemporary version of the classic BBC television comedy series about the bumbling members of a Home Guard unit during the Second World War. Acting alongside him in the star-studded cast is Sir Michael Gambon, who will play Private Godfrey. Dad's Army, which originally ran from 1968, sees all of its most memorable characters brought back for the movie makeover, including Captain Mainwaring (Toby Jones), Pike (Blake Harrison) and Fraser (Bill Paterson). But the Hamish McColl screenplay writes in numerous new female characters, including Rose Winters, played by Hollywood royalty Catherine Zeta Jones.","Actor Bill Nighy reveals he thinks about his own mortality '12 times a day'

"To jump off a plane with just a parachute takes a leap of faith. But for two skydivers it almost became a leap of fate. This is the near-death moment two skydivers almost collided with the plane they had just jumped out of in Thailand only seconds before. The dive at first seemed like any other of the 10,000 plus jumps instructor Forest Pullman had taken when he and his tandem passenger dropped 13,000 feet into the air. It seemed like a regular dive for instructor Forest Pullman and his tandem passenger... until the pilot of the airplane they just jumped out of dove 180 degrees and headed straight for them . But just as his partner is getting her first rush of adrenaline and waving her hands in the air, Pullman is looking at something else. It was their plane. And it was coming right towards them. Mere moments later the plane is next to them, so close Pullman's drogue and bridle (which are used as a pilot parachute to deploy the larger parachute for the landing) hangs over the wing. 'Our bodies just missing the prop, wing, and tail,' Pullman pointed out in the YouTube video he posted yesterday of the terrifying near-collision. His passenger was enjoying her first rush of adrenaline when Pullman realized the plane's proximity to the pair . Seconds later the plane is right next to them in a moment that looks seconds away from a fatal collision . But just as soon as they could have been shredded by the propeller, the plane is underneath them. While his passenger screams 'Oh my god!' and has the time of her life, unaware of what they just nearly escaped, Pullman can't help but wipe his forehead in relief. 'Now she knows we almost got cut in half,' he writes in the video, before seeming to dole out some advice to fellow instructors: 'Stay calm, keep smiling.' The aircraft gets so close Pullman's drogue and bridle (which are used as a pilot parachute to deploy the larger parachute for the landing) drapes over the wing . 'Our bodies just missing the prop, wing, and tail,' Pullman points out in the YouTube video he posted yesterday of the terrifying near-collision . The instructor than tells his passenger 'we're good to go baby' and gives her a high five before a safe and uneventful landing. 'We made it!' they both say, relieved for different reasons as their feet touch solid ground. The video ends with one final note: 'To live another day! But time to reconsider...BE SAFE OUT THERE!' In the video's information Pullman wrote that he doesn't know how he and his passenger got so lucky during the October 2014 jump. The plane, which has 'Thai Sky' inscribed on the wing,  appears to belong to Thai Sky Adventures, a company that organizes skydiving jumps in Pattaya, Thailand . Just as soon as they could have been shredded by the propeller, the plane is safely underneath them . 'The pilot dove the airplane 180 degrees right at me and my tandem passenger. I have never heard of this happening.' 'After some research and talking to friends about it I now know of two other incidents like this.' 'One is on you tube [sic] and he did not get as lucky as we did...' Pullman has been a skydiving instructor for 15 years and currently lives in Bangkok. 'Thai Sky' is written on the wing of the airplane he jumped out of and, based on the code on the underside of the wing, appears to belong to Thai Sky Adventure , according to the Independent. The company, which dubs itself 'the skydiving hub of Asia,' organizes jumps in Pattaya, Thailand. While his passenger screams 'Oh my god!' and has the time of her life, unaware of what they just nearly escaped, Pullman can't believe what just happened . Pullman gives some advice to other instructors in the video: 'Stay calm, keep smiling' The pair exclaim 'we made it!' after landing and share a hug.

"PCSO Jonathan Hall has come under fire for comparing parents on the school run to 'wailing, hissing feral cats . Ambitious parents might think their educational problems are over when they secure a coveted place at a sought-after school. But it turns out that bagging a parking spot near the school gates can be every bit as competitive. According to one community policeman the fight for a space makes some parents harder to deal with than ‘wailing, hissing feral cats’. Jonathan Hall says they indulge in a ‘vicious game of cat and mouse’ as they try to avoid a parking ticket – even at the cost of blocking driveways. In desperation, the police community support officer used an official email to beg school-run drivers to behave themselves in Littleport, Cambridgeshire. Mr Hall, a former RSPCA inspector, wrote: ‘When challenged, the parent will become an angry creature, wailing and hissing their annoyance at being challenged over their dangerous parking. ‘The parent stares out from their metal box, with a look of pure hate. A look upon their face saying, “I would splat you with one swipe of my paw (if it was not illegal)”. Never mind the moggies, it is the mothers who bare their claws these days.’ Mr Hall reminded parents that officers patrolled near schools to prevent accidents and said parking on double yellow lines was likely to result in a ticket. It is not known which school he was referring to but residents confirmed his beat covers Littleport community primary school. One woman, who has an 11-year-old daughter at the school and lives along the same road, said Mr Hall’s remarks were justified. She added: ‘This road is completely chaotic. Everyone is trying to park down roads with no parking spaces. I can’t even park outside my own house. ‘We’ve had countless texts from the headmaster reminding people to park appropriately. But parents just ignore it. ‘I know there’s bickering and fighting going on between the women – it’s all very unsafe. They are so focused on getting a space they stop watching the kids and I think one day a child will be hit.’ Elizabeth Poglia, 70, a retired college lecturer who lives by the school, said: ‘It’s all these well-to-do mothers in their posh white Mercedes who are doing it. 'They have these huge great cars they don’t need and their attitude is “So what? I’m only here for two minutes”. He wrote on an online messaging forum saying that catching parents parking illegally outside some schools was like a game of 'cat and mouse' ‘They’re very slick and clever and they’re very self-assured. They are stealthy and will do anything to avoid getting a ticket. ‘They know they’re being inconsiderate but they think they are superior. The ones that go to work are always in a hurry and always pushy.’ Another resident, 31-year-old Emilia Zohahlwicz, said: ‘There is a lot of aggression from the mums. They fight for spaces and I think what the PSCO said is truthful.’ Ed Morrow, campaigns officer for Brake, the road safety charity, said illegal parking around schools presented a serious danger to children who can emerge from between stationary cars. He added: ‘We would urge all parents to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, by considering how their children can get to school other than by car, or if they have to drive, then by sticking to 20mph or below wherever there may be vulnerable people on foot or bike.’ A near-miss accident last March involving a child at a Littleport school prompted police to target parents who park dangerously. Miriam Farrell, 37, whose sons attend Littleport community primary, said: ‘The response is perhaps a bit over the top but there is certainly a problem with space. ‘There’s just not enough places for people to park and so people park illegally and compete for spaces.’ Other parents said the parking problem was made worse by schools being overcrowded. The PCSO (not pictured) said when parents are challenged they become 'an angry creature, wailing and hissing their annoyance' 'When I worked for the RSPCA one of the most frequently asked questions I was asked was, 'What is the most dangerous animals you have had to deal with ' A Fox ! A Badger, A Bull, A Horse !. When I told them it was with out a doubt a cat, they would look very disappointed. A cat, what one of those cute, cuddly, purring softies ?? 'But if the situation is right !! I would then tell them of my personal experiences of trying to catch an injured cat, usually a feral one and how crazy they would react. A Feral cat would climb a wall, run along the ceiling (almost), screaming and wailing like the most terrifying creature from a horror movie. It would take me all my strength and cunning to get hold of the ferocious Feline on the end of my Grasper, and place it into a pet carrier. 'All I wanted was to get the injured animal to a vet to have its paw seen too. The captured mog would stare out of its cage, with a look of pure hate, thinking to itself if I was bigger I would splat you with one swipe of my paw. Vets certainly earn their money. 'These days I no longer deal with such incidents. Or so I thought. Now take a parent, they are normally cute,purring, very pleasant, easy going, they might even engage in a little chat. But if the situation is right !! such as The School Run !!!! 'A game of cat and mouse unfolds, the parent ( not all ) will pretend they have not seen you, as they park their car on double yellow lines, once parked the charade will continue, even if you stand next to the car, hoping your presence will resolve the situation. 'When challenged, the Parent will be become an angry creature, wailing and hissing their annoyance at being challenged over their dangerous parking. It will take me all my strength to remain calm, as the Parent stares out from their metal box, with a look of pure hate. A look upon their face saying, I would splat you with one swipe of my paw ! ( if it was not illegal) 'Never mind the Moggies, it is the Mothers who bare their claws these days. 'I read a article in a paper recently where a mother had been knocked down by another parent, outside a school, and was in a serious situation in hospital. Some of you may have seen it yourself. It was a rather sobering read, and goes to show how things can go very wrong, over such a simple day to day event. 'When your local Pcso is at your school, please remember we are there to prevent accidents. Accidents that might involve a child, ( or parent ) and no one wants that. If you can walk, please do. If you have to drive, and I know many of you do, please allow time to get to your school and park safely. If you should park on a yellow line, and get a ticket, please don't climb the wall ! the lines are there for safety reasons, nothing else. 'I do not have a Grasper these days, only a ticket book. And if there is no illegal parking, it stays in my pocket. And that gives us all a good Feline.'","PCSO Jonathan Hall said mothers on the school run 'bare their claws'

"Five-star hotels pride themselves on offering cordon bleu food and personal service, but a hotel in Japan may offer a glimpse of the future, because it will be staffed almost entirely by helpful humanoids. When the first guests check into at Henn-na Hotel in Nagasaki this July, they will be greeted by 10 eerily lifelike robots - and the mechanical service will not stop there. The robots will check in new guests before carrying their luggage and cleaning their rooms – and all with a smile. A hotel opening in Japan this summer will be staffed by helpful humanoids. The first guests check into at Henn-na Hotal in Nagasaki this July, they will be greeted by 10 eerily lifelike robots, like this one. They will come from a company called Kokoro, which has been developing 'actroid' or human-seeking robots, for just over a decade, The Telegraph reported. The robots are designed to look like and share the mannerisms as polite young Japanese women. They will look like they are really breathing, blink and make eye contact as well as altering their body language and tone to respond to guests’ requests. Their cloth uniform also makes them look more human. The robots will check new guests in (illustrated), before carrying their luggage and cleaning their rooms – with a smile. The robots are designed to look like and share the mannerisms of a polite young Japanese woman and will look like they are really breathing, among other realistic touches . Claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years, office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans. The idea that robots will one day be able to do all low-skilled jobs is not new, but Andrew Anderson from UK artificial intelligence company, Celaton, said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought. AI, for example, can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically, while the latest models are also capable of making decisions traditionally made by humans. ‘The fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks, but constantly learn how to do it better and faster, means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were,' Mr Anderson said. For example, a machine can recognise duplicate insurance claims by knowing it has seen a phone number or an address before. The robots will be multilingual and able to speak fluent Japanese, Chinese, Korean and English. Three of the uniformed robots will man the reception desk, another four will act as porters, while others will clean. An industrial robot will serve as a cloak room attendant. While human staff will be on hand to make sure everything runs smoothly in the hotel, company president Hideo Sawada said that he hopes the robots will carry out 90 per cent of tasks in the hotel. He told the Japan Times: ‘We will make the most efficient hotel in the world.’ Guests staying at the hotel, which is located at Huis Ten Bosch theme park in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, won’t need any room keys, because the doors will be fitted with face recognition technology, allowing them to access their rooms using their appearance alone. The temperature of their rooms will be monitored with technology that detects body heat and guests will be able to call for robotic room service using a tablet instead of a phone.

An industrial robot will serve as a cloak room attendant (pictured) The hotel, which means ‘change’ or ‘strange’ in Japanese, is set to open its doors on 17 July and has 72 rooms. It is set in a theme park that is modelled on a quaint Dutch town. A single room will cost from £40 (¥7,000) per night and a twin room will cost from £50 (¥9,000). However, people will be able to bid for rooms online, so the cost will likely rise if the project proves popular. It is thought prices will be capped to match the theme park's most expensive rooms, which cost around £166 (¥30,000). While the Henn-na will be Japan’s first hotel run by robots, androids are already working in shops and restaurants. A club called The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo is known for its sci-fi cabaret show, featuring robotic boxers and dancers, as well as its garishly illuminated interior. And humanoids called Nao will begin working at branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group from April, on a trial basis. If the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. The days of laboriously sorting through clothes and loading the washing machine may soon be a chore of the past, because there's a robot that can do your washing for you. Scientists from the University of California-Berkeley and University of Massachusetts have developed software that enables the robot to perform the complex set of tasks. The PR2 robot has a Microsoft Kinect sensor attached so it can 'see' dirty clothes, put them in a washing basket and load them into a machine, Motherboard reported. After the wash cycle is complete, PR2 also folds clothes, but at the moment is unable to unload the wet clothes and hang them up. At the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, in Austin, Texas, last month, the scientists explained that the task is difficult for robots because they have to adjust their grasp to pick up different clothes and work their way through a pile. While their bot works out a single manoeuvre in less than on second, it takes around 15 minutes to load a washing machine. The hi-tech rooms (illustrated)  will use facial recognition technology and the temperature will be monitored with technology that detects body heat. Guests will be able to call for robotic room service using a tablet instead of a phone, among other features .

The 1ft 11in (58cm) bot also has touch sensors, can speak 19 languages and is able to read and respond to emotions, by analysing facial expressions using embedded software called NAOqi. During a presentation in Tokyo last week, Nao welcomed customers to the bank, and asked which service they required. A total of 1,000 'Pepper' robots are already working across home appliance stores in Japan, where they help customers looking for a Nespresso coffee machine. Equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology, Pepper is able to read people's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they're feeling. Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence . The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming.","Humanoids will staff the Henn-na Hotel in Nagasaki, which opens in July .

"Hundreds of University of Texas students donned sombreros, construction gear and camouflage outfits to attend an offensive 'border patrol' party at the Phi Gamma Delta (called Fiji) fraternity Saturday night. Fiji's president Andrew Campbell jumped to defend the party to student newspaper the Daily Texan, claiming it was actually an Old West-themed event that had simply been misinterpreted. But pictures taken inside the party, and obtained by the newspaper, tell a very different story. Revelers: The Phi Gamma Delta chapter at the University of Texas held a party this weekend where patrons dressed up in traditional Mexican clothing including sombreros and ponchos . Decked out: Fraternity President Andrew Campbell claims the theme was actually Old West, but that description didn't match up to some of the Mexican decorations pictured at the house . The fraternity house was decked out with a temporary tequila bar and a head-in-the-hole picture stand where guests could pose as a Mexican cowboy and his Seniorita. Those who attended the event also told the paper that guests wore construction hard hats and reflective gear with name tags like 'Jefe' and 'Pablo Sanchez'. Others wore camouflage gear as if to represent border patrol agents - a look one wouldn't expect to find on the frontier. The house's bar was also painted after the Mexican flag with the outline of the state of Texas in the middle. 'If any individual or cultural groups were offended, Texas Fiji apologizes for any insensitivity that our guests or members may have portrayed. It is never Texas Fiji's intent to alienate or demean any ethnic group,' Campbell said.

"Police have caused fury after they requested the names of British customers who bought copies of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Officers asked at least three newsagents for people’s details in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Yesterday, Wiltshire Police apologised after admitting an officer had taken down the names of four people in the town of Corsham who bought the magazine featuring a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front. Two further newsagents in South . Scroll down for video . A Wiltshire Police officer visited  a small newsagents and post office in Wiltshire and requested the personal details of all subscribers to the Charlie Hebdo magazine (pictured), which was the subject of a terrorist attack . Wiltshire Police has now apologised for the incident and said the officer's motivation was 'purely around enhancing public safety'. The force said that information obtained during the visit had been 'disposed of' Wales were reportedly called by a community officer asking for the names of customers who had bought the post-attack issue. David Jones, 63, was told by his local shop in Beddau, Pontypridd, that an officer had asked for his name after he bought a copy for his 21-year-old son, who studied French at university. He said: ‘I am astounded that this intrusion has occurred and wonder what right the police have to check up on what I and others are reading. 'Surely their time would be better spent hunting deranged people who want to behead citizens on our streets.’ Anne Keat, 77, was among those who ordered a copy of the publication  and said she was 'baffled' by police wanting the names of those who bought it . He said his newsagent told him that anther stockist in a nearby town had also been asked about Charlie Hebdo customers. ‘I cannot fathom out what link they think exists between a local person in a small town in South Wales, a satirical French magazine and some terrorists,’ he said. ‘Trust in the police is low and this type of official or unofficial snooping on private individuals will not improve the situation. They are acting like the Stasi.’ Grandmother Ann Keat, 77, was also told by her newsagent in Corsham that police had asked for her name, and the names of others who had ordered Charlie Hebdo. The retired nurse said: ‘I was cross – what’s wrong with me wanting to buy it? It’s an intrusion, and in terms of free speech it’s worrying really.’ Hundreds of Britons queued for a copy of the £3.50 souvenir edition of the magazine, published following last month’s attack by Islamic extremists on its offices which left 12 people dead. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The Charlie Hebdo attack brought millions of people worldwide together to condemn those who seek to silence free speech. Twelve people were killed when gunmen (pictured) stormed the office of Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7 . The Paris massacre led to an outpouring of support around the world, including the 'Je Suis Charlie' message . ‘It is therefore alarming that overzealous police officers are attempting to find out who has bought a perfectly legal publication. We have to hope that these are isolated cases.’ Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights organisation Liberty, said the officers ‘may have had good intentions, but the road to oppression is paved that way’.

"Hands-on: Ed Miliband holding his newborn son Samuel in 2010. The Labour leader has floated plans to double the length of paternity leave and increase statutory paternity pay from £100 a week to £260 . New fathers are to be offered a month of paternity leave under a £150million Labour plan to encourage them to be more hands-on with their children. Labour leader Ed Miliband today promises a sharp increase in paternity pay to £260-a-week – the equivalent of the minimum wage – so more working fathers can afford to take time off. But the plan has faced some criticism from business leaders, who warn it will cause uncertainty and staff shortages for employers, especially small firms. It comes after Labour has faced sustained criticism for being anti-business. But the party claimed 'good' businesses will welcome the policy as a way to encourage both men and women to stay in work. Mr Miliband unveiled the 'Father's Month', expected to help 400,000 men a year, as part of a coordinated push of family-friendly policies. It includes increasing free childcare for three and four year olds from 15 to 25 hours a week and guaranteeing breakfast and after school clubs from 8am to 6pm. He said: 'The modern British family needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help. 'Parents work long and stressful hours, at different times of the day, and it is increasingly tough to balance this with giving our kids the best start in life they can get.' Mr Miliband, a father of two sons, said more and more fathers want to play a hands-on role in childcare particularly but are 'frustrated by out-dated laws and entitlements'. He criticised the Tory plan for a married couple's tax break, which will cost £700million but only help one in five families with children. 'At the heart of Labour's plan, is the belief that Britain succeeds when modern working families succeed,' Mr Miliband said. 'That means giving Dads, as well as Mums, the chance to spend more time at home in the those crucial weeks after babies have been born.' The idea of offering fathers a month off work when they have a child was first put forward last year by the left-leaning IPPR think tank. Labour claims it would benefit up to 400,000 families a year. Under existing rules new fathers qualify for a statutory £138.18 a week, equivalent to £3.45 an hour for a 40-hour week, with employers encouraged to make up the gap in the employee's usual pay. Only just over half of new fathers (55 per cent) take it up at present. Bringing the taxpayer-funded contribution up to minimum wage level would increase take-up to around 70 per cent, the IPPR estimates, at a cost to the Treasury of around £150 million in 2015-16. Scroll down for video . Mr Miliband insisted the modern British family 'needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help' Mr Miliband today met Sarah Phillis and her son Milo at her home in Peckham, south east London, as he unveiled plans for a significant boost to paternity leave if it wins the election . Ed Miliband today spoke of his fear that being leader of the Labour party means he does not see his children enough. He insisted that being a father was more important than being Labour leader, but struggles to find time for his wife Justine and his family. Appearing on ITV's This Morning, he said: 'I’ve got two young boys of four and five and the greatest pleasure in life is spending time with them and Justine. 'It is really hard because like many, many parents, you’re working long hours and you become more and more aware of how important that quality time is. Part of the thing I’ve learnt to try and do is try and carve out that time with them, mainly obviously at weekends, but to carve out that time because I don’t want them to think of me as a dad who wasn’t around. 'My job as leader of the Labour party is important but my most important job is being a good dad.' With the party's spending plans under close scrutiny ahead of the election, Labour said House of Commons figures showed its policy of extending free childcare to three and four-year-olds - paid for by a bank levy - would save 'significantly' more in tax credits than the cost of the extra paternity pay. 'The modern British family needs government to be more flexible in what it does to help,' Mr Miliband said. 'Thanks to the last Labour government, fathers have two weeks' paid paternity leave. 'Millions of families have benefited, with parents saying this has helped them support each other, share caring responsibilities and bond with their children. But the money isn't great - and too many dads don't take up their rights because they feel they have to go back to work so they can provide for their family.' He pointed to the party's weekend announcement that it would end the 'crazy' situation of underused and mothballed Sure Start children's centres by restoring an obligation on councils to provide childcare via them. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said using private and charity providers would mean 50,000 new places could be laid on at no cost to the taxpayer - a claim disputed by campaigners. The Pre-School Learning Alliance welcomed the commitment to restore facilities but said 'it would be short-sighted to suggest that such an initiative would not require additional funding from government'. Labour says increased paternity pay will be funded via the current tax credit budget. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves, who is expecting her second baby, dismissed the concerns, dismissed the concerns of business about the impact of the plan . Last year when the plans were floated, BCC executive director of policy Adam Marshall said: 'Parental leave has changed more than five times already over the past decade, and every time it changes employers face significant adjustment costs.' Last night John Longworth, BCC director general, said: 'The 'father's month' amounts to a tax on business. 'Although well-meaning, proposals such as this create very real costs for businesses, which can in turn lead to reduced productivity, reduced growth and fewer jobs,' he said. 'It also raises the spectre of a dad being off for a month, returning to work for a couple of weeks, and then asking for shared parental leave as soon as he is eligible – which could be hugely disruptive to small and mid-sized firms whose success depends on the talents and contributions of each employee.' But Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves, who is expecting her second baby, dismissed the concerns. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is exactly what people used to say about maternity leave, that it was a big burden on businesses. But the reality is, what good businesses know, is that it is really important to keep women in the workplace once they have children and not let them drift off because they can't manage work and family life. That's increasingly the case for dads.' 'Good employers like Asda, National Grid and Citibank are already giving more than the statutory paternity leave.' 'What good businesses know is that unless they give that flexibility to mums and dads, they are likely to lose their best employees as they will go to a business that does value them, or they will sadly drop out of the workforce altogether.'","Labour leader Ed Miliband announces increase in leave from a fortnight .

"A shocking new study has found that people from the black and Hispanic communities are denied mortgages at more than twice the rate of whites and Asians. The study by online real estate database Zillow found that white people who apply for a conventional mortgage are denied just over 10 percent of the time and Asians 13.3 percent. By contrast, blacks who apply for the same loans are denied nearly 28 percent of the time and Hispanics are denied 22 percent of the time. A shocking new Zillow study has found that people from the black and Hispanic communities are denied mortgages at more than twice the rate of whites and Asians . 'It's clear that the housing playing field remains strikingly unequal in this country,' said Zillow Chief Economist Stan Humphries. One reason said Humphries is that whites tend to make more money than blacks and Hispanics, which makes qualifying for a loan much easier. 'Black and Hispanic applicants for conventional home loans make roughly $20,000 less per year than white applicants, resulting in much higher denial rates,' he said. According to Zillow's analysis of 2013 race and homeownership data from the federal government, the overall homeownership rate in the U.S. is 63.5 percent. Among whites the rate is 71.1 percent, compared to 57.8 percent for Asians, 41.9 percent for blacks and 45.2 percent for Hispanics. The difference in home ownership between black and white households is the same now as it was in 1900, reports CNN Money. Prices in black and Hispanic neighborhoods grew faster during the economic boom, but fell even harder when the housing bubble burst . The difference in home ownership between black and white households is the same now as it was in 1900 . Prices in neighborhoods with a higher concentration of blacks and Hispanics grew faster during the boom, and fell even harder when the housing bubble burst. 'Black and Hispanic communities are clustered in areas that saw huge run-ups in home values prior to the recession, and even larger drops during the crash,' said Humphries. But there are some reasons for optimism according to Humphries. 'Home values in black and Hispanic communities are expected to rise faster over the coming year, and the data shows that Federal Housing Administration-backed loans have proven to be a viable and critical source of financing in minority communities,' he said. The racial divide in home prices can be partly explained by geography and the discrepancy is most intense in some of the nation's most volatile markets. In Los Angeles, home prices in black and Hispanic neighborhoods are still 20 percent below peak levels, while prices in the city's white enclaves have rebounded sharply and have appreciated beyond previous peaks in the Asian communities.","Research shows a big difference between mortgage refusal rates depending on ethnic group .

"Two in three parents are putting their children's lives at risk by strapping them in to wrongly fitted car seats. And that has soared by more than a third in just five years - putting up to seven out of ten youngsters in danger. The figures come just days after the Department for Transport  revealed the number of children killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads has risen for the first time in two decades. The number of youngsters killed or seriously injured rose by 3 per cent to 2,060 in the year to September 2014, official statistics revealed. Two in three parents are putting their children's lives at risk by strapping them into seats incorrectly (file pic) A study revealed that 71 per cent of seats in England and Wales did not meet minimum fitting standards . It also coincides with government measures for a new safer child-seat system - based on a child's height rather than their age - which is now going through parliament. Details are revealed in a new report into car-seat safety problems by road safety campaign group Good Egg, which has tested 20,500 child safety seats in England, Wales and Scotland since 2002. It found 71 per cent of seats tested last year in England and Wales and 64 per cent in Scotland did not meet minimum fitting standards. This was a significant increase from 47 per cent in 2010 and the average of 57 per cent the last five years. Online purchases and second-hand seats have also contributed to the rise in incorrect fitting. A Which? survey last year revealed nine out of ten shops – including major high street names – made 'potentially lethal mistakes' when showing parents how to install their child and baby car seats properly. The table shows the checklist a parent should follow when purchasing the right seat for their child . Jan James, chief executive of Good Egg Safety said: 'Two thirds of the children and babies in Britain are now at risk as a result of the seat being improperly fitted, incorrect for the size and weight of the child, or wrong for the make and model of vehicle.' She added: 'The saddest thing is most parents and grandparent genuinely want what is best for their children, they just don't know how to choose the right seats nor how to fit them.' The safety group says parents who buy a child seat in a shop should insist a trained sales assistant helps fit the seat, and parents should specify their child's height and weight and the car's model before buying. Its report says: 'If the seat arrives without clear instructions for fitting and testing, then send it back. 'If you're offered a second hand seat, just politely decline. There is very little chance that a second hand seat will be right for your car and your child. You wouldn't entrust your child with a stranger yet that's exactly what you are doing if you place them in a seat without knowing its history'. However tempting the price may be, road safety officers advise against buying second hand child car seats – most only have a life span of about five years, and if they have ever been involved in an accident they might not offer full protection. Even if you want a bargain, you should buy new. Transport minister Robert Goodwill said: 'We are in the process of signing a new child seat specification. 'It gives a higher degree of protection and new standards that go on the height of a child, not the age.' Ministers say that moving to a system based on the child's height – rather than age - will make it much easier for parents to choose and fit the correct seat. Legislation currently going through Parliament will allow a new and safer standard of child seat - known as 'i-size' – to be used alongside existing ones in Britain. It will require a child to travel in a rearward position until the age of 15 months, provide side impact protection for better protection of the head and neck, and involve a more rigorous testing procedure for new designs, including an improved crash test dummy. Ben Willshire, group manager at the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) in Berkshire said it was developing a new 'star rating' system which will help consumers make an informed choice when buying a child seat and will include an assessment of the usability of the seat.","Number of parents strapping children in wrongly fitted car seats has risen .

"The deep web is a hive of illegal activity, rife with child pornography, drug deals and human trafficking. But because it is 'buried' so deep it is considered out of the reach of mainstream search engines and  many law enforcement agencies - until now. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has developed an engine dubbed Memex - a combination of memory and index - that not only scours content on this so-called dark net, but also identifies subtle patterns in activity. Scroll down for video . The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has developed a search engine dubbed Memex - a combination of memory and index - that not only scours content on the so-called dark net, it identifies patterns and associations that may be too subtle to be recognised by human investigators . Memex was announced by Darpa last year and the agency recently gave Scientific American a preview of the software. Darpa said: 'Today's web searches use a centralised, one-size-fits-all approach that searches the internet with the same set of tools for all queries. '[But] common search practices miss information in the deep web - the parts of the web not indexed by standard commercial search engines - and ignore shared content across pages.' Memex was designed to overcome these challenges by extending 'the reach of current search capabilities and quickly and thoroughly organise subsets of information based on individual interests.' The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. This has been likened to dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. It looks behind standard search results for patterns, links and similar behaviours. The software scours all aspects of the web - including those hidden in the dark net - to create data maps that might reveal clues about illegal activity. In particular, Darpa wants to use Memex to uncover human trafficking rings by searching for patterns in the number of online sex adverts being posted from certain regions, or porn sites featuring the same email addresses or phone numbers. These patterns could reveal links that human investigators could miss, explained Scientific American. 'We're envisioning a new paradigm for search that would tailor indexed content, search results and interface tools to individual users and specific subject areas, and not the other way around,' said Chris White, Darpa program manager. 'By inventing better methods for interacting with and sharing information, we want to improve search for everybody and individualise access to information. Ease of use for non-programmers is essential.' The Memex program gets its name from a hypothetical device described in 'As We May Think' - a 1945 article for The Atlantic Monthly. It was written by Vannevar Bush, director of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) during World War II. In the article, Memex was described as an analog computer that would supplement human memory. It would store and automatically cross-reference all of the user's books, records and other information. This cross-referencing, which Mr Bush called 'associative indexing', would let users quickly search large amounts of information, and gain insights from it. Targeting the deep web is also an initiative being developed in the UK. The Memex program gets its name from a hypothetical device described in a 1945 article for The Atlantic Monthly.

In December, Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) said a specialist unit was being set up to hunt down paedophiles using the dark net to share child pornography. The National Crime Agency and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) will use advanced technology to trace 'digital footprints' of criminals . In December, the UK government said a specialist unit was being set up  to hunt down paedophiles using the dark net to share child pornography. The National Crime Agency and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) will use advances in analysing images and communications to trace the 'digital footprints' left by the users who share them. Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Twitter and Yahoo will use proposed digital fingerprints, or hash values, of thousands of known child sex abuse images to prevent them  being shared. Google has also developed new technology that allows child abuse videos to be identified and blocked. Microsoft, Google and Mozilla have also said they will investigate ways of placing restrictions within their browsers to block people from accessing child pornography. Google and Microsoft have both also introduced a number of changes to their search functions globally. Google claims to have seen a five-fold reduction in the number of searches for child abuse images since these changes were made. However, these changes are thought to be partly responsible for driving much of the trade in child pornography into the dark net. Prime minister David Cameron said the new unit is aimed at 'shining a light on the web's darkest corners' as he announced a package of measures to tackle online child abuse. The National Crime Agency estimates that around 20,000 people from the UK use secret or encrypted networks each day. The dark net consists of a network of encoded websites that sit behind the publicly available websites and cannot be found with normal search engines. It came to prominence in 2012 when the FBI made a series of raids on Silk Road - an online marketplace described as the 'eBay for illegal drugs'. Figures compiled by the National Crime Agency suggest that use of the dark net rose by two thirds in 2012. Hidden capabilities that let users email and host file storage through encrypted and anonymous networks are provided by services the The Onion Router (Tor). Tor users currently represent 0.18 per cent of the total number of internet uses in the UK. However, in a recent investigation, GCHQ and the NCA were able to track down a British man who had been maintaining chat rooms and websites in the Far East and Eastern Europe that were used to share child pornography around the world. He was also offering advice to other paedophiles about how to hide their behaviour and was using software to keep himself anonymous. Analysis by experts at GCHQ allowed them to trace the man and he was later sentenced to three years in prison for making and distributing indecent images of children.","Memex was designed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .

"The family of a murder victim is suing a funeral home and a cemetery after their relative's casket popped open during her burial. Mother-of-five Nequia Webb-Davidson, 40, was shot and killed by her husband in a murder-suicide on January 12, 2014, just days after she filed an emergency protection order. As her body was lowered into the grave later that month, the lid scraped against the side and swung open, sending a pile of soil and stones onto the corpse. Grappling to recover the situation, cemetery employees started trying to dig around the plot to make it bigger - leaving the grieving relatives to look on in horror for hours. Eventually, they announced the burial would have to be postponed for a day while they re-sized the hole and cleaned the casket's inner lining. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Horrifying': Relatives of Nequia Webb-Davidson, who was shot dead by her husband in January 2014, were forced to watch cemetery workers try to force her casket into the ground as soil and rubble fell on her body . Far fewer relatives were able to attend the rescheduled service. In a lawsuit against J. Foster Phillips Funeral Home, Inc. in Jamaica, New York, and Rosehill Cemetery in Linden, New Jersey, the family accuses both firms of 'exacerbating' the tragedy of Webb-Davidson's death. 'It just was a horrifying sight,' Webb-Davidson's sister Kandice Webb told CBS2. 'They tried to fix it, you know make the hole a little bigger and what they did was make a mess... we sat there for hours trying to bury her. 'No one should have to go through that.' Brooklyn-born Webb-Davidson was killed at her family home in Virginia by her veteran husband Terrell Davidson, who served on four tours in Afghanistan and Iraq and reportedly suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. She left behind five children aged 13 to 21, and was described as 'compassionate' by her family. The suit, filed to Brooklyn Supreme Court on January 25, demands reimbursement for the casket, the burial and the funeral service. Tragic: Webb-Davidson was killed by her veteran husband Terrell Davidson, who served on four tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, before he turned the gun on himself. She had just filed for emergency protection from him . Devastation: Webb-Davidson's family, including her brother (pictured) said the incident exacerbated a tragedy . The family also requests damages for grief and suffering and expenses for relatives who stayed an extra day for the rescheduled service. The family attorney, Ron Katter, says the incident was evidence of incompetence and negligence for which both firms need to be held accountable. 'It was a desecration of the remains,' Katter told 1010 WINS. 'The funeral home showed an incredible amount of disrespect not only for the deceased, but for her family, who had to witness this incompetence and negligence. 'It is tragic enough that the family continues to feel the anguish of their sudden loss but, worse, they still have to experience the horrors that occurred that day at the graveside service.' Representatives for the funeral home and the cemetery have yet to respond to Daily Mail Online's request for a comment.","Nequia Webb-Davidson, 40, was killed by her husband in a murder-suicide in January 2014 days after she filed for emergency protection from him .

"Maggie Rizer and her husband Alex Mehran have welcomed their third child - a baby girl named Cecilia. The supermodel, 37, announced the happy news on her Instagram page this morning with a photo of herself cradling the newborn. In a heartfelt post, she wrote: 'We are so proud to welcome our daughter, Cecilia Kathryn Mehran. Named for two angels and the Patron Saint of music, heaven is surely filled with the most beautiful singing today.' New arrival: Maggie Rizer announced the birth of her daughter Cecilia on Instagram this morning . Cecilia is the first daughter for the couple who already have two young sons - Zander, three, and Quinn, who turns two in March. Ms Rizer, who now rarely models but remains in demand, despite having moved to San Francisco for her husband's work, was last seen on the catwalk in September 2014 at Michael Kors' New York Fashion Week show. Though her pregnancy was not public knowledge at the time, she would have been four months' pregnant - a point at which most expectant women will start to show a small bump. Changing shape: The supermodel shared a side-on photo of her eight-months-pregnant bump last month . Where did it go? Ms Rizer, pictured on her birthday in January with her husband and eldest son, didn't even look pregnant in this front-on snap, despite being eight months pregnant . But photos from Ms Rizer's Instagram show that she has remained supermodel slim throughout this pregnancy. In one photograph with her husband and son Zander, she does not even appear to be pregnant, although from the side it is clear that she has a sizeable bump. Ms Rizer, who originally hails from New York State, was one of the world's most popular models in the late Nineties and early 2000's. She stopped modeling in 2004 after it emerged that her stepfather, John Breen, who had been handling her finances, gambled away her entire fortune. Her professional earnings alone were estimated to be over $7million, though she also lost inheritance left by her biological father, Kevin Rizer, after his death from AIDS when she was 14. Since the loss of her father - her parents divorced when she was a baby when Kevin announced that he was gay - the model has been a staunch AIDS awareness activist. Baby on board: Ms Rizer was last seen on the catwalk in September 2014 at Michael Kors' New York Fashion Week show while four months' pregnant . These days, Ms Rizer says ordinary life holds far more appeal than fashion. In an interview with Refinery 29 in late 2012, she said she says she loves the 'civilised' Bay Area lifestyle with its 'BBQs, normal work hours, cars to transport you instead of cabs.' She even finds it hard to acknowledge her former fame: 'I get a lot of, ""Do people ever tell you that you look exactly like Maggie Rizer?"" And I give a lot of, ""Thanks, I hear that a lot."" I'm not good at owning up to it.' On her children, she said: 'I think there's something so special about having a sibling very close in age to you...' she says. I imagine they will play together, have the same friends, build forts together... 'There's nothing better that I can imagine then being 90 years old with Alex and having five kids, 25 grandchildren, and a zillion great-grandchildren to follow. And five or six golden retrievers at our feet.'","The supermodel, 37, and her husband Alex Mehran, have named their daughter Cecilia Kathryn .

"Mario Obed Meneses Lopez (pictured) and his 16-year-old girlfriend were arrested after a video showed him throwing their baby across a toom . A Mexican couple have been arrested after horrific images emerged of the father throwing his baby girl across the room - because her crying woke him up. Mario Obed Meneses Lopez, 21, and his 16-year-old girlfriend were arrested after a video was taken of him slinging the two-month-old baby girl around by her neck and throwing her across the room. Police were called by a concerned friend of the mother who surreptitiously filmed the attack and handed it to officers. The video showed Lopez lying in bed next to the screaming baby before swinging her around by her neck and flinging her across the room where she is heard crying out in terror. The mistreatment continues as Lopez is shown kicking the baby several times. The mother, who cannot be named because of her age, is heard telling him to stop, but does nothing to take the child away from him. She can be heard saying in the video: 'That's it Mario, leave her alone.' Prosecutors in Mexico City confirmed they have arrested the pair. The baby was subsequently taken to hospital and once she had been given the all clear by medics, she was taken into care. Medics said the baby girl suffered from numerous bruises - some  from the assault caught on video, but others which were from an earlier attack. Mario Obed Meneses Lopez pictured shortly before grabbing the two-month-old baby girl by her neck and throwing her across the room - just because her crying woke him up. She has now been taken into care . Carlos Orta Garcia, director of System for Family Development, said: 'We found evidence of cigarette burns and head trauma caused by separate attacks.' The abuse took place at a house  in Valle de Chalco Solidaridadoc, a municipality on the eastern outskirts of the metropolitan area of Mexico City. Police spokesman Fariol Jaramillo Munoz said: 'The man shown in the video had been living with his 16-year-old girlfriend. 'He was the father of the child and the baby is now a ward of court. 'Both of them now face prosecution for child abuse. 'The mother was an accessory because she failed to act despite the fact that she could clearly see the baby was being harmed.

"Rajedmiah Miah masqueraded as a good Samaritan by offering a drunk girl help to get home after a night out, then snatched her from the street and raped her . A man masquerading as a good Samaritan by offering a drunk girl help to get home after a night out snatched her from the street and raped her. The teenager had become separated from her friends in Newcastle while celebrating her 18th birthday, when Rajedmiah Miah approached her and offered to help her get home. But instead he put the girl, who was so drunk that she was vomiting, into a taxi and took her to his home where he locked his bedroom door and raped her. Newcastle Crown Court heard that the victim had been allowed to go out in to the city centre with friends for the first time to celebrate her birthday last September. The group went to a number of bars but by 2am her friends had gone and she was left alone in the Pink Room nightclub, in Westmoreland Road, Newcastle. A group of other girls started speaking to her and told a doorman they were concerned about the state she was in. Prosecutor Jonathan Devlin said: 'The doorman spoke to her and he said she was very drunk and he was concerned for her safety but he thought she was with friends, rather than being alone. 'She then left the nightclub and walked away from the area and was approached by the defendant. 'She told him she had lost her friends and he said he would help her find her way home.' Miah then hailed a taxi, which they got in. She had no idea where they were going and was falling asleep in the cab, the court heard. When they got to Miah's home in the west end of Newcastle, he helped her out and shepherded her into his shared house. Mr Devlin said: 'She was scared and didn't want to go in. 'He took her upstairs, went in his room, locked the door and pushed her onto his single bed. 'Others in the house heard her screaming and she banged on the wall. 'The defendant grabbed her by the arms, put his hand roughly over her mouth and raped her. 'Afterwards she began to hit him with her shoes.' Other people in the house saw her in a distressed state and tried to comfort her but she was hysterical and ran out. A man passing by came to her aid and took her to West Road police station to report what had happened. Mr Devlin said: 'It must have been clear to the defendant that she was very drunk. She vomited at least twice in his presence. 'Because of her intoxication she was particularly vulnerable. 'In hailing the taxi and taking her to his home, there was a limited amount of abduction and detention.' The teenager had become separated from her friends at the Pink Rooms in Newcastle while celebrating her 18th birthday, when Miah approached her and offered to help her get home. But he pushed the girl, who was so drunk she was vomiting, into a taxi and took her home where he locked his bedroom door and raped her . Miah, of Elswick, Newcastle pleaded guilty to rape and was jailed for six years and told he must sign the sex offender register for life. Judge John Evans told him: 'The victim, who had just turned 18, was celebrating her birthday and, perhaps not used to drinking a lot of alcohol, she found herself alone at the end of the evening and not in the best condition to find her way home. 'You encountered her on the streets and took the clearest advantage of her. 'All of that without any regard for the fact that you were not using contraceptives or for her expressed desire for you to stop what you were doing. 'As she has said to the police, this is a night that is likely to haunt her for some time. Caroline Goodwin, defending, said Miah initially approached the girl looking to help but then took advantage of her state. Miss Goodwin said: 'His intentions initially were good but I'm afraid what happened in the house completely and utterly changed that. 'This was a dreadful set of circumstances and he is remorseful and has found the whole experience quite shocking. 'He recognises what he did was utterly wrong and he should have known better. As Miah was jailed for six years, a court heard the teenager fears she will be haunted by memories of her 18th birthday for the rest of her life. Prosecutor Jonathan Devlin said: 'The victim says she has been left emotionally devastated by the offence. 'She says the memory of her 18th birthday will haunt her for the rest of her life.' After the case, Det Insp Sharon Chatterton, of Northumbria Police's public protection unit, said: 'Miah took advantage of a vulnerable woman he had pretended to help but instead took her to an address where he then raped her. 'I'd like to praise the victim for her courage and bravery throughout what was been an incredibly difficult time for her and I hope the sentence passed today, and the fact Miah is behind bars where he belongs, means she can move forward with her life. 'We would always encourage victims to come forward and speak to us.'","Rajedmiah Miah approached the teenager and offered to help her get home .

"A man in Georgia last week stumbled across what he now calls 'the best hunting story of my life'. Out looking for deer in the woods near his home in Chattahoochee Hills, Casey Sanders said he heard a shout before seeing a naked young man stranded by a creek. Shocked and suspicious, Sanders announced that he was armed and started filming the bizarre encounter, which took place on October 2. He soon figured out the confused twenty-something had attended the electronic dance festival TomorrowWorld, which was set on a 500-acre property not far away, but had finished four days earlier. Scroll down for video . Dazed and confused: A naked reveler from music festival TomorrowWorld in Chattahoochee Hills, Georgia, is found stranded in a creek on a nearby property four days after the dance party finished by a local hunter, who filmed the encounter on his phone . 'I was attacked': The stranger, who hasn't been identified, claims he was 'beaten up' and drugged by a group of men and then dumped in the woods, where he remained lost for four days . Appearing disoriented and admitting he wasn't sure what state he was in, the naked reveler eventually said he had been attacked while leaving the three-day jamboree, which concluded on September 28. 'Three guys, they beat the crap out of me,’ the stranger can be heard saying in the YouTube clip, The Houston Chronicle reported. ‘They drugged me out to the middle of nowhere. 'They stripped me down and they kicked me out.’ The man said he had spent 'days' looking for water and, once finding the stream, decided to stick by it. Sanders continued to interrogate the man from afar, asking him where he was from and his address, which the man could not remember. The man said he was from Atlanta, a one hour drive from Chattahoochee Hills, where TomorrowWorld was staged. He also begged Sanders not to call the police. After four minutes of filming, Sanders, now convinced the man needed help, stopped recording. In the comments section of the YouTube clip, he said she pent an hour helping the stranger out of the forest. Rural: TomorrowWorld took place on a 500-acre property in Chattahoochee Hills, a one hour drive from Atlanta, Georgia. Hundreds of DJ acts performed across eight stages over three days .

Sanders said the man remembered his phone number and called someone to come and pick him up from the main road using Sanders phone. 'I know I was confrontational at first, but what you don’t see is the hour after that of me getting him to safety,' Sanders wrote. 'I mean I did save his life and I didn't call the cops. 'Sorry I wasn't so trusting to (a) random stranger naked in the creek out in the middle of the woods who couldn't differ a dream from reality. 'I didn't exactly have a script in my head of this is what I will do when I find a naked man in a creek.' The raver has not been identified. It is unclear whether anyone was reported missing following the festival. Sanders video of the incident has received over 800,000 views.

"A cyclist has captured images of driver apparently using his mobile phone, laptop and headphones while behind the wheel of his Land Rover. The video was shot in Aberdeen's Queen's Road last week and was uploaded to YouTube by an anonymous poster known only as Cycle Cam. The motorist's actions have been condemned by road safety campaigners and the driver now faces a potential questioning by police. A cyclist using a head-mounted camera caught this image of a driver apparently using his mobile phone, laptop whilst driving with headphones over both ears . The pictures, shot from the head-mounted camera, captured the driver looking down at his phone as he cruised past the cycle lane on February 5. In the description accompanying the video, the cyclist wrote: 'This bloke is driving a three tonne Land Rover in town, looking at a mobile phone, laptop and wearing headphones on both ears. 'Not only he's not paying any attention to the road, I suspect he's not even on this planet.' He adds: 'I just thought he was on a mobile phone like dozens of people on my daily commute.' After overtaking the cyclist, the man driving the Land Rover gets stuck in traffic, allowing the biker to catch up and confront him. The cyclist uses a light to get the driver's attention and then points out his open laptop, mobile phone and headphones before the motorist drives off into the distance. Police Scotland have said that no-one has been charged in connection with the video but that officers were following a 'line of inquiry'. Neil Grieg, research and the policy director at the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), said the driver should be 'ashamed'. The cyclist saw the man as he drove past him but then cycled up behind him and filmed him using a light . The driver then drove ahead of the cyclist, who regularly posts videos from the road on to YouTube . But when the Land Rover driver became stuck in traffic, the cyclist caught up with and confronted him . The incident happened in Aberdeen's Queen's Road (pictured) shortly after 5am on February 5 . He said: 'It's a clear example of breaking the law on mobile phone use and the driver should be ashamed to be taking such risks for the sake of keeping in touch. 'No call is more important that someone's life. 'The IAM have no problem with camera users sharing their footage with Police Scotland so that they can consider if formal action is required.' He added: 'Ideally we would like to see more police out there enforcing the law rather than relying on amateurs. 'No one taking such footage should be pursuing a car just to get a good shot. 'Concentrating on catching someone out is also a distraction from the real task of driving or riding safely.' Driver caught reading the paper while behind the wheel on the motorway . A driver was seen reading the newspaper while travelling at 55mph on the motorway with a child in the passenger seat . A man was captured reading the newspaper while travelling on the motorway at 55mph with a young girl in the passenger seat. Shocked passengers on the M5 took photographs of the man as he drove down the outside lane near Junction 11 in Cheltenham during rush hour yesterday morning. Duaine Peacock, who was being driven to work at the time, sent the photograph to the Gloucestershire Road Police Twitter account. 'I was shocked. It takes the mick a bit,' the 20-year-old trainee mechanic said. 'I was just coming down the motorway in the passenger seat, and I saw an old car doing 55mph in the middle lane. When we went to overtake him I saw that he was reading with the interior light on. 'And the worst thing was he had his little girl in the passenger seat. She was a very young child, I’d say three or four years old. 'He should have been paying more attention. ' What if someone was to break suddenly to avoid something. It could cause a big pile-up. 'It’s things like that the police get called out to daily. It only takes a split second and then that’s it - you’ve had it.' Kevin Roseblade, Head of Tri Force Collision Investigation at Gloucester Constabulary, said the driver in question had put a number of people in danger. He said: 'Although driving could be considered an everyday activity for many of us it still requires 100 per cent concentration 100 per cent of the time. 'Whether the driver pictured is reading a newspaper, map, directions or some other form of written material it is extremely dangerous with potentially fatal consequences for him, his passengers and other road users.' Aberdeen's 'Cycle Cam' YouTube poster is not the only cyclist to attempt to shame drivers with videos shot from helmet and handlebar cameras. Lewis Dediare - also known as 'Traffic Droid' - has a camera mounted on a three-foot pole protruding from his modified bicycle. The 39-year-old also carries a ruler to measure  his distance from cars and brandishes  a 'red card' at offending road users. Like Mr Cherry, he also uploads his footage to YouTube and Twitter and will often hand it over to police so the drivers can be further punished. Lewis Dediare - aka 'Traffic Droid' - also posts footage from his helmet and handlebar cams online . Mr Dediare's antics were filmed for Channel 4 documentary The Complainers last year. He says his naming and shaming video clips have resulted in around 200 police warnings every year, as well as several prosecutions. The telecoms officer set out to take action against poor driving in 2009 when he was hit by a car which failed to indicate as drove into his lane while out cycling. He broke two ribs and also injured his back and hip, but when he learned the driver had only been given a driving education course he felt more needed to be done to warn motorists of the dangers they pose to cyclists.","Cyclist on way home from work earlier this month captures video .

"Boxed macaroni and cheese is off the menu at the White House. Michelle Obama said she banned it from her family's diet after being alerted to its processed ingredients. In an interview for the March issue of Cooking Light magazine, the mother-of-two recalled how her daughters used to love the cheap and easy-to-make meal. However, Sam Kass, the family's former personal chef, vehemently opposed the boxed variety and decided to give a quick tutorial to highlight the 'unhealthiness' of the product. Scroll down for video . Slap up supper: Michelle Obama said she banned boxed macaroni and cheese from her family's diet after being alerted to its processed ingredients . Mrs Obama said that Kass gave her daughter Malia, who was about eight years old at the time, a block of cheese and challenged her to turn it into the same powdery consistency as the ingredient in the mac and cheese box. The youngster apparently spent 30 minutes trying to 'pulverize' the block of cheese into dust with no joy. Mrs Obama said from that point she and her family stopped eating macaroni and cheese out of a box 'because cheese dust is not food, as was the moral of the story.' The Obama's diet is now apparently completely rid of processed foods. However, in the past when Mrs Obama was working, shopping and cooking, she admitted it was tough being so health conscious. 'Sometimes I would use processed food a little bit more. I relied on takeout probably more than I should’ve,' the 51-year-old recalled. But now, as she marks the fifth anniversary of her anti-childhood-obesity initiative Let's Move!, the first lady wants to arm families with the knowledge she didn't have in the past. 'It’s doable - people just need the training and the education. 'What we do know is that the food you cook is healthier, and it can be more affordable, but it takes some skills,' she said. A couple of the first lady's tips include, banishing canned juices, learning how to cut up a whole chicken and making pasta dishes from scratch. In an interview for the March issue of Cooking Light magazine, the mother-of-two recalled how her daughters used to love the cheap and easy-to-make meal . Not for me: Mrs Obama says through a better diet she hopes to still be mobile as an 80 or 90-year-old woman . 'It’s some tomatoes, it’s some basil, it’s boiling pasta, it’s adding in a little flavoring and seasoning, and you have a delicious meal. It’s quick. It’s fast. It becomes faster the more you do it,' she chimed. Growing up in a working class family, Mrs Obama said her mother was very nifty with food. She would shop on a budget and create a menu plan. Leftovers from Sunday roast beef dinners would be used for lunches on Mondays and Tuesdays. Other favorite home-cooked dishes growing up included lemon chicken and lasagna but she was less keen on 'liver Wednesdays.' Mrs Obama says through a better diet she hopes to be an active, globetrotting  80 or 90-year-old woman. 'I want to be able to walk up a temple or a ruin on my own and see the world. And I can only do that if I've been investing in my health now.' The Chicago native also sites physical activity as a key ingredient to success, something which she has introduced through her Let’s Move Active Schools program. Touching further on her eating habits at home, Mrs Obama says that she and Barack have dinner almost every night together around 6:30pm.

"After becoming a hero in New England thanks to his play on the field in Super Bowl XLIX, Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler is  becoming known for his heroics off the gridiron as well. The Super Bowl champion paid a visit to Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts on Friday and told sick patients, 'You can do anything.' The rookie defensive back, 24, sat and talked with children, took pictures and signed autographs during the visit. Scroll down for video . Malcolm Butler (right) took pictures and signed autographs during a visit to Boston Children's Hospital . During his visit, Butler told patients: 'If you work hard and do the right thing, you can do anything' The rookie, 24, was the hero of Super Bowl XLIX for the New England Patriots despite his limited playing time . The unlikely star, who worked at a Popeyes chicken restaurant in Mississippi before joining the Patriots, also handed out signed football gloves, the Boston Herald reported. He began his visit by meeting with patients on long-term stays and then did a special Q&A session at the hospital's in-house radio studio that was broadcast to every patient's room. Sam Clark, 17, who is recovering from open-heart surgery after being born with cardiomyopathy, was one of the hosts. Butler told Clark and others: 'If you work hard and do the right thing, you can do anything.' Clark took Butler's message quite seriously and said he 'won't give up until the clock strikes zero'. Butler visited with Conner Hicks, 12 (left) and Sam Clark, 17 (right). Clark is recovering from open-heart surgery after being born with cardiomyopathy . A Boston Children's spokeswoman said Butler's visit helped patients take their minds off of being sick . During the interview, Butler also answered questions about the Chevy Colorado pickup truck he is supposed to be getting from quarterback Tom Brady. Brady was awarded the truck after winning Super Bowl Most Valuable Player honors and vowed to give it to Butler. It sounds like Butler will not be keeping the red model of the Chevy that was on the field in Arizona. Butler said: 'Yeah, I'm getting the truck. I just have to call the dealership. 'I'll probably get it black or blue.' An update about the truck Butler is getting from Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady was provided during the visit. Butler said he was getting the truck and that 'I'll probably get it black or blue' The unlikely star also handed out signed football gloves (pictured) during his visit to Boston Children's . The patients at Boston Children's were inspired by Butler's visit and he was inspired by them in return . The undrafted free agent appeared in 11 games this season, recording 15 tackles and three passes defended. The pick he made at the goal line that allowed the Patriots to maintain their 28-24 lead over the Seattle Seahawks and win the Super Bowl was his only interception of the season for the Pats. Boston Children's spokeswoman Kristen Dattoli said: 'It takes your mind off of being sick for a little while, and that is truly the best gift that you can give these patients.'","New England Patriots cornerback paid a visit to the hospital on Friday .

"Senior NBC executives have met to discuss what to do next about the growing Brian Williams crisis after further examples  of his apparent habit of embellishing and exaggerating old stories to make himself look better emerged over the weekend . Williams, who not only hosts NBC Nightly News but is also managing editor of the country’s highest rated newscast, announced on Saturday that he was taking a temporary leave of absence after questions arose over his admission to making false on-air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while in Iraq in 2003. But if Williams hoped that move might take the heat of him, he was sorely mistaken after new reports emerged casting doubts on old claims that he had experienced a similar close call in Israel in 2006 and been robbed at gunpoint in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank in the 1970s. NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke held a meeting with NBC News executives at his house on Sunday to discuss what to do next about the growing scandal engulfing news anchor Brian Williams . Former Today show host Katie Couric tweeted on Monday that she had no interest in replacing Williams - despite rumors linking her with his job . With much at stake for parent company NBCUniversal, CEO Steve Burke is reported to have held a meeting with NBC News executives at his house on Sunday to discuss what to do, reports Politico. The network has so far refused to comment on when or whether Williams will return and who will decide his future, although NBC News announced on Friday that an internal investigation had been launched. By Sunday night - and with the scandal not looking like going away anytime soon - the embattled news anchor announced that he was backing out of an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show scheduled for Thursday. Williams had spread the story of his helicopter being under attack during a previous Late Show interview with Letterman in 2013. Former Today show host Katie Couric has been rumored as a possible replacement for Williams, but on Monday she denied any interest in taking over as Nightly News anchor. 'Been out of pocket – any rumors about me and NBC completely untrue. Wishing my friends at my former home the best during this tough time,' she tweeted. In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of an RPG that had been fired at his helicopter in Iraq in 2003 . Since Williams' initial apology on Wednesday, questions have been raised about several previous claims including that he saw a body or bodies in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005. His remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in New Orleans' French Quarter, the area where Williams was staying. On Sunday fresh footage emerged of him lying yet again about the 2003 Iraq war story that has got him into so much hot water days earlier. In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television Williams repeated his claim that a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his helicopter before claiming that he had been close enough to stare down the barrel of the weapon. 'I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and had hit the chopper in front of ours. And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here,' Williams told his young interviewer prior to a speaking engagement at the campus. During the same interview Williams also recalls a close call in Israel in 2006 when he also claims he was lucky to escape rocket fire, reports Mediaite. 'I've been very lucky to have survived a few things that I've been involved in,' said Williams in 2007. Staying off air: Brian Williams has cancelled an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. He an appearance in 2013 he gave a false account of how a helicopter he was in was hit by an RPG in Iraq . 'The war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back where there were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.' Yet Williams' original report on the July 2006 incident tells a rather less dramatic version of events. It does not reference anything close to rockets passing 'just beneath' his chopper and nor does he make any claims about being lucky to be alive. 'The trails of smoke and dust visible out the window are where Katyusha rockets have landed - in this case in the uninhabited Israeli countryside, and in some cases they have set fire to the surrounding brush. The missiles are unguided and random. And plentiful,' writes Williams. 'Then, I noticed something out the window. From a distance of six miles, I witnessed a rocket launch. A rising trail of smoke, then a second rocket launch, an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward Israel.' But, in the 2007 interview, he told the student: 'I've been very, very lucky the way my life has turned out.' Another old story often repeated by Williams about his bravery growing up in a quiet New Jersey suburb is being questioned by local residents in the light of his admission that he lied about taking enemy fire in Iraq. An old story often repeated by Brian Williams about his bravery growing up in the quiet New Jersey suburb of Red Bank, pictured, is being questioned after he admitted lying about his bravery in Iraq . Williams, pictured as a high school senior in the 1970s, when he claimed he was mugged at gunpoint . Local residents in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank are questioning the credibility of a story Williams told Esquire magazine in 2005 about being mugged at gunpoint during the 1970s. Williams recalls being left 'looking up at a thug's snub-nosed .38 while selling Christmas trees out of the back of a truck.' According to his story he was trying to help a local church when the thief grabbed his money. 'That wasn't a bad job, until a guy came up and stuck a .38-caliber pistol in my face and made me hand over all the money. Merry Christmas, right? Of course, I suddenly appreciated the other jobs I thought I hated,' Williams recalled when he told New Jersey Monthly in 2008. But several longtime Red Bank residents aren't convinced by Williams' claims. 'I would highly doubt he's telling the truth,' Danny Murphy told the New York Post. 'I find it hard to believe anyone was held up in this area in the '70s. It was very safe,' said Murphy who owned a restaurant just a few blocks from where Williams claims he was accosted. The Post spoke to several residents who recall the area being so safe at the time that kids could walk around alone at night on their own. 'It was never dangerous here,' said Yolanda DeMaria, 93. 'It was a very peaceful town, a lovely town. It was a small town with a dress shop and a five-and-dime. No one locked their cars.' Another local resident also found Williams' claims difficult to take seriously. 'Don't listen to Brian Williams,' said Les Carbone, 85. 'He's going to tell you a lot of things. I doubt he was robbed at gunpoint. I was born in Red Bank, there were no crimes like that. Tell Brian Williams to stop lying.' In a memo on Saturday to NBC News staff, that was released by the network, the anchorman had said that it had become 'painfully apparent' that he has become a distracting news story. Williams announced that was taking himself off the broadcast for several days with weekend anchor Lester Holt set to fill in. 'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny . A source told the DailyMail.com Williams will not be involved in any of the day-to-day editing of the program during his absence. It has been repeatedly reported that NBC executives were warned a year ago about Williams constantly inflating his biography. The New York Times reports that it had got to the point where it was a joke in the news division but 'there was no one around to pull his chain when he got too over-the-top'. NBC News refused to comment Saturday on when or whether Williams would return and who would decide his future. Williams, however, said he would be back. 'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions,' Williams said in his memo. 'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us,' he wrote. There was no indication by Williams, who has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2004, that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast on Friday. He signed off as he usually does, saying he hoped people would be back to see him on Monday. Holt did mention Williams' leave in Saturday's newscast. 'A word tonight about our colleague Brian Williams, who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he's covered,' Holt said before reading Williams' memo to viewers. Nightly News has reigned as the top-rated evening newscast over its competition on CBS and ABC. Williams' importance to NBC News goes beyond his anchor status, said Al Tompkins, a faculty member for broadcast and online at The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. 'He sets the tone of the network. It may not be as critical as when (Walter) Cronkite was CBS' anchor, in every way, but he is more than a face,' he said. Williams' absence itself is a delicate challenge, according to Tompkins. 'He can't be gone long. The timing will be critical - too short and it won't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough, and too long and he looks like damaged goods,' he said.","Nightly News anchor Brian Williams is engulfed in a growing scandal after he admitted to lying about a 2003 Iraq war story .

"Helen Chan, the mother of convicted Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan, has made an impassioned plea for her son's life to be spared as he, along with Myuran Sukumaran, face execution by firing squad this month. On the ABC-TV Four Corners program she described his daily life as 'every day he is walking in the valley of death' Raji Sukumaran, meantime, has on Monday blamed the Australian Federal Police for her son's plight after they tipped off Indonesian authorities but those same officials insist they would do the same again and also into the future. 'It's a strange thing to wish to spend the rest of your life in prison. But we don't want them to die,' she said. The families of the Australians on death row have made a trip to Jakarta's presidential palace on to plead for the two Sydney men to be spared. Scroll down for video . Helen Chan, mother of Andrew Chan leaves the the National Commission on Human Rights in Jakarta. The families of condemned Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will lodge an appeal as lawyers for the pair plan their next legal move. The ringleaders of the so-called Bali Nine face execution this month for the 2005 heroin smuggling operation . Helen Chan, mother of Australian death row prisoner Andrew Chan, accompanied by her son Michael, has pleaded to Indonesian authorities to spare her son from the death penalty . Raji Sukumaran, mother of convicted Australian drug-smuggler, Myuran Sukumaran, reacts after making an emotional appeal to Indonesian authorities not to carry out the execution of her son during a media conference in Jakarta on Monday. The mothers of the two Australians facing the executive begged authorities to 'spare our sons' lives', as their lawyers revealed plans for a last-gasp legal bid .

He is willing to face it, he is not ignoring his wrongdoing,' she said. 'This is what I am proud of. I feel that he is very down to earth - facing death every day, but not crying or making a scene. 'Therefore this time when I see him, although I am sad, I have inner peace.' Her son Andrew told Four Corners that he will continue to read and stay fit. 'Here I am, I sit here and I study. People say I can't. I sit here on a death-row sentence and most people turn around and go, ""It's a waste of time."" I believe it's not. I believe the Lord has a purpose for me. And it's not here and it's not to die.' Bali Nine duo Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) could be executed by the end of the month .

Raji Sukumaran and Chinthu Sukumaran, the family members of death-row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran leave after visiting him at Kerobokan Prison in Bali . Sukumaran's mother Raji and his brother Chinthu along with Chan's mother Helen and his brother Michael will meet with Indonesia's national human rights organisation Komnas HAM to set forth the legal battle in a bid to save the condemned pair's lives. 'Our days are very difficult, we can't stop thinking of what will happen and the violent way he will be killed. My mum keeps thinking about his and Andrew's dead body being handed to her, she is having nightmares,' Chinthu Sukumaran said. 'Why is it that the Indonesian president does not give him a chance and have pity on us being aged parents?' Ms Chan told Four Corners. 'We are old and in poor health and we do not have long to live, therefore we would not like to see our son go before us.' It follows after the lawyer who represented the Bali Nine ringleaders when they were first sentenced to death row is putting his job on the line by claiming he has new evidence that could save the duo. Australians on death row Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are scheduled for execution this month. 'I was stupid. I didn't really think through the consequences or anything. Somebody asked me to do something and I just sort of did it' Myuran Sukumaran said to Four Corners . In an extraordinary twist, Muhammad Rifan says he has 'never revealed evidence' that could discredit him but he was prepared to ' take the heat' for the Australian drug smugglers, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who are expected to face the firing squad by the end of the month. 'It's something that implicates us, it could discredit me. But for them I will take it. I told Myuran it's okay,' he said. 'It's one last thing I can do for them.' 'Those judges, I believe they were very sorry because after sentencing them to death, they told me that was not want they wanted. 'This highlights the problems that time, between the Indonesian government and the Australian government. 'Look, you know, I think every criminal, what rushes to their mind, they're not gonna get busted, full stop,' said Andrew Chan . 'I see at that time, the judges were not independent in sentencing the case.' Even though the families blame the Australian Federal Police for the son's fate, Mike Phelan, who led the Australian probe into the Bali Nine, said: 'I think it's a tragedy that we've got young lives that are potentially facing the death penalty, but I believe it was a successful operation and, you know, taking eight kilograms of heroin, which is a very significant amount of heroin, off the streets is a significant operation.' Sukumaran admitted on the ABC program: 'I was stupid. I didn't really think through the consequences or anything. Somebody asked me to do something and I just sort of did it because they were my friends and I trusted them and I believed in them. 'Look, you know, I think every criminal, what rushes to their mind, they're not gonna get busted, full stop,' said Andrew Chan. But a final clear warning from Mr Phelan. 'Even with the aid of hindsight, should the same set of circumstances present themselves again with another syndicate or other people, we would exactly the same thing.'","Helen Chan, mother of Bali Nine drug smuggler Andrew Chan, has pleaded for Indonesia to spare her son's life .

"Dutch police have uncovered a city centre cannabis farm after spotting a remarkable lack of snow on the roof of one home, while neighbouring buildings suffered a heavy covering. Officers in the city of Haarlem, 12 miles west of Amsterdam, raided the otherwise unremarkable home after spotting it had a snow-free roof despite heavy snowfall only hours earlier. The lack of snow suggested the temperature inside the building was so high that the snow was melting more rapidly than on neighbours' homes - a tip-off from Mother Nature that Dutch police are turning to with increasing frequency in order to catch cannabis cultivators in the winter months. Scroll down for video . Evidence: Officers in the city of Haarlem, 12 miles west of Amsterdam, raided the otherwise unremarkable home after spotting it had a snow-free roof despite heavy snowfall only hours earlier . Cultivation of marijuana requires the temperature inside a building to be far higher than in normal properties, with growers using expensive lighting rigs to ensure the plants are tricked into believing they are growing in a country with a warmer climate. While in summer months the effects are not unnoticeable to anybody standing outside the building, the effects of keeping the plant at a steady 29C can lead to unwanted consequences. With snow almost guaranteed in the Netherlands' mid-winter, police are increasingly looking out for houses with a tell-tale frost free roof to locate the otherwise unremarkable residential houses drug lords favour when creating cannabis farms. In fact the technique has become so common that Dutch police last week released details of several cannabis farms they discovered using the technique - including a photograph of the building in Haarlem. Last Monday officers used the same premise to raid a farm in the city of Zutphen, where they found a total of 88 cannabis plants. Two days later one person was arrested in Arnhem in similar circumstances. Not everybody is happy with the technique, however. After Haarlem police revealed the unorthodox method, Twitter users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided as potential drug lords, as their homes suffer similar snow-free roofs. After  police in Haarlem (pictured) revealed their unorthodox method of identifying cannabis farms, Twitter users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided . The arrests may come as something as a surprise to those who thought growth of cannabis was legal in the Netherlands, which has long had a relatively relaxed attitude towards the drug. However the law states that no more than five cannabis plants can be grown in any one, as that is believed to be the cultivation limit for personal use. Any more than five plants and the grower is considered to be a preparing the drugs for sale, which is illegal. Possession of cannabis is restricted to no more than five grams in a public place. The Dutch police technique of visually checking rooftops for snow is something of a low-maintenance adaption of the way British police use helicopters equipped with heat-seeking technology to identify buildings giving off abnormally high levels of heat. Speaking in 2013, Martin Knowles, West Midlands Police Deputy Air Operations Manager, said: 'Our thermal cameras can detect unusually high temperatures coming from properties several thousand feet away – anyone growing cannabis on a commercial scale, using rows of heat lamps, runs the very real risk their criminality will be rumbled from the skies.'","House in Haarlem, Netherlands had snow free roof despite heavy snowfall .

"Smiling for the camera as he holds a young girl to his chest, this is the suspected paedophile who was allegedly punched to death by a British father. Sandro Rottman, 43, who was arrested over child pornography a few days before his death, posted the image on Twitter. The German wrote: ‘Just finished a day with the most beautiful girl in the Beach Club of Sotogrande. Hope one day I will have one my own.’ Scroll down for video . Accused: Kainth, 40, has been charged with homicide after allegedly attacking Sandro Rottman (pictured) British father Victor Kainth (left) allegedly beat a suspected paedophile to death after catching the man filming his daughter on his iPad while eating at a Spanish restaurant with his partner Gemma Hawkins (right) He died on Sunday after a man named locally as Devinder Kainth, 40, caught him photographing his daughter on an iPad and attacked him. Kainth was having a family meal at a restaurant in exclusive Sotogrande, on the Costa del Sol in Spain, when he confronted Rottman. The millionaire, a keen boxer, hurled the iPad to the ground before punching the German, who died in hospital of his injuries. Kainth was arrested and is being held at high security Botafuegos Prison, in the southern port of Algeciras. His partner Gemma Hawkins, 31, the mother of his daughter and two sons, has been interviewed by police. There was no sign of her last night at their home or at the £8,000-a-year school of two of the children. Miss Hawkins, from Kent, was described as a ‘blonde bombshell’ who ‘turned heads’. The millionaires’ playground of Sotogrande is known for its large houses and golf courses such as the world-famous Valderrama Club. It is a favourite of former prime minister Tony Blair as well as the Duchess of York and her daughters Beatrice and Eugenie. The head chef at the Spinnaker restaurant where the incident took place is Austrian Philip Hannig, who spent a year training under Gordon Ramsay. According to witnesses, Mr Kainth and his partner, Gemma Hawkins, were eating with their three children (pictured, above, with Ms Hawkins) when they started chatting to Sandro Rottman . Yesterday, details emerged of the attack on Saturday night. The owner of the Spinnaker restaurant told the Mail: ‘After an afternoon of friendly chatter, the British man suddenly told his family to leave. ‘Devinder looked at Sandro’s iPad and found pictures of his family which had been taken earlier that evening. He was shouting: “Why have you taken these?” Suddenly he told his family to get out of the bar. Five seconds later he hit Sandro so hard he fell to the floor. I think this knocked him out, or at least dazed him. ‘Then Devinder went crazy and started hitting Sandro. He must have hit him at least 20 times in the face and head. ‘[Sandro] had blood gurgling from his mouth. He was choking and struggling to breathe. He also had a big lump on the side of his head – no other visible cuts – just this big lump. ‘Then he was unconscious like he was in a coma. The waitress started screaming for help. We were all shaking and trembling. When [Devinder] ran out of energy, he calmly got up and walked out the door.’ A staff member who watched CCTV footage of the incident said: ‘He dragged him along the floor like a dog.’ Two of the couple's children attend one of the most exclusive schools on the Spanish coast where fees are around 10,000 euros a year. The third goes to nursery . A worker at the nearby El Octogono Beach Club said the worrying Twitter photo was taken at its children’s pool. The barman, who asked not to be named, said the girl was the daughter of Britons who spend every summer there. Of Rottman, a web designer, he said: ‘He had a drink problem and would get through up to three bottles of vodka a day. He’s been banned for the past year because he ran up a huge bill. He’d fallen on hard times after making a lot of money during the boom years in Spain when he was spending £50 a day on drink. He drank vodka and orange juice. ‘He dressed well in smart trousers and a blazer even in the hard times. He was always on his own and always on his computer because that was how he made his money, but I never saw him misbehaving.’ Rottman is said to have once been so drunk he fell into the sea and had to be rescued. He limped and is said to have been treated for a liver problem. Kainth is a gym fanatic who worked out on most days and did gruelling Crossfit classes. He has a three-bedroom house in the area and once owned a supermarket in nearby Casares, but it has closed, sources said. A neighbour said: ‘The last time I saw him and his partner here was last August. They had an argument round the pool one day. I couldn’t understand what they were saying but he seemed very aggressive. His girlfriend left in tears and started throwing his clothes out of the window.’ A British man has been arrested for allegedly killing a German man he caught filming his young daughter in a restaurant in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night . The altercation happened at the The Spinnaker, pictured above, in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night after Devinder Kainth  reportedly saw Sandro Rottman filming his daughter . The couple were said to be well known in the resort for their 'matching his-and-hers black and white Range Rovers' and their expensive spending habits. Kainth was said to work out every day in the gym, with one friend describing him as 'hard as nails'. He reportedly took part in a Crossfit classes regularly at the gym which is known for being a particularly strenuous 'military-style workout'. A witness described estate agent Kainth as 'short and stocky' and 'a very well prepared fighter, possibly a kick boxer.' Ms Hawkins is also believed to be a fitness fanatic like her partner. Various people in the resort have described her as a 'blonde bombshell' with a 'cracking body'. A waitress in a restaurant in the resort said: 'When she walked into the restaurant all heads turned'. Another source added that she's 'better seen and not heard' and a 'real Cockney London girl'. The family moved to Sotogrande full-time a year ago, although apparently they have been going to the resort for years. They previously had a house in Casares, another resort nearby, according to a friend. Mr Kainth was identified by witnesses and police arrested him at his nearby home. The girl's father approached the man after seeing him filming with a tablet device, a source with the Civil Guard police force in Algeciras said . He appeared before a magistrate on Monday and was remanded in custody accused of homicide. The Spinnaker owner added: 'The German man is very normal. I knew nothing about him being arrested last month.' But the manager of another restaurant in Sotogrande said: 'The German Sandro had a bad reputation locally and was banned from various bars. 'He owed money in various places and walked with a limp and was quite an odd fellow.' He added: 'As I understand it, he was in there with his iPad and taking pictures of people in the bar. '[Mr Kainth] was looking through the photos on the tablet and saw photos of his children. 'Then he went further back and saw pornographic pictures of other children and just went crazy. He punched him to the ground.' A police spokesman said: 'The incident happened because of a video the victim had been recording of the British man's daughter. 'He snatched the tablet he was using and when he discovered there were images of his daughter on it, threw it to the ground and assaulted him.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We stand ready to provide consular assistance if requested.'

"In the last few years, Carole Middleton's inner circle has become increasingly A-List, with the 60-year-old counting even the Queen among her friends. And now the grandmother of the future king has been spotted with a man who is arguably the Canadian king of Rock n' Roll. Photos have now emerged of Carole and her husband Michael with the singer Bryan Adams in St Lucia on January 25. Scroll down for video . Carole Middleton was pictured walking alongside the Canadian singer Bryan Adams at St Lucia airport on January 25 . The couple were snapped walking alongside the Eighties star at the island's international airport as they boarded a plane to Mustique for her 60th birthday celebrations. Carole can be seen smiling widely and clutching her panama hat to her head as she makes her way towards the plane. Despite a lengthy journey from the UK to the Caribbean, Carole appeared fresh-faced and fashionably attired in blue skinny jeans, a navy and cream floral top and black pixie boots. She covered up the effects of the long-haul flight with a pair of enormous black sunglasses. Michael Middleton was dressed very smartly for the long trip in khaki chinos, a pale blue oxford shirt and a navy blazer. Bryan appeared far more casually dressed in comparison, in a tight black T-shirt, black jeans and black trainers. He is a regular visitor to Mustique since buying a villa on the island several years ago. The rock star trailed along behind Carole and Michael Middleton as they headed towards the plane . The Middletons looked remarkably calm and collected after a long journey to the Caribbean from the UK, as they boarded a plane for the last leg of their journey to Mustique . Carole and Michael were flying to Mustique ahead of the rest of their holiday companions, which included The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Pippa, 31, and James, 27. Along with Pippa and James, rumoured guests included Basil Charles, the owner of Mustique's much-loved Basil's Bar, and the island's resident doctor Michael Bunbury and his wife Lotty. The family were booked in for two weeks at Villa Rocina, a £14,000-a-week four-bedroom house with a beautiful infinity pool and four staff — a chef, butler, housekeeper and gardener. Carole looked chic in a pair of blue skinny jeans, a floral long-sleeved top and a pair of black ankle boots . They were there for Mrs Middleton's birthday celebrations, which, according to sources, was fun, informal and noisy and included bespoke cocktails created especially for the event. Those not invited included Mrs Middleton's brother Gary Goldsmith, whose colourful lifestyle has proved embarrassing on occasion. Also off the guest list was James' girlfriend Donna Air, 35, and Pippa's boyfriend Nico Jackson, also 35, who were dropped due to limited space at Villa Rocina. Carole's daughter Kate, who is almost seven months pregnant, and her husband William joined her on the island for a final family break before they become parents for a second time in April.

"A puzzling silence has descended around Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner who has not been since in public for over a month. And she hadn't posted any messages to Twitter since December 13, when she fired off a typical volley of 20 tweets. That has been feeding speculation in Argentina about her health in the wake of surgery on her head in October, and questions about who is running the country. 'She's decided to stay away from her duties in power,' opposition Senator Gabriela Michetti told the DyN news agency. A puzzling silence had descended around Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (pictured here December 10) who had not been seen in public for more than a month . 'She's suffering from fragility and weakness,' Mr Michetti said. 'Maybe she's still determining the course, but for a while she's been uncomfortable in her role as president.' Members of Fernandez's administration dismiss the questions, saying she's busy at work. She hadn't posted any messages to Twitter since December 13, when she fired off a typical volley of 20 tweets . Defense Minister Agustin Rossi said Thursday that opposition criticism makes him 'laugh hard' because 'the president is totally in command.' But her aides have not explained why she has stayed out of the public eye, though Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich recently said that the president 'is also a human being and needs rest' because 'she still in the process of recovering her full health.' Fernandez was long known for nearly daily speeches and constant tweets. Unwell: Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez, pictured arriving at a local hospital, in Buenos Aires, in October before she underwent surgery  to remove a blood clot form her brain . But she was silenced for six weeks late last year when she underwent surgery on October 8 to remove a blood clot. She returned to work on November 18. Since her return, Fernandez has tried to reinvent her image, putting aside the all-black wardrobe she wore for three years as a sign of mourning for her late husband Nestor Kirchner. Along with her late husband and predecessor Nestor Kirchner (above), Ms Kirchner is credited for restoring the presidential power in a country gravely weakened by the 2001 economic collapse . Economy Minister Axel Kicillof has said that Fernandez continues to have final say on all decisions and recently dismissed rumors of growing power struggles in her administration that were fed by a series of contradictory statements by Cabinet ministers. Kicillof complained of a 'soap opera being created' by the media to try to destabilize the government. 'They spend so much ink and they try to generate tensions, frictions,' Kicillof said. Fernandez made her last public appearance on December 10. Three days later, she made her last comments on Twitter criticizing a protest by police. Her last official photograph was taken on December 19 at a meeting held at an Islamic center. Officials have said that she spent Christmas holidays with her family in Argentina's south and has since been meeting with her ministers at the presidential residence, although no images have been provided. She also reportedly visited her ailing mother at a Buenos Aires clinic on Wednesday, but the government has yet to confirm the information. Capitanich has said that Fernandez will travel to Cuba for a summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States on Jan. 28 and to Venezuela for a meeting of the Mercosur trade bloc on January 31.","Has not posted any messages to Twitter since December 13 .

"Whitney Houston's mother has made another appearance in hospital to be at Bobbi Kristina's beside amid claims she is avoiding the 21-year-old's father. Cissy Houston arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Sunday evening to visit her granddaughter, who is still in a coma fighting for her life. However it has been claimed the 81-year-old former gospel singer is planning her trips so she doesn't bump into Bobby Brown. The pair have been pictured arriving separately since Cissy flew in from her New Jersey home, and sources have told the Atlanta Journal Constitution it is deliberate. Bobbi Kristina also received a number of visitors, including close family friend Tyler Perry. She has now been in hospital for over a week. Continued support: Cissy Houston arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Sunday evening to visit her granddaughter, who is still in a coma fighting for her life . Deliberate: It has been claimed the 81-year-old is allegedly planning her trips so she doesn't bump into Bobby Brown. They have been pictured arriving at different times throughout the week . Regular: The former gospel singer has been seen at the hospital most days since flying in from her home in New Jersey last week . Close friend: Tyler Perry was also seen walking into the Atlanta hospital on Sunday as the bedside vigil to Bobbi Kristina continues . It is not the first time each side of the family have been at odds when gathered in the same place. Bobby Brown and his entourage arrived for Whitney's funeral in 2012, but quickly left because he was moved around three times by security. The tragedy being carried by the family of this week hit even harder on Saturday, as relatives gathered at the 21-year-old's bedside on the three-year anniversary of her mother's death. Whitney Houston died on February 11, 2012, the day before the Grammy awards of that year. With this year's Grammy's set to take place Sunday, it was an eerie link between mother and daughter that added to the solemness of the situation at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Bobbi Kristina remains comatose in the facility one week after being found facedown and not breathing in the bathtub of her home Roswell, Georgia, in a scene that echoed the death of her mother. Father: A grief-stricken Bobby Brown arrived at the hospital on Saturday morning amid reports that he and Cissy Houston are avoiding each other . Emotional: Brown is said to be remaining hopeful that his daughter's condition will improve . Prayer: Brown, who reportedly hopes a miracle will save Bobbi, spent 90 minutes at the hospital Saturday . Bobbi's was seen arriving at the hospital with his entourage and his pregnant wife, Alicia, on Saturday. The singer appeared tired and emotional after leaving the facility after about 90 minutes, The New York Daily News reported. Grandmother Cissy Houston, who is said to be devastated over what happened following the death of her daughter, Whitney, arrived at the hospital one hour after Brown left. Other family members were also seen entering. There have been no updates on Bobbi's condition. While police said they had found drugs in the house, it is not clear how Bobbi came to lose consciousness. However on Friday it emerged that authorities were looking into a criminal investigation. Tragic: Bobbi Kristina with Whitney Houston in February 2012 - the singer was found dead two days later . According to TMZ, suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved. Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye. Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for around 15 minutes before she was discovered. She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update. 'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' Visit: Cissy Houston arrives to visit Bobbi Kristina Brown at the Emory University Hospital on Friday . Emergency: Cissy flew in from her New Jersey home earlier in the week . One person told the website: 'Cissy was traumatized losing Whitney in 2012 and the pain is still raw from that. 'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' She was also the most outspoken against the film about her daughter, which premiered last month. 'Lifetime has chosen to go ahead with the movie about Whitney in spite of my family's objections,' the bereaved mother said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in June. 'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.' Vigil: Gary Houston Jr. and Leolah Brown try to keep their optimism as they wait and hope for Bobbi Kristina Brown's recovery . Support: Relatives are seen coming and going from Emory University Hospital, where Bobbi is comatose . Visit: As family stay by her side, police are investigation possible foul play . On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off. 'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said. It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn. Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter.","Cissy Houston, 81, arrived at the Emory University Hospital on Saturday .

"A lesbian couple is fighting their sperm donor for full custody of their son after a judge accepted his bid to visit the child. The case could redefine reproductive rights for same-sex couples in New Jersey. Sheena and Tiara Yates of Pennsville, New Jersey, claim Shawn Sorrell, of Delaware, signed a contract they drew up, agreeing to relinquish his legal paternity over the boy born in 2013. The child was conceived via at-home artificial insemination - a practice much cheaper than clinic procedures but not recognized under the law. In September, Sorrell requested to see the boy at weekends, while paying $83 a week in child support, and his appeal was granted. Distraught: Sheena and Tiara Yates (pictured at their 2011 civil union) have been hit with parental appeals from both of their two sperm donors. They are fighting the second, whose son was born after they married . 'Emotionally it's very hard for us,' Sheena Yates told NJ.com. 'All we want is a family, and we can't have kids without an outside party. It's a lot for us to have to deal with. It's not just hard on us, it's hard on the kids, too.' The Yateses have had two children conceived via at-home artificial insemination, using the sperm of two donors. But last year, both men filed for visitation with their children. The first, father to the Yates's toddler, was granted parental time, which the couple accepted as they were not married at the time of his birth. However, they are now fighting back against Sorrell, whose one-year-old son was born after they entered into a civil union. Sons: They have had two boys via at-home artificial insemination. The younger (right) now sees his legal father Shawn Sorrell for a few hours each weekend. Sorrell also pays $83 a week in child support to the Yateses . He can now see the child a few hours each weekend, while paying $83 a week in child support. The rulings came despite the fact that the Yateses drew up contracts for the men, agreeing that they would relinquish their legal paternity. The women opted for at-home procedures to avoid the $1,000 fee at a clinic. But under the law, sperm donors retain their rights if the artificial insemination is done outside of a physician's office. Disputes surrounding at-home insemination are treated as standard custody battles. John Keating, the Glassboro-based attorney representing the Yateses, slammed the distinction as a significant obstacle for same-sex couples. He also argues that the fact the women visited a physician for advice should act in their favor. 'We don't think this is an anti-LGBT decision,' Keating told NJ.com. 'But we do think it disparately impacts LGBT couples, and disproportionately impacts lower-income people.' The Yateses hope that the fact of their marriage will strengthen their case that they are a strong united family who deserve full custody. They entered into a civil union in 2011, and in 2014, a few months after their second son was born, they got married.","Sheena and Tiara Yates have conceived two boys via at-home artificial insemination .

"Meet the Australian couple who traded in their jobs for a life of adventure. Jarryd Salem, 27 and his girlfriend Alesha Bradford, 30, are exploring the world’s most remote locations and documenting life on the road together on their travel blog Nomadasaurus. It's a nomadic lifestyle the pair have been embracing for more than six years after realising their love for the road and they won't stop until they explore every inch of the planet. Walking away from the life of comfort, the couple are currently backpacking their way from Thailand to South Africa – and they’re roaming across these countries without using any air transport. Jarryd Salem and Alesha Bradford pictured at Kuang Si Falls in Luang Prabang as they enjoy their time . ‘After a few years of backpacking around North and Central America we decided we wanted a new challenge,’ Mr Salem told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Our modes of transport will be motorbikes, trains, buses, cars, tuk-tuks, camels, hitchhiking, boats and anything else that keeps us on the ground. ‘The no flying rule was simply a fun goal we set for ourselves, which grew more appealing as time went on.’ Before their life-changing experience took place, the duo lived their own separate lives in different states in Australia. Mr Salem was bouncing in between dead-end jobs in Sydney while Ms Bradford operated machinery on her family farm and worked as a receptionist for agricultural companies in Western Australia. Travelling on their journey of a life-time - the Aussie couple pictured on their first day trip in Singapore . Pictured at Sapa View in Vietnam as the pair document their best advice and stories from the locations . Bradford partying at the Thingyan Festival in Mandalay Myanmar as she documents her time on their blog . Chasing their travel dreams at the age of 20, Ms Bradford set out on her own adventure in 2004, while Mr Salem jumped on the backpacking wagon in 2007. But one night in September 2008, the pair had their first encounter in Vancouver of Canada before Ms Bradford packed up her entire life Down Under and made the big move just three months later. ‘I was working as a bar security at a hostel in Canada when Alesha was staying as a guest,’ Mr Salem said. ‘After that first night, we ended up spending a week together before she headed back to Australia for a few months but I convinced her to move back – and the rest, as they say, is history.’ Travelling on their journey of a life-time, the couple have spent four months in Thailand and Myanmar and eight months riding on their motorbikes through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. ‘We have decided to make the bucolic paradise of Phong Nha in central Vietnam our temporary home while we prepare ourselves for the next leg of the journey,’ Mr Salem said. The couple purchased two cheap motorbikes in Laos as they rode through Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam . Walking away from the life of comfort, the couple pictured backpacking through Tulum in Mexico . The duo travelled to Luang Prabang in Northern Laos where they explored the beautiful Kuang Si Falls . ‘In 2015 we will finally leave South-East Asia and spend the year backpacking around China, Central Asia and the Middle East – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraqi Kurdistan and Turkey. ‘After that we will probably take another small break somewhere in Europe to recharge our batteries before attempting to take on Africa. ‘That will be the longest and most difficult part of the adventure, and we think this could take anywhere between 12 and 18 months to travel through.’ While it seems the pair have dropped their ‘normal lives’ to chase the freedom of life on the road, Mr Salem said they are ‘happy to break away from society’s expectations’. ‘Is working 40 hours a week for 50 years, paying off a mortgage and hoping that you will have enough health and wealth to enjoy your old age considered “normal”?’ he said. Mr Salem drinking and mingling with the locals during a motorbike stop at Phonsavan Laos . Ms Bradford embracing the picturesque view and serenity surroundings in Dalat of Vietnam . The couple pictured 'hanging out with Lenoardo' at Maya Bay in Thailand where 'The Beach' movie was filmed . ‘Our ‘pre-travelling’ lives were definitely not mediocre, but they were far from being extraordinary. ‘We quickly fell in love with the simplicity and freedom of life on the road and knew early on that we could continue to pursue our new life for as long as possible. 'All it took was that first step to ignite the passion.' Both sharing one thing in common, Mr Salem said even if they find themselves 'stationary' for a while, he doubts their 'love of travel will ever burn out'. 'Our ultimate goal is to open up a backpacker’s hostel somewhere in this world, and I am sure one day we will find the perfect place to do this,' Mr Salem said. 'After we reach South Africa we will re-evaluate where we want to go next. Perhaps we will jump on a freight ship and cross the Atlantic to South America, or head up the coast of West Africa. 'Maybe we will grow tired of living out of a backpack and throw a dart at an atlas to decide where we want to settle down for a while. Time will tell, and we’re in no rush.' Ms Bradford pictured as they prepare to head off on the Maeo Hong Son Loop for five days on their scooters . After kayaking around Halong Bay in Vietnam,  the pair found a private inlet, describing it as 'incredible place' Pictured at Phong Nha in Vietnam as the couple write, photograph and share their experiences to others . The couple pictured at Da Nang in Vietnam where they visited the Marble Mountains and Son Tra peninsula . Up until this year, Mr Salem was working in construction while his girlfriend held jobs across restaurants, bars, hotels and cafes to be able to put money aside for their big adventures. 'Working full-time doesn’t seem like a chore when you have a different backdrop to call home every couple of months,' he said. 'These days we have been lucky that we are starting to earn an income from freelance travel writing, as well as generating some funds from our blog. We are focusing more on these endeavours. 'We are loving the new challenges of having a continuous project on the road as well as share our lifestyle advice to help others make the most of their own adventures.'

Mr Salem pictured trekking through mud to get to the beginning of the Tu Lan Cave System in Vietnam . As life on the road continues for the Aussie couple, the pair admitted they miss their friends and family but Salem added their ‘home’ is wherever they rest their heads at night. ‘Our family and friends have fully supported us every step of the way – both when we left home on our first solo adventures, and now that we are travelling full time together,’ Mr Salem said. ‘We are both very close with our family and having them encourage us has been instrumental in helping us follow our dreams and our hearts yearn to explore what else is out there. ‘This nomadic lifestyle we have developed is far from perfect, but it is what makes us happy. At the end of the day, isn’t that all that matters?’","Jarryd Salem and  Alesha Bradford are exploring the world together .

"Likely GOP presidential contender Mike Huckabee lit into President Barack Obama on Monday over remarks he made last week that were critical of Christianity. 'Everything he does is against what Christians stand for, and he's against the Jews in Israel,' Huckabee, who was until recently a Fox News host, said this morning on Fox and Friends. 'The one group of people that can know they have his undying, unfailing support would be the Muslim community. It doesn't matter whether it's the radical Muslim community or the more moderate Muslim community.' Former Arkansas Governor and likely 2016 presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is pictured here speaking at a dinner last Thursday. Huckabee said this morning on Fox and Friends that Obama is 'against the Jews in Israel' and that 'everything he does is against what Christians stand for' Last Thursday Obama used an address at the National Prayer Breakfast to chastise critics of his administration who have complained that neither the president or his advisers will refer violent extremists waging war in the Middle East in the context of the religion they profess. Preferring to call them 'terrorists,' Obama's administration has deliberately refused to characterize ISIS and other related groups that seek to impose a caliphate in that region as radical Islamisists. At the breakfast, which occurred a day after the president held a roundtable with Muslim leaders, Obama urged Christians to get off their 'high horse' and 'remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.' 'In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ,' he added. The comments have infuriated Republicans - who were already up in arms over Obama's refusal to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a March visit because of the proximity to that country's elections - and talking heads on major networks, including left-leaning channel MSNBC. Former Virginia governor Jim Gilmore, a Republican, said Obama's remarks were the 'most offensive I’ve ever heard a president make in my lifetime.' 'He has offended every believing Christian in the United States. This goes further to the point that Mr. Obama does not believe in America or the values we all share,' Gilmore said immediately following the speech, per the Washington Post. President Barack Obama, pictured here at the National Prayer Breakfast last Thursday, Obama urged Christians to get off their 'high horse' and 'remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.' Referencing the murder of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh at the hands of ISIS, revealed earlier that week, Fox and Friends host Elizabeth Hasselbeck argued on the show Friday, 'Christians had nothing to do with a man being burned alive in a cage we saw on Wednesday that we saw took place last month. 'Nothing to do it,' she added, angrily. 'Yet he named them, invoked the name of Christ — our savior— three times and talked about Christians but couldn't call radical Islam for what it was, couldn't name the person behind the match.' MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell said Sunday that she thought it in poor taste for Obama to use the term crusade 'in any context right now.' 'It's too fraught,' she said during an appearance on Meet the Press. 'And the week after a pilot is burned alive in a video shown, you don't lean over backwards to be philosophical about the sins of the fathers,' she asserted.","'Everything he does is against what Christians stand for, and he's against the Jews in Israel,' Mike Huckabee, until recently a Fox News host, said .
But Muslims 'know they have his undying, unfailing support,' he continued, whether 'radical' Muslims or 'more moderate' Muslims .
Last week Obama urged Christians to get off their 'high horse' and remember that the Crusades and Inquisition were 'in the name of Christ'"
"A sex-trafficking survivor, who was chained in a basement and raped aged seven by her male nanny, spoke movingly at the Grammys on Sunday about her ordeal. Before Katy Perry sang By The Grace Of God, Brooke Axtell, 34, took the stage and spoke directly to domestic violence victims, urging them to seek help. She shared the story of her own abusive relationship which followed a traumatic childhood. The Austin-based writer was sold for sex to other men by her nanny whose care she was under while her mother Mollie was in hospital and her father Calvin was traveling for work. Miss Axtell is a singer-songwriter, poet and activist along with communications director for Allies Against Slavery, a nonprofit that fights against human trafficking. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Brooke Axtell, 34 a domestic violence survivor who was trafficked for sex by her male nanny as a child, made a speech about her traumatic past during the Grammys on Sunday night . Brooke Axtell (pictured left) poses backstage during the 57th Grammy Awards at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night after giving her moving speech before Katy Perry sang By The Grace Of God (right) Miss Axtell was cared for by a number of nannies before being looked after by a man she called 'Jim', who was training to be a priest. In an essay in 2012, entitled What I Know of Silence, Miss Axtell shared the horrifying details of how she was sexually abused by Jim at the age of seven. She wrote: 'Jim tied me up and called me a whore. He gave me to other men who pay to rape little girls and film it for their private pornography collections.' Miss Axtell wrote that she was confined to a basement in chains, where was raped and filmed. Even when her ordeal ended, she didn't report Jim because of the shame she felt about what she had suffered, according to Washington Post. Miss Axtell never told anyone what had happened to her and later found herself in a relationship with an abusive boyfriend. At the beginning of her speech at the Grammys in Los Angeles on Sunday, Miss Axtell, who is unmarried, said: 'I am a survivor of domestic violence. After a year of passionate romance with a handsome, charismatic man, I was stunned when he began to abuse me. The Austin-based writer and activist is the director of communications for Allies Against Slavery, a nonprofit that fights against human trafficking. Right, she is pictured with her father, Calvin Axtell . 'I believed he was lashing out because he was in pain, and needed help. I believed my compassion could restore him and our relationship. My empathy was used against me. I was terrified of him and ashamed I was in this position. 'What bound me to him was my desire to heal him. My compassion was incomplete because it did not include me. When he threatened to kill me, I knew I had to escape. I revealed the truth to my mom and she encouraged me to seek help at a local domestic violence shelter. This conversation saved my life.' She added: 'Authentic love does not devalue another human being. Authentic love does not silence, shame or abuse. 'If you're in a relationship with someone who does not honor or respect you, I want you to know you are worthy of love. Please reach out for help.' Miss Axtell finally told her mother about the abuse after her boyfriend threatened to kill her. Her mother, Mollie O'Meara Axtell, helped her get in contact with a shelter. The 34-year-old went on to found Survivor Healing and Empowerment (S.H.E.), a group which supports survivors of rape, abuse and sex-trafficking. Brooke Axtell's parents, Calvin and Mollie O'Meara Axtell. After years of keeping a secret, their daughter finally revealed her childhood sex-trafficking trauma to her mother who helped her get in touch with a domestic violence shelter . She is also a spokeswoman for the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) and works with a domestic violence shelter in her hometown of Austin. Miss Axtell has also won the Phyllis Smart Young Prize for Poetry and published several books of poetry. She has also produced three albums and performed with British pop star Dido and drummer, Terry Bozzio (who played with Frank Zappa). The multi-talented artist has also worked with with Bob Dylan's guitarist Charlie Sexton and Mitch Watkins (guitarist for Leonard Cohen and Lyle Lovett). But it was through her activist work, that Miss Axtell drew the attention of the executive producer of the Grammys, Ken Ehrlich. She penned a powerful message for the Grammys  to highlight violence during the ceremony. She didn't know that she would be appearing alongside Katy Perry until last week. Miss Axtell said that Perry's choice of song may have been because of similar experiences in her life. 'I think it's clear from the song that she is choosing to perform that she has had an experience in her life where she felt very devastated by a relationship, and I think that's her entry-point into this,' she said. However the activist insisted Perry had never confirmed that specifically. In an interview with Slate Magazine this weekend, Miss Axtell said sexual abuse before the age of 18 is a major factor in being vulnerable to domestic violence. 'I wanted to find a balance between sharing the reality of my own trauma but also to emphasize that there is a path to freedom, and to offer a call to action: to encourage women in this position to value their own lives and their voices and reach out for help,' she told the magazine. 'I know last year they addressed the issue of gay marriage [when Macklemore performed Same Love while Queen Latifah officiated a mass wedding of gay and straight couples]. This year they wanted it to be the issue of violence against women.' Asked about what she would think about on stage, she told the magazine: 'I’ll be thinking of the survivors I’ve worked with over the years. I know if I speak from that place, I’ll be very peaceful and very clear. I’ll try not to focus on the fact that Beyonce and Madonna and Lady Gaga are sitting right there. And I won’t be wearing a shark costume [referring to Perry's Super Bowl halftime performance.' Miss Axtell spoke after President Obama made an appearance via a pre-recorded video, stating nearly one in five women in the U.S. has been a victim of rape or attempted rape and one in four women has experienced domestic violence. Obama urged viewers to back the White House's anti-domestic violence campaign ItsOnUs. 'It's not OK and it has to stop,' Obama said. 'Artists have a unique power to change minds and attitudes and getting us talking and thinking about what matters. 'And to the artists at the Grammys tonight, I ask you to ask your fans to do it too,' he added. The hashtag #ItsOnUs began trending within minutes on Twitter. My name is Brooke Axtell and I am a survivor of domestic violence. After a year of passionate romance with a handsome, charismatic man, I was stunned when he began to abuse me. I believed he was lashing out because he was in pain, and needed help. I believed my compassion could restore him and our relationship. My empathy was used against me. I was terrified of him and ashamed I was in this position. What bound me to him was my desire to heal him. My compassion was incomplete because it did not include me. When he threatened to kill me, I knew I had to escape. I revealed the truth to my mom and she encouraged me to seek help at a local domestic violence shelter. This conversation saved my life. Authentic love does not devalue another human being. Authentic love does not silence, shame, or abuse. If you are in a relationship with someone who does not honor or respect you, I want you to know that you are worthy of love. Please reach out for help. Your voice will save you. Let it extend into the night. Let it part the darkness. Let it set you free to know who you truly are. Valuable. Beautiful. Loved.","Singer-songwriter, poet and activist Brooke Axtell, 34, gave a powerful speech before Katy Perry sang By The Grace Of God at the Staples Center .

"British helicopter maker AgustaWestland suffered a bruising setback yesterday as India scrapped a major order. The Indian Ministry of Defence said it had terminated the  £465million deal ‘with immediate effect’ amid allegations the firm bribed officials to win the contract. The move is a bitter blow for AgustaWestland and its workforce of nearly 3,300 in Yeovil where the helicopters are made. Scrapped: The Indian Ministry of Defence said it had terminated for the £465million deal the helicopters like this one 'with immediate effect' amid allegations the firm bribed officials to win the contract . However, it comes just days after the company secured a £1billion order from Norway for 16 search and rescue helicopters. India ordered 12 AW101 choppers in 2010 to transport senior officials such as the prime minister and other high ranking politicians. Three of the helicopters have been delivered but the other nine will not follow, after the Indian government ended the deal. Giuseppe Orsi, former head of AgustaWestland’s Italian parent firm, Finmeccanica, is on trial in Italy on fraud and corruption charges for his alleged role in bribery to secure the contract.

"The Ministry of Defence was forced to buy scrapyard parts to keep its only carrier in service. Today The Mail on Sunday can reveal how, in a frantic effort to refit HMS Illustrious after a fire, MoD officials salvaged parts from her  sister ship HMS Ark Royal – the  aircraft carrier sold two years ago. To public outcry, the historic vessel was sent to a Turkish scrapyard to be recycled into tin cans. Raiding the lost ark: HMS Ark Royal (pictured) was sent to a Turkish scrapyard to be recycled two years ago . This cost-saving measure left Britain without a single carrier for fixed-wing planes, with HMS Illustrious, which can carry only helicopters, as the Royal Navy’s sole vessel capable of carrying aircraft. A report obtained by this newspaper reveals that following the fire aboard Illustrious, the ship’s officers found they had no parts to replace those destroyed. This led to cash-strapped defence officials making an emergency request to the scrapyard’s owners to search the rusting remains of Ark Royal to find the missing parts. Last night, the MoD refused to say how much it had cost to salvage and airlift these parts to Britain. The MoD was forced to buy scrapyard parts to keep its only carrier in service, HMS Illustrious . But the former head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Lord West, said: ‘We should have held on to the Ark for just this sort of situation. ‘Selling her off for scrap was a huge risk. With her sister ship Illustrious remaining in service, she would have been very useful. The Royal Navy has been cut to the bone, with no aircraft carriers and just  19 destroyers and frigates.’ The parts from Ark Royal were due to be fitted to Illustrious following her return to Portsmouth on January 10 after delivering humanitarian aid supplies to victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Illustrious had previously been on anti-piracy patrols off the coast of Somalia. It was during this operation that the fire started on August 13 last year. Afterwards one of the carrier’s officers realised that there were ‘no replacement stores’ for the radio switchboard and its surrounding cabinet. Civil servants confirmed that the same equipment had been fitted to Ark Royal. Both ships belong to the Invincible class of aircraft carriers. The sale of the Ark to Leyal Recycling for £2.9 million in 2011 led former US Defence Secretary Robert Gates to describe the UK as no longer a ‘full partner’ in military operations. Illustrious is to be retired later this year. New aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth is due to enter Royal Navy service in 2020. An MoD spokesman said: ‘While the part was not one that would  routinely need replacing, a small fire meant we had to get hold of another one, which we did, paying £57,000 less than we would have done if buying new.’ The MoD refused to say how much it had cost to salvage and airlift these parts to Britain .","The Ministry of Defence was forced to buy parts to keep carrier in service .

"There's been a dramatic twist in the shocking axe murders last month of members of the van Breda family in South Africa, with allegations that the surviving son’s injuries were self-inflicted, and in a further development authorities also believe he waited about four hours to call for help. The Inquisitir has reported that Henri van Breda, 20, who was treated for only minor injuries, and called emergency services at 7.30am claiming his family was 'attacked by a guy with an axe' despite the investigators finding the brutal attack took place at 3am in the city of Stellenbosch. The brutal assault left his teenage sister Marli, 16, bleeding and close to death on the balcony of her family's home in Stellenbosch, after her throat was cut and she'd suffered horrific head injuries. Ms Breda's mother Teresa, 54, was found dead on the balcony and police discovered her deceased father Martin, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, in a bedroom. Marli van Breda has recovered the ability to blink in response to questions which police had hoped could be vital to finding the killer. Scroll down for video . Split apart: Henri van Breda (back left) reported that he had escaped the attack with minor injuries while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Survivor: The attackers left Marli (pictured) with a cut throat and 'severe' head injuries on the balcony of her home in Stellenbosch - 50 kilometres east of Cape Town. She has begun reacting to questions from investigators, however, by blinking . Since then, police have revealed that it was at least four hours before her brother Henri reported the crime inside the high-security golf estate, about 50 kilometres east of Cape Town. Remarkably, an audio recording of the five-minute phone call, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal Henri van Breda 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody attack. 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Bredas' neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack. It's also thought that a doctor who examined Henri van Breda after the murders, suggests the bruises and scratches on his arms were 'self-inflicted'. Investigators have also confirmed that a 'brand new axe' was the weapon used. In the meantime, everything appears to hinge on the future testimony of young Marli. According to her uncle, André van Breda, “She is getting better every day, she is moving her eyes to follow instructions.” The young man's mental health has been under speculation since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were revealed to have been negative and no further testing occurred. The Times reported his uncle Her Breda, who has been caring for the 20-year-old, said his nephew is heart-broken. He denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply hidden from the media's gaze. Deceased: Martin (left) and wife Theresa (right) both died at their home in Stellenbosch - about 50 kilometres, east of Cape Town . Brothers: Rudi (pictured left and right) has been remembered by friends as a keen sportsman. His younger brother Henri is now being investigated over his self-inflicted injuries and the four-hour delay in calling for help from emergency services . Mr Breda added: 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' Marli remains in a stable but serious condition in hospital - but both family and friends have been barred from her bedside. She underwent brain surgery after the attack and is being closely monitored by doctors, while police provide round-the-clock guard. Devastated friends who knew the family in Australia paid tribute to the axe attack victims last week. The family was based in Perth and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, before returning to South Africa in mid-2014. Rudi's friends have been leaving tributes on social media, with his university friend Afif Norzal saying: 'You are a true blue genuine mate my friend. 'At times when I didn't have anyone to talk to, you would definitely make me feel the most welcome... I will always love you.' Family friend Retha Dutton said Rudi was visiting his parents and siblings before he returned to university for the final year of his Masters of Engineering. Mr Norzal told Daily Mail Australia in an interview: 'He was one of those guys - me being from a different culture - he was one of the first friends who genuinely connected with me. 'He was one of those people when he talked to you, you genuinely knew this guy wanted to be your mate. He was a really chilled and laidback person. He never stressed about anything.' Henri returned to South Africa with his parents in mid-2014. He had been living at Trinity College where his brother was staying while studying at the University of Melbourne in 2013. Both attended Scotch College in Perth. Ms Dutton told Daily Mail Australia: 'Teresa was a lovely mother... She was so happy all her children were with her, the boys had came from Australia (to visit). 'Henri moved back to South Africa in the middle of last year and he stayed with his family. She loved having him with her. She always used to tell me how wonderful it was.' Her husband Martin was the managing director of Engel and Voelkers Australia, an international property firm which has offices in Perth and Queensland. Friends described him as a 'great man' with a bright future ahead of him. Peter Armitage tweeted: '(He) was going to change SA (South Africa)... Folks, live for today. Tell people you love them today.' Mr Armitage said Martin was the founder of Netstar and Woodhill College. Martin's golf club also paid their 'deepest condolences' to the family on Twitter. Paul Freney, a friend and colleague of Martin's at Engel and Voelker,  told Daily Mail Australia he and his wife Teresa were committed parents to their three children. 'Committed parents' The van Breda family had just moved back to South Africa in June after six years in Perth, Western Australia. Their son Henri is being investigated after his injuries were found to be self-inflicted . Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack,while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . He said: 'I heard about it yesterday. A mate of mine rang me up and I nearly fell off my chair. 'They were very nice people. Martin loved his rugby. He was an avid Force supporter from Western Australia. We used to go to the rugby together, he loved his golf.' 'Teresa... looked after the business of running the home and all that sort of stuff, and I imagine had a fair bit to do.' 'He was a very intelligent man and he was obviously very wealthy, had a lot of money, but it was all earned through his own endeavours.' The van Breda family spent several years living in the Perth suburb of Claremont. Around 2012 they moved to the Sunshine Coast, where Engels and Volker had an office. Ms Dutton, whose daughter is close friends with Marli, said she last saw the family on January 2 in South Africa. She said they were a 'very, very happy family'. A close family friend described the van Bredas as 'like a perfect family' The van Breda family lived on the estate of the De Zalze Golf Club (pictured) about 50 kilometres east of Cape Town . Marli was enrolled at Matthew Flinders Anglican College at Buderim while she was in Year 9. A school spokesman said the community was 'very sad to hear the tragic news'. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with Marli, her family and those who love her,' the spokesman said. She is currently a student at Somerset College in South Africa. The school's headmistress Meg Fargher, described the Year 11 student as a  'lovely, popular, clever girl' whose parents were very involved in the school, news24 reported. Both schools are providing access to counsellors for students. Emergency medical services spokesman Robert Daniels told reporters it was obvious that the victims were attacked with an axe.

"A Russian cruiser came within 30 miles of the British coast but the Navy only had one ship to respond (file image) A fully armed Royal Navy warship was scrambled to challenge a missile-carrying Russian vessel  in the waters off Britain just days before Christmas, defence sources revealed last night. In a calculated test of Britain’s reduced naval capacity in the North Sea, the Russian warship came within 30 miles of the coast. It was detected nearing Scotland, but the only ship the Royal Navy had available to respond after Ministry of Defence cuts was in Portsmouth, resulting in a delay of 24 hours until it was in position. The threatening approach towards Britain’s territorial waters triggered a top-secret Navy and Air Force operation co-ordinated by the military top brass at the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) bunker at Northwood, just outside London. RAF reconnaissance aircraft tracked the progress of the Russian warship as it neared north-east Scotland, and the tension heightened when aerial photographs revealed the ship was carrying a full payload of guided missiles. Commanders at PJHQ decided to send the new Type 45 destroyer HMS Defender, which is Britain’s immediate-response ship during a national security crisis. The Russian ship waited in the Moray Forth, a stretch of water  that flows into Loch Ness, for Defender to arrive, as if her captain were recording the Navy’s response times. At the time, Defender was in dock at Portsmouth. Her crew were forced to make the 600-mile journey around the coastline, because budget cutbacks mean there are no maritime patrol vessels sailing off Scotland. A defence source said: ‘This was no exercise – the Russian ship was behaving very aggressively in a stretch of water bordering Britain’s territorial waters. ‘They were watched very closely by the RAF and it was agreed that HMS Defender should block the Russians’  passage. A tense stand-off ensued when Defender reached the Moray Firth as crews tried to establish intentions . ‘Defender was fully equipped with Sea Viper surface-to-air missiles and guns capable of firing 40kg shells as far as 18 miles. Her captain and crew knew this was the real deal and were prepared to engage.’ A tense stand-off ensued when Defender reached the Moray Firth. While the MoD last night declined  to explain the specific international protocols adhered to at such a delicate moment, The Mail on Sunday understands the crews exchanged radio messages in an attempt to establish each other’s intentions. No shots were fired but Defender’s 190-strong crew remained at battle stations throughout the confrontation. The British crew then watched as the Russian ship retreated. They followed it north to the Baltic Sea, where a Russian task force was on legitimate manoeuvres. Defender then sailed back to Scotland, docking in Glasgow on Friday. Last night, Russian expert Jonathan Eyal, from the military think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, said Russia had intended to intimidate Britain. He added: ‘The Russian fleet, which is . growing in strength  and expanding its sphere of influence, wanted to . show a presence  in the North Sea and sail as close  as possible to the . national sea boundary. ‘The Russians knew exactly what they were doing. They were saying, “We are back in business in the North Sea and we are powerful.” ‘They knew how far they could sail before they would be required to withdraw. ‘The Russians may also be inspecting nuclear installations in Scotland, with a view towards the independence referendum. Certainly the Russians would see the country as more vulnerable if it were no longer part of Britain. ‘The approach was part of a pattern of behaviour, and the action is more threatening when considered in this context. ‘Last year Russian military jets approached Swedish airspace and only withdrew when the Swedes scrambled their aircraft.’ After the confrontation between Defender and the Russian ship, which is believed to have begun  on December 20, the Russian military news agency Interfax-AVN released a statement claiming  that the vessel was sheltering in the Moray Firth because of adverse weather conditions. This is the second such incident  in two years. In December 2011, the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, anti-submarine ship Admiral Chabanenko and escort ship Yaroslav Mudry sailed close to Scotland before being challenged by the Royal Navy. Defender is the fifth of the Navy’s six state-of-the-art Type 45 destroyers – she was built in Glasgow, which is one of her two affiliated cities. The other is Exeter. The MoD refused to comment last night for operational reasons.","Russian vessel detected 30 miles away from Scotland last night .

"A former Penn State footballer who was paralysed from the neck down after a fall during a game has been elected to the New Jersey Assembly. Determined not to let his injury beat him, Adam Taliaferro spent eight months learning to walk again after he was paralysed from the neck down. He was told he had just a three per cent chance of walking on his own again and beat the odds to begin calling for changes to help others who had become injured in similar accidents. Adam Taliaferro was given a three per cent chance he would ever walk again after he suffered serious spinal cord injuries on the football field and has now overcome the odds and been elected to the Jersey Assembly . It was this desire that led Taliaferro, now 33, to become an 'accidental politician' - first being advised to become a county freedolder in 2011 to help more people. And now he has been sworn in to replace an Assembly member in New Jersey who stepped down. Taliaferro was paralyzed from the neck down in 2000 and given little chance of ever walking again. 'It 100 percent changed me,' Taliaferro said. 'Before my injury what was important to me was my family but also football — it was my dream to play in the NFL. It really teaches you to appreciate everything.' Taliaferro was sent dozens of donations to pay for care to help his rehabilitation but decided to instead use the money to establish a foundation to give emotional and financial help to people with similar injuries. So far, the Adam Taliaferro Foundation has distributed more than $1 million to those who have suffered similar accidents. 'Everyone that we help I see myself in them,' he said. 'My biggest thought is I want everyone to have the same chance of recovery I had.' Senate President Steve Sweeney became aware of the foundation and put Taliaferro on the path to this political career. He told him he could help more people as an elected official and encouraged him to run for Gloucester County freeholder as a Democrat. From here he has gone from strength to strength and after November plans to apply to be elected full term to the Assembly. In September 2000 trainers anxiously examined Penn State cornerback Adam Taliaferro after he was injured in the fourth quarter of a game against Ohio State, in Columbus, Ohio. He was temporarily paralysed . Taliaferro, who played as a cornerback, spent eight months learning to walk again after being injured . Taliaferro was born in Pittsburgh, but moved to Voorhees, New Jersey, as a child. After attending Eastern High School, he had scholarship offers from 30 universities to play football but the choice came down to Penn State and Tennessee. The decisive factor, he said, was that Penn State was close enough to home for his parents to come watch him play. He was just five games into his freshman season when he was injured while making a tackle against Ohio State. He remembers thinking he had only hurt his arm when he couldn't lift it after the play, but knew something serious happened when he couldn't move his leg. In January 2001 Taliferro is shown walking out of Magee Rehabilitation hospital in Philadephia with his mother Addie (center, back) and physical therapist Amy Bratta (right) Adam Taliaferro used money donated to him to help with his own care to set up a foundation to help others . He was given just a three percent chance of ever walking again, but the immediate medical attention he received on the field and physical conditioning helped his recovery, he said. Though he would never play football again, Taliaferro graduated from Penn State in 2005 and the Rutgers Camden School of Law. In addition to his blossoming political career, he is a health care policy analyst at Bristol-Myers Squibb — and a Penn State trustee. Taliaferro was a cornerback for Penn State team . Tom Bradley, who was Penn State's defensive coordinator during Taliaferro's career, said he saw a student athlete with tremendous potential. 'So smart, you could tell he was mentally ahead of where the other guys were,' said Bradley, now an assistant at West Virginia. Bradley said he wasn't sure how his and Taliaferro's political views might align — Bradley declined to say where he falls on the political spectrum— but he said he was confident in Taliaferro. 'He'll do the right thing,' Bradley said. 'I know him . Celeste Riley, who previously held the post, said the position on the Assembly is likely to be a challenging one for Taliaferro because of the diversity of the population. But she said she thought his own experience would help him to succeed. 'I think he'll do it. He's a hard worker and people like to have an example of what it means to work hard and face adversity,' she said.","Adam Taliaferro was footballer for Penn State when he was injured in 2000 .

"The earliest images of the battlefield of Waterloo - depicting the naked bodies of fallen soldiers - have gone on display after they were discovered in a private collection. The watercolour paintings are believed to have been painted by an Irish man, one of many civilians to flock to Belgium to witness the aftermath of the battle, and have gone on show at the British Museum. They feature the naked bodies of defeated troops which remained on the battlefields for five days following the bloody June 18, 1815, conflict, depicted as eerie white outlines on a vast panoramic brown landscape.

The works form part of an exhibition entitled Bonaparte and the British: Prints and Propaganda in the Age of Napoleon. They offer a poignant contrast to the more traditional accounts of the battle, which show the battle in full force. Sheila O'Connell, co-curator of the exhibition, told the Telegraph that experts knew of 'absolutely nothing earlier' to suggest that there were not the first images of the battlefield.

The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time. France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington. The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am. The 11 watercolours of the battlefield of Waterloo were taken from a private collection, including three long panoramas . The works are on public show for the first time. These are the earliest known studies of the battlefield made only two or three days after the fighting concluded . The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army. This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender.

"When a young Chinese father was photographed on holiday with his one-year-old daughter he had no idea he'd begun an enduring family tradition. Hua Yunqing,  62, was photographed with his daughter Huahua while on a day trip to a local beauty spot and liked the picture so much that he has since returned to the same location every year to repeat the photo. Over the following 35 years Hua and his daughter Huahua, 36, would take the same shot every year beside the same lake in Zhenjiang, a city in eastern China's Jiangsu province, showing the little girl growing up, her father slowly ageing and  the scenery around them changing as time passed. This photo of Hua and Huahua taken in 1980 when she was just one-year-old was the very first in Hua's long collection . In fact during their 35 years of taking the pictures they have only missed one year, in 1998 when Huahua missed the trip to the family's favourite lake. As he and his daughter have grown, their changing lives are documented in the photographs and not purely because the pair are ageing. The photos capture the changing fashions and capture Huahua's journey into adulthood and then motherhood, as her own children started to be snapped in the annual shot. Hua who posted the photos taken at Taying Lake online, said recreating the image each year has since become one of the family's customs. 'I didn't have any thought of doing the same thing again but when I got the photo back, I liked it so much that when we went back the next year I repeated it. 'After that it became sort of the family tradition and we did it every year with only one break in 1998 when my daughter did not join us for the family holiday and was abroad.' Hua added that the photos have documented his daughter's growth from a small baby to a child, into an awkward teen, a pretty young woman and now as she becomes a parent herself. 'When I started I never guessed that I'd still be doing this when I was in my 60s and my daughter is now no longer alone, she is a mother-of-two.' He said he was not expecting his family to continue the tradition forever but after posting images online he was delighted with the positive reaction. Hua liked the picture so much that he insisted on returning to the spot each year to reenact the picture. Huahua smiles at the age of two (left) and mimics her father's pose at three (right) Each year the father and daughter visit the same lake in Zhenjiang, a city in eastern China's Jiangsu province .

"A pride of lions had far from an easy meal when they chose to eat porcupine for lunch, with one unlucky cub getting the point loud and clear. The pride spotted two of the spiky creatures in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa and decided the slow moving rodents were fair game. One porcupine certainly dented the pride of one cub, when the big cat was left with one of its quills stuck through its nose. Getting the point: A lion cub tries to remove a porcupine's quill from its nose after trying to eat the rodent for lunch in the South African desert . Dragging it out: The cub winches in pain and closes both eyes as it uses its paws to try and pull the quill from out of its nostril . Now how are we going to eat this? The pride watch the slow moving rodent walk into view and ponder their next move . Time to strike: One of the cubs circles the porcupine and looks for the chance to strike, while the others appear to have already lost interest . But the porcupines victory was short lived, with the pride's alpha male later devouring both rodents. The encounter was captured by Philip Eglise. He said the lion pride initially consisted of five cubs and two adult females. The group attacked the two porcupines who managed to hold them off for around 15 minutes. The 38-year-old of Kilndown, Kent, said the porcupines quills 'are an exceptionally effective defence'. He said rather than firing the quills, porcupines rush backwards into the faces of their attackers which 'causes the quills to become detached'. He said: 'This can cause very serious injuries or infections which predators can die from. 'This happened a couple of times during this particular encounter, and the after-effects of one such attack can be seen where one of the cubs is attempting to remove a quill from its nose. 'The cub continued to paw at its nose for some time afterwards; it would have surely been very painful.' Mr Eglise said eventually the porcupines retreated into a bush, which he expected would 'save them'. Get it out! The cub looks in pain as it seeks assistance from another member of the pride to get the quill out of its nose . Why did you do that? The cub, who has now removed the quill, looks forlorn as stares at the porcupine, perhaps seeking sympathy . Bush retreat: The porcupines fled to the bushes where photographer Philip Eglise, who captured these pictures, assuming they would be safe . Check mate! The alpha male then swooped in and ate both porcupines; the lion is pictured above licking its lips after eating them . But the pride male then arrived and killed them both. Mr Eglise said: 'Sometimes nature feels horribly cruel and unfair to our modern sanitised lives, and to witness such a scene is always emotional. 'To see two such plucky animals, massively smaller and outnumbered by their attackers, was genuinely difficult to watch and I was hoping the porcupines' strong defence would eventually win the day.' Most lions now live in eastern and southern Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing.","A pride of lions spotted two porcupines in the Kalahari Desert in South Africa and decided to make them their lunch .

"A Colorado Sheriff is speaking out over the says the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, in 1995, claiming it was not an accident, despite his department reaching that conclusion 20 years ago. 'Based upon the information I've been briefed on up to this date … I do not think it's an accident,' Sheriff Tony Spurlock told CBS4  in an exclusive interview. 'I don't think it was an accident and I think it's very suspicious,' said Sheriff Spurlock, who became the Douglas County sheriff last month. Last year Harold Henthorn, 58, was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of hi second wife Dr Toni Henthorn, 50. Scroll down for video... First wife: Henthorn's first wife, Lynn,  also died in a remote location with her husband as the only witness . Accused: Harold Henthorn, left, has been accused of murdering his second wife, Dr Toni Henthorn, right, who fell to her death while the couple took a hike at Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012 . An autopsy report says she fell or was pushed over the ledge when she paused to take a photo during a hike on Sept. 29, 2012. The couple was visiting the park for their 12th wedding anniversary. Harold Henthorn told investigators his wife slipped and fell, but prosecutors didn't buy his explanation and charged him with murder last November. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May. Only after her death did Toni Henthorn's relatives realize she was covered by three life insurance policies totaling $4.5 million. A claim was sent in for one policy just days after she died, court records show. Harold Henthorn's attorney, Craig L. Truman, has said that the case is complicated and that 'justice will be done' once the facts come to light. Loss: His first wife, Sandra Lynn, was killed in a freak accident when their car crushed her as she changed a flat tire . But now attention has shifted to Henthorn's first wife, Sandra Lynn Henthorn, 30, who also died in mysterious circumstances. She was crushed to death in 1995 when a car slipped off a jack while she and Harold were changing a flat tire. Reports emerged showing that Dr Henthorn, who had one daughter, also had life insurance policies to the value of $4.5 million - and that a claim was made on one of the policies just two days after her death. The indictment says Harold Henthorn, who was the only witness to her death, 'willfully, deliberately, maliciously and with premeditation and malice aforethought did unlawfully kill his wife', CBS reported. He told authorities that his wife had been reaching under the car to help him change the front tire on their Jeep Cherokee on the rural road, when the jack slipped and the Jeep fell on his wife, crushing her. Harold Henthorn collected nearly $500,000 in life insurance proceeds from his wife's death. Detectives closed the case just one week after the investigation, ruling the death an accident, but the Douglas County Sheriff's Office told CBS4 that they have now re-opened the investigation. A source told the channel that Henthorn had taken out a $300,000 insurance policy on his wife. It added that three life insurance policies had been taken out on his second wife - each valued at $1.5 million - and that efforts had been made to collect on it on the first business day after her death. Changing his mind: Douglas County Sheriff Tony Spurlock says the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife, Lynn, in 1995 was not an accident, despite his department reaching that conclusion 20 years ago . How she died: As he changed the tire,  his wife crawled under the Jeep, apparently to retrieve a lug nut or flashlight, when he said a jack gave way or slipped and the Jeep fell, crushing her. Harold Henthorn collected nearly $500,000 in life insurance proceeds from his wife's death . One of the policies named the Harold and Toni Henthorn Trust as the beneficiary and a claim was sent in for the policy on October 1, 2012, CBS reported. No payment was made, however. The Douglas County coroner wrote 'this is an accidental death' on May 9, two days after Lynn Henthorn died. It is not clear who attempted to file a claim for the policy. The claim was made before her body was cremated or a memorial service was held. Dr Henthorn, an ophthalmologist, had been married to her husband for 12 years. She left behind a daughter, then seven. Douglas County investigators reopened the Lynn Henthorn death two weeks after the death of Toni Henthorn in 2012. They say they have done 40 interviews in the past 27 months and continue to diligently work the case. That information leads my detectives to determine this is probably not an accident,' emphasized Spurlock. Some have accused the local police of botching the investigation. Items and paperwork went missing at the time, hence the need for a follow-up. Case closed: The coroner wrote 'this is an accidental death' on May 9 1995, two days after Lynn Henthorn died. Three days later, on May 12, six days after the death, the Douglas County Sheriff's Department followed suit, closing the case as an accidental death and ruling no criminal charges should be filed . Oversight: Some are now asking if the Douglas County Sheriff’s Department mishandled the investigation into Lynn Henthorn’s death the first time around . At the time Henthorn  told investigators several different and conflicting stories of what he did after r the Jeep fell on his wife. He told some that he gave her CPR and helped get her out from under the vehicle. He told others he did not give her CPR and was unsure of how she was pulled out from under the Jeep. One investigator said he looked over Henthorn's hands and noticed no unusual marks, bruises or scratches that might have indicated an attempt to pull the car off his wife. Even the flashlight was found under his car in the 'off' position yet no questions were raised about it. In an interview with a Douglas County investigator, Harold Henthorn said he had been having a lot of flat tires recently 'due to construction in the area of their home. There is one tire with a nail in it in their garage at home.' The file indicates there was no follow up done to locate the tire Henthorn talked about to verify that part of his story. On the evening of the accident Patricia Montoya was returning to  Denver  on Highway 67 with a group of friends and family members. They stopped to help Henthorn and his stricken wife. 'He didn't want us to touch her,' Montoya told CBS4. 'It was a creepy feeling that he gave all of us.' Stories: Harold Henthorn told different sheriff’s investigators shifting versions of what happened in the hours before Lynn Henthorn's death, but police did not pursue the discrepancies or attempt to pin Henthorn down . She said her group immediately began administering CPR to Lynn Henthorn, angering Harold Henthorn, who did not want anyone to touch his wife. And Montoya said when they placed their jackets over Lynn to keep her warm, 'The husband wouldn't take his coat off for her, he wouldn't take the coat off to cover her. We all felt the same oddness. It was creepy, it was like he was trying to harm her,' said Montoya. She said everyone in her group came away from that evening with the same feeling. 'We all said that he probably set it up to where that car fell on her and that was all our thoughts. We all thought the same thing. It didn't seem like that was an accident.' She shared her thoughts with the police yet nobody came to interview her about what her suspicions or what she had witnessed. 'We were all very surprised. We all felt they would come and find us. And they never did.' Only when the case was reopened in October 2012 did  investigators seek her out and interview her about that night. Now in documents that provide further damning detail of the deaths of both Toni Bertolet Henthorn and Lynn Rishell Henthorn the prosecution has highlighted the similarities between both women's passing. Both deaths, the documents state, 'involved bizarre 'accidents.' Both left Henthorn with significant insurance benefits. He is beneficiary or trustee on three policies on Toni, totaling around $4.5million and received a $500,000 pay out on the death of his first wife. Both occurred in remote locations. Both times Henthorn was the lone witness. Both deaths occurred after about 12 years of marriage. Henthorn told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Witness: Patricia Montoya was returning to the Denver metro area with a group of friends. They stopped to help Henthorn and his stricken wife. Harold Henthorn's behavior was strange but the police didn't want to know . New tact: Tony Spurlock said investigators are employing new techniques and digging up new information on Lynn Henthorn’s death. He is optimistic that the reopened investigation will have a positive result . According to the documents the man who met his second wife on a Christian dating website, even told a Sunday school class that his first wife died of cancer and lost a baby she was carrying to chemotherapy. In the case of his second wife, an incident which happened just two years after she almost died when she was struck by a wooden beam Harold had thrown off their deck is disclosed in the documents. After that incident, Harold joked to friends: 'I was trying to kill my wife.' In both situations, the documents continue, the women were doing atypical things when they died. Lynn Henthorn was 'fastidious in dress and a cautious women who would not ordinarily crawl under a jacked-up car to search for lug nuts while wearing a nice sweater, especially after exploratory surgery only two weeks earlier.' Sheriff Spurlock is attempting to reassure the public that things will be different this time around and that there will be a positive outcome. He says investigators are employing new techniques and digging up new information on Lynn Henthorn's death.","Harold Henthorn told friends that his wife Toni had slipped while trying to take a photograph during their hike in September 2012 and fell 50ft .

"The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for same-sex marriage in Alabama despite attempts by the state's chief justice to refuse licenses for gay couples. In a federal ruling, the justices rejected Alabama's bid to stop legalization from taking effect on Monday. It means Alabama is the 37th state to allow gays and lesbians to wed - paving the way for nationwide legalization. Ruling: Alabama has become the 37th state to legalize gay marriage after federal justices overruled the state's chief justice Roy Moore who tried to block the legislation. Today, Tori Sisson and Shante Wolfe married . Donna and Tina kiss after getting married in a park outside the Jefferson County Courthouse in Birmingham . Greg and Roger prepare to marry each other outside Jefferson County Courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama . Denied: Chief Justice Roy Moore urged judges to reject licenses for same-sex couples but has been overruled . 'It's about time,' said Shante Wolfe, 21, who has camped outside the courthouse with her partner Tori Sisson, hoping to be Alabama's first same-sex couple to marry. Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore spearheaded the attempt to block gay marriage in the Deep South state by sending an order to state probate judges on Sunday night. Moore has been one of the state's most outspoken critics of gay marriage. He called homosexuality an 'inherent evil' in a 2002 custody ruling against a lesbian mother. Last week, Moore sent a letter urging probate judges to reject the licenses. The head of the judges' association on Friday predicted most would issue the licenses. Moore upped the ante Sunday night by sending the directive. He argued that judges are not bound by the ruling of a federal judge that the gay marriage ban is unconstitutional. The letter sent on Sunday night read: 'Effective immediately, no probate judge of the state of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with (the Alabama Constitution).' After marriages begun on Monday, Alabama's Attorney General Luther Strange slammed the ruling for causing 'confusion'. Overjoyed: Crowds cheered as Greg and Roger, now married, embraced following the Supreme Court ruling . Finally doing it! Sisson and Wolfe dressed in their finest for the occasion as they walked into the court room . Put a ring on it: Sisson puts a ring on Wolfe's finger as they say their vows after a tense wait overnight . One of the first: Wolfe and Sisson showed off their marriage license as many more queued for their turn . According to Pink News, he said: 'In the absence of a stay, there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Court's anticipated ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage. 'With the lifting of the 14-day stay on Feb. 9, 2015, the U.S. District Court order remains in effect, enjoining me from enforcing Alabama's laws against same-sex marriage in my official capacity as attorney general. 'I advise probate judges to talk to their attorneys and associations about how to respond to the ruling.' It was a dramatic return to defiance for Moore, who was removed as chief justice in 2003 for refusing to obey a federal court order to remove a washing machine-sized Ten Commandments from the state judicial building. Critics lashed out that Moore had no authority to tell county probate judges to enforce a law that a federal judge already ruled unconstitutional. Waiting in line: Same-sex couples queued up outside the Jefferson County courthouse on Monday morning . Protest: Gay rights activists have been camping out by the courthouse to protest Moore's stance . Ecstatic: Tori Sisson and Shante Wolfe said 'it's about time' when they heard the news on Monday morning . He's been one of the state's most outspoken critics of gay marriage; in 2002 he called homosexuality an 'evil' in a custody ruling. 'This is a pathetic, last-ditch attempt at judicial fiat by an Alabama Supreme Court justice-a man who should respect the rule of law rather than advance his personal beliefs,' said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign. Warbelow urged probate judges to issue the licenses in compliance with ruling of U.S. District Judge Callie Granade. Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, predicted that 'we will see marriage equality in Alabama' on Monday. 'I don't think the probate judges in Alabama are going to defy a federal court judge's order,' she said. On January 23, Granade ruled that the state's statutory and constitutional bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional but put her order on hold until February 9 to let the state prepare for the change. Ready to go: Wolfe and Sisson have been ready to wed outside Montgomery County Courthouse for days . Controversial: There remains deep opposition to same-sex marriage in the Deep South state . Justices are expected to issue a ruling later this year on whether gay couples have a right to marry nationwide. The same-sex couples queuing outside courthouses were left waiting until the last minute on Monday morning for the high court to issue a ruling on the state's request. Jessie and Cooper Odell brought their son with them to witness their marriage. Jessie, 42, said he was surprised by the speed with which Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage fell. 'I knew it was coming, but not this fast with our history on civil rights,' he said.","Federal justices denied Alabama's bid to block legalization .

"The ex-wife of a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 testified Monday that she found a torn piece of a missing poster with the boy's image in a shoebox belonging to her husband, years after he told her he had strangled someone in New York. Daisy Rivera said that she came across the shoebox in the 1980s, when they were moving back into her parents' house. She says she noticed the photo of the boy and thought Pedro Hernandez had another child he never told her about. 'He explained to me that child had disappeared within the area where he worked at in New York City,' she said. 'And I asked him, disappeared how?' Daisy River, Pedro Hernandez's ex-wife, testified on Tuesday that he kept a small picture of Etan Patz from his missing poster. She said she found the picture in a shoe box after they moved to New Jersey in the 1980s . Patz disappeared on May 25, 1979 and was never seen again. Hernandez said he strangled the boy and put his body in the trash . He told her that he knew the family and that's why he had the photo. The image was part of Etan's missing poster. Before they were married, Hernandez told her in Spanish that he had strangled a 'gringo muchacho,' which means 'white guy' in English, who had offended him while working in New York, she testified. He didn't want to lie to her and he wanted forgiveness so he told her, she testified.  But Hernandez didn't elaborate, and Rivera didn't ask about it, and she didn't tell police, she said. Rivera said Monday she didn't consider whether the photo was linked to the story he told her. Pedro Hernandez's lawyers say that he is mentally ill and that his statements to police that he killed Etan Patz are fiction . Daisy Rivera (pictured in 2012) said Hernandez told her in Spanish that he had strangled a 'gringo muchacho,' which means 'white guy' in English, who had offended him while working in New York . 'I never forgot that face,' she said. Hernandez was a teenage stock clerk at a convenience store a few blocks from where Etan was last seen on his way to school on May 25, 1979. He moved back to New Jersey shortly after and was never considered a suspect until 2012, when a relative called police with a tip. Hernandez confessed to choking the boy and tossing his body with curbside trash. He has since pleaded not guilty. His attorneys say his confession is fiction. The former husband and wife met when Rivera was 16, after Hernandez moved back to New Jersey from New York. They got married after she became pregnant and have two children together, Peter, now 31, and Natalie, now 30. They divorced more than two decades ago and had a contentious relationship, she testified. Hernandez's attorney, Alice Fontier, sought to show that Rivera was making up the story about the photo, because there was no record of her telling authorities about it when she was initially questioned. She also sought to show Rivera was not reliable, because she had been arrested on a charge of deceiving welfare authorities in an unrelated case. The incident was expunged from her record, she testified. Prosecutors have not said whether they have the photo. Etan's body has never been found. His case has stretched decades and continents, and spurred legislation to create better communication among law enforcement agencies to find missing children. The trial is expected to last three months.","Daisy Rivera said she discovered the picture in a shoebox in the 1980s .

"An Atlantic City casino has sparked a racism row after serving a special menu of fried chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese on Martin Luther King Jr's birthday. The Borgata, which also features a luxury hotel and spa, was branded stereotypical and 'seriously racist' by hundreds of social media users after it unveiled the $24 menu last Thursday. However, many others claimed that political correctness had run amok, saying that the food options were a 'tasty tribute' to the celebrated African-American pastor and civil rights activist. Controversial: The Borgata casino in Atlantic City  has sparked a racism row after serving this special  menu (pictured) of fried chicken, collard greens and macaroni and cheese on Martin Luther King Jr's birthday . Sparking debate: On Monday, professional poker player Shaun Deeb posted a photo of the controversial birthday menu on Twitter, alongside the caption (pictured): 'This is what borgata is serving. #isitracist?' Speaking to AP, Joe Lupo, senior vice president of the Borgata, said The Metropolitan restaurant chose dishes that were among King's favorite foods, as documented in numerous historical sources. 'Our general manager of the restaurant is an African-American female who wanted to come up with the menu to celebrate and honor Dr. King,' said Mr Lupo. 'We allow our managers to run their restaurants. She did research and came up with an authentic recipe. It's very clear these were his favorite foods.' A 2008 article in the Knoxville News Sentinel quotes a contemporary clergyman, Rev. G.H. Williams, a guide at the Martin Luther King Jr National Historic Site in Atlanta.

"Tax officials in Connecticut have admitted that they purposefully keep an eye on billionaires living in the state in order to ensure they don’t miss out on revenue generated from income tax that would be lost if the rich residents moved elsewhere. Tax officials in the state - home to some of the richest Americans - track the quarterly estimated payments of 100 high net-worth taxpayers and can tell when payments are down. Of that number, about a half-dozen taxpayers have an effect on revenue that's noticed in the legislature and Department of Revenue Services. Aerial photo of the Greenwich, Conn., estate belonging to billionaire hedge fund owner Stephen Cohen: Tax officials in Connecticut have admitted that they purposefully keep an eye on billionaires living in the state in order to ensure they don’t miss out on revenue generated from income tax . 'There are probably a handful of people, five to seven people, who if they just picked up and went, you would see that in the revenue stream,' said Kevin Sullivan, the state's commissioner of the Department of Revenue Services. With one exception, he said, state officials don't actually approach the super-rich. He said: 'There isn't friendly visiting or anything like that, how are you feeling? Doing all right? Doing OK?' Two years ago, tax officials were alarmed that a super-rich hedge fund owner might leave and reduce the state's income tax revenue. They set up a meeting and urged the unidentified taxpayer to stay. The effort was partly successful, with the taxpayer leaving Connecticut but agreeing to keep the hedge fund here. 'It would be nice to have both, but at least we didn't lose both,' said Kevin Sullivan, the state's revenue commissioner. Tax officials in a few states said they do not track individual tax payments, though state budget officials typically follow total quarterly tax payments by the rich to make sure revenue projections hold up. Ray Dalio, founder and co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, is one of Connecticut's richest residents. The state depends on the billions of dollars in revenue his income tax generates . And some experts don't believe there's any need to worry about the super-rich moving to avoid high taxes. 'The claims are almost always anecdotal,' said Matt Gardner, executive director of the institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Connecticut tax officials won't say who the super-rich are, citing privacy, but it's not hard to guess. Many movers and shakers in and around New York City, the capital of the banking and hedge-fund world, work in or populate the verdant suburbs next door in Connecticut. They include names like hedge fund owner Steven Cohen; Thomas Peterffy, of Interactive Brokers; Ray Dalio, of Bridgewater Associates; and Paul Tudor Jones, of Tudor Investment Corp. Combined, their net worth is more than $40 billion, according to Forbes. Those four declined to discuss their experiences, if any, with Connecticut tax officials. But if they or other big-moneyed individuals or their businesses decide to leave, the danger is real. In April 2014, super-rich taxpayers in Connecticut and elsewhere shielded their income through charitable donations or other means to avoid a tax hit following the expiration of federal tax cuts. The result: Connecticut income tax revenue plunged by nearly $281 million, more than 14 percent, compared with the same month a year before. In the 2014 budget year, state income tax revenue was $8.7 billion, more than half the $16.4 billion in total revenue from taxes and fees. The migration of the rich affects other taxes, such as the sales tax if wealthy car buyers purchase their Bentley in a different state or country . Three of the half-dozen or so super-rich taxpayers in Connecticut use the services of the Greenwich accounting firm Marcum LLP . While tax officials in several states say they track revenue from rich people's taxes, none said they have approached super-wealthy taxpayers as Connecticut has, intending to persuade them to stay put. States may call on them if they see a marked increase or decrease in payments, said Ronald Alt, senior research associate at the Federation of Tax Administrators. But he has never heard of state officials lobbying a taxpayer to stay put. Arkansas, home to Wal-Mart's Walton family, the owners of Tyson Foods and other super-wealthy taxpayers, does not contact them to alter their decisions, said John Theis, the state's assistant revenue commissioner. But the agency reviews what's changing for the wealthiest employers and individuals as part of its revenue forecast. The super-rich tend to donate to charities when tax laws are in flux. Andrew Hastings, chief development officer at the National Philanthropic Trust, noted the phenomenon at the end of 2012 with the so-called fiscal cliff, the combination of expiring tax cuts and across-the-board government spending reductions. 'It was a windfall for many charities,' he said. Three of the half-dozen or so super-rich taxpayers in Connecticut use the services of the Greenwich accounting firm Marcum LLP, and each has a yearly income of more than $1 billion. Partner John J. Mezzanotte also said he has seen a big step up in charitable giving. The migration of the rich affects other taxes, such as the sales tax if wealthy car buyers 'bought their Bentley in Florida instead of Greenwich,' he said. Sen. L. Scott Frantz, the ranking Republican on the legislature's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said the disproportionate impact on state revenue by one group of taxpayers — in this case, the super-rich — is 'pretty frightening when you think of it.' Even Connecticut's revenue commissioner acknowledges the state can't put too many eggs in its rich residents' baskets. The more the government relies on the super-wealthy, the more volatile that revenue is, said Sullivan, a former Democratic lawmaker. And raising taxes on the wealthy to attack income inequality has its limits, he said. Tax policy, he said, should not make the state dependent on the very rich. 'You don't want a system that doesn't ask them to do their fair share,' he said, 'but you don't want a system that makes you so reliant on their fair share that if they all picked up and left tomorrow or died tomorrow you'd be screwed, as they say in the tax business.'","Tax officials in the state track the quarterly estimated payments of 100 high net-worth taxpayers and can tell when payments are down .

"Comedian Stephen Fry raised eyebrows among audience members at the Baftas last night after apparently imitating scientist Stephen Hawking's electronically synthesised voice. Professor Hawking - who is known for his good humour as well as his fearsome intelligence - was attending the ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London to present an award. He made jokes on stage, declaring at one point that he was 'better looking' than host Mr Fry, 57. Scroll down for video .

After the prize-winners left the stage, he wrapped up, muttering 'that was really super' in what appeared to be an impression of Professor Hawking's electronic voice. The scientist, who suffers from motor neurone disease, is so paralysed by the illness that he can speak only with the aid of a computer. Yesterday's ceremony was the first public outing for Mr Fry and Mr Spencer since they tied the knot.

Eddie Redmayne carried off the leading actor Bafta for his performance as Professor Hawking in The Theory Of Everything. Redmayne, who has already won a Golden Globe and Screen Actor's Guild award for the role, dedicated this win to three families - his own, his family on the film and the Hawkings ‘for their trust in us, their generosity and their kindness’. The biopic, based on a memoir by Professor Hawking's first wife, deals with the onset of motor neurone disease which has left him severely disabled. The Theory Of Everything started the ceremony with a win when David Beckham presented it with the Bafta for outstanding British film. Its subject also made an appearance when he arrived on stage with another of the film's stars Felicity Jones, before they handed over the Bafta for special visual effects to Interstellar. But Mr Fry's efforts to be funny were met with disdain by some viewers on Twitter. London-based singer Clare Burnage said: 'Slightly thrown by Stephen Fry's verbal impression of the amazing Stephen Hawking. Was it bad taste? I rather think so.' Another Twitter user called Bantonio Banteras said: 'Stephen Fry doing an impression of Stephen Hawking was the most horrifically awkward thing I've ever seen.' Meanwhile Liam Trenfield tweeted: 'I do like Stephen Fry but that imitation of Stephen Hawking was horrifically awkward, and simply unneeded.'

"A set of rare photographs which show former US President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie relaxing on vacation in Cape Cod will go up for auction later this month. The candid images were taken by Washington Post heiress Katharine Graham at Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon's Cape Cod beach shack in August 1961, just two years before JFK's assassination and show the couple enjoying a laid-back holiday in the company of some of their closest friends and family, including Mrs Mellon and her banker husband Paul. In one series of photos, JFK can be seen eating a relaxed meal outside on the deck, while deep in conversation with his host Mrs Mellon. His wife is pictured just a few meters away, seated alongside Mr Mellon. Scroll down for video . Happy and relaxed: The images, including this one of former US President John F. Kennedy and Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, are set to go up for auction on February 19 . Laid-back: Jackie (R) and her host, banker Paul Mellon, are pictured chatting on what appears to be the deck of the Cape Cod property . Style icon: Jackie Kennedy (R), who was known for her impeccable fashion taste, is pictured in many of the images looking incredibly casual and carefree . Another set of  images, which will be auctioned off by RR Auction House on February 19, shows the then-44-year-old former President enjoying a swim in the bay alongside a male companion, before climbing up out of the water and onto what appears to be a dock, while reaching for a towel. None of the images seem to show JFK wearing his back brace, which was designed to help alleviate his chronic back pain - and which he is believed to have been wearing on the day of his death. Meanwhile, a usually-immaculate Jackie can be seen looking carefree and relaxed, wearing a casual collection of beachwear - a far cry from the high-end fashions she was usually pictured in. One image shows her enjoying a cigarette, while deep in discussion with a male friend. 'They're amazing pictures,' author Pamela Keogh, author of Jackie Style, told People. Enjoying a dip: In this image, JFK (L) can be seen swimming alongside a male companion . A rare moment of calm: None of the images seem to show JFK wearing his back brace, which was designed to help alleviate his chronic back pain - and which he is believed to have been wearing on the day of his death .

'[JFK] is not in perfect shape and Jackie's wearing a bathing suit your mother might have worn. 'This is not Jackie in French couture. They don't even look like they know they were being photographed.' Other guests pictured in the images include JFK's closest sister Eunice, artist William Walton, Katherine Graham's husband Philip, and three of the Grahams' four children. The Mellons' 26-acre estate, in Cape Cod’s Osterville, was located just a few miles away from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port - which JFK and Jackie used as their summer retreat. The sprawling Cape Cod property was sold in 2013 for nearly $20 million. The candid holiday snaps are the latest in a long line of JFK images and memorabilia to go under the hammer. Anchors aweigh! The couple, whose own summer retreat in Hyannis Port was just a few miles away, can be seen enjoying a boat trip with their friends in this rare picture . Bidding starts at... The images, including this shot of the group enjoying a day out at the beach, will go under the hammer at Boston-based RR Auction House on February 19 . Rare insight: According to RR Auction House's vice president Bobby Livingston, the images depict the couple in a completely new light, unlike many other photographs in which they are 'always posed' In October last year, a set of 13 wedding negatives from the Kennedys' spectacular wedding ceremony and celebration fetched $34,000 at auction, while in 2013, a Polaroid picture depicting the exact moment in which JFK was shot went under the hammer in Cincinnati. Surprisingly, the image, which was predicted to sell for up to $75,000 failed to attract a buyer, but is believed to have later been sold privately. But, as RR Auction House's vice president Bobby Livingston explained to People, the latest set of images show an entirely different side to the Kennedys - showing them at their most relaxed and happy, and offering a rare glimpse into their lives away from any public scrutiny. 'We've sold many White House photos of the family but they are always posed,' Mr Livingston said.

"A devastating new bullet designed to 'take out all your vital organs' has been released - aimed squarely at women who worry about protecting their own homes. Produced by Georgia based, G2 Research, the Radically Invasive Projectile or R.I.P, has been dubbed 'the last round you will ever need.' Intended to splinter into eight inviscerating shards, the R.I.P was launched at the Las Vegas Shot Show in January and footage of the devastating impact of the bullet has gone viral. Scroll Down for Video . Devastating: This is the Radically Invasive Projectile, or R.I.P. bullet which is designed to splinter and cause maximum damage to a victim and (right) the pumpkin shows the damage it can cause . Designed for home use: The president of G2R - the firm that produces the new R.I.P bullet has said that he is aiming the product to be used by women living on their own who want to protect their homes . Last round: This computer generated graphic shows how the bullet's shards would split from the casing after they were fired . The G2R website claims the R.I.P acts as a full metal jacket manufactured with trocar angles, which means that the each of the eight shards has three angles which taper to a point - to 'penetrate the dermis layer more efficiently.' 'It is capable of going through barriers such as sheet rock, plywood, sheet metal or glass and still performs its original intent. The bullet shreds through solid objects and only then, expands its energy,' claims the G2R website. The company's president, Cliff Brown explained to the Blaze that a scared and lonely housewife worried about protecting her home is one of the target customer bases for the terrifying new ammunition. 'I wanted to create a round that would work well against a home intruder,' said company president Cliff Brown told the Blaze. Entry: This gelatine rectangle reveals the power of the bullet as it enters and begins to spread its shards outwards . Impact: This split second frame reveals what could happen to the human body as the bullet begins to splinter inside the victim as it hits . Reverberations: The frightening impact of the bullet shows what could happen to the insides of a victim of the R.I.P bullet when it strikes . 'There were so many stories out there about a woman trying to defend her home and having to shoot someone five or six times and they’d still come after her. 'We wanted to create an effective one-shot man-stopper.' The frightening science behind bullets which expand and splinter having hit their target is that it cuts down on the risk of ricocheting as the body takes the whole brunt of the impact. G2R officials said they tested the bullet in a range of automatic and semi-automatic weapons, as well as in rifles, with zero failures. They claim to successfully tested the bullet in most firearms on the market including Sig, Glock, Beretta, Springfield, FN, Taurus, Walther, Khar, S&W and many others. Shattered: This split second frame highlights what happens to a water melon as the R.I.P bullet enters its rind . Explosive: This next frame from the same video reveals the dramatic effect the R.I.P bullet has on the watermelon . However, despite its power, the bullet is not capable of penetrating level 3A body armor - which is what law enforcement officials wear. 'That was one of our main goals when designing this bullet,' he told the Blaze. However, according to weapons enthusiast and political blogger, Richard Rowe, the new bullets bear an uncanny resemblance to Flechette bullets used in the Vietnam war but now banned under the Hague COnvention. Standard bullets do most of their damage through a transference of kinetic energy in an expanding bubble around the projectile. Carcass: This image shows the bullet about to hit (right) Flesh: This screen grab from a video by G2 Research reveals the exit wound on a turkey carcass caused by the R.I.P bullet . Flechette bullets operate in a different manner - they have tiny shards which act as spikes that penetrate the target and pass through the other side. Rowe criticizes the R.I.P round because he says that because the shards of this bullet are copper, they won't pass through the victim. He claims that they will more than likely come to rest inside the target - as witnessed in some of their promotional videos. And furthermore, becasue the round is designed for 9mm handguns wielded by women, the R.I.P is a cruel home defense weapon because it will only cause maximum pain and suffering.","New bullet unveiled at Las Vegas gun show this month that is designed to cause as much internal damage as possible to its victim .

"There are more Muslim children than Christian growing up in Birmingham, figures show. The latest statistics, extracted from the 2011 Census, give an insight into the fast pace of demographic change across Britain. They pinpoint several parts of the country where traditional religious beliefs are being eclipsed for the first time. Scroll down for video . The figures show that there are more Muslim children than Christian growing up in Birmingham . In England’s second city of Birmingham, of 278,623 youngsters, 97,099 were registered as Muslim compared with 93,828 as Christian. The rest were of other faiths such as Hindu or Jewish, or none. A similar trend has emerged in the cities of Bradford and Leicester, the towns of Luton, in Bedfordshire, and Slough in Berkshire, as well as the London boroughs Newham, Redbridge and Tower Hamlets, where nearly two-thirds of children are Islamic. Last night experts said more must be done to ensure that society does not become polarised along religious lines. Professor Ted Cantle, of the ICoCo Foundation, which promotes community cohesion, said: ‘What we are seeing are several trends running together. There is a long-term decline in support for the established religions, notably Christianity; continuing immigration from the Asian sub-continent; and higher fertility among the Muslim population, which has a considerably lower age profile. ‘There is also deepening segregation exacerbated by the loss of white population from cities and more intensive concentration of black and minority ethnic groups as a result of replacement. ‘This is the real problem, as residential segregation is generally compounded by school and social segregation. ‘Nothing surprises me about the pace of demographic change. What does surprise me is that the Government has no policy to combat segregation because it inevitably reduces understanding and tolerance on both sides of the divide.’ In England’s second city of Birmingham, of 278,623 youngsters, 97,099 were registered as Muslim compared with 93,828 as Christian (stock image) The figures show that Christianity is still the dominant religion in every local authority area in England and Wales, even in the most culturally diverse towns and cities. Of the 45.5million participants, 27.9million subscribed to Christianity, compared with 1.8million Muslims, the second largest grouping. However, among dependent children – defined as those aged up to 15, or between 16 and 18 and in education and still living at home – the gap is narrower. Of 12.1million youngsters, 6.1million were Christian and 1million were Muslim. And in some places, the balance has now tipped towards Islam. In Bradford, 52,135 children are Muslims (45 per cent) next to 47,144 Christians; in Leicester the figures are 22,693 and 18,190 respectively. The widest gap is in Tower Hamlets where 62 per cent of children are Islamic, outnumbering Christians by 34,597 to 8,995. Sughra Ahmed, president of the Islamic Society of Britain, said: ‘Britain’s Muslims make up just 5 per cent of the population but have a younger demographic profile than other faiths, as these figures show. It matters to us all that this next generation of young British Muslims develops a clear and confident sense of their British identity alongside their Muslim faith. It’s important that schools teach all of our children the values of respect and tolerance. ‘Britain is doing better at this than many of our neighbours. A major new study this week showed that most people think the children of immigrants are integrating well. ‘This is one of the most tolerant countries in the world. It will continue to be so, provided we all understand how that depends on respect for the beliefs of others too.’","Statistics from 2011 Census show more Muslim children than Christian growing up in Birmingham .

"The Department of Defense has spent about $1.2 million on impotence medications since they first went on its insurance plan's formulary, including more than a half-million dollars last year alone. Federal government contract records, filed under the category 'troop support,' show just how reliant America's fighting men have become on the little blue pill that can add between-the-sheets pushups back into their regular fitness regimen. Tapayers began footing the bill for erectile dynfunction medicine in 1998, when the military's TRICARE medical plan added Viagra and covered up to six pills per month. Records for those early years are hard to come by because Pentagon physicians were required to special-order the medication for each patient. By 2008, however, the government began issuing regular contracts to stock the pills in its pharmacies. GREEN FATGUES, BLUE PILLS: The Pentagon has paid for countless doses of Viagra for men in the field and stateside . NOW WITH EXTRA TAXPAYER DOLLARS: The US military has ramped up its purchases of Viagra for servicemen, spending more than $504,000 last year alone . The Washington Free Beacon uncovered some of those records. A broader survey of contracts shows $1,199,785 in purchases in the last seven years, of which 89 per cent were for Viagra. Other brands including Cialis and Levitra reeived narrower distribution to military men. TRICARE provides 'medically necessary' and 'appropriate' remedies for erectile dysfunction, and it doesn't stop with pills. 'External vacuum appliances' – a polite euphemism for penis pumps – are covered, as are penile implants, testicular prostheses and hormone injections . The Department of Defense's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee decides what does and doesn't make the cut. Most of the Viagra orders have been 30-pill bottles of 100mg tablets, delivered by a single pharmaceutical vendor in Dublin, Ohio. TRICARE forms filled out by prescribing physicians require a diagnosis for men under 50 that shows they suffer from 'organic impotence' – a condition that reduces blood fllow to the sex organs or causes nerve damage. About $1.2 million in taxpayer funds has paid for erectile dysfunction pills used by military men . IT'S NOT A HOOVER: The Pentagon's TRICARE medical insurance plan now covers 'external vacuum devices' – penis pumps – to treat erectile dysfunction, along with a range of miracle pills . Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines over 50 don't need to qualify – if the doctor says they need it, the taxpayers foot the bill. But Pentagon physicians are not permitted to provide the drugs to men whose impotence is entirely due to psychological factors. There are no records online that indicate the Department of Veterans Affairs is purchasing impotence drugs for its patients, which suggests that men who leave the armed services must use private insurance to cover the cost – or pay out-of-pocket.","Department of Defense started offering Viagra to its employees in 1998 but contract records only cover as far back as 2008 .

"A Mexican federal judge threw out a five-year, money-laundering sentence for Sandra Avila Beltran, ordering the immediate release of the 'Queen of the Pacific' for her alleged role as a liaison between Mexican and Colombian drug cartels. A statement issued Saturday by the Attorney General's Office said the judge ruled that Avila already had been tried for the same crime in Mexico and the United States. The ruling brings to an end a saga that began in 2007, when Avila was arrested while sipping coffee in a Mexico City diner. Sandra Avila Beltran is pictured in handcuffs as she is escorted by federal authorities upon arrival to Benito Juarez airport in Mexico City . Her case is widely known in Mexico because Avila is the niece of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, 'the godfather' of Mexican drug smuggling who is serving a 40-year sentence for trafficking and the murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena in 1985. Prosecutors alleged Avila spent more than a decade working her way to the top of Mexico's drug trade. They said her romance with Colombian Juan Diego Espinoza Ramirez brought together Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel with Colombia's Norte del Valle cartel. A statement issued Saturday by the Attorney General's Office said the judge ruled that Avila already had been tried for the same crime in Mexico and the United States . Avila was tried in connection with the seizure of more than nine tons of U.S.-bound cocaine on a vessel in Mexico's western port of Manzanillo and acquitted in December 2010. A Mexican appeals court upheld the verdict in 2011. But she remained jailed while Mexican courts decided on a U.S. extradition request, which judges granted in 2012. Avila also faced charges stemming from several seizures in Chicago in 2001 that amounted to 100 kilograms of cocaine. A 2004 indictment in the Southern District of Florida did not specify Beltran's role in the drug-dealing case. Avila was tried in connection with the seizure of more than nine tons of U.S.-bound cocaine on a vessel in Mexico's western port of Manzanillo and acquitted in December 2010 . In a plea deal in Miami in 2013, she pleaded guilty to a lesser count of being an accessory after the fact in an organization that included Espinosa Ramirez, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to cocaine trafficking charges. She was sentenced to time served and returned to Mexico, where she was sentenced on the money-laundering conviction last year. The Inquisitr reports that Avila had long denied the charges and described herself as a housewife with the luck to be 'born rich.' She first caught the attention of the authorities when the cartel kidnapped her son, though the boy was later found alive. She furthered her notoriety with a 2009 interview with Anderson Cooper.","A Mexican federal judge threw out a five-year, money-laundering sentence for Sandra Avila Beltran, ordering her immediate release .

Picking up on his host's hostile manner, the minstrel left the castle instead of retiring to bed - which for the lord's confirmed his suspicions, and he set his hunting dogs to go after him. But the dogs tore the musician limb from limb, and to this day he is said to haunt the castle grounds, with some guests reporting hearing the sound of baying hounds and a man screaming.

"The 'conservative' family of two young sisters arrested in Cambodia for taking naked photos inside the Angkor Wat temple has told Daily Mail Online: 'They didn't mean any disrespect.' Lindsey Adams, 22, and her 20-year-old sister Leslie, from Prescott, Arizona, were discovered apparently having dropped their trousers inside the temple complex. They have been deported to Thailand, fined $250 each and banned from entering Cambodia for the next four years. Cambodian officials have now confirmed earlier reports the sisters were being deported, saying 'the court decided to expel them from Cambodia' following their confessions. Family: Leslie (far left), Lindsey (2nd left), their mother Joy (2nd from right) and younger brother Rosser (right) Arrested: Lindsey Adams, 22, (pictured in an earlier holiday photo) and her sister Leslie, 20, were detained for taking naked pictures at Cambodia's sacred Angkor temple . Questions: Lindsay (left) and Leslie (right) from Prescott, Arizona, looked sullen as they spoke to police . Happier times: The sisters pulled funny faces and smiled in one of their more modest tourist snaps . Local police said the women 'lowered their pants to their knees and took pictures of their buttocks.' A world heritage site, Angkor contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is Cambodia's most popular tourist destination. Chau Sun Kerya, a spokeswoman for the Apsara Authority, said the women's actions were offensive because Angkor is considered sacred ground. According to Cambodia Expats Online the pair were charged with trafficking pornography and exposing their sexual organs. Awaiting further action: Officials are debating what action to take and what charges to level against the girls . Admitted their mistake: The girls apologized to officials and said they realized it was wrong, police said . Scene of the incident: They were taking nude photos inside the Preah Khan temple, one of Cambodia's oldest . Father: James 'Grizzly' Adams is a qualified pilot . Lindsey and Leslie's younger brother told Daily Mail Online: 'They didn't mean any harm, they didn't mean to disrespect any one.' Rosser Adams, who lives with his mother Joy in Prescott, added that the worldwide media attention had been 'annoying' for the family and said they didn't plan to comment further. Lindsey and Leslie's parents are separated and live in different homes in Prescott. Their mom Joy lives in a modest bungalow in a suburb of the town, while dad James owns a large five-bed, four bath house worth $500,000 on a posh estate. Neighbors say the two girls attend college and have been away from home, but split their time between both parents' houses when back. One neighbor, who asked not to be named, told Daily Mail Online: 'James is a really nice guy so this will have come as a shock to him. 'The family is very conservative, so this isn't the kind of attention they would want. 'James is a commercial airline pilot and he can be back and forth from his house. 'He has three children, two daughters and a son, they all seem like nice kids.' Adams, 60, nicknamed 'Grizzly' by friends – a reference to the famous 19th Century California mountain man and bear trainer James 'Grizzly' Adams - wasn't home when Daily Mail online visited yesterday. The Aviation Business Gazette published an article about Adams in September, 2013 saying the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had recognized him by including the pilot in the FAA Airmen Certification Database. The database, which appears on the agency's website at www.faa.gov, names Adams and other certified pilots who have met or exceeded the high educational, licensing and medical standards established by the FAA. Internet searches suggest Adams, originally from Louisiana, works as an airline transport pilot, a flight instructor, ground instructor and mechanic. A Facebook profile picture shows him dressed in a pilot's uniform and shows he's a member of the Taildragger Pilots United Facebook group. Family home: The girls' mom and brother live in this bungalow in Prescott, Arizona . Father: Both girls and their brother split their time between their mother's home and their father's home, also in Prescott, Arizona . Lelsie Adams in her high school yearbook. She and her sister now both attend college . Taildragger is the aviation term for aircraft with a conventional undercarriage. In May last year Adams obtained a firs- class medical designation to fly solo. He also has a Aeronica 7AC fixed wing, single-engine, two seater plane registered in his name. The girls' arrest is the second time in the last fortnight that tourists visiting the sprawling temple complex have been caught without their clothes. Three French tourists were deported last weekend after they pleaded guilty to taking nude pictures of each other inside another temple within the complex. The three deported French men received a suspended six-month prison sentence on two charges - public exposure and making pornography - and will be banned from re-entering Cambodia for four years. The trio were caught just days after a series of photos of Asian women posing nude at ancient Cambodian temples went viral online and outraged officials who vowed to step up efforts to prevent similar stunts.","Lindsey Adams, 22, and her sister Leslie, 20, were arrested at Angkor Wat after they were discovered snapping nude photos .

"Under the cover of darkness, a light blue van with two huge rotating aerials fixed to its roof drives slowly down a residential street. A camera reveals that in the back, twiddling a set of controls that might have been pinched from a Thunderbirds spaceship, sits a middle-aged man wearing a tweed jacket and flamboyant moustache. ‘Yes!’ he declares, peering conspiratorially through a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles. ‘There’s a TV set on at No 5. It’s in the front room. And they’re watching . . . Columbo!’ Smoke and mirrors: There is no evidence that a TV detector van has ever worked . The camera pans out to show a team of sinister looking heavies leaping from the van. ‘If you don’t have a TV licence, it won’t take us long to find you,’ a narrator informs viewers. ‘Don’t get a fine. Get a licence!’ This famous 20-second advert aired on the BBC hundreds of times during the Seventies, becoming as embedded in contemporary culture as parka jackets, sideburns and the Bay City Rollers. Terrified by its depiction of vans that could see through living room walls, a generation of Britons was cowed into lining up at the Post Office to buy a TV licence. So far, so effective; yet conspiracy theorists have long maintained that the menacing TV commercial is actually a cynical and deeply misleading piece of government propaganda. The ubiquitous TV detector van that it portrays doesn’t really exist, they claim. Indeed, the supposedly commonplace vehicles have never been widely used on Britain’s streets. Many believe they were paraded across TV screens — and are still used in press releases — as part of a dishonest PR stunt. The chance of one driving down your street is almost nil, they allege. Historic: The Television Detection Van was first introduced in 1952 . ‘Detector vans are a myth,’ the UKIP MEP Gerard Batten, a long-time campaigner against the licence fee, told me this week. ‘Prosecution [for not having a TV licence] depends on the accused being caught in the act of watching live broadcasts, or admitting to it. The non-existent threat of Detector Van evidence is just a means of getting suspects to incriminate themselves.’ Sceptics such as Batten point out there isn’t a single documented case in British legal history in which so-called ‘detection evidence’ from vans has been used to prosecute a licence fee evader. This was, sheepishly, confirmed by the BBC in 2011 in response to a (hitherto unreported) Freedom of Information request. Advances: The vans upgraded many times, but it is claimed their equipment has always been ineffective . Sceptics also wonder why the BBC has always refused to either say how many of the vehicles it owns, or to answer questions about how they work, who operates them, and where they are used. Instead, the Corporation’s spokesmen have for decades told reporters that revealing such information ‘might be useful to people trying to evade the licence fee’. All of which has only added to the weight of doubt regarding the very existence of the vans. This week the subject was thrown into the news following the leak of an internal BBC memo. The 18-page document, obtained by the Radio Times, laid bare in great detail the Corporation’s on-going efforts to target unlicensed viewers, more and more of whom are being pursued for evasion because they don’t realise you need a licence to watch live TV on smartphones or tablets. It revealed, for example, there are currently 334 ‘enforcement officers’ working in the UK, an increase of 20 per cent on last year. On patrol: Former drivers have said the vans would go out solely to be seen, and would often not have their equipment switched on . Meanwhile, roughly 5.8 per cent of households evade the £145.50 licence fee, up from 5.2 per cent in 2012. Yet nowhere in this detailed and supposedly authoritative document was there a single mention of the fabled TV detector vans, or of how they may be catching cheats. The revelation was seized upon by media commentators. One national newspaper reported it under the headline: ‘TV Detector vans: a work of fiction?’ In response, the BBC insisted the vans ‘do exist’ but refused to answer further questions. So what has been going on? This week, more than 60 years after TV detector vans were first unveiled, I managed to establish the truth behind the use of these controversial surveillance vehicles. The key to the mystery lay not with the BBC, but in the archives of the Post Office Vehicle Club (POVC), an organisation of 200 enthusiasts devoted to cars, vans and lorries owned by the postal service. Christopher Hogan, editor of the club’s newsletter, explained that, until 2002, the Royal Mail was in charge of TV licence collection and enforcement. And, he told me: ‘We know details about every vehicle it used, including their serial number, going back to 1906.’ The club therefore has records of every single TV detector van that was in operation between 1952, when they were first rolled-out, to 2002, when the Royal Mail lost the contract for licence enforcement. These confirm some vehicles existed — but there have never been more than 20 or so at any one time. This appears to confirm suspicions that detector vans always were — and almost certainly still are — largely a propaganda tool. Their story begins in the Fifties, when the Post Office announced, with some fanfare, it had acquired a ‘fleet’ of converted Hillman Minx and Morris Oxford estate cars, which had vast triangular aerials attached to their roofs. In the event, however, the POVC records reveal that only nine of these were ever in service. The early Sixties saw another ‘fleet’ of Commer detector vans unveiled with great fanfare. But, again, archives show that only 11 of these were used at any one time. A few years later, another ten Commers were introduced, bringing the total number of detector vans to 21. This quantity was maintained throughout the Seventies, Eighties (when first Dodge and then Leyland supplied new vans) and Nineties, when eventually Ford Transits were introduced. It continued until 2002, when licence enforcement was handed to the outsourcing firm Capita. Given that roughly 4,000 people are prosecuted for licence fee evasion every week, the usefulness of detector vans, in tracking down offenders, is highly debatable. Indeed, TV licensing catches all but a tiny minority of cheats by the very low-tech technique of sending inspectors to knock on their doors. Although ‘enforcement officers’ have no official powers of entry, they are trained in either talking their way across the threshold, or tricking homeowners into confessing they have been watching TV illegally. Vintage car enthusiast Martin Maltas owns one of the few Seventies detector vans still in existence, a  converted Dodge Spacevan. He worked in TV licence enforcement in Harrogate for four years in the early Eighties, but never saw a single detector van. Maltas adds, however, that his father occasionally used one while doing the same job in the Sixties. ‘I’ve talked to Dad and a lot of other people who worked in them and the whole point of the vans was their scare factor,’ he tells me. ‘They’d put adverts in the local paper saying “TV detector vans are coming to your town”. Then they would be driven around with their huge yellow aerials going around, to make sure they were seen.’ The detection equipment on the vans theoretically worked by picking up a signal that was emitted by the oscillator on TV sets. However, it was notoriously hard to operate, and almost useless at pinpointing televisions in blocks of flats and terraced homes, where there would be many TVs in close proximity. Indeed, an un-named caller to Radio 2 this week, who said he worked on one such vehicle in the Eighties and Nineties, claimed the equipment was rarely switched on. He said: ‘There were aerials on the roof, connected to nothing. We called it flag-waving: driving around to show people we were about.’ Other recent correspondents to newspapers have suggested many vans carried no equipment at all. Since 2002, when the Royal Mail stopped running vans, analogue TVs have been replaced by digital ones, so old detection equipment would be obsolete. Meanwhile, hostility to the licence fee has grown in tandem with the explosion in Freeview and satellite channels, which means people spend less time watching the BBC. In a bid to persuade them to pay up, the Corporation claims today’s enforcement officers have hand-held detectors that can pinpoint TVs ‘within 20 seconds’. But they refuse to explain how these devices work or how many are in use. The number of detection vans is also a secret. However, a 2009 procurement document seen by the Mail states the BBC was at this time seeking to ‘enhance the current fleet of vans by building a further fleet of vans (minimum five)’. That suggests there could be as few as ten in operation — one for every 2.5 million households. Interestingly, the BBC has since given evidence to the Information Commissioner arguing (successfully) that it should not be required to disclose details of the fleet under the Freedom of Information Act. Its submission, which has again been seen by this newspaper, argues that making such information public would ‘change the public’s perception of the effectiveness of detector vans’. It further warns: ‘If the deterrent effect of television detector vans is lost . . . a significant number of people would decide not to pay their licence fee.’ In other words, if the truth about these sinister vehicles which supposedly haunt our cul-de-sacs — not to mention the men in moustaches who operate them — ever gets out, then the BBC reckons we’ll stop being scared of them.","Detector Vans were heavily promoted by the BBC, who claimed they can detect working TV sets .

"A respected bishop was assaulted just weeks before his death by a carer who forced him to have cold showers and slapped his bottom, a court heard. The Rt Rev John Satterthwaite was suffering from dementia when he was 'subjected to unnecessary humiliation and degradation' by carer Kate Rogowski. The former Bishop of Gibraltar, known around the world for his past roles in the Anglican church, died aged 88 just weeks after the assault. Rogowski, 25, was found guilty of assaulting the Reverend after a trial at Preston Magistrates Court and was given an eight-week jail term. The Rt Rev John Satterthwaite died a month after his treatment at the hands of Kate Rogowski came to light . The vulnerable clergyman did not live to see justice done and died in Chorley Hospital in May last year - though his death is not related to the assault. The court heard he was a resident at The Lodge care home within the Buckshaw Village Retirement complex, near Chorley, Lancashire. Magistrates said Rogowski, of Buckshaw Village, 'acted in direct contravention of his care plan, causing him unnecessary humiliation and degradation by cold showering him and slapping his bottom' and had shown no remorse. It is understood a member of staff raised the alarm. Rt Rev Satterthwaite was Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe from 1980 to 1993 and had held previous roles as Bishop of Fulham and General Secretary of the Church of England's Council for Foreign Relations. He is considered to have played a major role in strengthening his church's relations with other denominations and in establishing an Anglican presence on the continent. He retired in 1993 and lived in Carlisle before moving to the rest home. The former Bishop of Gibraltar was suffering from dementia and living the Lodge care home within the Buckshaw Village Retirement complex, near Chorley, Lancashire at the time of the assault . DC Carl Matthews, who investigated the case, said: 'This victim was a vulnerable member of the community who has been subjected to ill treatment at the hands of one of the people who were entrusted to care for them. 'Rogowski showed total contempt for his well-being, displaying shameful behaviour that should never be tolerated. Thankfully this behaviour is not a true reflection of the majority of the care staff.' The Diocese of Carlisle and the Diocese of Blackburn have issued a joint statement saying: 'We are really shocked to discover this sad end to the very distinguished life of Bishop John. 'He was a tremendous character with a huge fund of interesting stories about his time as Bishop of Europe. 'Bishop John was much loved by the very many people who knew him. All people deserve respect, but especially the most vulnerable in our society. We pray for all those who work for older people.' Preston Magistrates Court heard Rogowski caused the clergyman 'unnecessary humiliation and degradation' A spokesman for HICA, which manages The Lodge, said: 'We are gravely saddened for the resident that this situation occurred and we appreciate how distressing this is for the person and their family members and the team currently working at the home. 'At HICA we have a zero tolerance approach to any forms of abuse and our safeguarding policy and training ensures that any issues such as these are reported immediately and action taken. 'As a not-for-profit organisation our only objective is to provide, safe, caring, responsive, effective and well-led care services and we are proud to be working with both safeguarding departments and the police across all areas of our operation to ensure that poor practice such as this is stamped out in the care sector.'","Former Bishop of Gibraltar was known around the world for church role .

"Jose Mourinho will aim to balance a refreshed team with a winning one when Chelsea, still reeling from the New Year's Day loss at Tottenham, host Watford in the FA Cup third round on Sunday. Rather than send his front-line players into battle swiftly after a loss which saw Chelsea's Barclays Premier League advantage wiped out, Mourinho is likely to rotate his options after an arduous festive schedule. 'Obviously we are going to rest a couple of players. That's normal,' he said. VIDEO Jose Mourinho: Watford are a good team, but we'll rest players .

'Obviously we want to try to beat Watford, but at the same time we have to analyse the players' condition and make the right decision for them.' Striker Diego Costa and forward Eden Hazard are among the front-line Chelsea players who could be rotated out of the starting XI. Petr Cech could replace Thibaut Courtois in goal, depending on the severity of the latter's finger injury, while Oscar, Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic could also be afforded a rest after the 5-3 loss at White Hart Lane. Rather than turn to youth, like Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Dominic Solanke or Lewis Baker, Mourinho is planning to field players who have been on the first-team periphery this term, like Ramires, who has been hampered by a niggling groin injury, but remains an integral figure in the season run-in. 'I have players from the first-team and players that we need to have in condition to play,' Mourinho said. 'Hopefully Ramires is getting there step by step. He played 45 minutes (against Tottenham). 'He's a player we need and he's a player we haven't had for the first part of the season. Petr Cech could deputise in place of Courtois if he is not fit to play against Watford . Striker Diego Costa (right) could be one of the players rested against Watford by Mourinho . Nathan Ake (right) takes on Didier Drogba (centre) in training as he looks to earn a start in the FA Cup . John Obi Mikel (second right) could feature against Watford as he was an unused substitute against Tottenham . 'When we had him he was not really ready and finally he looks like he's almost getting there.' Mourinho is still to ascertain the full extent of Courtois' finger problem, but has a more than capable deputy in Cech, who may have played anyway. The Blues boss added: 'He (Courtois) has a problem in one of his fingers. Let's see what happens. 'I don't know (if it's broken). I didn't ask. I just asked if he could carry on at half-time (at Spurs).' When Chelsea were unbeaten, eight points clear of Manchester City in the Premier League and apparently cruising, thoughts of some turned to a quadruple quest. Now, with a championship title battle in full swing, the FA Cup could be deemed a distraction, but Mourinho's approach remains. 'It's impossible to go for one trophy, or two, or three, or four,' he said. 'It's only possible to go for the next match. And the next match is FA Cup and we want to try to win the FA Cup. Simple as that. Mourinho (centre) denied that the FA Cup is a distraction for Chelsea, and said he wants to win the trophy . John Terry (centre) has demanded a response from Chelsea after a 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on Thursday . Frank Lampard (centre) scored Manchester City's winner as they moved level on points with Chelsea . 'We don't choose competitions. We choose the next match and the next match is against Watford. And it's an important match. 'It's a difficult game. It's a good team, one of the best teams in the Championship. 'We have the experience of the difficulties against teams like Bolton, Derby, teams that we played already this season. 'They have a good team. They are fresh. They didn't play this New Year fixture. 'They will go to try to beat us, so we need to be alert because the game is going to be difficult.' John Terry hopes Chelsea will respond to seeing their advantage over defending Premier League champions City evaporate. Frank Lampard, a team-mate of Terry's for 13 seasons at Stamford Bridge, scored to earn last season's league winners victory over Sunderland before Chelsea's defeat at Spurs. 'It's hard to see them claw us back,' Terry said on chelseafc.com. Mourinho criticised the performance of referee Phil Dowd (centre) after the defeat to Tottenham . Gary Cahill (centre) may face disciplinary reaction for kicking  Tottenham striker Harry Kane (second right) 'We were eight points in front and now we're level on points. 'It's disappointing to have lost that lead but we said in the dressing room we'll come together, put a run together and hopefully get a lead again.' The defeat could have many ramifications, not least for the title race and Mourinho, who invited scrutiny on the performance of referee Phil Dowd at White Hart Lane and could face Football Association disciplinary action. Cahill could also be punished retrospectively for kicking Spurs striker Harry Kane in the back.","Jose Mourinho will rest a 'a couple of players' against Watford in the third round of the FA Cup .

"Amid a swirl of diplomatic maneuvering, President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met at the White House on Monday to evaluate the prospects of reviving an elusive peace plan to end the conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists. Hanging over the discussions was a potential split between Obama and Merkel on sending Ukraine defensive weapons to wage a more effective fight against the rebels. The White House has said Obama is reconsidering his opposition to arming Ukraine given a recent surge in violence, while Merkel has adamantly opposed such steps. Obama said Monday that a 'decision has not yet been made' as to whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with lethal, defensive weapons and that he continues to hope that diplomacy will prevail. UPresident Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel hold a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Monday. Obama said a 'decision has not yet been made' as to whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with lethal, defensive weapons and that he continues to hope that diplomacy will prevail . President Barack Obama, right, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, left, hold a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Monday morning before participating in a joint press conference together and a working lunch . The U.S. and Europe have largely been in lockstep in their response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, raising the prospect that the public divide on lethal aid was merely a tactic to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to accept a peace plan. Merkel and Obama stressed on Monday at their joint press conference that their countries were united on the issue of Russian aggression. The U.S. President said that even though his country and the European countries it is aligned with may disagree tactically on how to approach Russia if peace talks fail, they are 'completely unified' on the broader issue. 'We stand up for the same principles of inviolability of territorial integrity,' Merkel said in her remarks, according to the White House's translation. The German Chancellor admitted that the coalition working to secure a peace agreement with Russia has 'suffered a lot of setbacks' but said she still sees no military solution to the situation in Ukraine. 'We have to put all our efforts in bringing about a diplomatic solution,' she said. Obama said he too favors peace talks and hopes sanctions will weaken Russia enough to bring Putin to the table. But if diplomacy fails, Obama said, the U.S. will look at all available options, including lethal weapons. After a German reporter referred to him as 'Nobel Laureate Obama,' per a translation, and asked where is 'red line' is on the issue, Obama refused to provide a specific timeline and said a decision would come about as part of an 'ongoing analysis' of Russia's encroachment on Ukraine. He later said of the decision before him, 'The measure by which I make these decisions is: ""Is it more likely to be effective than not?"" And that is what our deliberations will be about.' 'We are not looking for Russia to fail. We are not looking for Russia to be surrounded and contained and weakened.' Obama explained. The United States' preference, he said, is for a 'strong, prosperous, vibrant, confident Russia that can be a partner with us.' 'Unfortunately,' he said, Russia made a decision that is not only 'bad for them strategically' but bad for Europe and for the world. 'In the face of this aggression and these bad decisions, we can't simply try to talk them out of it,' Obama continued. 'We have to show them that the world is unified in imposing a cost for this aggression. 'And that's what we're going to continue to do,' he added. U.S. soldiers who are elements of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and Polish 12th Mechanised Brigade soldiers march during a partner training with Polish 12th Mechanised Brigade at the Drawsko Pomorskie military training area in Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland, near the Ukraine, on Monday. Over the next few weeks, the US soldiers will conduct training as part of so-called 'Stryker Detachment', and then from March 12 will take part in the exercises with 1st motorized infantry battalion of the Polish 12th Mechanised Brigade . Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met with Putin and Ukrainian leaders last week and announced a new summit meeting for Wednesday in Minsk. The United States will not be at the table when French and German leaders meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Putin in an attempt to breathe life into a much-violated September peace plan. Merkel said Monday, however, that her country has been in 'very, very close contact' with the U.S on sanctions and they have been in 'very close cooperation, very close coordination.' She told reporters that she and Hollande were looking to bring about a ceasefire with talks and at least create conditions in which civilians not dying. 'I myself would not be able to live with not having made this attempt,' she said of this week's meeting. If a point in time comes in which it becomes clear that 'success is not possible,' however, then the United States and Europe will have to come together and discuss next steps, she noted. The European Union decided Monday to temporarily hold off on slapping more sanctions on Russians and Ukrainian separatists while awaiting the outcome of the peace talks. 'The principle of the sanctions is maintained but the application will depend on what happens on the ground,' French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said during a break in talks with EU foreign ministers in Brussels. The meeting in the Belarusian capital takes place with Merkel and Hollande deeply opposed to arming Ukraine in its bid to push back the separatists that NATO and the United States insist are being armed by Russia, which also has troops fighting in the eastern Ukraine. Opponents of arming Kiev believe that could open a proxy war between Washington and Moscow. Merkel and Hollande insist the only way to end the conflict is through diplomacy. 'It must be possible to find — not through military conflict but at the negotiating table — a balance of interests inside Ukraine that guarantees both the integrity of the state and the appropriate scale of autonomy' for the separatists, said German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and French President Francois Hollande, enter a hall for their and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's talks in the Kremlin. Talks among the leaders of Russia, France and Germany on a peace initiative for Ukraine ended early Saturday and will resume on Wednesday . Secretary of State John Kerry, on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, said that he, too, was working for a diplomatic solution but was ambiguous on arms for Kiev. 'I have no doubt that additional assistance of economic kind and other kinds will be going to Ukraine. And we do so understanding that there is no military solution,' he said. 'The solution is a political, diplomatic one. 'But President Putin's got to make the decision to take an off ramp. And we have to make it clear to him that we are absolutely committed to the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine no matter what,' Kerry said in response to a direct question about sending arms. At the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, Vice President Joe Biden had stopped short of explicitly addressing possible arms deliveries. 'We will continue to provide Ukraine with security assistance not to encourage war, but to allow Ukraine to defend itself,' he said. Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican members of Congress on the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee were said Monday to be creating legislation that provides for 'defensive lethal assistance' for Ukraine. A congressional aide told Reuters that the committee's chairman and ranking member were 'far along in discussions' on the issue. Both chambers of the legislative branch unanimously passed legislation in December authorizing an arms shipment to Ukraine and Obama gave the bill his approval. The legislation gave him the authority when to send weapons, however, and some members of Congress are agitated that he's not yet acted. 'The Ukrainian people do not have time for President Obama’s “strategic patience,"" ' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday after Obama and Merkel's press conference, taking aim at a term used by the administration in a document outlining the principles that will guide the president's foreign policy decisions during his remaining two years in office. 'It is time for President Obama to quit equivocating and quickly provide Ukraine the defensive weapons it needs,' he said. Graham, a Republican who has announced that he's considering a presidential bid, said 'Obama’s continual weakness in the face of aggression is making the world a more dangerous place.' 'His reluctance to provide defensive weapons – which Ukraine desperately needs to protect themselves against Russian intervention – is another low point in a presidency which has many to choose from,' Graham charged. The current situation 'once again shows that under President Obama’s leadership it is better to be America’s enemy than her friend,' he continued. 'It’s a sad fact that our enemies are seldom challenged while our friends are constantly undercut and abandoned.' More than 5,300 people have been killed since fighting began in April, according to a U.N. tally, and the bloodshed has markedly increased over the past two weeks. On Monday, a powerful explosion rocked a chemical plant and set it on fire outside the separatist stronghold of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Rebels said the plant was hit by government shelling.","Obama said Monday that a 'decision has not yet been made' and he continues to hope that diplomacy will prevail .

"An iconic American civil rights group that was founded to fight the Ku Klux Klan is now taking aim at the only African-American to hint he might run for president in 2016 – because he opposes gay marriage. Republican Ben Carson, a retired world-class pediatric neurosurgeon, has found himself listed on the Southern Poverty Law Center's 'Extremist Watch' website alongside neo-Nazis, skinheads, and Klansmen, in a peculiar example of the group's mission-creep. Carson said Monday that the characterization is 'projectionist and ignorant.' Asked if he thought the SPLC was 'crooked,' Carson replied, 'Oh, definitely. And I – certainly that's been the impression of everybody I've heard from.' 'I find it very ironic that they would castigate someone as a hater whose entire professional career was spent saving people's lives,' he said. Carson described a scholarship program he has endowed, and literacy projects he has set up 'specifically in poor areas, so that kids can learn the love of reading, which will have a profound impact on their academic performance.' 'But because I don't agree with them about traditional marriage, I'm a ""hater"",' he mused. 'And that's pretty interesting that someone could come away with that belief.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ben Carson, a possible 2016 presidential candidate, is making waves in Iowa (shown) and other early primary states – but his right-of-center views have attracted unusual critics including America's most iconic civil rights legal aid group . NO DIFFERENCE? Presidential hopeful Ben Carson appears on the same Southern Poverty Law Center's watch list that includes skinheads and neo-Nazis, because he is a Christian who opposes gay marriage . David Duke (left), founded the Louisiana Ku Klux Klan and later ran for governor of Louisiana; the SPLC lists him on its 'Extremist Watch' website . Carson first attracted national notice in 2013 when he chastized President Barack Obama from a few feet away at the speaker's podium during that year's National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. 'Obamacare,' Carson said, 'is really, I think, the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.' 'In a way, it is slavery,' he added then. His political positions are wrapped tightly in his Christianity, including opposition to gay marriage and a preference for a flat income tax rate that would affect everyone equally. 'When I pick up by Bible, you know what I see?' he asked the prayer breakfast audience. 'I see the first individual in the universe, God, and he’s given us a system. It’s called a tithe.' Tithing is an institution that calls for Christians to donate a flat 10 per cent of their earnings to the church where they worship. But it's speaking against same-sex unions that has put him on the hot seat, and may endanger his chances of emerging as a serious presidential contender outside America's Bible belt. HORROR: Floyd Corkins entered the conservative Family Research Council's office in 2012 with a gun and shot a security guard, later saying he meant to kill as many people as he could; he got the idea from the SPLC's 'Extremist Watch' website . 'If we can redefine marriage as between two men or two women or any other way based on social pressures as opposed to between a man and a woman,' he wrote in his 2012 book America The Beautiful, 'we will continue to redefine it in any way that we wish, which is a slippery slope with a disastrous ending.' More dramatically, he said during a 2013 Fox News hannel interview that 'traditional' marriage is 'a well-established pillar of society and no group – be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality – it doesn’t matter what they are, they don’t get to change the definition.' NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association, advocates for the normalization of pedophilia in society. The Southern Poverty Law Center cites these examples as evidence that Carson belongs on the same list as white nationalists and antisemites. Days after the Fox interview, he admitted on CNN that his comments were 'somewhat insensitive, and I certainly apologize if I offended anyone.' 'I have always advocated equality for everyone,' Carson insisted. 'As a Christian, we have a duty to love everyone and to love them as ourselves. You know, I love gay people. I love straight people.' On Monday Carson told Daily Mail Online that 'when embracing traditional Christian values is equated to hatred, we are approaching the stage where wrong is called right and right is called wrong.' 'It is absolutely critical for us to once again advocate true tolerance in this world where freedom of speech is closely guarded. That means being respectful to all of those with whom we disagree, as well as allowing people to live according to their values without harassment.' BAD COMPANY: The Southern Poverty Law Center lists Ben Carson as an 'extremist' alongside former KKK National Imperial Wizard Jeff Berry (left) and White Aryan Resistance founder Tom Metzger (right) RACE POLITICS: Malik Zulu Shabazz (left), head of the New Black Panther Party,has attracted the SPLC's attention but is one of only a few African-Americans on the 'extremist' list – along with Carson . 'It is nothing but projectionist and ignorant,' Carson said, 'when groups label certain people with whom they disagree as haters. Said behavior is truly uncouth and should be viewed as such.' Placing an individual or organization on a high-profile, credible list of extremists can have unintended consequences. In August 2012 a gunman namex Floyd Lee Corkins entered the Family Research Council's headquarters in Washington in an attempt – as he later explained – 'to kill as many people as possible' Corkins shot a security guard before he was disarmed. He chose his target from the SPLC's 'Hate Map' web page – a geographic guide to its extremist list. The Family Resarch Council, like Carson, landed on the site because it opposes gay marriage. Putting Carson on a list along with former Klan leader David Duke and skinhead Eric 'The Butcher' Fairburn wasn't the first time the organization dabbled in national electoral politics. In 2011 it included Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul on a list titled 'Electoral Extremism: 23 Candidates on the Radical Right,' listing 'Right-wing libertarian' as his 'EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY.' Cornell Law School professor William Jacobson, wrote Friday that 'the Southern Poverty Law Center ceased long ago to be a neutral source of information.' The SPLC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The group's controversial spokesman Mark Potok did speak to the left-wing website Talking Points Memo, however. NO ARGUMENT: Holocaust denier Ernst Zuendel is on the SPLC's list for producing publications titled 'The Hitler We Loved and Why' and 'Did Six Million Really Die?' 'Our criticism of him was based in large part on his very extreme rhetoric about the evils of gay people,' Potok said. 'He says that any criticism he makes is always kind and never meant to destroy the person, but then he says that gay marriage will lead to the destruction of America much in the same way the Roman Empire collapsed.' In February 2014 Potok claimed on CNN that 'anti-black attitudes among American whites have gone up quite significantly between 2008 and 2012, to the point where now more than half of white Americans have these anti-black attitudes.' SPLC's latest nonprofit income tax return shows that its assets totaled more than $314 million at the end of October 2014. More than $3 million of its income between 1999 and 2008 came from the Picower Foundation, whose founder Jeffry Picower earned billions – and later had to forfeit the money – from convicted scammer Bernie Madoff's investment frauds.","SPLC started as a civil rights legal aid charity but has since placed conservatives of many stripes in its crosshairs .

"A watchdog group filed a complaint against Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock today over his home sale to a campaign donor. Schock sold his home to an executive at Caterpillar, Inc., in 2012 for more than three times its assessed value, the liberal website Blue Nation Review reported last week. Caterpillar is headquartered in Schock's district and the executive, former vice president of the company Ali Bahaj, had donated to Schock, the website said. Illinois Republican U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock sold his home to an executive at Caterpillar, Inc., in 2012 for more than three times its assessed value . Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said the Office of Congressional Ethics should investigate whether the sale violated federal law and House rules. The congressman has said the price was in line with other nearby properties. Schock also told reporters during a stop in Peoria on Friday that his real estate agent handled the transaction and he never spoke to the buyer. 'There's nothing there,' Schock said. Schock bought the vacant property in Dunlap, Illinois, on which the home was built for $128,250 in 2003, according to property records. The 4,100-square-foot home — with four bedrooms and three fireplaces — was completed in 2007, records show. The following year Schock won his bid for the U.S. House of Representatives. Schock said the home was listed for four years before it sold in 2012 for $925,000. He noted there were other homes in the area that sold for more, and that the price per square foot of comparable home sales 'were right in line with what everything was selling for at that time'. Schock bought the vacant property in Dunlap, Illinois, on which the home was built for $128,250 in 2003. The 4,100-square-foot home  was completed in 2007, records show. Schock said the home was listed for four years before it sold in 2012 for $925,000 . A review of property records by The Associated Press found between 2011 and 2013, homes of comparable size in the neighborhood consistently sold for three times their assessed value, or more. That includes one 5,400-square-foot home on more than half an acre — about double the size of Schock's lot — that sold for $1.07 million. But Schock's home sold for about $225 per square foot — about $50 to $75 more per square foot than other homes in the same area that were listed at similar size and condition. Bahaj and his wife donated a combined $4,600 to Schock's campaign in 2008, the maximum allowable contribution, and Ali Bahaj gave $1,000 to the congressman's joint fundraising committee last year, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. Bahaj also has donated to Caterpillar's political action committee, which has supported Schock. Schock's spokesman did not immediately respond Monday to a reporter's request for comment about the complaint. Schock has recently also faced questions over his lavish office decor in Washington, D.C. A member of staff was said to have confessed that that the new design was based on Downton Abbey's red room, the Washington Post reported. However, the 33-year-old Illinois congressman has refused to say if he drew his inspiration from Julian Fellowes' hit television series, starring Hugh Bonneville, Michelle Dockery and Elizabeth McGovern. A top aide for Schock also resigned earlier this month after it emerged that he had posted racially charged comments online.

"The lead singer of the Eighties band T'Pau has always managed to retain her size eight figure . Carol Decker has never had to watch her weight. The lead singer of the Eighties band T'Pau has always been the envy of her friends because she managed to retain her size eight figure without much effort. But when she was 53, all that changed and the 5ft 4in singer of the hits China In Your Hand and Heart And Soul put on 2st in a year, taking her from 7½ st to 9½ st. And no matter what she tried, she couldn't shift it. 'Cutting back on carbs and spending more time in the gym just weren't working,' she says. 'I was two years into my menopause, so I thought: ""This is it - you hit your 50s, you kiss goodbye to your waistline and turn into a sphere."" ' But that wasn't the only change she'd noticed. 'I started to feel uncommonly tired all the time,' says Carol, now 57. 'After concerts I'd be shattered and I didn't want to do anything except go to sleep. At home, by 3pm I was done for the day. 'My children were 12 and eight and I needed my energy for them. I found I needed to sleep eight to ten hours a day, but I never got that because of my busy life and school-age kids. I was constantly napping.' Initially, she blamed this on the menopause, too. But after a year without any improvement, her husband, Richard Coates, 50, encouraged her to seek medical advice. Her doctor agreed that the tiredness could be due to the menopause, but also gave her a blood test for anaemia. Carol had been anaemic during her pregnancies. 'The breathlessness and general lethargy were similar,' she says. However, the test came back clear. Still feeling exhausted, she asked for more tests - and a simple blood test finally pinpointed not just the cause of her tiredness, but her weight gain, too: Carol has a severely underactive thyroid gland. It's a common problem and Carol's not the only one to confuse the symptoms with the menopause. About one in 50 women and one in 1,000 men have an underactive thyroid gland, also known as hypothyroidism. But Lyn Mynott, chief executive of the charity Thyroid UK, says the figures could be far higher, as many people aren't going to their GP, often putting their symptoms down to the time of life or 21st-century fatigue. Hypothyroidism stems from a problem with the thyroid gland in the neck, reducing the amount of the hormone thyroxine it produces. 'The thyroid gland regulates your metabolism, so if it becomes underactive, lots of things in the body slow down or don't work very well,' says Miles Black, a surgeon at the London Thyroid Clinic. 'As a result, people feel much more tired than usual. They also put on weight and often feel cold. Their gut slows down so they become constipated and they may become prone to dry skin, thinning hair and muscle or joint pain. 'Some people also have a vague brain fog or feel depressed.' Hypothyroidism can occur at any stage in life - babies can be born with it - but it most commonly occurs in women between the ages of 40 and 50. At this age, some presume their symptoms are just a part of the menopause or getting older. But when she was 53, she went from from 7½ st to 9½ st in a year, and began feeling tired all the time . 'The chief difference is that hypothyroidism does not cause hot flushes as the menopause does,' says Mr Black. 'Normally, the hypothyroidism symptoms will become more extreme: they may develop a puffy face, a deepening of their voice or even goitre (a swelling in the neck). 'Any woman who has unremitting unexplained fatigue should seek a blood test to rule out a thyroid issue.' Early diagnosis is preferable because if left untreated hypothyroidism can increase the risk of heart disease. This is because it encourages an increase in levels of bad LDL cholesterol, which can block arteries. Quite why the thyroid gland should suddenly struggle to produce enough thyroxine during middle age, or at any point in life, is unclear. 'It may be genetics, as it does tend to run in families, and it may also be hormonal as it does tend to affect women more. Or it could be that the thyroid gland just winds down with age,' says Mr Black. 'The most likely reason is a combination of all these things.' However, there are some acknowledged causes. Often it can be caused by an autoimmune attack, which means that the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack the thyroid gland. Some medications, such as the heart rhythm drug amiodarone and some steroids, can suppress the action of the thyroid gland. Pregnancy, which puts pressure on the thyroid to produce more thyroxine, can also temporarily induce hypothyroidism. The condition can be picked up by a blood test that checks for levels of TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone. High levels suggest the thyroid may not be working effectively, as it is having to be driven hard by the TSH to push out adequate amounts of thyroxine. Sometimes a blood test may also be given to check for levels of thyroxine, also called T4. 'Some people have what we call subclinical hypothyroidism, which means their TSH is high, but their T4 is normal, and some people have symptoms, even though their TSH and T4 levels are fine,' says Mr Black. 'It is not a clear cut area and different doctors have different attitudes to this. I normally treat these people with levothyroxine (a synthetic form of the thyroxine hormone) and see if the symptoms improve.' Levothyroxine is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism. Carol Decker has been on levothyroxine since her diagnosis in 2011, though she was initially reluctant to take tablets. 'I don't like taking medicine if I can avoid it,' says Carol, who lives with her family in Henley-on-Thames. 'I told my doctor: ""I know you're going to prescribe thyroxine, but I've been on the internet and I'm concerned about the potential side-effects.""' These include headaches, diarrhoea, chest pain, feeling restless, temporary hair loss, muscle cramps, an itchy rash and trouble sleeping. 'When I asked my doctor what would happen if I didn't take the medication, she replied: ""Your heartbeat will get slower and slower over the years until one day it will stop and you will die."" ' Carol has been on levothyroxine (a synthetic form of the thyroxine hormone) since her diagnosis in 2011 . Despite her fears, Carol concedes she felt better within a week of starting the treatment. 'I've not felt any side-effects. In fact, I've only felt better. Getting my energy back was paramount. Before it was a struggle just going about my day and making it through to the evening. I began to dread performing as I could barely stay awake or summon up the energy or enthusiasm to do it. But since being on thyroxine, I've not had such problems and feel like I did before the symptoms started. I feel and look more like my old self. I'm 9st, and I'd like to get under that so I can wear my lovely old clothes again.' Just why she developed hypothyroidism is unclear, but there may be a genetic link. Carol's mother, Patsy, who died from renal failure in 2014 aged 78, also developed an underactive thyroid in her 60s. The diagnosis hasn't altered my lifestyle or habits, but if I feel tired I get a bit paranoid as to why and then I remind myself everyone gets tired,' she says. Carol is moving a bit slower than normal - but only because she is using crutches and an air boot, having fractured her right ankle after falling while rehearsing. 'It was a serious injury: apparently, I've been lucky not to lose blood supply and have the bone die. The biggest tragedy is having to go on-stage in flats. 'I can't move too much in case I wrench my ankle, so I jig about from the hips up. I never drink before a show but, because my ankle is weak, I'll suddenly totter off to the right and I'm sure the audience is thinking ""Hello?!"" ' As far as her condition is concerned, she says: 'As long as my thyroid behaves itself, I should be fine. I look after myself. At my age, you get more out of life if you're sensible.'

"A woman who was left in a coma with horrific burns after her car burst into flames during a driving lesson has married the boyfriend who stuck by her in the wake of the accident and helped her learn to walk again. Lindsay Wood, 23, was left with life-changing injuries after her car collided with another during a driving lesson in September 2009 and erupted into a fireball. The then 18-year-old, from Cornwall, suffered third degree burns to 42 per cent of her face and body and was in a coma for months after the accident. Lindsay Wood, 23, has learnt to walk again and married her boyfriend Robert Wood (pictured on their wedding day), who stuck by her when she was left with life-changing injuries after her car burst into flames . Mrs Wood was just 18-years-old when her car collided with another and burst into flames during a driving lesson. She was left in a coma for months and suffered third degree burns to 42 per cent of her face and body . Mrs Wood, from Cornwall, was training to in beauty when she was involved in the collision which changed her life. She was pulling out of a T-junction and collided with a car, causing her vehicle to erupt in flames . She was initially taken to Treliske Hospital in Truro, Cornwall, but later transferred to the specialist Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where she eventually came out of her coma – only to spend several more months in hospital having treatment for her injuries. As well as receiving specialist burns care, she also had to have some of her fingers amputated, several skin grafts and plastic surgery. Mrs Wood, who was living with her parents Valerie and Robert, both now 48, at the time of the incident, had met her boyfriend Robert Wood just 11 months before the crash. While she lay in a coma in hospital, her parents told Mr Wood, who was 21 at the time, that he didn't have to feel obliged to stick around when she was so ill. However, he sat by her bedside every day and when he returned to work as a sales assistant, he drove up to see her every weekend. Recounting the period leading up to the crash, Mrs Wood said: 'At the time life was great. 'I was hoping to go to college to study beauty and I'd been dating Robert for around 11 months after meeting in town. 'He's seen me around, liked the look of me and approached me. We went on a date and had hit it off straight away, but it was still early days. 'Passing my test would mean we could zip off to the beach and have weekends away. I couldn't wait.' Mrs Wood met her boyfriend Robert Wood just 11 months prior to her crash and he chose to stay by her despite the fact her parents told him he shouldn't feel obliged to stay and care for her because of her injuries . She was initially taken to Treliske Hospital in Truro, Cornwall, but was later transferred to the specialist burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Her hair had to be shaved off by doctors during her treatment . Mrs Wood was in a coma for several months and spent several more in hospital while she received specialist care for her burns and learnt to walk again. She said Robert stuck by her side and encouraged her throughout . However, her life changed when she was involved in the collision, which came during the final driving lesson before her test. She recalled: 'I wasn't nervous as I had plenty of lessons and was confident. The drive was going well and I loved being behind the wheel. 'I remember crunching metal and a flash of light. It was like a bomb exploding.' She doesn't remember anything after the impact of the collision and woke up in hospital several months later. She said: 'I was in agony. As soon as I opened my eyes pain ripped through my whole body. 'Everything was white when I opened my eyes. I felt like I'd been asleep for months. My mouth was so dry. 'Robert was there too – he told me it was mid-October and I had been asleep for more than a month. 'I had been covered in flames. Thankfully I couldn't remember this.’ She said the driving instructor who was with her on the day of the crash, Shirley, escaped unscathed, as did the driver of the other vehicle. She added: ‘I had third degree burns to 42 per cent of my body and had been put in an induced coma. Mrs Wood met Robert just 11 months before the crash (pictured together before the incident, left and after, right). He visited her regularly in hospital and helped her walk again. They have now married and live together . 'My face, arms and legs were covered in burns and I had undergone numerous operations while unconscious to remove the burnt skin. 'Surgeons had grafted skin from the backs of my thighs, the top of my arms and my bottom onto my burns. I couldn't take it in. 'All I really wanted to ask was “what do I look like?” but I was too scared. And the pained looked on everyone's faces said it all. 'I was a monster.' Mrs Wood said it was around this time that she realised how special her then-future husband was. 'He never gave up on me,' she said. 'I would make my family get me ready for his visits. I made them brush my teeth and wash me. 'One day I asked dad why he wasn't brushing my hair. It turned out the doctors had shaved it off. I was gutted. 'But Robert didn't seem scared by the swathes of bandages covering my face, shaved hair or burnt skin. 'He told me on our first anniversary, when I'd been unconscious, he'd sat with me. 'When I asked him what he did, he said: “I chatted to you”. 'He impressed my parents – they thought he was a keeper. 'I thought he was too – he didn't seemed fazed by my mangled face, my bloody arms or stumped fingers – which were amputated as a result of the burns. 'When I got down he would say: “It'll get better” He was a constant presence, my shining light.' Lindsay and Robert married in a small ceremony, in front of family, at St Petroc's Church in Bodmin (pictured) The pair (pictured toasting their future on their wedding day) have since moved in together in Cornwall . Mrs Wood said her father (together above) made an emotional speech at her wedding reception in March 2013 . After coming out of the coma, Mrs Wood faced the agonising prospect of learning to walk again. She said: 'I was incredibly weak and couldn't even lift my arms. 'I couldn't walk and hadn't even tried to get out of bed. Nurses had to wash me lying down and I couldn't even go to the loo or eat properly. 'I felt like a baby learning to walk again. I repeatedly said I couldn't do it. Every step with my walking frame felt like a mile. 'I would shout out but Robert was always there. 'Despite only being 21 and working full-time as a sales assistant, he would come to the hospital, hold my hand and walk with me. 'He was fantastic. When I got depressed he told me he loved me. 'I told him to leave me, but he said I was beautiful and brave and he wouldn't.' In December 2009, Mrs Wood was transferred from Swansea to Bodmin Hospital, nearer to her home in Cornwall, and her burns began to heal into scabs. 'Even though I thought I looked horrible Robert would still tell me he loved me,' she recalled. 'And he would add: “I fancy you too”. 'But it wasn't easy. I was in and out of hospital five days a week, having physiotherapy, stretching my muscles and learning to walk. It was exhausting. 'In November 2010 – more than a year after the crash – Robert was with me when I took my first step without a walking frame. 'From then, I walked everywhere I could. With Robert by my side. 'In August 2011 Robert and I were in St Austell in Cornwall when he led me to a jewellery shop and asked me to pick out a ring. 'He told me he was proud of me and a week later got down on one knee. 'As I looked at the pink sapphire glinting on my hand I didn't see scars I saw a beautiful gem.' The pair married at St Petroc's Church in Bodmin in March 2013 and have since moved in together. Mrs Wood, who now has a full-time job as a nursery nurse, has just been awarded £500,000 compensation for her injuries, paid for through insurance. She also recently passed her driving test. She said: 'When I think how far I've come I can't believe it. 'It's all thanks to my fantastic family and Robert.'","Lindsay Wood suffered life-changing burns after her car burst into flames .

"Previously unseen photographs revealing the extent of the neglect suffered by a baby orangutan before his rescue have been released as donations to pay for his care hit £50,000. Little Budi was caged in a chicken coop and fed only condensed milk for most of his short life but is now on the road to recovery thanks to a British animal welfare charity. New video footage and photographs taken at a rescue centre in Borneo reveal the staggering improvement in his health - from a 10-month-old ape too weak to move, to sitting up and eating from a spoon. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Budi the orangutan was found lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up . Tragic: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort . Transformation: The change in Budi in a few short weeks is remarkable. Here he is pictured exercising at the rescue centre in Borneo . Before Budi was rescued, his owner hadn't given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him. Her ignorance and neglect were killing him slowly and painfully, but she eventually told authorities she wished to hand him over. He was rescued in Indonesia by International Animal Rescue  and cried like a human baby during the journey to his new home in Borneo. His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent. But the future is now looking bright for Budi thanks to the people caring for him at the rescue centre and MailOnline readers who have helped raised £50,000 in a few short weeks. A new video shows him eating pureed food from a spoon, which vet Christine Nelson describes as 'remarkable'. 'When Budi first arrived he didn’t even have the muscle strength to open his own mouth,' she said. 'The vets would have to press the sides of his mouth gently so it would open wide enough for them to get the food into him.' Slurp! When Budi was found, he was too weak to open his mouth to eat, but he now eagerly licks pureed food from a spoon . Rest: After such an ordeal, Budi is making the most of having a comfortable pillow to get some well-deserved sleep . He is still not able to eat solid food because he hasn't learned how to chew, but can sit up on his own - quite a change from the ape found lying on his back on the floor of his wire cage unable to move. The plight of the orangutan in Indonesia has reached a critical stage, with the survival of the species under serious threat. Animals are suffering and dying because of the destruction of the rainforest - primarily for palm oil production. International Animal Rescue is working in West Kalimantan, Borneo to rescue and care for baby orangutans that have been taken from their mothers to be illegally sold as pets, and adults that have spent their entire lives in captivity, chained up or imprisoned in tiny cages. The team also goes to the aid of orangutans stranded when their forest home is destroyed and relocates these vulnerable animals to safe areas of protected forest. Alan Knight OBE, the Sussex-based charity's chief executive, said: 'Budi has won the hearts of people across the world and we’re overwhelmed and delighted by the generosity the public has shown in supporting his treatment and care. 'It’s an absolute joy to see the transformation in him and know that he is no longer in pain. 'It’s a great testimony to the skill and dedication of our team that Budi is progressing so well. And clearly he is a little fighter with a strong will to survive. 'Thanks to everyone who is helping to pay for his treatment and care, he has the best possible chance of a full recovery. 'We really hope people will continue to follow and support his journey back to full health. 'He still has a long road ahead of him and will be at our centre for several years to come, so we need all the help we can get with his rehabilitation in the hope that one day he will be fit to return to the forest and fend for himself.' The charity estimates it will cost about £5,000 a year to care for the little orangutan and he is likely to need six or seven years of rehabilitation before he can even be considered for release into the wild. If Budi doesn't regain the strength he will need to fend for himself in the forest, International Animal Rescue will have to cover the cost of caring for him in their sanctuary for the rest of his life. Severe malnutrition: Budi's little body was bloated with fluid and his limbs were swollen and bent when he was rescued from his cruel owner . Lis Key, from International Animal Rescue, said: 'When MailOnline reported the story of Budi the baby orangutan on January 22, it triggered a huge wave of response from the public and media across the world. Singer/songwriter Sia tweeted her support for Budi . 'Budi has appeared on websites, blogs and TV in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and America.' Fearne Cotton, Joss Stone and Ricky Gervais have tweeted their support for the orangutan. The latest celebrity to give her backing to the fundraising campaign is singer and songwriter Sia Furler, who currently has two songs in the Official UK Top 40 Singles Chart. Although Budi is on the road to recovery, his moving story is far from unique. Mr Knight explained: 'Including Budi, we now have 84 orangutans in our rescue centre in Borneo and every one of them has a story that would make you weep. 'We’re always in need of money to pay for their care and rehabilitation. International Animal Rescue, based in Uckfield, East Sussex saves animals, big and small, from suffering around the world. Work includes freeing and caring for dancing bears in India, rescuing primates from captivity in Indonesia, and sterilising and vaccinating stray dogs and cats in developing countries. Wherever possible, the charity returns rescued animals to their natural environment but it also provides a permanent home for those that can no longer survive in the wild. International Animal Rescue works to educate the public in the compassionate and humane treatment of all animals. Sound scientiﬁc evidence forms the basis of its decision-making and determines the course of its rescue operations. It also works with other like-minded organisations and government departments to strengthen legislation to protect animals from cruelty and neglect. 'We’re hoping that public interest and concern for Budi will make people want to find out more about our rescue and rehabilitation project as a whole and help us care for these tragic victims of relentless deforestation and the illegal trade in primates.' To donate £10 towards the cost of Budi's care, please text BUDI10 £10 to 70070. Recovery: Budi tries new foods but hasn't learned how to chew. He enjoys sucking the juice from slices of fruit .

"Small businesses have attacked Ed Miliband’s plan to double the length of automatic paternity leave . Small businesses have attacked Ed Miliband’s plan to double the length of automatic paternity leave, saying they would struggle to cope. Labour announced yesterday that it would increase paid leave for new fathers from two to four weeks, as well as putting up statutory paternity pay by more than £120, to £260 a week. But the Federation of Small Businesses said firms would have to shoulder the expense of getting staff in to cover for fathers – a burden many may be unable to afford. And the British Chambers of Commerce said the plan would amount to a ‘tax on business’. The criticism follows a week of woe for Mr Miliband, who has been attacked by captains of commerce from the head of Boots to the former boss of Marks and Spencer. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said of the latest pledge: ‘It’s important political parties understand the practical implications of policy changes. ‘Altering paternity leave so soon after introducing shared parental leave has the potential to cause confusion. We’d like to see shared parental leave have a chance to bed in before seeking to give dads extra time off. ‘For small businesses in particular, extending paternity leave from two to four weeks makes it much more likely that they will have to buy in replacement staff ... a cost some firms will struggle to afford.’ Christian May, of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘The very firms likely to be hit hardest by this new regulation will be the ones who are already best placed to manage parental leave without heavy-handed legislation. Small and medium-sized businesses often come to arrangements that suit both parties.’ He added: ‘Politicians need to realise that each new whim, each new policy announcement, has a major impact on somebody’s business somewhere down the line. New rules would simply mean more bureaucracy.’ Nick Clegg is also proposing the introduction of a month’s paternity leave after a child’s birth on a ‘use it or lose it’ basis . Yesterday, Labour’s welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves dismissed the criticism – saying ‘good’ businesses would welcome the move. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘This is exactly what people used to say about maternity leave, that it was a big burden on businesses. But the reality is, what good businesses know, is that it is really important to keep women in the workplace once they have children and not let them drift off because they can’t manage work and family life. That’s increasingly the case for dads.’ Labour welfare spokesman Rachel Reeves said 'good' businesses would welcome Miliband's plan . She added: ‘Good employers like Asda, National Grid and Citibank are already giving more than the statutory paternity leave. ‘What good businesses know is that unless they give that flexibility to mums and dads, they are likely to lose their best employees as they will go to a business that does value them, or they will sadly drop out of the workforce altogether.’ A new system of shared parental leave, championed by the Liberal Democrats, will come into force in April. Nick Clegg is also proposing the introduction of a month’s paternity leave after a child’s birth on a ‘use it or lose it’ basis. Labour said its proposal would cost £150million a year, paid for by savings in tax credits. It said these would be created by another party pledge, to extend free childcare for parents of three and four-year-olds so that such families would not rely on benefits to pay for care. But Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘Whilst well-intentioned, Labour fail to understand that companies, especially smaller businesses, can’t afford to shoulder the ever-growing financial burden which accompanies policies such as extended paternity pay. ‘Whilst those about to become fathers will be the winners of this policy, everyone else loses.’ Elizabeth Duff, of the National Childbirth Trust, welcomed the move, saying: ‘The more that dads are able to engage with their baby in the early days, the better their bond will be, so we want to see all political parties committing to policies like this.’","Businesses attack Ed Miliband's plan to double length of paternity leave .

"This is the moment a Los Angeles TV reporter shoved a pedestrian out of his camera shot in the middle of filming a live segment. Steve Kuzj, from KTLA News, was on the streets of Hollywood Wednesday night to report on the measles outbreak when a man with gray curly hair ran up from behind shouting incoherently. Kuzj, who is a second-degree black belt and has been practicing martial arts since age five, took no time to decide what to do next. Steve Kuzj, from KTLA, was reporting from the streets of Hollywood when he noticed a man running into his segment . Kuzj, who is a second-degree black belt and has been practicing martial arts since age five, swiftly pushed the man out of his camera shot . He quickly pushed the man out of the way and continued on with his news segment. Kuzj later explained his actions on Twitter, saying that he was trying to protect himself and viewers from the man attempting to run on screen. 'To be clear, that was a crazy man running at me, swearing, trying to get on TV. I was defending myself and viewers from hearing obscenities,' he wrote. Kuzj is one of many TV reporters to be videobombed during a live segment. In December a weatherman caught headlines after getting an unexpected surprise on live TV as an excitable American bulldog jumped up to greet him mid-forecast. He later said on Twitter that the man, who can only be heard in the video shouting incoherently, could have been yelling obscenities and he wanted to protect viewers and himself . After the incident, Kuzj regained his composure and carried on with his segment on measles for the Los Angeles news channel . Sky Sports recently announced they were pulling street reporters after a series of problems during their live transfer coverage in September of last year. This included one journalist trying to report the latest updates as a fan crept up behind him and shoved a sex toy in his ear. KTLA viewers applauded Kuzj's quick-thinking and professionalism on Twitter. Comedian Theo Von wrote: 'Ups to @SteveKuzj doing his job professionally and holding his ground at the same time.' 'Great save! Way to keep your composure. @SteveKuzj,' wrote @crowther439. Kuzj may be a TV news reporter, by day, but he also takes pride in his martial arts talent. In 2013 he uploaded a highlight reel of his skills to YouTube and now he has more than 27,000 views. Kuzj later wrote on Twitter the reasoning behind the push.

"He's the self-made millionaire who has succeeded at everything he's taken on - from court cases against foreign governments to mastering emerging technologies and playing the stock market. He was Australia's richest politician long before Clive Palmer arrived on the scene. Now, the ultimate prize may be in sight for Malcolm Turnbull. While Liberal MPs today defeated a spill motion that would have brought on a challenge to Prime Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the leadership crisis is almost certain to continue. And while it does, Mr Turnbull will stay the man most likely to take over as leader, and prime minister. Scroll down for video . MPs have reportedly confirmed that the current Communications Minister (pictured) will contend the leadership if a spill motion proves successful on Monday morning . On Monday, the Liberal Party will decide whether to dump Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) as leader while Malcolm Turnbull (left) is almost universally considered to be the only realistic challenger to Mr Abbott . Lawyer Mr Turnbull,  then chairman for the Australian Republican Movement, at a Republican rally back in 1999 . Liberal MPs voted 61 to 39 against a motion to bring on a vote on Mr Abbott's leadership, meaning a substantial bloc of the party wanted the opportunity to oust the prime minister. Observers interpreted the result as meaning Mr Abbott's leadership is still in dire trouble. While Mr Turnbull has remained publicly silent on the issue, MPs have reportedly said he was ready to challenge Mr Abbott for the leadership if it came to a vote. He is almost universally considered to be the only realistic challenger to Mr Abbott, who defeated him in a leadership ballot six years ago - by one vote. Mr Abbott went on to win the 2013 election and become prime minister. While mutinous Liberal MPs see Mr Abbott as having lost touch, a belief fuelled by the Australia Day Prince Phillip knighting incident, Mr Turnbull regularly scores well in opinion polls and is considered a colourful and cunning character with his head in the game. His love for technology and his constant online presence stands in contrast with the Prime Minister's recent comparison of Twitter to 'electronic graffiti' which he said was 'a big mistake to pay too much attention to'.

The then former Environment Minister pictured with a journalist at his house in Sydney in 2007 . Mr Turnbull is an avid user of the medium, and has 327,000 Twitter followers compared to the prime minister's 440,000. In one example of Mr Turnbull using social media to his advantage, as reports circulated that he was holding a secret meeting with potential leadership plotter Julie Bishop, he responded by tweeting a photograph of him smiling as he sat, alone, on a train miles from where the supposed meeting took place. '@BenFordham you need to improve yr [sic] surveillance! I am on the train to Tuggerah. PoliticsinPub Nth Wyong 2nite,' the caption read. The technology obsession stems from way back for Turnbull, who co-founded OzEmail - which at one point was one of the largest internet service providers in the country - back in 1994. It was an investment that reportedly made him $60 million when he finally sold it in 1999, Fairfax reported. But the former investment banker's fortune was evident long before the sale, when he purchased his first million dollar property in Sydney's exclusive suburb of Point Piper, also in 1994. A second purchase next door, for over $7 million just a few years later, allowed him to expand his exclusive section of the waterside even further, according to Fairfax. Mr Turnbull and his wife then sold that property in 2011 for $13.6 million. His current harbour-side Point Piper estate is close to the Altona mansion which sold for about $52 million, Fairfax recently reported. Despite his great wealth - he was valued at $186million on BRW's rich list in 2010, Fairfax reported - Mr Turnbull is keen to dispel the 'silvertail' tag and portray himself as a self-made man who rose to the top from next to nothing.

The former barrister as leader of opposition, with then deputy Julie Bishop (left), back in 2008 . In an interview with GQ, he said: 'I've taken the view that one's wealth is the result of hard work and good judgement, but a large part of it is luck.' On a number of public occasions, he has also recalled his turbulent childhood, in which his parents divorced and his mother took off with most of the family's belongings. 'I know what it's like to be very short of money. I know what it's like to live in rented flats, I know what it is like to grow up with a single parent,' he said back in 2008 when he was chosen to lead the Liberals, according to The Australian. Raised by his father and reliant on scholarships for his education at Sydney Grammar, and as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford - an honour he shares with Mr Abbott - there are now predictions that if he become prime minister, Mr Turnbull would revisit the Gonski education reforms. A father-of-two himself, Turnbull is well known as a family man, and a romantic one at that. He has been married to Lucy Hughes - the daughter of one of Australia's leading barristers and former conservative attorney general Tom Hughes - for more than 30 years.

The family man with (from left) his wife Lucy,  daughter Daisy, son Alex at the Australian premiere of the film 'Cold Mountain' at the Sydney State Theatre in 2003 . Mr Turnbull recalled how the pair met, in an Australian Women's Weekly article last year. 'She was 19 and I was 23. Our first encounter was not across a crowded room, or on a dance floor, but in the otherwise thoroughly unromantic environment of her father's legal chambers where she was working over the summer holidays,' he wrote. 'I was so in love and so worried I would lose her that I asked her to marry me soon after we met. She said we should wait until we grew up. Thankfully, we didn't (it is not entirely clear that men ever grow up, of course) and we were married two years later, in 1980. 'Over the years, we have grown together. It is almost impossible to imagine, let alone remember, what it was like not to be together, so much so that I have a much clearer sense of 'Lucy and me' than I do of 'me'.' Lucy Turnbull is no shrinking violet herself, becoming Sydney's first woman Lord Mayor in 2003. Mr Turnbull's views on climate change, his leadership of the campaign for Australia to  dump the British monarchy and become a republican at the 1999 referendum, and his liberal views on gay rights and other issues have stamped him as an iconoclastic conservative.

Mr Turnbull speaks to the Prime Ministers' chief of staff Peta Credlin during question time in the House of Representatives, Parliament House, Canberra . As an investment banker in the 1980s, Mr Turnbull's partners included former NSW Premier Neville Wran, a Labor stalwart, and former ALP Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's son Nicholas. Mr Turnbull has said he was approached by Labor to join that side of politics, and that he politely turned them down. It was as a lawyer that Mr Turnbull first came to public notice, as a brash and confident young barrister who took on the British Government in the 1986 Spycatcher trial. Fighting for former British Spy Peter Wright, whose book was accused of revealing top secret information, Turnbull's victory meant the book and its excerpts were allowed to be published. He later famously defended Kerry Packer against drug trafficking and tax evasion accusations. In some ways, Mr Turnbull's past is not unlike Mr Abbott's - both of them studied at the University of Sydney and Oxford and both of them went on to work as journalists. In policy however, they are worlds apart: Turnbull for one, once supported an emissions trading scheme, has clarified his stance as a firm believer of climate change and has voiced his support for gay marriage quite openly. When Mr Abbott won their first leadership contest in 2009, a devastated Mr Turnbull initially indicated he would quit politics, before changing his mind and accepting the role of opposition communications spokesman, and later minister. On Monday, Australia will watch if he is forced to bite back the promise he once uttered during an interview with GQ: 'I resolved, when I decided to stay in parliament, that I would do everything I could to give Tony a loyalty and a consistency that not all my colleagues gave me. 'I've done that. If Tony is unsuccessful — and I don't think he will be — no one will be able to say Malcolm Turnbull was anything other than supportive.'","Failure of today's spill motion unlikely to end Liberal leadership crisis .

"President Barack Obama presented a rose-colored version of congressional history to a liberal-leaning online audience on Monday, as he claimed that he was the most productive president since Jyndon Johnson until Republicans got in the way. Asked by the news website Vox if he had a prescription for the political polarization of Washington since his arrival in 2009, he blamed the GOP. 'You know,' he said, 'my first two years in office when I had a Democratic majority and Democratic House and Democratic Senate, we were as productive as any time since Lyndon Johnson.' 'And when the majority went away, stuff got blocked.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . NOSTALGIA: Obama pines for the good old days when his party ruled the roost in Washington, and says he was the most productive president since LBJ until the GOP got in the way . ACCOMPLISHMENTS: The Affordable Care Act was a 'big f*****g deal,' according to VP Joe Biden, but the ensuing controversy has left some Americans wishing Congress had passed fewer laws . The line about LBJ came from a December 2010 article in which The Washington Post said the outgoing Democrat-dominated federal legislature had 'passed more landmark legislation than any since the era of Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Great Society"".' Congress passed, and Obama signed, a whopping 383 new laws in 2009-2010, and voters responded by sweeping Republicans into power in the House with 63 new seats and shrinking Democrats' majority in the Senate. The tea party was alive and well, and the Obama presidency never again had an easy road on Capitol Hill. Major initiatives like Obama's $787 billion stimulus spending bill, the much-derided 'Cash for Clunkers' car buy-back scheme and a law that put all student loan borrowing under Washington, D.C.'s control felt like Democratic wins in 2010, but have since lost their luster. So has the Affordable Care Acre, Obama's signature achievement and the law that will define his legacy for good or for ill. Bits of the Dodd-Frank banking reform law have been chipped away since its birth in 2010. And Democrats took credit for ending the Iraq war and withdrawing 100,000 troops back to the safety of the United States in that same year. But with the benefit of hindsight, Obama's critics have hammered him for failing to leave a residual military force behind – a force that might have prevented the rapid and rapacious growth of the ISIS terror army in cities once secured by Americans' blood. 'Congress and the administration simply failed to listen to the American people,"" said Ohio Rep. John Boehner at the time. 'Time and time again they yelled ""stop,"" but the folks running Washington barreled ahead with a job-killing agenda our nation didn't want or need.' Laws passed during those two years would fill more than 4,050 pages of new federal code. Boehner became Speaker of the House two weeks later and hasn't relinquished his hold on power since. The count of new laws passed in Boehner's first two years as speakers – that is, Obama's third and fourth in office – ratcheted down to 286 as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid began throwing up roadblocks to the upstart GOP on the other side of the U.S. Capitol. Two years further down the road, in the Congress that concluded in December 2014, just 86 federal bills were signed into law. Obama suggested in his Vox interview, which was conducted last month, that Republicans have stymied his agenda and slowed down the march of progress. OBAMA WEPT TOO: House Speaker John Boehner got emotional in January 2011 as outgoing speaker Nancy Pelosi passed him his ceremonial gavel after a tea party wave that swept 63 new Republicans to power . THE FINAL INSULT: Kentucky GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell now runs the Senate, leaving Democrats without any moorings in Congress during President Barack Obama's final two years in office . Reid, however, bears much of the responsibility. In 2013 and 2014, a flood of House bills turned into a trickle in the Senate as he ran the upper chamber of Congress with an iron fist. By October 2014, Boehner's House had passed as many as 387 bills that would never see a Senate vote, most of them with votes from both Republicans and Democrats. Obama told Vox that eliminating 'the routine use of the filibuster in the Senate' would be a helpful development. That maneuver allows any single senator to object to a vote that would end debate on a subject and put a question to the floor for a final vote. Under such an objection, a supermajority of 60 is needed to proceed. Not since 1979 has either party held that many seats. The result is often gridlock and slow deliberation, followed by a flurry of intense legislating as the end of a two-years session approaches. 'There's nothing in the Constitution that requires it,' Obama said. 'The framers were pretty good about designing a House, a Senate, two years versus six-year terms, every state getting two senators. There were a whole bunch of things in there to assure that a majority didn't just run rampant.' 'The filibuster in this modern age probably just torques it too far in the direction of a majority party not being able to govern effectively and move forward its platform,' he insisted. Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, has taken a different approach from that of Reid, whom he displaced in January. 'DINGY HARRY': Sen. Harry Reid blocked hundreds of House bills in the last Congress and has been sidelined in the current session . Where Reid became Washington's chief individual obstructionist, McConnell has opened up the legislative process to Democrats' amendments on every bill. It's not out of the goodness of his heart, however: In 2016 Republicans will have a tough time retianing control of the Senate since so many of the contested seats will be GOP-held, and in states where a Democratic presidential nominee would expect to do well. By allowing his rank-and-file to vote in favor of liberals' amendments now and again – as long as they don't pass – he provides Republican senators with political cover that they'll need next year in order to keep their seats. McConnell, like Boehner, wants to see Congress remain in the red column and elect a Republican president to work with them. And then he – or she – could later claim to have been the most productive president since LBJ, at least until the pendulum swung back and 'stuff got blocked.'","President gave a wide-ranging interview last month to the website Vox, which held on to the transcript until Monday .
'My first two years in office ... we were as productive as any time since Lyndon Johnson,' Obama said .
Democrats ran both houses of Congress for Obama's first two years in office; the House fell to the GOP in 2010, and the Senate in 2014 .
As Republicans seized the reins in the House, Senate Democrats began blocking bills and the rate trickled to one-quarter what it had been .
Much of what Congress passed in 2009 and 2010 has become intensely controversial: Obamacare, the stimulus, 'Cars for Clunkers' and others ."
"Microwaves are great for heating food in a hurry, but what happens if you need to cool, or even, freeze food just as quick? That’s where the Freezer-Wave comes in.

Depending on how long the switch is pressed for, the food and drinks are either cooled down, or frozen completely (pictured) It was designed by Emma Maskery from Peterborough and was recently crowned the winning entry in this year’s Odd Invention Challenge. Ms Maskery won £5,001 and beat off competition from the Karaoke Shower, Handy Toilet Seat Lifter and Secret Shoe Shine. Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide that has a surface temperature of -78.5°C (-109.3°F). As it breaks down, it turns into carbon dioxide gas rather than a liquid and this can be used to keep food frozen, or at least cold, for long periods. The Freezer-Wave was fitted with two carbon dioxide canisters. These canisters were connected to actuators that were linked to the Freeze switch. Tubes from the canisters were then drilled into the back of the microwave. When the switch is flicked, the actuator activates the canisters and the carbon dioxide is blasted onto the food or drink. The annual competition is run by Oddka - a firm that specialises in flavoured spirits - and judges included inventor and YouTube star Colin Furze, TV presenter Emily Hartridge plus votes from the public. Mr Furze then built a prototype Freezer-Wave - also known as the Instant Freezing Microwave -to demonstrate its capability. He fitted a regular microwave with two carbon dioxide canisters. These canisters were connected to actuators that were linked to the Freeze switch. Tubes from the canisters were then drilled into the back of the microwave. When the switch is flicked, the actuator activates the canisters and the carbon dioxide is blasted onto the food or drink.

"Bruce Jenner has been spotted getting into a tiny Ford Fiesta just two days after he crashed his Cadillac Escalade in a four-car pileup that left a 69-year-old woman dead. The former Olympian took the $14,000 compact car out for a spin today after a weekend under the public glare for his driving. He was pictured this morning going on his usual Starbucks coffee run. Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation in the crash Saturday afternoon on the Pacific Coast Highway, CNN reports. If any of the drivers in the crash if found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison. On Monday, detectives said they are planning to ask Jenner to turn over his cell phone records to show whether he was texting while driving at the time of the crash - an activity that could net a vehicular manslaughter charge under California law, the Los Angeles Times reports. Trading down: Bruce Jenner swapped his $76,000 Cadillac Escalade and his $185,000 Porche for a $14,000 compact Ford Fiesta on Monday . Coffee run: It appears that Jenner is trying to keep a lower profile following the crash in Saturday, which left a 69-year-old woman dead and made headlines the world over . Jenner could also being trying to use the inconspicuous car in the hopes of going incognito as photographers follow him everywhere he goes . The 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' reality star has vehemently denied he was texting and driving and said he would gladly offer up his cell phone records to move it. Jenner allegedly smashed into the back of a Lexus driven by Kim Howe - forcing it into the oncoming lane, where she was hit head-on by a Hummer H3 and killed. At the time he was driving a $76,000 Escalade ESV, which was hauling a dune buggy. It was revealed on Monday the Mrs Howe, a widow who owned a house in the same gated Calabasas community where Kim Kardashian lives, did not have a valid driver's license. And has not had one since 2007, the Times reports. Jenner, who is in the midst of transitioning from a man to a woman, told police that he was taking a 'very low dosage of hormones that his doctor had prescribed,' a family source told Radar Online. The pictures were taken on Monday morning as Jenner hit Starbucks in Malibu for his morning coffee fix . Horrific: A sombre-looking Bruce Jenner surveys the crash scene on Saturday, including the mangled Lexus sedan that Kim Howe was driving when she was killed . Impact: Jenner's $76,000 Cadillac Escalade can be seen can be seen colliding with the white Lexus, which is thought to have been being driven by Ms Howe, a widow . The very next day, he was spotted out in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS - a 500hp supercar that costs about $185,000. Pictures from the outing published by the New York Post show Jenner speeding. He was driving at least 56mph in a 50mph zone, according to a digital speed limit sign on the road. It is unknown why Jenner opted to dramatically downgrade his set of wheels. One possibility is that he was hoping to go incognito in a low-profile car. The crash comes at a time when Jenner was already at the height of his post-Olympic fame as he prepares to publicly reveal that he is transgender and is becoming a woman. He reportedly claimed after the crash that it was the result of him being followed by aggressive paparazzi photographers. Investigators said that the paparazzi were not creating a danger and likely not a factor in the crash. It could be, too, that Jenner suspected that a less flashy care would attract less attention following two days in the spotlight for his habits on the road. On Sunday, Jenner released a statement that said: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident. 'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'","Jenner crashed his $76,000 Cadillac Escalade on Saturday and was spotted driving a $185,000 Porsche 911 GT3 RS the very next day .

"Survivors of the Costa Concordia disaster were stunned to see the ship's captain standing on the shore without even getting his feet wet, a court in Italy has heard. Captain Francesco Schettino is on trial in Grosseto accused of causing the shipwreck in January 2012, when he smashed into a reef near Giglio Island, with 32 people on board losing their lives. The case is in the process of being wrapped up with a verdict expected later this week, but Schettino's lawyers have denied that he acted like a 'reckless idiot'. Captain of the Costa Concordia Francesco Schettino sits in court in Grosseto today where he is on trial accused of causing a shipwreck in January 2012 . In closing arguments, the court heard that as survivors shivered as they staggered on to the shore of Giglio Island, they were startled to see Schettino already safe on land . The captain is charged with multiple manslaughter and injury and abandoning the luxury liner when many of the 4,200 passengers were still on board and desperately trying to save themselves. In closing arguments prosecutor Alessandro Leopizzi said that as survivors shivered as they staggered on to the shore of Giglio Island, they were startled to see Schettino already safe on land without even getting his feet wet. However, the cruise company Costa Crociere Spa has put the blame squarely on Schettino who was in court today for the final arguments, saying that he was suffering from a fever. The court also heard his lawyer Domenico Pepe repeatedly deny that Schettino abandoned his ship, saying he was thrown off as the vessel capsized. Mr Pepe also challenged prosecution contentions that Schettino should have immediately dropped anchor and ordered all to abandon ship. Had anchor been lowered, the lawyer claimed the Concordia would have quickly sunk - instead of eventually coming to rest, on its side, on a rocky seabed outside the port - and thousands would have perished. The court also heard Schettino's lawyer Domenico Pepe repeatedly deny that he abandoned his ship, saying he was thrown off as the vessel capsized. He is pictured on board the Costa Concordia in his captain's uniform . Mr Pepe added: 'Like a good sailor, he read the wind and went ahead. He was following the mariner's adage that the ship is the best lifeboat. Schettino's lawyer also told the court in his final arguments that perhaps one reason some of the lifeboats weren't lowered was because not all of them had been tested in an equipment check three months before the collision. Helicopters plucked many of the survivors to safety after there were no more functioning lifeboats. The court also heard from lawyers for survivors and for victims' families who insisted that senior executives of Costa Crociere be made to pay hefty damages for so much death and suffering. Cesare Bulgheroni, a lawyer representing a Greek couple who survived and the estate of a German who died, said: 'Something is missing in this trial of Schettino. 'It is incomplete because, in our view, other responsibilities, beyond his, emerged.' Mr Bulgheroni explained that an emergency diesel generator didn't work, elevators didn't shut down for safety reasons during the disaster, some crew didn't speak Italian, the ship's working language while others barely spoke English. Mr Bulgheroni and other lawyers for civil plaintiffs have banded together in a network called 'Justice for the Concordia.' The wreck of the Costa Concordia lying on its side after it smashed into a reef near Giglio Island, with 32 people on board losing their lives . They contend that Costa Crociere's board of directors should be equally responsible. Mr Bulgheroni added: 'We didn't have those people in the dock. There was only Schettino. 'People didn't die because the ship hit the rocks, they perished because they weren't helped in the emergency.' In 2013, a judge in Tuscany fined the company 1 million euros and Costa asked for a plea bargain deal to respond to administration sanctions, which, under Italian law, are given for companies whose employees commit crimes. Five Costa Crociere employees were allowed to enter plea bargains in exchange for lenient sentences. None of them is serving prison time. They include the helmsman and the company's land-based crisis coordinator, who, prosecutors said, downplayed the severity of the emergency. Prosecutors have asked the court to convict Schettino and sentence him to more than 26 years in prison. Judge Giovanni Puliatti indicated that the trial will last at least another day, with deliberations to follow.","Italian court is hearing closing arguments in trial of Francesco Schettino .

"A widowed Thai mother is facing deportation and could be forced to leave her children in the UK after her British husband was killed in a car crash. Om Gorry, 36, faces the prospect of leaving her children, James, 10, and Emily, four, and returning to her native Thailand because she has been unable to prove to officials that she is their primary carer. Mrs Gorry, whose British husband Alan was killed in a car crash two years ago, has been told her children are British citizens and so are entitled to remain in the UK. Om Gorry, 36, faces being deported to her native Thailand after her British husband Alan died. Mrs Gorry (pictured with the pair's children, James, 10, and Emily, four) is currently living in Hampshire with her children . Mrs Gorry, who was born in Thailand, moved to the UK to live with husband Alan (together above) in 2004. However, the pair moved back to Thailand when she found out her mother was ill and her husband later died . She said officials have suggested that they could be looked after by their paternal grandmother in Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire. However, Mrs Gorry is appealing the decision and family and friends have now launched a petition to keep her in the country while an online campaign in support of her case is growing support. Mrs Gorry married her husband in 2004 and the couple lived in Hampshire before temporarily moving back to the Far East in 2007 because her mother was ill. Between 2004 and 2007, Mrs Gorry applied for permanent residency in the UK, which she was granted. However, after moving to Thailand, and leaving the UK for more than two years, her right to a permanent residency was ended. After the death of both of her parents and Mr Gorry in the space of three years while living in Thailand, Mrs Gorry decided to return to England with her children so she would have the support of her late husband's family. She was granted a temporary European Economic Area Family Permit visa to enter and live in the UK and they moved in with Mr Gorry's mother Pat in April last year. Alan Gorry (above) died aged 36 in a car crash two years ago. Mrs Gorry moved back to the UK, to his mother's home in Hampshire, following his death . The children settled in at a local school and the family has since tried to move on from the tragedy of losing 36-year-old Mr Gorry. The European Economic Area Family Permit allowed Mrs Gorry to live in the UK as long as her two children, who both hold British citizenship, remained in the country. In addition to the permit, Mrs Gorry chose to apply for a derivative residence card, which proves the holder has the right to live in the UK as a primary carer and shows employers they are allowed to work here. She said she was desperate to be granted the derivative residence card because it would help her find employment in the UK. However, she recently got a letter from the Home office which said it had rejected her application and reviewed her case. Officials said she had not proved she was the primary carer of her children and suggested that her 69-year-old mother-in-law could care for James and Emily instead. In an apparent U-turn by the Home Office, her passport has now been confiscated and she has been told to make plans to return to her homeland immediately. She said: 'Everything was going really well, we had a new start and I was getting my life back together then suddenly this is hanging over me. 'When I got the letter from the Home Office I was so shocked and upset and I just couldn't get my head around it. 'They said I hadn't proved that I was James' mother but we sent his birth certificate and Alan's death certificate. I just don't know what more I can do to prove it to them. 'Who on earth is going to leave without their children? My little girl is only four, I'm not going to leave her. 'If I have to go I would have to take them back to Thailand with me, but that wouldn't be what's best for them. They've just started settling in and making friends at school. 'It will affect them if I have to leave. They've already lost their father and now the government wants to take their mother away from them too. 'The decision is ridiculous.' Extracts from Home Office letters to Mrs Gorry show that her Derivative Residence Card was refused (above) The letters also warn Mrs Gorry that she should 'make arrangements to leave' the UK and return to Thailand . Helen Thompson, a family member, has now launched a petition to send to Prime Minister David Cameron, which has already fetched more than 2,600 signatures. She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for the family and to suggest Pat can be the primary carer is ridiculous. They haven't asked her or done any checks on her finances or health. 'She works in London four days a week, she's going to be 70 this year and she has an enlarged aorta so she has to watch her blood pressure. 'There's no way Om would leave her children here, she'd have to take them with her back to Thailand, but then that's denying their rights as British citizens. 'The effect it would have on the children would just be devastating. It's just outrageous. ‘They love being over here with all the family, they just love it. ‘They are denying the children’s right to a family life. It’s just ludicrous. 'It shouldn't have to come to this and it has cost us so much money already. 'Om's amazing, she's a really strong person but we all have our moments where we get upset and worried. She just needs the structure and stability now to move on with her life.' Mrs Gorry (pictured with her 10-year-old son James and four-year-old daughter Emily) said she is appealing the Home Office decision. Friends and family have also set up an online petition against the deportation . Mrs Gorry is appealing the Home Office decision but doesn’t know when the case will be heard. She is appealing on the grounds that the decision fails to consider the best interests of her children and that it doesn’t take into account her right to a family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. She also claims the Home Office decision fails to take into consideration the compassionate and exceptional circumstances which she has found herself in, and the fact she has been the children’s primary carer since they were born. A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'This case is subject to an ongoing appeal and it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.'","Om Gorry, 36, has been told to prepare to return to her native Thailand .

"The University of Michigan has spent a whopping $16,000 on a campaign telling students to watch what they say to avoid hurting other students' feelings. On posters and pamphlets plastered across its campus in Ann Arbor, the public college advises its 43,000 students to avoid words including 'I want to die', 'crazy', 'gay' and 'ghetto'. The notices are part of the university's 'Inclusive Language Campaign', which hopes to 'improve the day-to-day language of students on campus by providing education around words that are offensive', student campaign representative Kidada Malloy told The College Fix. 'Offensive': The University of Michigan has launched a campaign to educate students on words that others could find offensive, such as 'tranny' and 'retarded'. Pictured: A pamphlet explaining some of the words . Concerning events held on campus last year indicated the need for such material, Amanda McLittle, coordinator of Diversity Education in University Housing, told the Michigan Daily. Theta Xi held a 'Hood Ratchet' party last year, sparking the hashtag '#BBUM', which stood for 'Being Black at Michigan', where African American students shared their experiences online. 'We don't talk enough about how our language and the words that we use, and how they impact others,' McLittle told the paper. 'Last year's events showed that this has always been needed.' 'YOUR WORDS MATTER' the posters read. They ask questions including: 'If you knew that I grew up in poverty, would you still call things 'ghetto' and 'ratchet'?' In the pamphlets, the group lists offensive words and explains why they might be hurtful. For example, they warn students against using 'I want to die' because the words 'carelessly diminish the experience of people who have attempted or committed suicide'. Campaign: Photos shared to the campaign's Facebook page show submissions from students . Hurtful: The campaign was launched after officials were notified of a 'Hood Ratchet' frat party last year . The phrase 'that's retarded' 'perpetuates able-ism by implying that individuals with mental, emotional, or physical disabilities are abnormal, defective, or inferior', another section reads. The university's 'Inclusive Language Campaign' warns students that the following words may offend others: . 'crazy' 'insane' 'that's so retarded' 'that's so gay' 'jewed' 'tranny' 'gypped' 'ratchet' 'illegal alien' 'fag' 'ghetto' 'raghead' 'I want to die' 'that test raped me' Students have been involved in the campaign since its beginning and staff members have helped them hold focus groups to figure out the direction of the work. 'This program is intended to be educational, not regulatory,' University spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said of the campaign. 'We hope there is only the understanding that we all participate in, and have the power to influence campus culture.' When asked if the campaign stifled free speech, he added that the opposite is true. 'We believe it will make discourse more constructive by respecting the views and perspectives of others,' he said. 'A campus conversation about the impact of words is good for everyone.' The campaign was launched last semester and included a series of kick-off events. The costly campaign comes at a time when the college has raised tuition and fees for the past two years, The College Fix reported. Controversial: Some students have expressed shock that the campaign cost the public university $16,000 .","Posters and pamphlets telling students 'your words matter' have been displayed around campus as part of its 'Inclusive Language Campaign'

"Former Grand Slam doubles champion Bob Hewitt pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and sexual assault of minors on Monday in a court in Johannesburg. Australian-born Hewitt, 75, is accused of raping a girl under the age of 16 in 1981, raping another girl under the age of 16 in 1982, and sexually assaulting a third girl under the age of 18 in 1994, all in South Africa. Hewitt said he emphatically denied raping his former students, in a statement read by his lawyer, Terry Price. He said his accusers had changed their statements a number of times during various television interviews in recent years. Former grand slam tennis doubles champion Bob Hewitt outside a Johannesburg court Monday . 'No matter what happens in this case I will never recover from these accusations,' his statement read, comparing his case to the recent allegations against comedian Bill Cosby. Wearing an olive jacket and pale yellow shirt, Hewitt was joined in the witness bench by his wife. Lawyers said the suspended hall of famer was partially deaf and needed assistance. He had brought a pillow along to support his back on the hard wooden benches. Hewitt won doubles and mixed doubles titles at all four Grand Slam events between 1963 and 1979 and played with greats like Billie Jean King. Recognised as one of the greatest doubles players of all time and a winner of 15 Grand slam doubles titles, Hewitt was indefinitely suspended from the International Tennis Hall of Fame in November 2012 because of the allegations. Hewitt, who is on trial for rape and sexual assault of minors in the country, has pleaded not guilty . The first state witness, Theresa 'Twiggy' Tolken, described to the court how Hewitt sexually assaulted her during their coaching sessions and later raped her at a resort in 1981. She was 12 and 13 at the time of the alleged assaults. The AP typically does not identify alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Tolken agreed to be named. Tolken read three letters she said Hewitt had written to her at the time of the assault. 'I want to see you. Can't of course hold or kiss you because that has to come from you,' Tolken read. She said that Hewitt had told her to destroy the letters. A children's right activists erects a poster showing former grand slam tennis doubles champion Bob Hewitt, outside a Johannesburg court Monday . Tolken, now 47, travelled from New Zealand to testify in the case. This is the second time Tolken has pursued a criminal case against the tennis star. In his statement, Hewitt said of Tolken: 'I treated her like my own daughter and became, in retrospect, too close to her.' Outside the courthouse, a group named 'Women and Men Against Child Abuse' hung black and red posters, calling for a life sentence for child rapists. The largest banner was made of a photograph of Hewitt receiving a trophy, surrounded by the words, 'Sport's hidden shame of child abuse. How many? How long?' Hewitt said he emphatically denied raping his former students, in a statement read by his lawyer, Terry Price .

"The Islamic State has released a new  propaganda video featuring John Cantlie in which the captured British journalist gives a guided tour of Aleppo. The largest city in Syria has been on the frontline of ongoing battles between ISIS, the Free Syrian Army, various rebel groups and fighters loyal to the Assad regime for the best part of four years and the ancient architecture that saw Aleppo named a World Heritage Site is seen largely destroyed. The expensively filmed and professionally edited footage is the 10th time Cantlie has appeared in a video released by ISIS and the third time he has been seen giving a tour of an ISIS-held territory, following previous videos inside the Iraqi city of Mosul and in the recently Syrian city of Kobane. The documentary-style 12 minute film sees Cantlie wander the streets of Aleppo interviewing fighters, including a French militant who calls for further attacks on targets in his home country, stating: 'Muslims in the West number in the millions and are capable of inflicting mass carnage'. Ominously Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - has claimed the video is 'the last in this series'. Slick: The documentary-style 12 minute film sees John Cantlie giving a guided tour of the city of Aleppo . Relaxed: The video shows Islamic State militants calmly fishing in the Euphrates River . ISIS fighters are seen laughing and drink tea in the terror group's latest video, which was filmed inside Aleppo . The latest Cantlie video is titled 'From Inside Halab' using an alternative name for the city of Aleppo. It follows similar documentary-style guided tours of Kobane and Mosul. The video begins with Cantlie visiting an agricultural district of Aleppo where he claims the economy is 'thriving' and grain silos are 'packed to the rafters' with food that is then sold without profit . As Cantlie speaks from what is likely to be a pre-prepared script given to him by ISIS militants, brightly coloured HD-quality footage of grazing sheep, bustling markets and shots of mosques. The journalist then visits a religious school in the city, where he is filmed extolling the virtues of ISIS' education system while young boys are seen reciting religious verses. These children, Cantle says, 'will with any luck form the mujahideen [jihadi fighters] for the next generation in this region'. After leaving the religious school, Cantlie is seen standing in a suburb of Aleppo named Al Bab, where he points out a  drone surveillance aircraft flying overhead. 'The mujahideen really don't care how many eyes in the sky are looking down on them,' Cantlie says before calmly adding: 'At some point that drone will betaking photographs, dropping bombs or firing missiles. Horror: John Cantlie wander the streets of Aleppo interviewing fighters, including a French militant who calls for further attacks on targets in his home country . Sick: The fighter, who is not named, urges more so-called 'lone wolf' terror attacks in the France and states that at the very least ISIS sympathisers should 'defend their religion' by striking non-believers in the face . Calm: The latest Cantlie video is titled 'From Inside Halab' using an alternative name for the city of Aleppo. It follows similar documentary-style guided tours of Kobane and Mosul . Seconds after the drone is seen in the sky, Cantlie is seen standing outside a badly damaged building he claims is a civilian market area. The journalist claims that he and his captors were five minutes away when Syrian regime aircraft bombed the area. He claims that although the bombs were fired by Syrian aircraft, the drone was American, suggesting the U.S. military is working closely with the Assad regime to identify targets. Cantlie and his crew are then told they have to leave the area due to the threat of further airstrikes. The film goes on to show footage of ISIS militants fishing, chatting and drinking tea on the banks of the Euphrates River, before Cantlie is seen giving a tour of a local Sharia law court. The journalist makes a impassioned speech of the qualities of Sharia law, calling it 'remarkably simple' and attempting to justify the harsh punishments as an effective deterrent. Terror: This ISIS militant claims the terror group will never be destroyed as God is on their side. The group, he states, is only getting stronger and more united as efforts to destroy the terror group are stepped up . Propaganda: Militants are seen being handed out propaganda from a so-called 'media point', which appears to be little more than a corrugated iron shack where information sheers packed with anti-Western material are stacked ready for distribution .

Sick: These children, Cantle says, 'will with any luck form the mujahideen [jihadi fighters] for the next generation in this region' John Cantlie has been held captive for more than two years by IS militants. In previous instalments, he has delivered his message under duress from behind a desk and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The last video of the photojournalist released last month and saw him give a guided tour of the city of Mosul. In previous films, Mr Cantlie says he accepted 'long ago' that his fate is 'overwhelmingly likely' to be the same as other captives - brutal execution at the hands of the militant known as Jihadi John. Earlier footage released by the group in October purported to show him in the embattled Syrian city of Kobane. Brave Kurdish fighters have since forced ISIS out of that city. Mr Cantlie's father Paul, 80, died from complications following pneumonia last year. His sister, Jessica Cantlie, has previously appealed for 'direct contact' with the militants holding him. Since August, ISIS has filmed and posted online the deaths of six Western hostages.

"The nearest I've come to handling an animal for dinner is stuffing a turkey for Christmas dinner. So when posed with the question - would I butcher an animal to eat? - by a vegetarian, I answered yes, I would be able to slice and chop a rack of meat, without a care in the world. And now I had to prove it. Brits eat an average of 84kg per person of meat annually - with chicken and and pork the most popular type that we consume. However, as more people are concerned with buying locally, and making sure animals are fed organically and reared humanely, there are more questions being asked how our food is sourced. Scroll down for video . The writer with the pig she will section into five parts; tenderloin, ribs, spare ribs, belly and a leg . We are so used to eating on the go and grabbing convenience food, that it seems a slice of ham or a chicken nugget is no longer associated with animals being killed for us to eat. As a carnivore, I'll happily eat bacon, ham, chops, pies and joints - and now I had to prove that I would be willing and able to carve it myself. I hadn’t given much thought to how it went from a living, breathing creature to ending up on my plate until I went to The Shed Restaurant in Notting Hill to learn how to butcher a pig with some help from part-owner and head chef Oliver Gladwin. Oliver butchers all the meat in the restaurant himself – a fact he is justifiably proud of. The 28-year-old trained at Leiths Cookery School and has worked in restaurants in London and as a head trainer at Devon’s River Cottage. His passion and enthusiasm are infectious – my worries at tackling the task quickly fade as he assures me that I will be fine. Head chef and part owner Oliver Gladwin (right) guides the writer as she slices through the carcass . Elbow grease: Sawing through the rib of the pig was the toughest part of the process . Oliver talks me through what we are going to do, explaining the process before he hands me two knives; one long blade which will slice through the meat in one swoop and another shorter knife to carve out the loin and smaller cuts. First we tackle the fat. Using the small knife, Oliver shows me how to pull away the lard. Nothing we cut today will be wasted – he is a firm proponent of nose-to-tail eating; the lard can be used as dripping or to make roast potatoes. Once the fat has been cleared, I have to pull out the tenderloin – a cut of meat that runs on the inside of the spinal column of the pig. Oliver shows me what to do and watches closely as I slice through the meat. The knife is sharp and does quick work of this, gliding through it like butter, before I dig in deep and pull the meat away from the bone with my fingers. The next step is to cut the flank off the ham (the leg of the pig). My aim is to get a long a belly as possible. I only use a knife to do this – not an axe or a saw as many butchers do - as Oliver does things the old-fashioned way, using traditional techniques he learnt from a butcher. Using the animal’s weight to my advantage, my newly acquired knife skills come to the fore as I hack my way through the bone and then slice around the skin and tendon but not all the way through as I have to separate the leg from the torso by breaking it in one clean move. Using my previous knife lines as a guide, I position myself at the back end of the pig while Oliver holds down the front. Lifting the trotter with my fingers, it’s astonishingly heavy as I push it towards him. In one, swift move I push and with a cracking sound, the leg comes apart cleanly. Snapping the leg off: After tracing an outline with her knife, the writer had to snap off the leg of the pig . Task accomplished (from left to right): spare ribs, belly, tenderloin, ribs and leg . Next up is to separate the torso of the pig. We count down five ribs and this time around I am more confident and slice through cleanly between the fifth and sixth rib. The final step is to separate the loin from the belly. Making two marks on either end of the pig and running the blade of my knife from point A, where I will start, to the end goal, point B, where I will finish. This is hard work and Oliver takes pity on me. An accomplished butcher, he wouldn’t use a saw but as it’s my first time, he offers me the alternative. It’s a tough job this, tougher than the rest of the tasks. The pig is heavy, unyielding and I grapple with its weight. The saw slips from my fingers a couple of times but I persevere, brushing aside Oliver’s help. I want to do this, I want to see it through. A primal feeling of joy courses through me as I successfully saw through the spare ribs. What I have in front of me now are five sections of the pig, which Oliver will use in his kitchen for the rest of the week. We’ve cut tenderloin, ribs, spare ribs, belly and a leg, the latter which will be hung and used as ham. Standing over my work, with a knife stuck into the pig, as if I've killed it, I feel a deep sense of respect for the animal. It’s a new found appreciation for what I have been thoughtlessly consuming on a daily basis. So in answer to the vegetarian's question - would I be able to butcher an animal for my dinner - my answer is yes. What would yours be? *Source: Defra 2013 Family Food report .","According to a Defra report, Brits eat 84kg of meat per person annually .

"Jamie Theakston has reduced the sale price of his £2million Tudor mansion after failing to attract buyers. Wings Place in Ditchling, East Sussex, is now being listed at £1.85million after sitting idly on the market for almost a year. The five-bedroom property lies in grounds once owned by Henry VIII who is thought to have given the estate to his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves following the annulment of their marriage. Wings Place in Ditchling, East Sussex, has been on the market for almost a year. The property is now being sold for £1.85million after failing to attract buyers . Mr Theakston has spoken in the past of how buying the property in 2004 was a 'boyhood dream'. But with most of his time spent in London, the 44-year-old radio DJ decided to put it up for sale in May last year. The house's sprawling grounds were the setting of Mr Theakston's wedding to jeweller Sophie Siegle in 2007. The couple, who have two children, also own a house in Chiswick, west London. Wings Place has four reception rooms, five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a cellar.The grade 1 listed house also has an impressive external staircase leading to what was once a public library. The property is Grade I listed and once belonged to Henry VII. Mr Theakston is selling it after spending too much time away, he said . After being listed for £2million, the house remains for sale at a lower price. It has four reception rooms and five bedrooms . Among its traditional features are original 16th Century fireplaces and wooden beans. Above, one of four reception rooms at Wings Place . It was one of several manor houses given to Anne of Cleves by Henry VII following the annulment of their marriage in 1540. Mr Theakston and his wife Sopgie Siegle also have a home in Chiswick, West London . In the 1950s it was listed as a Grade 1 heritage site, with its staircases, fireplaces and wall paintings in tact. Speaking when the house was first put up for sale, Mr Theakston said: 'The bottom line is that we just don’t have time to use it that much any more. 'You never really own this kind of house, you just look after it for the next generation.’ Wings Place is set in grounds formerly known as Ditchling  Manor Garden, first mentioned in texts dating back to the 11th Century. Following the dissolution of monasteries in 1537, it was gifted to Henry VIII who later gave it to his lieutenant. Three years later the king gave the house to Anne of Cleves following the annulment of their marriage. After her death it was reverted to the Crown and later occupied by Lord Abergavenny who gave it Henry Poole as part of a dowry for the hand of his daughter in the 1570s. Later, part of the house was converted into a public library by James Browne, whose father took ownership of it in 1688. The library was accessed by an external stair case which is still in tact. In the mid 1800s, several families were listed as living at Wings Place. It was sold at auction in 1935 and has remained in private ownership since. The house's grounds were the setting for Mr Theakston's wedding reception in 2007. He and jeweller Sophie Siegle married in the nearby village church . The house is being sold by estate agents Savills. Previously Mr Theakston said it had been a 'boyhood dream' to live in it .","Wings Place in Ditchling, East Sussex, is being sold for £1.85million .

"The future is looking bright for British actor Jack O'Connell, who last night won the Rising Star Award at the EE British Academy Film Awards. But 24-year-old actor admits his life could have turned out quite differently after he attended a 'rough' school in Derbyshire and then had a number of brushes with the law. He won the Bafta thanks to acclaimed roles playing a violent teenager imprisoned in Starred Up and a prisoner of war in Angelina's Jolie's Unbroken. Scroll down for video . Jack O'Connell last night won the Rising Star Award at the EE British Academy Film Awards . But while Jack has found success in Hollywood by playing characters who are behind bars, he has also come close to being locked up himself. 'I haven't done time, but only by the skin of my teeth,' he once admitted. Now keen to put his misdemeanors behind him, he's reluctant to speak about his crimes in interviews but has confirmed he once faced a custodial sentence. Speaking to Megan Conner for the Guardian last year, he said: 'Some of the roles, like Eric in Starred Up (Eric is a violent youth offender who is taken to an adult prison in the film), haven't been much of a stretch, really. 'It's just quite hard for me to be open about it. Partly because the stuff I got involved in as a kid was quite serious, and partly because I've now got my American visa. The actor, pictured in the film Starred Up in 2013, said playing Eric, a troubled teen who ends up in prison, wasn't 'much of a stretch' as he once faced a custodial sentence himself . The actor dated Tulisa in 2012 but they split up due to 'incompatible work schedules' 'When I was younger, I got into a lot of trouble and was made to feel guilty for a long time. I was in and out of court, and then I had a young offender's referral order for a year. And that was at the time when I was trying to be an actor at the Royal Court. 'I was in real court the day I was starting a play called Scarborough at the Royal Court in London – waiting to find out if I was getting a custodial sentence.' But fortunately for Jack, he wasn't locked up for the 'serious' crime and eventually went on to establish himself as a leading man in Hollywood. He admits the glittery awards parties and dinners with Angelina Jolie are a far cry from his working class upbringing in Alvaston, Derby, where he once had dreams of being a footballer or joining the army. His mother, Alison, was an employee for British Midland while his late Irish father Patrick worked on the railways for Bombardier. The close-knit family help keep Jack's feet on the ground as his career soars, with his mother now working as his manager and his sister, Megan joining him on the red carpet on numerous occasions. Angelina Jolie, pictured with Jack at the UK premiere of Unbroken, said he 'has something unique to him' Jack plays Louis Zamperini in Unbroken, pictured, an athlete who survived a Japanese POW camp . They both joined him at the Baftas where Jack said they would make sure he stayed on best behaviour while the champagne flowed. He joked yesterday: 'I've got my mum and sister down here with me strategically so I'll be well-leashed tonight.' Jack attended a catholic secondary school in Derbyshire, which he described as 'rough as f***', and he left with just two GCSEs in English and drama. Summing up his education in an interview with the Telegraph, he said: 'What I learnt aside from [anything] academic at school was probably very valuable lessons in terms of how to lie, how to play the game, how to play authority against itself.' He attended a TV workshop in Nottingham which he thanked in his Bafta acceptance speech as it was there that he made it his mission to pursue a career in acting. As he tried to make his name as an actor, he juggled his auditions around doing menial work on a farm to earn money. After a few minor roles in shows like The Bill, he then got lucky being cast as a National Front supporter in This Is England and then a troubled drug dealer in E4's Skins. He has since admitted that his background gave him an edge over the other stage school actors trying out for the roles. Big parts in '71 and Starred Up followed, but his big break into Hollywood came when Angelina cast him as Louis Zamperini in Unbroken. Jack admits she had to do 'background checks' on him thanks to his criminal past, which made obtaining an American visa difficult. But Angelina was adamant Jack was the actor she wanted and has championed him ever since, even visiting Derbyshire to meet his family. Jack with two of his Skins co-stars, Lily Loveless and Kathryn Prescott, in 2010 . Jack once dated co-star Kaya Scodelario (both pictured in a promotional poster for Skins) The Derby-born actor, far right, in one of his first roles as a National Front supporter in This Is England . Speaking to Vulture about why she cast him, she said: 'I'd seen so many young men for this movie, and it became very clear to me at a certain point that there are so many great actors out there, but there were still things I continued to look for and didn't find. 'I had to find a man who was a real man's man, who had that physicality, who was an everyman but also disciplined and willing to go to all these places emotionally. It was hard finding that really capable young actor where you really believed he could survive all that time on a raft or could take 220 punches [as Louis does in a POW camp]. 'There are not a lot of young men in their 20s like that. Jack has something very unique to him. I challenge you to find another young man full of more fire.' Jack didn't let Jolie down, taking to the part with gusto, even losing a stone in weight to portray the survivor of a Japanese POW camp in World War Two. He's won rave reviews for the role and has since gone on to be cast in Tulip Fever alongside Dame Judi Dench and Money Monster with George Clooney, directed by Jodie Foster. Jack, pictured left at yesterday's Baftas, is rumoured to be dating model Cara Delevingne, right, and the pair are set to star together in the film Tulip Fever . Tulip Fever also stars model of the moment Cara Delevingne, sparking rumours that she and Jack were dating. In his interview with the Guardian last December he didn't confirm or deny the rumours but went as far to say, 'Yeah, I am a boyfriend to someone.' When pressed if he was boyfriend to Cara, he said: 'Er, I'm not able to make comment at this stage. Because I've got trust issues. You'll say something I didn't say.' If he is dating Cara, it wouldn't be the first time he's had a relationship with a co-star. During his time on Skins he dated actress Kaya Scodelario for a year - another rising star to graduate to the big time after recently being cast in the new Pirates of the Caribbean film. She once described him as the love of her life and was heartbroken when they split up. Another famous ex of Jack's is the pop star Tulisa Contostavlos. He dated the former X Factor judge for a few months in 2012 but they called time on their relationship due to 'incompatible work schedules.' Even after their break-up, the singer sang his praises. She told Cosmopolitan magazine: (He)was one of the most genuine guys I’ve ever met. 'He’s never spoken about us publicly. He restored my faith that there are still good guys out there.' The young actor's schedule certainly looks set to remain busy for the near future as he has come a long way from being a troubled Derbyshire teen.","Jack O'Connell, 24, won Rising Star Award at yesterday's Baftas .

"SpaceX called off Sunday's planned launch of a deep-space observatory — and a revolutionary rocket-landing attempt - after a critical radar-tracking system failed. Former Vice President Al Gore, who first envisioned the observatory two decades ago, was on hand for the attempt. The SpaceX company halted the countdown at the 2½-minute mark following the loss of the Air Force radar system for tracking the rocket in flight. Chief executive officer Elon Musk said via Twitter that the company would try again Monday and that the delay probably was for the best. Scroll down for video... Not ready for launch: Falcon 9 went vertical early on Sunday morning in advance of the launch of the DSCOVR satellite. Liftoff has now been postponed until Monday . Florida, we have a problem: Elon Musk's SpaceX was forced to scrub a planned launch Sunday evening in which it was to attempt to land the first stage of a rocket onto a platform floating in the Atlantic Ocean . 'Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter,' the company's billionaire founder wrote, adding that it was not needed for launch, 'but nice to have.' Besides launching its first deep space mission — an observatory that will shoot to a spot 1 million miles from Earth to monitor solar outbursts — SpaceX will attempt its second landing of a leftover booster on an ocean platform. It's part of the company's plan to eventually reuse rockets. The Deep Space Climate Observatory is refashioned from the Earth-observing satellite conceived in the late 1990s by Gore when he was vice president. It was canceled before ever flying and packed away until several years ago, when NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Air Force decided to resurrect it as a space weather sentinel. Gore arrived at Cape Canaveral well in advance of the sunset liftoff, eager to see his brainchild finally soar. Try, try , try again: The launch was the company's second attempt to land a rocket booster -- an event that, if successful, could be a significant step toward making space travel far more affordable . Boom! Musk described the event in January when the rocket crashed on landing as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. SpaceX has been developing technology to land the largest stage of its  rocket back on Earth . He told reporters an hour before the planned launch time that he was grateful to the scientists and others who kept his dream alive. The measurements will help measure global warming, he noted, and the steady stream of pictures of Earth may help mobilize the public to put pressure on the world's government leaders 'to take action to save the future of human civilization.' 'The constant ability to see the Earth whole, fully sunlit, every single day ... can add to our way of thinking about our relationship to the Earth,' said Gore. He was accompanied by Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who flew on the space shuttle as a congressman in 1986. Rinse and repeat: SpaceX successfully launched a supply rocket to the International Space Station in January, the sixth mission by the aerospace contractor to the station since 2012. The landing wasn't as smooth . X marks the spot: A barge floating off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, was supposed to recover the leftover booster, but components came down too hard and broke apart, according to SpaceX founder Elon Musk . The $340 million mission is meant to provide a heads-up on intense solar activity that can disrupt communications, power and air travel. That's why the spacecraft is to be stationed 1 million miles from Earth and 92 million miles from the sun, the so-called Lagrange point where the gravity fields are neutralized. NOAA's director of the Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, Tom Berger, likened it to a 'tsunami buoy.' The observatory originally was called Triana, after the sailor who first spotted land on Christopher Columbus' historic voyage. Now it's dubbed DSCOVR, short for Deep Space Climate Observatory. Gore's presence added to the excitement at the launch site. Also contributing to the buzz, though, was the experimental landing planned by SpaceX. Musk wants to eventually reuse his rockets to cut down costs and speed up flights. It will be the second such landing test for SpaceX. Last month's effort ended in flames. SpaceX loaded more hydraulic fluid into the first-stage booster this time for the guidance fins; the fluid ran out too soon on Jan. 10, and the booster landed hard and tumbled over. But the path of the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket this time will see the booster descending faster than before, making it harder to nail the vertical landing. SpaceX officials repeatedly stressed that the landing test is a secondary objective, and that the main job is to make sure the observatory gets a good ride to space. Blasting off: Onlookers and photographers watched the trajectory of the Falcon 9 rocket, which lit up the sky over Cape Canaveral, Florida in January . 'Launching our 1st deep space mission today,' Musk wrote via Twitter. He noted that the observatory will end up '4X further than moon.' 'Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission,' he added. 'Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.' The modified barge that will serve as the landing zone nearly 400 miles off the Florida coast is almost as big as a football field, but that's small against the backdrop of the Atlantic. The 14-story booster will descend from an altitude of about 80 miles, with touchdown expected nine to 10 minutes after liftoff. Last month's effort resulted in minor damage to the platform. SpaceX not only patched everything up, but added a name to the platform, painted in large white letters on deck: 'Just Read the Instructions.' That's the name of a ship from the Culture science fiction series written by the late Scottish author Iain M. Banks. Musk, a Banks fan, already has his company delivering cargo to the International Space Station for NASA and working on a capsule to fly American astronauts there.","The launch was the company's second attempt to land a rocket booster .

"Travelling has never been easier or more popular. And like moths to a flame, scammers are drawn to people who are on holiday or 'just passing through' with money to burn, no local knowledge and all their valuables tucked neatly nearby. Every year foreign visitors are tricked out of small change or, worse, find themselves in dangerous situations or the victims of crime. While this is by no means a warning against travel, being prepared and on guard can go a long way to  evading confidence tricksters, wily locals and credit card bandits. Scroll down for video . Scammers are drawn to holiday goers and travellers but if you know what to look out for you can avoid cons . Together with Peter John, author of Around the World in 80 Scams: An Essential Travel Guide, we run down some of the most well-worn ruses, and how to dodge them. 1. If an offer looks too good to be true, it probably is. This applies anywhere, from advertisements in newspapers or online to offers from touts in bus stations. 2. Do not accept food or drink from strangers who you've just met in hotels or on buses or trains. 3. Before  travelling, research whether the destination is notorious for any particular scams. Embassy websites and online travel forums are particular good sources. 4. Watch  taxi drivers like a hawk. Many are honest, but many will cheat given the slightest chance . 5. Find out the exchange rate before you arrive and familiarise yourself with notes and coins as soon as possible. 6. Keep as many of your possessions as possible in sight at all times. 7. Don't  assume  policemen or customs officials are honest, especially in poorer countries. 8. Carry a backup ATM or credit card  in case you lose your main card. 9. Try not to arrive in foreign cities after dark. Thieves love darkness. 10. Don't buy expensive goods overseas unless you know exactly what you're doing. 1.) Fake wake up call . Cheapflights.co.uk commissioned research into the most popular travel scams and found that hotel guests are often duped by fake wake up calls. Late at night the phone rings with someone claiming to be from the front desk. They explain that the internal computer system has crashed and that they need your credit card information again. In fact, they are a prisoner speaking to you on a smuggled mobile phone. In your sleep addled state you give them everything they need to empty your bank account. This scam was especially common in Georgia, in the US. Avoid it by: Refusing to give any information and putting down the phone. Tell hotel staff and the police immediately. 2.) Airline ticket refund ruse . Beware cheap tickets and refundable schemes. 'Scammers advertise refundable airline tickets free on sites like gumtree.com,' says Peter John. 'They sell them for cash (to you) and then get the money they paid for the tickets refunded to their credit cards.' You wind up with no ticket and an airfare down; the scammer has your money as well as the cash they originally paid for the ticket refunded. Avoid it by: Buying tickets direct from airlines or first-hand through trusted websites. 3.) Phony takeaway menu . No matter how hungry you are or late it is watch out for fake menus. After you've settled into your hotel room  a takeaway menu might be surreptitiously slipped under your door. If you order from it there's a strong chance you won't see any food but the person on the other end of the phone now has your card details and will be making a  large withdrawal. Avoid it by: Eating in local restaurants or ordering room service. Tricksters put fake take away menus under hotel doors to collect your money without delivering food . Fake wake up calls are made by scammers from prisons to hotel rooms in a bid to extract your bank details . 4.) Gemstone scam . A simple but  effective trick: a scammer sells a tourist some gems cheaply, telling them they can make a fortune by selling them back at home or making them into a pair of earrings or a bracelet. The gems turn out to be worthless paste. 'This is especially common in south east Asia and India,' says Peter John. 'Several Malaysians complain each year about gem scams in Thailand. In 2009, a Malaysian man and his family were taken to a Thai gem shop where the manager claimed that it was the last day of a sale. Con artists sell gems cheaply so you can make a fortune reselling them, if they didn't turn out to be worthless . 'The manager said that normally the shop would not sell to tourists as it was a wholesale business. The business had an 'ISO 9001' banner outside, which convinced the victims to buy gems. 'They bought two pendants, a ring and a pair of ear-rings for 130,000 Baht ($4,000/£2,500). When they returned to Malaysia and had the gems inspected, they found out that the gems were fakes. They had been treated with beryllium to change their colour, and were practically worthless.' Avoid it by: Do your homework and don't buy unusually cheap gems. 5.) Airport security cut up . As you approach security someone lingers nearby with keys in their pocket. They cut in front of you and set the alarm off, pretending that they 'forgot' to empty their pockets. While this kafuffle plays out, you are held up and an accomplice on the other side quickly steals your laptop, phone, wallet and other valuables from the conveyor belt. If someone cuts in front of you at security watch out someone else isn't taking your belongings in the hold up . The Kenyan police posted warnings about this scam on their website and the US Federal Aviation Administration also mentions it. Avoid it by: Keeping your belongings with you until just before you walk through  security  and keep an eye on them after they are processed by the machine. 6.) Distraction muggings . Muggers aim to distract you while they rob you. For example, a woman with what looks like a baby – it very often is just a doll or bundle of clothes – walks up to you and makes pleas for money for her baby. She might throw it at you too and insist you hold him/her/it for a moment. Distraction methods such as spraying mustard or tomato juice onto someone are used before pick pocketing . By the time you've got rid of her you'll notice your pockets have been pilfered by her accomplice. Peter John says, 'People can be distracted in any number of ways – from spraying mustard or tomato sauce onto the victim's cloths to asking for directions.' Avoid it by: Walking away and not being distracted. 7.) The slow count . This is a common European occurrence, but can happen anywhere. Once you've paid for a ticket/souvenir/some street food the cashier will begin a painfully slow process of counting out your change. You impatiently grab the change, happy to be on your way, while they've counted out far less than you were owed. Avoid it by: Waiting it out. Some cashiers will count your change painfully slowly until you grow impatient and leave without enough . 8.) Injured beggars . 'Gangs of panhandlers prey on travellers' generosity,' warns Peter John. 'Beggars fake injuries to get greater donations; this is especially common in India, South America and south east Asia.' Sometimes the injuries are real and the stories behind them especially sobering. In 2008, Pakistani police arrested a begging gang. An eight-year-old boy told them that one of the gang masters had broken his arm. He and his fellow beggars would be placed at good begging locations and made to beg. The money was collected by the gang masters who kept the children alive and begging in return. Avoid it by: Giving the child food rather than money. Beggars' injuries are often genuine and the stories behind them sobering. Give children food instead . 9.) Corrupt policemen . 'Policemen pretend that tourists have broken the law and demand thinly-disguised bribes,' says Peter. 'Unfortunately, this can happen anywhere with badly paid and corrupt cops.' It happened to him in northern Mexico. On the way to the American border a policemen stopped them and engaged in conversation. Watch out for corrupt policiemen that may claim you've broken the law and demand thinly-disguised bribes . He spotted a pocket penknife and demanded what he called a 'quick fine' of $30 (£19). The fine was negotiated to $10 (£6.50) and the penknife was confiscated. There are thousands of stories like this but unfortunately there's little you can do to prevent it, save stay at home. Avoid it by: Being amenable, keeping your temper and try to talk your way out or around the situation. 10.) Rosemary seller . Beware the lovely  woman  offering you a sprig of rosemary, which is said to be a sign of friendship. Next thing you know she will be holding your hand and reading your fortune. Beware the lovely woman offering you a sprig of rosemary, which is said to be a sign of friendship . Once you accept the rosemary or allow her to begin the fortune telling spiel she'll demand money in return; more and more loudly, until you are embarrassed into paying and fleeing. Watch out in Madrid and New Delhi for this. Avoid it by: Walking swiftly in the opposite direction.","Peter John, author of Around the World in 80 Scams, explains top cons .

"A task force which includes the combined resources of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), Australian Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection, State and Territory police has seized crystal meth with a street value of close to $1 billion in less than two years - and yet it's barely put a dent in the 'ice pandemic' At least 25 organised crime gangs have been broken up, three major commercial drug laboratories shut down and members of a Mexican cartel were recently arrested. But new figures revealed by the ACC to Daily Mail Australia show that in the past few months, the production, importation and use of 'ice' has gone to another level. Scroll down for video . The Eligo National Task Force and its various agencies has captured more than $350 million worth of 'ice' in less than three months across Australia . The ACC and AFP were part of the operation in which authorities recently seized 135 kilograms of crystal methylamphetamine andseized and arrested four men in Victoria . Australian Crime Commission Acting Chief Executive Officer, Paul Jevtovic admitted that the syndicates work are working high level of sophistication and 'provides a disturbing picture of the transnational nature of organised crime'. And the criminal involvement is not restricted to local manufacturers and distributors. 'The fact that Australian illicit drug users pay a premium price for most illicit drugs compared to prices in key foreign markets, makes Australia an attractive market for manufacture and importation of methylamphetamine,' Mr Jevtovic said. To illustrate how bad the problem has become, the ACC produced figures comparing the first year of the national task force against the latest available for the first quarter of this financial year. The disturbing increase of 'ice' production and use in Australia. The Crime Commission reports that the national task force focusing on illicit drugs and money laundering has found crystal meth is now at 'pandemic' proportions . From the year January 2013 to the following January in 2014, more than 530 kilograms, worth more than half a billion dollars was intercepted by the Eligo National Task Force (ENTF). But in the past two months alone, the same union of Australian agencies has closed the net on several syndicates attempting to get up to 350 kilograms of the illicit substance on the streets. Across the last week of July, a joint operation across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania resulted in the seizure of more than 220 kilograms of illicit drugs, the majority of that haul was 'ice'. It means law enforcement agencies are getting results but they're having to come up with different strategies. And while authorities would not be drawn, there are suggestions that officers are being more regularly embedded as operatives within gangs. 'With its relative accessibility, affordability and destructive side-effects, crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of crack cocaine in the United States' says Paul Jevtovic . The ACC's list of side-effects of 'ice' include; psychosis, paranoia, anxiety, depression, decreased memory, violent streaks, risk of heart failure and stroke . A task force which includes the combined resources of the Australian Crime Commission, Federal Police, Customs and Border Protection, State and Territory police has seized crystal meth with a street value of close to $1 billion in less than two years . Mr Jevtovic said only that 'non-traditional law enforcement measures aimed at disrupting and deterring organised crime groups have been used'. 'We've been better able to unearth an elaborate network.' The main detections at the Australian border have originated from India, China and Hong Kong in numbers but Mexico and Canada by weight. Iranian produced meth have begun making its way in and increasing numbers are being tracked from West African crime groups. In a submission to Victorian Parliament the ACC stated that 'organised crime groups which may have traditionally focused on importing particular illicit drugs, for example heroin or cocaine, have commenced importing multiple illicit commodities, particularly methylamphetamine'. The ACC boss labelled this 'an emerging pandemic'. 'With its relative accessibility, affordability and destructive side-effects, crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of crack cocaine in the United State.' More than 100,000 people were arrested on drug-related charges in Australia in the year 2012-13 . Mr Jevtovic also warned that international crime syndicates are now competing with traditional producers (in some cases they have joined forces) for a piece of the local 'ice' market. 'No one criminal syndicate, crime group or ethnicity-based group is dominant in the methylamphetamine market,' he said. 'The methylamphetamine market is sufficiently diverse and profitable to support a large number of competing and sometimes collaborating suppliers, at different levels of sophistication. 'There is also evidence that some crime groups that previously specialised in other drug markets are now focusing their activities on the methylamphetamine market.' The ACC say 'there is also evidence that some crime groups that previously specialised in other drug markets are now focusing their activities on the methylamphetamine market' Tougher still for authorities, because of the lucrative nature of the 'ice' trade, criminals are now joining forces 'at different stages of the methylamphetamine supply chain, or to collaborate on an importation or local supply'. Crystal meth comes in four forms normally being tablet, crystal, base (or paste) and powder. 'The increase in imports (of the drug) does not appear to have coincided with a decrease in local production.' According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, methylamphetamine accounts for more than 70 per cent of global amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) seizures. The ACC warning that 'border detections and domestic seizures are at record levels. The Australian market remains robust and is likely expanding'.","The first quarter of this financial year has produced record numbers of seizures and arrests across Australia .
The Eligo National Task Force has captured more than $350 million worth of 'ice' in less than three months .
One of the largest single seizures was 135 kilograms of methylamphetamine in Melbourne occurred in late July .
More than 100 kilograms of drugs was found in a shipment of fish in Sydney .

"Drew Peterson has been charged with trying to hire someone to kill the prosecutor who led the 2012 trial that resulted in the former police officer being convicted of killing his third wife. State and local prosecutors said on Monday that Peterson is charged with solicitation of murder for hire and solicitation for murder after allegedly trying to hire someone to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow while Peterson was in prison. The charges relate to the time period September 2013 to December 2014 and a preliminary hearing is set for March 3. The 61-year-old is serving a 38-year prison sentence at the Menard Correctional Center in Menard, Illinois, after being convicted in the 2004 drowning death of Kathleen Savio. Scroll down for video . Drew Peterson has been charged with trying to hire someone to kill the prosecutor who led the 2012 trial that resulted in the former police officer being convicted of killing his third wife . An investigation into Savio's death was reopened after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared in 2007. Authorities have said they believe Stacy Peterson is dead and that Drew Peterson is a suspect, but he hasn't been charged in that case. The former cop is being held by the Illinois Department of Corrections where he awaits the appeals court's decision on offering him a new trial over the murder of Savio. The first arguments from his defense lawyers in the appeal are to be held in April at the earliest, according to Radar Online. Peterson was found guilty in 2012 for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, eight years before. On March 1, 2004, Ms Savio was discovered by a neighbor face down in her dry bathtub, her thick, black hair soaked in blood and a two-inch gash in the back of her head. Peterson is charged with solicitation of murder for hire and solicitation for murder after allegedly trying to hire someone to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, above, while Peterson was in prison . The  death of the 40-year-old aspiring nurse was initially deemed an accident. After Peterson's fourth wife, 23-year-old Stacy Peterson, vanished in 2007, Savio's body was exhumed, re-examined and her death reclassified as a homicide. Peterson had divorced Savio a year before her death. His motive for killing her, prosecutors said, was fear that a pending settlement would wipe him out financially . He is currently serving 38 years for her murder and is not due to be released until May 2050 when he will be well into his nineties. Questions remain about Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, who has been missing since 2007 and whose body has never been found. Peterson revealed in 2013 that he lived in fear of being killed behind bars. According to a letter to his lawyer at the time, he was not adapting well to his new home. Peterson, a former cop, is serving 38 years for the murder of his third wife, Kathleen Savio (pictured) in 2004 . 'I’m in a cell the size of a broom closet, peeling paint, rusting fixtures, I have no TV or anything and I haven’t been out since I got here,' he wrote to his former attorney Joel Brodsky in one letter. 'Prison is all the nightmarish things that one would think.' Peterson is incarcerated at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois where he is being held in protective custody throughout his sentence because of his former profession as a cop. Drew Peterson's 2012 trial was the first in Illinois history where prosecutors built their case on hearsay thanks in part to a new law, dubbed ‘Drew's Law,’ tailored to the case. The hearsay, prosecutors said, let his wives ‘speak from their graves’ through family and friends. The hearsay - any information reported by a witness not based on the witness' direct knowledge - included a friend who said Savio told her Peterson once put a knife to her throat and warned her: ‘I could kill you and make it look like an accident.’ Savio so feared for her life that she kept a knife under her mattress. Stacy Peterson (pictured) was just 19 and 26 years younger than her husband when they married. She  mysteriously vanished in 2007. Her body has never been found . A former co-worker of Peterson's, Jeff Pachter, testified that Peterson offered him $25,000 to hire a hit man to kill Savio, though he never followed through. Peterson was 26 years older than his fourth wife, Stacy, when they married, only eight days after his third divorce was finalized. Four years later, the 23-year-old went missing in 2007. This disappearance prompted Illinois State Police and the FBI to investigate, and they later had Savio's body exhumed, re-examined and her death reclassified as a homicide. When her sister called the police reporting Stacy's disappearance, Peterson said that she had called him several days before and said that she left him for another man. Her car was found at the airport. One of the biggest aspects in the case of her disappearance was the issue of whether or not he disposed of her body in a large blue container, three of which he bought prior to when she went missing. Stacy Peterson's family hoped a conviction in Savio's murder could lead to charges against Drew Peterson in Stacy's disappearance. Stacy's pastor, Neil Schori, testified she told him that her husband got up from bed and left their house in the middle of the night around the time of Savio's death. Before his 2009 arrest, the glib, cocky Peterson seemed to taunt authorities, suggesting a ‘Win a Date With Drew Contest’ and then, after his arrest, ‘Win a Conjugal Visit With Drew Contest.’","The wife killer was charged on Monday with trying to hire someone to kill Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow while he was in prison .

"BBC staff can claim an 'unpredictability allowance' if their shifts do not follow a set pattern and they can be called in early or stay late, it has been revealed. Workers receive the extra payments, as much as 20 per cent of their salary, if they work unpredictable and unsocial hours, including weekends, evenings and early mornings. A request made under the Freedom of Information Act has revealed that unpredictability allowance payments, made to those workers whose hours can be changed at short notice, have totalled £187,395,824, between 2009 and 2014. BBC staff can claim an 'unpredictability allowance' if they have to get up early for work and their shifts do not follow a set pattered, it has been revealed . There have been 90,384 payments to staff, although this would include workers who have received the allowance on more than one occasion. Additionally, staff who work between midnight and  6am can claim night pay, with the total paid between between 2009 and 2014 standing at £41,707,581. In the last year the unpredictability and flexibility allowances, coupled with night pay, has cost the corporation - which is funded through the licence fee - £36million with 13,267 workers entitled to the money. A former BBC producer said staff will on average receive around £5,000 a year in the bonuses. 'There isn't a commercial organisation in the world that would dream of offering backhand bonuses to staff who are already being handsomely paid simply to set an alarm clock,' he told the Daily Express. The producer, who was not named, said many BBC workers who take on anti-social hours are employed on a freelance basis, so are not entitled to the extra pay. The BBC's Director General, Lord Hall . He added: 'To give this payment to staff in case they work inconvenient hours is disgusting and an abuse of the licence fee.' Staff can take home an extra ten percent of their salary as a bonus if they are informed of their hours of work two weeks in advance. If they are normally told of their shift patterns seven days in advance they are entitled to 20 per cent of their salary. These staff members are expected to have some degree of flexibility when it comes to their working hours, with shift patterns subject to change depending on the operational needs of the BBC. Workers could be called in on the day, or have their hours changed, if there is a need for them to work. The majority of these staff are believed to work in the corporations News division, due to its round-the-clock output. Other broadcasters, such as ITV and Sky, do not give workers flexibility bonuses. A BBC spokesman told MailOnline: 'It’s impossible to broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week without employing people to work through the nights. 'Like most organisations we reflect this in our pay structure – however we’re always looking to make savings and unpredictability allowance has come down by £4 million since 2010. In that same period pay restraint, combined with headcount reductions, has to date saved the BBC £150m per year.' The spokesman added that almost 1,000 fewer staff claimed the unpredictability allowance in 2014 than in 2009. A report published last year revealed that the BBC needs to find an extra £400 million a year by 2017, and could have to cut content in order to make savings. The broadcaster is saving an extra £1.1billion a year more than it was seven years ago, with £35 million cut from the £229million-a-year talent budget paid to the BBC's top stars. There are also plans to make youth channel BBC Three online only - a move expected to save around £100million a year. In recent years, the BBC has repeatedly come under fire for wasting money. The controversial IT project known as the Digital Media Initiative was axed by Director General Lord Hall at a cost of £100 million to the licence fee payer. And the corporation was castigated by MPs after a report by the National Audit Office discovered it had handed out £369million in severance payments to its staff over eight years. Lord Hall has stated that future severance payments will be capped at a maximum of £150,000.","Staff are entitled to extra money if they work unpredictable shift patterns .

"What colour is snow? At first, it seems like an easy answer. Anyone who has seen snow will know it is white, the reason being because it reflects almost all visible light incident upon it. But if you’ve ever dug a deep hole in snow and looked down, you will have noticed that sometimes it can actually appear blue - and sometimes even red, in other circumstances - but why? Dreaming of a white Christmas? Don't dig too deep into snow, or you might start to notice a bluish tint. This is due to more and more of the ice crystals in the snow reflecting blue light, and absorbing other types, although of course in this image the effect is amplified by the shadows as well . As mentioned, snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it. Anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light, which looks white. Snowflakes are understood to be unique - at a molecular level at least. But scientists have revealed that each and every one of them can in fact be sorted into 35 general shapes, which in turn tell experts how they formed. The shapes, which include column crystals, irregular snow particles and plane crystals - which make ‘traditional’ hexagonal snowflakes - vary according to temperature and humidity. Bournemouth-based chemistry teacher Andy Brunning, created an infographic based on recent research to show the different shapes, which he published on his blog, Compound Interest. It shows 39 types of ‘solid precipitation’ or snow, including the 35 types of snowflakes and their names, which can be further divided into 121 subtypes. Simpler snowflake shapes such as germ of ice crystals, are more common at low humidities, while more complex flakes, such as plane crystals are formed in areas of high humidity. Other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple, for instance, reflects only mostly the green wavelength. But, as reported by JSTOR, when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue. The reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) ‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the NSIDC explains. While most of the light is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue. When you see just the surface of a pack of snow, the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice. But if you look into a significant amount of snow, about 3.3ft (one metre) or so, more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end. ‘For instance, if you were to poke a hole in the snow and look down into the hole, you may see a bluish colour,’ said the NSIDC. While most of the light that is incident upon snow and ice is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue, giving a slight bluish tint in deep snow and ice, such as this image from South Georgia Island in Antarctica . ‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) explains. Shown is a slight bluish tint in a melting glacier in East Greeland . When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason. This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment. Also known as ‘watermelon snow’, it is ‘most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions’. Interestingly, C. nivalis cells actually appear green under a microscope. The reason they appear pink in snow to our eyes is due to a biochemical called beta-carotene. It protects the algae’s chlorophyll from the sun’s rays, but in the process gives them a red or pinkish hue, rather than green. Be careful not to eat watermelon snow, though - it can act as a laxative. When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason. This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis (shown) that contain a bright red pigment . Also known as ‘watermelon snow’ , red snow is most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions. Shown is red snow in the Dolomites, Italy . Red snow can also be caused by iron-rich seawater, such as Blood Falls in Antarctica’s Taylor Glacier, shown, where the water leaks from an ancient reservoir under the glacier. The iron oxidises when it comes into contact with the atmosphere, turning red . Last year, meanwhile, a Washington photographer  spent two month living in a remote base in Antarctica to reveal how the area can be surprisingly colourful. Gaston Lacombe captured incredible images showing the bright pinks, greens and reds of the area - caused by everything from penguin poo to massive blooms of algae. Mr Lacombe told MailOnline he was invited to the remote base by the Government of Argentina as its artist in residence. The Canadian photographer now based in Washington, D.C. spent two months at Esperanza Base, a permanent research station on Antarctica’s Trinity Peninsula. Gaston Lacombe spent two months at Esperanza Base, a permanent research station on Antarctica’s Trinity Peninsula, to capture amazing images of coloured snow last year. Here, the red snow effect is caused by the algae Chlamydomonas nivalis . The red colour doesnt always come from algae, however. Adelie penguins transiting to and from the sea shore colour the surface of the snow with whatever substance they drag with their feet. The pink colour here is from penguin poo, since they eat mostly krill, a small type of shrimp .","Snow might normally appear white - but it can also appear red and blue .

"To bring the story of mobster Mickey Cohen's reign over post-war Los Angeles to life, the director of Gangster Squad employed Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling - and more than 100 irreplaceable vintage American cars. There's the 1941 light blue Ford Deluxe Convertible that Gosling's character drives; the bulbous, bullet-nosed 1947 Ford sedans that served as police cars; the gorgeous black 1936 Oldsmobile convertible with a tan ragtop; and the regal 1949 Packard Super 8 limousines that carried Cohen.

'If you want to lock a movie scene in, use the right car and they will immediately get it.' Picture car coordinator Tim Woods spent 12 weeks working with 'Gangster Squad' director Ruben Fleischer to get the automotive look of 1949 Los Angeles just right. A few of the vintage cars came from Woods' own personal collection. He called on Southern California car collectors (and a few local junkyards) for the rest.

Kotzin got into the business through his buddy Chuck Shubb, who calls himself a picture car supplier. Shubb owns some 60 classic cars and belongs to six car clubs, including the Lincoln Club, where he serves as a judge. He collected cars as a hobby while running his construction company until a chance meeting with an art director in 1985. She borrowed a few of his cars to use in commercials and music videos, and soon after, Shubb's movie-car business was born.

He travels with his cars, though he lamented that so much production has moved out of the area in recent years. Still, there's one thing he won't accept: 'I don't do wrecks.' 'They're my babies,' he said. 'They're not replaceable.' As the picture car coordinator, Woods has to do wrecks. They wrecked four classic 1949 Cadillacs in Gangster Squad, along with eight other cars. 'We blew them up, crashed them and destroyed them,' he said, adding that there was also 'one unforeseen accident where we hit a real 2010 Ford taxi in the middle of the night.' With rare exception, though, his team buys junkyard cars that don't run, then modifies them for stunts - and destruction. Still, Woods hates to see such classic beauties wrecked. 'The integrity of these cars is too much,' he said, adding that none of the working, cared-for vehicles was harmed during the making of the film. 'We never ever shot a hole in a single fender,' he said. 'Those cars are down here in my office and they're not even scratched or hurt. All bullet holes were CG.' That's good news for Kotzin, who draws the line at 'no dancing on the hood.'","They include 1941 Ford Deluxe Convertible, bullet-nosed 1947 Ford sedan .

"It is a terrifying moment for any man - as they lean down on one knee and fumble to open that tiny velvet box... their whole future dependent on the answer to a four-word question. But now it has become clear just how risky proposing to the woman you love really is. A new survey has shown that nearly one in four women have turned down at least one marriage proposal during their lifetime. A new survey has revealed that one in four women have turned down a marriage proposal in their lifetime, with the top reason being that the man wasn't 'The One' (picture posed by models) The most common reasons are because they feared the proposer wasn't 'the one', that it 'didn't feel right' or that their partner wasn't taking the proposal seriously enough. Others even said they have rejected a proposal because they thought it was nothing more than a joke. But 23 per cent of people who have declined a proposal admitted they'd regretted the decision later on. It also emerged 59 per cent of men feel nervous at the prospect of proposing to their partner, with 15 per cent admitting that the thought made them break out in a cold sweat. Almost one in three women also revealed that they would turn down a marriage proposal if the man hadn't gone to enough effort while popping the question (pictured posed by model) One man even recorded his own heart rate leading up to, during and after proposing during a break to Rome, with his pulse spiking at 131 beats a minute as he got down on one knee. A spokesperson for travel firm SuperBreak, who commissioned the research, said: 'We realise that proposing is a big decision for most people and the survey results clearly show this. 'It can take a long time to pluck up the courage to pop the question and to not hear the answer you are hoping for can be difficult. 'And it seems many women will turn down a proposal simply because it wasn't done in the way they were hoping. 'So if you are planning to propose, make sure you have an idea of what your partner would like and hopefully you will be celebrating hearing 'yes'.' Of the 2,000 Brits questioned over their proposal experiences, 37 of women revealed they had been proposed to  twice in their lifetime and 12 per cent admitted men had asked for their hand in marriage no less than three times. 1. I wasn't certain they were the one . 2. It just didn't feel right . 3. I don't/didn't want to get married . 4. It didn't feel like they meant it . 5. I didn't think we'd been in a relationship long enough . 6. We'd already split up and they were trying to win me back . 7. I was worried about what other people would think . 8. I didn't think we could afford it . 9. I thought it was a joke . 10. I didn't think my partner was taking it seriously enough . While issues over the condition of the relationship were most likely to solicit a 'no' from the woman in question, the research has shown that the effort that goes into the proposal is also a big factor. 29 per cent of women admitted they would turn down their partner just on the basis of the proposal itself being poor. 52 per cent revealed they were hoping for a traditional 'down on one knee' proposal and 20 per cent wanted an 'all-singing, all-dancing' proposal. It also emerged just 22 per cent of men actually planned to, or did, spend the traditional two months' salary on a ring for their partner. One in ten men don't intend to spend a great amount on a ring saying that they 'don't see the need for a ring.' The study found the most romantic destinations for proposing to a partner are Paris, Venice and Rome.","Survey shows quarter of British women have refused a marriage proposal .

"A clock that is so accurate it will lose just one second in 16 billion years has been created by scientists. The device, made using super-cooled atoms held within a lattice of laser beams, is around 1,000 times more precise than the atomic clocks currently used to define time. Researchers say clocks with this level of accuracy could open up new areas of science by allowing tiny changes fluctuations in the strength of gravity to be measured. Scientists used laser beams to create a lattice that traps single atoms of super-cooled stontium (above) This is because time in a powerful gravitational field will move more slowly than in a weaker field - a gravity induced time dilation predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Atomic clocks operate by means of atoms oscillating between two energy levels. In an optical lattice clock, millions of strontium atoms are held in a column of laser optical traps. Scientists detect the clock's 'ticks' - 430 trillion of them a second - by bathing the atoms in very stable red laser light. The precise frequency of the laser trigger prompts the switch between energy levels. By placing these hyper-accurate clocks at various depths around the world, it will be possible to measure tiny changes in the Earth's gravity. It could help geologists understand some of the processes that drive events like earthquakes and may even make it possible to predict them. Dr Hidetoshi Katori, head of the quantum metrology laboratory at the RIKEN Centre for Advanced Photonics in Japan, said the clock could also be used to develop a new international standard for the second. He said: 'If we can miniaturize this technology further, it would have useful applications, since tiny fluctuations in gravitational potential could be used to detect underground resources, underground spaces, and the movement of lava. 'We also hope that in the future, this will accelerate the movement toward a new definition of the international second, based on optical lattice clocks, to an even more stringent standard than the current definition of the second. The lasers beams are used to create an egg-box lattice with each cup holding an atom of strontium (above) Currently seconds are defined using International Atomic Time, which uses the oscillation of electrons within a cesium atom when it is cooled to almost absolute zero. As these electrons oscillate they emit microwaves each time and these can be measured. The best caesium atomic clocks are accurate to around one second in every 100 million years. However, Dr Katori and his colleagues have created two optical lattice clocks using atoms of strontium that are held in a laser-generated egg-box shaped lattice. The new clocks could help to measure gravity induced time dilation as predicted by Albert Einstein (above) A single atom is held within each 'cup' of the lattice within a container cooled to -180 degrees C. By then measuring the frequency of light absorbed by millions of these atoms, scientists are then able to use this to monitor time. Scientists have been trying to improve the accuracy of these clocks for years but until now it has been hard to produce any that out perform current atomic clocks. However, Dr Katori has found that using laser of a specific wavelength and cooling the atoms can improve their accuracy. In a study published in the journal Nature Photonics, Dr Katori and his colleagues compared two of these clocks over the period of a month to confirm their accuracy. According to the scientists, if their clocks had been running since the beginning of the universe around 13.8 billion years ago, they would have lost less than a second in time. Dr Katori added: 'It was a great feeling to have shown this excellent agreement between the clocks.' The most accurate atomic clocks currently used are called fountain clocks - so called the cesium atoms are tossed in the air and fall back down inside a vertical tube during a key routine repeated thousands of times an hour. A gas of cesium atoms is introduced into the clock's vacuum chamber and six infrared laser beams gently push about 10 million atoms into a ball. In this process, the lasers cool the atoms to temperatures near absolute zero and slow them down significantly, to enable precise measurements of their natural vibrations. Two vertical laser beams produced by the six lasers are used to gently toss the atom balls upward through the flight chamber (the ""fountain"" action), and then all of the lasers are turned off. This little push is just enough to loft the ball about 1.3 meters high through a microwave-filled cavity. Gravity brings the ball back down through the microwave cavity. During the trip, some atomic states of the atoms are altered, while others remain the same, as they interact with a microwave signal from a maser. When the trip is finished, another laser is pointed at the atoms. Some atoms—those whose energy states were altered by the microwave signal—emit light, or fluorescence. The resulting photons, the tiny packets of light emitted, are measured by a detector. This process is repeated while the microwave signal in the cavity is tuned to different frequencies. Eventually, a microwave frequency is found that alters the states of most of the cesium atoms. This frequency is the natural resonance frequency of the cesium atom (9,192,631,770 Hz), or the frequency used to define the second.","Japanese researchers have created super-accurate optical lattice clocks .

"People are more likely to make a complaint about online purchases because it doesn't involve face-to-face confrontation, according to new figures . Complaints by British shoppers are soaring - with people more likely to make a complaint about online purchases because it doesn’t involve a face-to-face confrontation. The number of complaints about online purchases has doubled to more than 66 million in 2014, according to new figures from a Consumer Action report. Customers are less likely to accept slow service, failed deliveries and inadequate products when they buy goods online. Retail suppliers received the most complaints last year- with a total of 18.5million individuals registering their disappointment. And 7.7million complaints were put in to mobile, broadband and television companies. A further 7.3million consumers made their displeasure known to energy suppliers. Public transport, leisure and tourism, banking and finance, tradesmen, property, postal and professional services were also in the list of the top ten most complained about sectors. The annual Consumer Action Monitor report showed a significant overall increase in the number of customers willing to take action by registering an official complaint. Almost half of Britons took action to resolve a problem they had with a service, compared with just 34 per cent in 2013. And almost one third of these complaints (20million) were made online. The figures were analysed by Ombudsman’s Services, a non-profit company that aims to resolve disputes for the energy, property, licensing and communication industries. Lewis Shand Smith, the chief ombudsman, said: ‘It’s clear to see that customers are less willing than ever to stand for poor service and poor quality. ‘While it is encouraging to know that consumers are becoming more aware of their rights and more likely to take action, we’re also seeing millions of problems that aren’t taken up with suppliers. ‘The research highlights a real need for more to be done to tackle poor customer service in the UK.’ Retail suppliers received the most complaints last year - with a total of 18.5million individuals registering their disappointment (file image)","More needs to be done to tackle UK's poor customer service, experts say .

"When Angela Kane, from London, was hunting for a holiday home in Ireland five years ago, she didn’t consult Zoopla or the usual array of property websites in search of the best deal or most up-and-coming area. Instead, she visited an astrologer and asked for his help in finding the perfect home. He drew her a personalised astrological map, covered in criss-crossing multi-coloured lines showing the most auspicious areas for her house hunt. Never mind structural surveys or price-growth estimates, this map, she reckoned, was the single most effective way to guarantee investing in the perfect property where she will, one day, happily see out her retirement. Mairead Armstrong, 47 (pictured), uses Astro-Cartography in which people consult their birth charts and match them with their holiday destinations to see if they are compatible . Angela, 45, an assistant, is only one of a growing number of professional women turning to a little-known branch of stargazing, called astro-mapping, not just to take the guesswork out of househunting, but also to plot the co-ordinates of every aspect of their life. Astro-mapping purports to use the latest computer programs, which can track the paths of the planets around the Earth to tell you exactly which countries, cities and even postcodes will be luckiest for you. Having narrowed her choice to three properties 30 miles apart, an analysis of Angela’s birth chart singled out the property closest to an intersection of her Moon lines — associated with nurturing and emotional support — and her Venus lines (linked to emotional happiness). ‘Financially, it was a huge decision — I was ploughing all my life savings into it — but it was also a huge emotional investment, so I wanted reassurance I was getting it right,’ says Angela. ‘I haven’t had a single building problem since I bought it, and the tranquillity and peace of mind I feel here, compared with everywhere else I have ever lived, are unique. I feel certain I have made the perfect choice.’ Of course, most people have experienced the sensation of feeling more at home in some parts of the world than in others. But could the reason really be found in the stars? The division of the heavens into 12 signs of the zodiac can be traced back to the 7th century . The division of the heavens into 12 signs of the zodiac can be traced back to the 7th century. But sophisticated computer software means modern-day astrologers claim they are learning more about the influence of the planets on our lives all the time. Indeed, they claim that our personal star chart can reveal far more than whether we are going to have a good or bad day — pinpointing where on Earth life will be easier or more challenging. Astrology author Marcus Mason practises astro-mapping from his base in Saltash, Cornwall, and draws up personalised maps for clients all over the world, with prices starting at £140. Requests range from couples who want advice on which country to emigrate to, to those who just want to choose the most auspicious venue for a wedding or landmark birthday party. Marcus says: ‘It’s like having a map of your star-life superimposed onto one of the Earth, which shows where you can reach your potential.’ Much like traditional astrology, astro-mapping involves identifying the unique positions of the planets, Sun and Moon in the sky at the moment of our birth. Your personal chart is formed by tracking lines down from the location of each of these heavenly bodies onto a map, and drawing another set of lines, radiating out from your birthplace to the points where the planets were rising and setting at that moment, to create a complex, interlocking web. As each planet has its own personality, experts claim you will feel the corresponding emotional pull of their power in spots which fall on their planetary line — with the effects felt about 25 miles either side. Marcus says: ‘Places close to your Venus lines might be better for romance, emotional health and relationships, while those close to your Mercury lines are more positive for mental health and communication. ‘Jupiter is known as the bringer of luck, happiness, abundance and wealth, so people who visit places near their personal Jupiter lines know they will have an easier, more relaxing time. Angela Kane visited an astrologer for advice before she bought a holiday home in Ireland five years ago (picture posed by model) ‘If you are on the look-out for an adventure holiday or a place where you can reach your goals, parts of the Earth near your Mars lines will be the spots to head for. But you may also need to careful because those regions carry a higher risk of accidents and conflicts.’ When Mairead Armstrong is choosing where to go on holiday, she always consults her chart before TripAdvisor. Mairead, who is single and lives in London’s West End, says: ‘I have always studied astrology, and I first saw how useful it was when I was planning a trip to Rio to spend time with my brother, about 15 years ago. ‘Family and friends were begging me not to go, saying it was far too dangerous. But, on my chart, running through that part of South America I could see a Venus line, which is the planet of harmony and good relationships. ‘That’s exactly what I experienced — everywhere we went people were welcoming and I didn’t have a single problem. ‘On another occasion a few years later, however, I went on a last-minute getaway to Madeira without checking my chart first. In the space of a few days, I narrowly missed having a car crash, and when I challenged a man in the street about the way he was treating his animals, he became aggressive and nearly attacked me. Some people have been so convinced by the benefits of astro-mapping that they move thousands of miles across the world (picture posed by models) ‘When I got home, I checked my chart to find that my Mars lines (associated with aggression) and Saturn lines (linked with challenging situations) crossed over the island, so it all made sense.’ Mairead now won’t go on a major trip without checking the planetary influences of her destination first: ‘In a few months, I will visit Qatar for work, which has another of my Venus lines running through it. But I won’t be stopping off at Dubai, which has Saturn, Pluto and Uranus influences close by, as that could indicate I’ll get caught up in volatile situations.’ When a number of positive or negative lines cross, they form hotspots — either to visit or to avoid. For Mairead, one such spot is Iceland. The fact that no less than eight of her lines cross there means she feels continually drawn to the country — indeed she has been back five times in the past 20 years. She first visited it on a stop-over to the U.S., before she was aware it was a place of personal astrological significance. ‘As soon as I stepped off the plane, I felt a complete sense of well-being. I even cut short my trip to America to spend more time there on the return journey. ‘When I consulted my chart after I got back, I saw so many lines were running through it,’ adds Mairead. Some women are so convinced astro-mapping works that they have moved thousands of miles across the world. When British-born Miranda Dickenson reached the end of a five-year university course in counselling in Colorado, USA, she was in a dilemma about where to start her new career. ‘I’d initially moved to the U.S. as an office manager, but after training to be a psychotherapist I knew I could set up my practice anywhere in the world. The choice was overwhelming, so when a friend mentioned she’d seen an astro-cartographer, I decided it couldn’t hurt to ask his advice. ‘He told me the influence of the planet Pluto suggested I should move on from Colorado. He then gave me the choice of two places — Genoa in Italy, or Perthshire in Scotland. I had family already in Scotland so I found an idyllic cottage right in the middle of a valley and took the plunge. ‘I felt at home right away. People were open and friendly and welcomed me into the community, and my psychotherapy practice is flourishing. I’m certain my chart helped me make the right choice.’ Professor Chris French, Head of the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmith’s University, London — which attempts to explain paranormal and related beliefs — is more doubtful. He says: ‘People turn to a system like this when they may be feeling their lives are out of their control. Even if the sense of control astro-mapping gives is an illusion, they will still find it psychologically comforting, and that it takes the anxiety out of stressful decisions such as moving house. Marcus Mason insists people are beginning to rely on astro-mapping for holidays and life plans because they can test whether it works or not (picture posed by model) ‘As a sceptic I have no doubt that this system has no validity whatsoever, but that doesn’t mean it can’t perform a useful psychological function for those who do believe in it.’ Marcus Mason, however, insists astro-mapping is steadily gaining popularity precisely because users can easily test if it works for them. ‘It can help people get out of a rut,’ he says. ‘I have had clients who were having endless financial problems and frustrations and who, I discovered, were living on their Saturn lines. By moving to live on a Jupiter line, they found their financial issues were more likely to resolve themselves. ‘Others, who discovered they were living on their Chiron lines — an asteroid linked with the need to heal wounds from past lives — found themselves dealing with on-going medical issues for many years. Moving away from these lines allowed things to get better.’ Mairead insists the accuracy of astro-mapping has been borne out by her many trips around the world: ‘In visiting more than 50 countries, it has never let me down,’ she says. ‘In a world full of choices, it’s a good way to help make some better decisions.’ For astro-mapping readings, contact Marcus Mason at heavenandearthcommunity.co.uk or Sue Farebrother on suemerlyn.com .","Astro-mapping uses the latest computer programs to tell you where to visit .

"A judge says Marion 'Suge' Knight will stay behind bars until his next court hearing at the end of March in the case of a deadly hit-and-run. The co-founder of Death Row Records sat at the back of the court room looking relaxed and sipping water days after his shock hospitalization for a panic attack. Addressing the rap mogul's bail-review, a prosecutor and Knight's attorney asked for a delay until March 20. Staying behind bars: Marion 'Suge' Knight, 49, appeared in court on Monday (pictured) to hear he will remain in jail until his postponed bail-review hearing on March 20. He denies murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run . Knight, 49, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run after authorities say he ran down and killed one man and seriously injured another in a parking lot. He was hospitalized last Tuesday when he fell into a panic attack moments after pleading not guilty to all charges. Armed guards reportedly watched over Knight in hospital. Hospitalized: Knight was in court on Monday (pictured), six days after he was hospitalized with a panic attack . Postponed: Knight's attorneys David Kenner (left) and Brett Greenfield (right) requested more time to prepare . Victims: Terry Carter, 55, left, died in the accident while Cle 'Bone' Sloan, right, was injured . TMZ reported that doctors discovered he had a blood clot and he was treated with blood thinners. Knight's blood clots have been an ongoing health problem for him since he was shot six times last summer. He nearly died from a clot several weeks back when he was in a Las Vegas jail. Back behind bars:  Knight was arrested for murder on January 30, 2015 in connection with a hit-and-run accident that killed one person near Los Angeles . Knight's attorneys have said he was trying to flee a vicious attack January 29 when he hit the men with his pickup truck. Authorities allege Knight killed one man, 55, and injured another, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, with his pickup truck on Thursday near a film set in Compton. Police say he fled the scene. Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case at the time. Marion 'Suge' Knight had a long-standing 'beef' with the man he is charged with attempting to murder by mowing him down in his truck, Daily Mail Online revealed last week. Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, was knocked unconscious and has a 'mangled' foot after the collision last week, an incident which saw music producer Terry Carter, 55, killed. And the actor and filmmaker - who has been employed as a consultant on hit movies such as Training Day - fears his injuries could bring his career to an abrupt end. Sloan is furious that Knight allegedly 'went ballistic' after a row erupted on the set of the film 'Straight Outta Compton, a production about the rise of the rap group N.W.A. Sloan had worked hard to convince rap legend and music producer Dr Dre to come to Compton to be involved in the film. But a source close to Sloan said Knight ruined the 'beautiful' moment by sparking a heated row. He is due back in court on March 20 as both sides said they needed more time to prepare for a bail-review.","Rap mogul was hospitalized after he pleaded not guilty to murder last week .

"A map showing the cost of living around the world shows how the U.S. is now less affordable for residents - but still cheaper than Britain and France. The global report reveals how Britain is the 10th most expensive country to live in with Australia tenth and America 24th. Switzerland tops the list while Norway and Denmark appear in the top five for the third year in a row according to the results of a survey which took into account the cost of groceries, transportation, restaurants and utilities. A map has been produced charting the cost of living around the world - and it reveals how the U.S. is cheaper for residents than the UK . Switzerland tops the list while Norway and Denmark appear in the top five for the third year in a row according to the results of a survey . In a damning reflection of Venezuela's domestic problems, the Latin American country has climbed from 12th place in 2013 to third place in 2015. Iceland has also jumped significantly, up from 10th place in 2013 to fourth in 2015. The world report, carried out by Numbeo, was fashioned into an infographic by movehub - a resource for people moving abroad. All nations were compared to the cost of living in New York. For example, if a country has a consumer price index of 70 on movehub's infographic then on average its cost of living is 30 per cent cheaper than that of New York's. Australia was found to be the sixth least affordable country while New zealand was seventh on the list . India came first on a list charting the lowest cost of living, followed by Nepal and Pakistan . In a damning reflection of Venezuela's domestic problems, the Latin American country has climbed from 12th place in 2013 to third place in 2015 .

More expensive but not in the big leagues: The U.S. ranked 24th in the world's cost of living table . Movehub explains the cost of groceries took into account the price for meat, bread, rice, eggs, fruits, vegetables and alcohol. While, transportation costs included one-way tickets, monthly passes, taxi fares, petrol prices and other costs related to running a car based on the use of Volkswagen Golf. Meal prices at expensive, mid-range and inexpensive restaurants were taken into account along with prices of coffee products, alcohol and water. Electricity, heating, water the internet were the utilities assessed. Therefore, the average cost of living for an Australian is almost one per cent cheaper than for someone living in the Big Apple. Pricey! Australia is the sixth most expensive place in the world to live in, according to new research . In it for the long haul: Switzerland is the costliest place to live in the world after four years in second place . India comes out as having the lowest cost of living, with poor wages matched by poor living conditions . Venezuela's tightening financial situation has fanned market anxiety about a default, especially as oil slumps to near six-year lows. President Nicholas Maduro has vowed to pay bondholders and most economists doubt a default is coming in the near-term, but investors are getting skittish as the economic crisis worsens. Venezuela depends on oil for 96 per cent of its export revenue. There were not many surprises where it comes to the countries with the lowest cost of living. India topped the pile in this regard, followed in by Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Algeria.

"It's been 29 years since an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine released large doses of radiation across Europe. But the effects of that devastating event could still be affecting the continent as a result of recent forest fires in Ukraine. According to new research, these fires are causing radioactive caesium in the soil around the nuclear plant to be released into the atmosphere as smoke, which then travels across Eastern Europe. Scroll down for video . Following three forest fires in Ukraine (stock image), scientists from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research measured radiation levels in the soil and atmosphere. They discovered that these fires caused around 0.5 petabecquerels of radioactive caesium to be released over eastern Europe as smoke . Scientists also warned that the situation could get worse as climate change made these fires more common. The Chernobyl disaster occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. An explosion and fire released radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe. There is still an exclusion zone in place  that measures approximately 1,000 square miles (2,600 square km) and surrounds the plant. In total, its believed the Chernobyl disaster released around 85 petabecquerels (PBq) of radioactive caesium into the atmosphere. Between two and eight PBq can still be found in the upper layers of the soil in the exclusion zone. During 2002, 2008 and 2010, three forest fires swept through the region and experts from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research wanted to discover if they released any of this radiation into the air. Using satellite images to track the spread of the fires, with measurements of caesium-137 in the area, the researchers created models of air movements. They estimate that 0.5 PBq was released in smoke that travelled over eastern Europe, as far south as Turkey and as far west as Scandinavia. While people in Kiev would have been exposed to an average dose of 10 microsieverts of radiation or 1 per cent of the permitted yearly dose . Although this sounds relatively small, the team also explained that because the fires would create an uneven spread of radiation, doses could be either much higher or could affect food crops. For example, mushrooms easily absorb caesium-137 and, if ingested, the exposure would be higher and more concentrated.

For example, mushrooms easily absorb Caesium-137 and, if ingested, the exposure would be higher and more concentrated. ‘The internal dose from ingestion can be significant,’ said co-author Tim Mousseau, and cancers could be hard to spot, but 'significant.' As part of the research, experts also modelled how fires in the region will peak between 2023 and 2036 as the area becomes drier as a result of climate change, according to predictions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. To put this into perspective, the human body typically experiences around 5,000 Bq of radiation as a result of radioactive isotopes within the body. In total, its believed the Chernobyl disaster released around 85 petabecquerels (PBq) of radioactive caesium into the atmosphere. The spread of radiation following the 1986 explosion is pictured.

An explosion and fire released large quantities of radioactive particles into the atmosphere, which spread over much of the western USSR and Europe. The Chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear power plant accident in history in terms of cost and casualties, and is one of only two classified as a level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale. The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated £11 billion ($18 billion). During the accident 31 people died, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for. And there are 1,000,000,000,000,000 Bq in a PBq. During the accident 31 people died, and long-term effects such as cancers and deformities are still being accounted for. However, the exact figure is highly contested. The UN's World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency recently said only 56 people have died as a direct result of the radiation, and 4,000 will die in later years. But the International Agency for Research on Cancer puts this latter figure as high as 16,000 deaths. Meanwhile, the Belarus national academy of sciences estimates 93,000 deaths so far and 270,000 cancers, and the Ukrainian national commission for radiation protection calculates 500,000 deaths. The battle to contain the contamination and avert a greater catastrophe ultimately involved more than 500,000 workers and cost an estimated £11 billion ($18 billion). The findings are published in the ESA journal Ecological Monographs. A Devon-based documentary maker recently captured the decaying region of Pripyat in Ukraine using a drone.

On May 25, 1979 Etan's mother waved him off with a dollar bill in his hand to get a soda from the store before catching the school bus, but he never emerged after prosecutors say he was taken to the basement by stock clerk Pedro Hernandez and strangled to death. Scroll down for video . The New York bodega where six-year-old Etan Patz was allegedly lured to his death in 1979 has been described as a 'safe haven' by residents - it has since gone and been replaced by a fashion store (above) Ramon Rodriguez, 75, told a Manhattan court on Thursday that Pedros Hernandez, left, admitted to the kidnapping and murder of Etan Patz, right, on a 1979 religious retreat in New Jersey . While records show police went to the bodega among many places during their search for Etan, a detective testified earlier this week that he couldn't remember the space being searched. The owners have since died. So has the lead detective. And when the bodega closed in the early 1980s, a cleaning company came and stripped away everything. It is a now a high-end eye  wear boutique. Commenting on the apparent murder scene, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzi-Orbon said: 'It's ironic and particularly tragic that this was the place that turned out to be the most dangerous for a child.' The bodega was depicted as a cramped oasis of household necessities in an area of ramshackle warehouses and vacant lots. Its narrow aisles were crammed with soda, beer, candy and household supplies. On the 33rd anniversary of the disappearance of Eatan Patz, New York Police Department's Crime Scene Unit gets access to the basement of 448 West Broadway at Prince St. in Soho . The map shows the path Etan would have walked after leaving his SoHo home for the bus stop - and its proximity to the bodega where Hernandez worked . Sometimes a live rooster perched on the counter, residents recalled. Just a day before Etan disappeared, another neighborhood mother found the lunch box he'd forgotten at the school bus stop and dropped it off at the store, asking counter worker Juan Santana to mind it until he could pick it up. Santana was a guy everyone in the neighborhood knew. But no one knew that his brother-in-law, Hernandez, would become the suspect in Etan's death more than three decades later, after giving a confession his defense now says was fiction produced by mental illness. Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to murder and kidnapping. Santana, who isn't a suspect, has become a confounding witness during testimony this week. A look back: In this March 1980 photo, Stan and Julie Patz stand on the  fire escape of their loft in SoHo. Below them runs Prince Street, along which Etan, their six-year-old son, set off to school on May 25, 1979 . Many of his answers didn't match others' remembrances, and ADA Illuzi-Orbon even warned jurors that Santana - who got Hernandez his $200-a-week job at the bodega - was worried about protecting himself and would not be cooperative. Santana, 66, testified that he remembered Etan picking up the lunch box the day before his disappearance, but he doesn't recall whether Hernandez ever spoke to him. And Santana said he didn't remember whether Hernandez was allowed alone into the store basement, where Hernandez said in videotaped confessions that he lured Etan by promising a soda, then choked him. In the confessions, Hernandez said he put the boy, still alive, in a bag, boxed it and left it with curbside trash. Etan's body has never been found. No one has testified, at least so far, that they saw Hernandez with the boy. Some records from the lengthy investigation are missing, and it's not clear why the shop never emerged as a prime spot until Hernandez' surprising 2012 confession. Some records from the lengthy investigation are missing, and it's not clear why the shop never emerged as a prime spot until Hernandez' surprising 2012 confession (above, the store being visited by NYPD in 2012) His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years. In considering evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing-child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting. Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. His parents, Stan and Julie, helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day. The trial is expected to last up to three months. In addition to Etan's mother, witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.","The youngster's best friend, Chelsea Altman, said the store at 448 West Broadway in Soho was a spot where parents felt comfortable letting their children roam unaccompanied .

"Key elements of the Highway Code are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock to Britain's city centres, the official Government review into self-drive vehicles will announce tomorrow. But the re-write will also serve to allow groups of cars and lorries to run far closer together in 'convoys' or 'platoons' with separation gaps between automated vehicles just a fraction of the recommend spaces between automated vehicles compared to those with drivers. Rules on tailgating may need to be removed entirely to enable the driverless cars to run almost nose to tail –taking up less road-space, reducing jams an improving fuel efficiency thanks to on-board sensors that can act with far more precision than a human driver. Key elements of the Highway Code are to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock, pictured five drivers steered automated Hyundai Genesis’ into a convoy at a test track in California . A Whitehall insider said: 'It seems likely that the introduction of driverless cars wil in due course necessitate changes to regulations, to common practice and to conventions governing the interaction of road-users.' Other parts of the Highway Code are on course to be relaxed because driverless cars can pass other vehicles with greater precision. So recommended passing distances to cyclists and pedestrians may have to be changed to prevent self-driving vehicles clogging up highways across the country. Under the existing Highway Code, drivers overtaking cyclists are expected to leave as much room as they would leave for a car. The official review into driverless cars, to be published on Wednesday, will confirm that the Highway Code will need to be reviewed. Rules on tailgating may need to be removed entirely to enable the driverless cars to run almost nose to tail, pictured Google's early protype for the a two-seater self-driving car . On Saturday the Daily Mail revealed exclusively that ministers would give the green light to trials on public roads of the new vehicles which will not require a licence to drive. Insurance costs could be slashed because the machines are less likely to make an error, say experts. Transport minister Claire Perry said recently: 'Driver and human error is reported to account for over 90per cent of traffic incidents, and so it is clear that driverless cars will make a huge difference. 'Using the technology to manage traffic flows on trunk roads will smooth traffic flows and reduce the stop/start of congestion, which will, in turn, reduce emissions and improve fuel consumption.' She added: 'We are also looking at 'platooning' of heavy goods vehicles on the trunk road network. I am sure you will know that platooning is the electronic coupling of vehicles to run in close formation. By allowing vehicles to run closer together, the government recognises the potential fuel and carbon savings, reduced congestion by creating more efficient use of the network, and reduced road casualties by eliminating driver error from accidents.' Volvo has begun testing the driverless-car technology. Here, a driver drinks tea as his car automatically drives itself, keeping a safe distance from the lorry in front . Graham Parkhurst, head of an academic research programme in Bristol and part of one of three official pilot programmes, said: 'If everyone obeyed exactly what it said in the Highways Code, the roads would probably grind to a halt. If we ask driverless vehicles to respect every aspect of the Highway Code we will quickly discover that some things would be unworkable.' The Government's major six month feasibility study into the practical, safety and legal issues surrounding the autonomous 'robo-cars' will conclude that there is 'no barrier to testing driverless technology on UK roads' from this summer. It paves the way for the first proper tests on British highways of vehicles that drive themselves amid other cars and real traffic. Until now the technology has only been trialled on private land or specialist test facilities. But in a move that puts the Government on course to fulfil its ambition to make the UK the world centre for self-driving vehicles – and draw in lucrative foreign research investment - the report will advise that 'The UK is well placed to lead the development of driverless technology.' The report is expected to distinguish between 'highly automated cars' fitted with steering wheels and pedals in which motorists will be expected to take control at any time, and 'fully' automated cars, where a licence will not be required because they are essentially a passenger in 'a car which is capable of operating on the road network without hman intervention.' In this case 'a driver need not be able and ready to assume control.' Drivers of highly automated cars could still face prosecution and penalties for mobile phone use, failure to wear a seatbelt and eating at the wheel .","Highway Code to be re-written to stop driverless cars bringing gridlock .

"Cast out by his pride, this starving lion was forced to take on a fully-grown buffalo in his desperate bid to survive. What ensued was a brutal hour-long battle leaving both animals bloodied, exhausted and with fatal wounds. Dramatic images capture the lion savagely biting and clawing at the buffalo's mouth, the big cat's face smeared with blood from where he's been gored by his heavier and larger opponent's horns. Scroll down for video . Tossed around: A male lion is flung into the air after attacking a lone female buffalo in the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia . The feline is tossed around in the air as he attempts to mount his adversary and is finally finished off when another buffalo arrives on the scene to deliver a lethal blow. The gut-wrenching pictures were taken by Matt Armstrong-Ford, 25, in the South Luangwa National Park in Zambia. The amateur photographer, from Eastbourne, who works for Shenton Safaris as a guide and camp manager, came across the bloody scene as the lion's claws were hooked into the female buffalo's muzzle. He recognised the cat as a six-year-old lion who suffered from mange, a type of skin disease, and who had become detached from his pride. Starving: The hungry six-year-old lion was suffering from mange, a type of skin disease, and had become detached from his pride . Bloody battle: Dramatic images capture the lion biting and clawing at the buffalo's mouth, the big cat's face smeared with blood and dust . The lion had camped himself next to a watering hole hoping to attack unsuspecting buffalo. Mr Armstrong said: 'After around ten minutes of our arrival the buffalo managed to shake the lion off itself but instead of trying to escape just stood there. 'Both animals stared at each other both too exhausted to move. 'After a few minutes of rest the lion then went for the buffalo and another ten-minute battle ensued. Again the buffalo managed to shake itself free. Exhausted: Both battle-worn animals appear to have little energy left after fighting for an hour in the national park in Zambia . Clinging on: The lion digs his claws into the buffalo's face as he attempts to pull the animal downwards to deliver a killer bite . 'The same process continued for about an hour until both animals were completely spent. 'The rest of the herd, who had come to the water to drink were watching from a distance while the fight carried on.' As it looked like fortune was favouring the exhausted but ravenous lion a member of the buffalo's herd came to its aid and delivered a deadly blow. The safari guide added: 'That seemed to give the cow the opportunity it needed to escape and along with the rest of the herd moved off. Final attack: The lion sinks his teeth into the buffalo's mouth - but the attack is not enough to bring down the much larger animal . Battle for survival: The incredible pictures were taken by Matt Armstrong-Ford, 25, an amateur photographer from Eastbourne . 'After this the lion managed to drag himself under a bush to lick his wounds. Both animals were covered in blood by the end.' Two days later the lion succumbed to his injuries, while the buffalo's carcass was found two weeks later having failed to fight off infection. Mr Armstrong added: 'I have never seen anything like that before. Usually when lion hunt buffalo it is as a pride - it is hardly ever alone. 'The fact that the lion was familiar to us and we had seen him in his prime made it very emotional to see him in the state he was in. By the end of the fight everyone was exhausted.' Herd arrives: As the lion prepares to rise, more buffalo arrive with another of the animals delivering a lethal blow to the feline . Beaten: Caked in blood from where he has been gored by the buffalo's horns, the male lion lies beaten on the dusty ground . Fatal wounds: Both animals died as a result of the clash.

"It didn't get him tossed out of the game like a flagrant 2 foul would have, but Brooklyn Nets center Mason Plumlee committed the mother of all party fouls on Saturday night in Washington D.C. During his team's 114-77 loss to the Washington Wizards at the Verizon Center, the 6' 10' Plumlee, 24, barreled into courtside waitress Deila Barr while he was chasing down a loose ball. The collision sent the tray of drinks Barr was holding flying and left her drenched in beer and booze. Scroll down for video . Brooklyn Nets center Mason Plumlee bumped into courtside waitress Deila Barr at the Verizon Center in D.C. Barr, 26, became the center of attention after the crash with Plumlee and was featured on ESPN's Sportcenter . The waitress said she thinks her tray contained four Bud Lights, a winter ale, a gin and tonic and a Chardonnay . The soaked server, who did her best to hold on to the tray, said she thinks she was carrying four Bud Lights, a winter ale, a gin and tonic and a Chardonnay, the Washington Post reported. Barr, 26, said: 'I just kind of see a ball coming towards me, and you can see me kind of kicking it out of the way so I don't trip. 'Then all of a sudden, I just see this giant white mass coming toward me.' After the collision, the game was stopped for a number of minutes so the mess could be cleaned up and the ball could be dried off. Fans who got soaked were given bags of Wizards swag and Barr got a new shirt to replace the one she was wearing. Spectator Scott Jenkins said: 'They brought me a bunch of shirts. 'They took care of me. The Wizards did it right.' Jenkins added he smelled like 'lite' beer that he hadn't ordered. Barr was left drenched and her tray was nearly empty after the crash (left). The ball (right) was soaked as well . Barr has been a courtside server for almost 18 months and also works at the US House of Representatives . Barr, a former college athlete played softball and field hockey at Division III Drew University, mostly roots for Philadelphia teams. Based on the way Plumlee acted after the accident, Barr won't be switching her allegiance to Brooklyn or Duke University anytime soon. She said: 'He kind of was a little brat about it; he threw his arms up in the air and stormed off. 'I'm sorry. I didn't know that impacted your life so much. 'But he played at Duke, so what do you expect?' Barr began working on the Small Business Committee at the US House of Representatives last month, according to her LinkedIn page. She has been a courtside server for Levy Restaurants for almost 18 months. During her time working at Washington Wizards games, Barr has 'initiated and maintained relationships with season ticket holders to enhance their experience.' Thanks to Plumlee, that experience enhancement now includes being doused with beer. Fans who were sitting courtside and got wet during the crash were given bags of Washington Wizards swag .

"The trustee liquidating Bernard Madoff's firm on Monday said he is distributing another $355.8 million to the swindler's victims, bringing the total payout to more than $7.2 billion. Irving Picard, the trustee, said the payout began on February 6, and covers claims by fraud victims with 1,077 accounts at the former Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Claimants will receive between $431 to $67.1 million. Most of the payout comes from November settlements with the Herald, Primeo and Senator 'feeder funds,' which Picard accused of sending customer money to Madoff to further his multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Madoff, 76, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty to running a decades-long fraud that was uncovered in December 2008 . The trustee said claimants on 1,160, or 52per cent, of the 2,216 accounts where he found valid claims have been fully paid. Madoff, 76, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty to running a decades-long fraud that was uncovered in December 2008. The $7.2 billion payout includes $823.7 million advanced by the Securities Investor Protection Corp, which helps liquidate failed brokerages. Picard has recouped roughly $10.55 billion for Madoff victims, or about 60per cent of the estimated $17.5 billion of principal he estimates they lost. Some of that money has been held back because of pending litigation, including by former Madoff customers who challenge Picard's authority to block their competing claims. Leah Larsen, an investor who lost money with Bernard Madoff, addresses members of the Securities Investor Protection Corp in New York in 2011 -  she said she lost $100,000 to Madoff's $64 billion Ponzi scheme . Joe Castellano was another victim involved in the billion-dollar fraud case . Picard has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits against feeder funds, and former customers he has labeled 'net winners' because they took out more from Madoff's firm than they put in. Through September 30, 2014, law firms, consultants and other professionals had billed $1.01 billion in fees and expenses to recoup money for Madoff's victims, court papers show. Federal bankruptcy judges have so far approved more than $601 million of payments, largely comprising fees, to Picard's law firm Baker & Hostetler. Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden oversees a separate $4.05 billion fund to compensate customers and third parties who lost money because of Madoff.","Victims of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme are set to get back another $355.8million from trustee Irving Picard .

"This is the moment Pharrell Williams and his backing dancers made a 'hands up' gesture in the middle of their Grammy performance. The artist took to the stage to perform his track Happy during music's biggest awards ceremony. While viewers concentrated on his bizarre bellhop costume the music paused for a moment during the song- allowing the performers to raise their hands in unison. It took place during a successful evening for Williams - who took home Best Solo Performance and Best Video for the track. Symbolic: This is the moment Pharrell Williams and his hooded backing dancers made a 'hands up' gesture in the middle of their Grammy performance. Missable: While viewers concentrated on his bizarre bellhop costume the music paused for a moment during the song- allowing the performers to raise their hands in unison . The gesture is the same used that has recently been used demonstrates protesting the death of unarmed black men at the hands of police. The use of hoods was used after the death of Trayvon Martin, who was shot and killed by George Zimmerman in 2012. However the 'hands up'' refers to Michael Brown, who was gunned down by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, last year. Some accounts of the deadly incident claimed the unarmed black teenager had his hands up when the cop shot him. A movement which followed adopted the slogan 'Black Lives Matter' and has been used by various celebrities during high profile events and awards ceremonies. Prince was one of the stars who used the phrase during the ceremony. Before presenting the award for best album, he said: 'Albums... remember those? Albums still matter. Like books and black lives, albums still matter.' Successful evening: Williams won Best Solo Performance and Best Music Video for Happy during the night .

"A Texas teenager has been fired from her job at a pizza parlor before she even started after she sent out a tweet complaining about the gig and her new boss saw it. In a hilarious Twitter exchange, a twitter user who goes by 'Cella' wrote: 'Ew I start this f*** a** job tomorrow.' The next morning, Robert Waple - the owner of Jet's Pizza in Mansfield, Texas - tweeted at her: 'And....no you don't start that FA job today! I just fired you! Good luck with your no money, no job life!' He was moved to tweet for only the second time since he started the account in 2009. Twitter user Cella sent out this tweet on Friday night before she was due to start a new job . Justice: Robert Waple - the owner of Jet's Pizza, who hired Cella - fired back and sacked her after seeing the dismissive, vulgar tweet . The exchange became an instant hit online. Mr Waple's tweet has been retweeted 3,800 times and favorited more than 4,200. Mr Waple said that one of Cella's future co-workers told him about the tweet and he had to log on to check it out himself. After firing Cella, several former employees chimed in to comfort her to say that working at Jet's Pizza wasn't all that great, anyway. One said it was the worst job he ever had. One Twitter user told Mr Waple: 'Just thought you should know I was stoned out of my mind every time I went into work, and your pizza sucks.' He replied: 'Being high would only partly explain how you could deliver a pizza to the wrong house...multiple times. You have no hockey skills.' Cella (left) was hired by Robert Waple (right), the owner of Jet's Pizza. After firing Cella, he defended his pizza shop against Twitter users who said the restaurant was a bad place to work . Cella didn't seem too broken up about getting fired - but was relishing her new-found internet fame after the Twitter exchange went worldwide . Riding off into the sunset: Mr Waple, who hadn't tweeted since setting up his account in 2009, seemed satisfied with his online work . Jet's Pizza in Mansfield, Texas, was where Cella was supposed to start her job on Saturday . Another Twitter user rose to Cella's defense, saying that the firing was unjustified: '@Cellla_ you were exercising your freedom of speech and never mentioned the company name so you got fired for no reason, contact HR asap.' Cella, who today tweeted about having to go to a court date, seemed to take it all in stride. She tweeted: 'That moment when someone snitched on you trying to get you in trouble but instead accidentally gets you famous.' As for Mr Waple - who joined Twitter in 2009 and hadn't tweeted before the Cella incident - he gracefully excited Twitter. 'Made my point today. I'll check in again in 6 years,' he wrote.","Teen named 'Cella' tweeted disdain about starting a job at a pizza parlor in Texas .

"The innovators behind Google, Facebook and eBay were among the men and women named the biggest American donors for 2014. According to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of top 50 donors, tech tycoons led the pack last year when it came to giving to a good cause. Of the combined $9.8billion given to charity by the top philanthropists, 47 per cent came from leaders in the technology industry - including Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Scroll down for full list . New money: Tech tycoons like WhatsApp founder Jan Koum (pictured) donated more than $4.5billion to charitable causes last year, according to a new ranking of top American donors . Microsoft founder Bill Gates (right) and his wife Melinda (left) took the number one spot on the list for donating $1.5billion to their own foundation . Silicon Valley takeover: The above chart shows how donors from the technology sector made up the most of the combined $9.8billion donations . More popular: Spending on charitable causes went up 27.5 per cent compared to last year, when it increased just 4 per cent . Gates and his wife Melinda took back the top spot on the list for the first time in ten years, with their generous investment of $1.5billion into their own foundation. Also appearing in the top-five donors is founding Facebook president Sean Parker and WhatsApp creator Jan Koum. Koum sold his mobile texting app to Facebook last year for an astonishing $19billion, and just eight months later he donated $556million of his newfound fortune to the Silicon Valley Community Fund. Twelve of the top 50 philanthropists made their fortunes in technology, making their field the most represented on the list. That's a sea change to the previous year when just six of the biggest donors were from Silicon Valley. In the top five: Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson (left) represents some of the more established donors on the list. On the right is Ted Stanley who made his fortune in marketing. He donated $650 million to mental health research last year, inspired by his son's own struggle with bi-polar disorder . 'Like': Sean Parker, one of the founders of Facebook, donated $24million to Stanford University last year to go towards allergy research . Other tech tycoons on the list include GoPro camera founder Nicholas Woodman and his wife Jill ($500million), Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page ($382 and $177million, respectively), eBay founder Pierra Omidyar and his wife Pam ($180million) and SalesForce.com founder Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne ($154million). The new influx of donations from the tech sector could make a huge difference in the charities they patronize,  since experts say they tend to me more active donors. Take Parker for example. Last year he put $550million in a donor-advised fund and almost immediately bequeathed $24million from the sum to Stanford University for allergy research. 'This younger generation is putting their money toward philanthropy now, compared with the older generation like Bill Gates and Paul Allen, who did it later in their careers,' the Chronicle of Philabthropy's Maria DiMento told the San Francisco Chronicle.

"A macabre directory listing the name, rank and decorations of every SS member is going up for auction decades after it was stolen from Nazi officials by a British spy. The 425-page book contains more than 30,000 entries, detailing every fighter in the Nazi Party's paramilitary arm - with feared leader Heinrich Himmler at the top of the list. It was published on December 1, 1938, just months before the start of the Second World War, and was later stolen by a member of Britain's Special Operations Executive. The directory is expected to fetch up to £2,000 when it goes under the hammer next month. Sinister: This SS directory shows every member of the Nazi Party's private army in December 1938 . Stolen: The book was taken from Nazi headquarters by a British officers from the Special Operations Executive . The book is set out like a telephone directory, listing the name of each SS member, their decorations and awards, their division, party number, SS number, date of birth and promotion details. It also contains entries for officers who had died before the book was published, in a tribute to their contribution to the Nazis' twisted cause. The head, or 'Reichsführer', of the SS was Himmler, widely regarded as the architect of the 'Final Solution' which led to the murder of 11million people in concentration camps. Other leading Nazis listed in the directory include Adolf Eichmann, number 6448, who was personably reponsible for the murder of 3million Jews. In 1960, Eichmann was caught in Argentina by Israeli secret service agents and brought back to Israel to be put on trial where he was found guilty and hanged. Leader: The feared SS was set up by Heinrich Himmler, architect of the 'Final Solution' Top: Himmler was listed in the book as 'number one' out of 30,000 members of the organisation . Allies: Himmler, left, is shown with Adolf Hitler, third left, as they observe a parade in 1940 . Reinhard Heydrich, described by Hitler as 'the man with the iron heart', is number 28 in the book, while Auschwitz boss Rudolf Hoess is listed at number 19,202. Many of the most notorious leaders of the Third Reich occupied relatively low positions in the SS hierarchy at the time the directory was published, as they did not achieve their senior positions until later. Hitler does not appear in the book, because he was never a member of the SS despite being leader of the Nazi Party. The directory was taken by an unnamed British spy who was tasked with infiltrating the German high command. He smuggled it back to Britain to be . examined by the intelligence services, and then kept it as a keepsake - . which was only discovered by his family when they were sorting through . his belongings after his death a few years ago. Evil: Adolf Eichmann appears in the book as member number 6448 . Chilling: Reinhard Heydrich, whom Hitler called 'the man with the iron heart', was number 28 . Richard Westwood-Brookes, from Mullock's Auctions in Shropshire, said: 'This book is extremely rare and the story of how it was stolen from under the noses of the Germans is also highly intriguing. 'If you are a researcher of the Third Reich, which many people are, it is worth its weight in gold. It really wouldn't take much for a researcher to trace the people in the book, it could show the missing pieces to someone's puzzle. 'Former members of the SS would have wanted to conceal their identities, but this book will show them for what they once were - this sort of information is priceless in my opinion. 'Most of the men in this book were monsters, people such as Himmler, a man very close to Adolf Hitler, they put people through hell.' The directory will go up for auction on March 18 at Ludlow Racecourse, with an estimate of between £1,000 and £2,000. Founded in 1925, the 'Schutzstaffel', . German for 'protection squad', initially served as Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguards, later becoming one of the most . powerful and feared organisations in all of Nazi Germany. Heinrich Himmler, a militant anti-Semite who was later architect of the 'Final Solution', became head of the SS in 1929 and expanded the group's role and size. Recruits . had to prove their 'racial purity' and were also taught they were the . not only the elite of Nazi Party but also of all humankind. Troops: SS soldiers march in a procession at a convention of the Nazi Party in 1933 . By . the start of the Second World War the SS had more than 250,000 members . and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from . intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps. The . soldiers of the SS committed many atrocities during the war, while the . concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by Theodor Eicke of . the SS. Thousands of SS men . were also drafted to help exterminate the Jews of Eastern Europe, . participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where Jews . from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps. At . the end of the war many leading members of the SS - including Himmler - . committed suicide. Those that were captured were tried at the Nuremburg . war crimes trials.","Book published in 1938 lists 30,000 members of the SS from Himmler down .

"A Moroccan man in France was brutally stabbed to death by a neighbour in front of his wife in what is described as a 'horrible Islamophobic attack'. Mohamed El Makouli was attacked after a 28-year-old man burst into his home in the early hours of Wednesday morning, it has been reported. His 31-year-old wife, Nadia, suffered wounds to her hands as she tried to save her husband before she fled their home in the quiet village of Beaucet, near Avignon, with their child to alert the police. Scroll down for video . Mohamed El Makouli was attacked when a 28-year-old man burst into his home in the early hours of Wednesday. The attacker has been charged with 'murder, attempted murder and possession of drugs' The attacker forced himself through the front door shouting 'I am your god, I am your Islam', before repeatedly stabbing Mr El Makouli, the National Observatory Against Islamophobia said yesterday. He later returned with another knife and attacked the 47-year-old again, this time killing him. An autopsy revealed Mr El Makouli had been stabbed 17 times. The attacker, who has been charged with 'murder, attempted murder and possession of drugs', is reported to have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He has been committed to a psychiatric hospital. It comes just a week after jihadi terrorists stormed the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo  in Paris and killed 12 people, including the editor. A total of 17 people lost their lives in a spree of shootings in the French capital. Abdallah Zakri, president of the Observatory, condemned the killing in Beaucet as 'a horribly Islamophobic attack'. Crackdown: French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira (pictured) said the  government was going to tighten laws against racism and anti-Semitism . And the regional Muslim council said it feared the climate of suspicion and hostility after the terror strikes in Paris last week were having an effect on the 'most fragile of our fellow citizens'. Police in Avignon said claims of Islamophobia would be investigated once they started questioning the attacker. Justice Minister Christiane Taubira said yesterday the French government was going to tighten laws against racism and anti-Semitism. She added she wants to give the authorities powers to block Internet hate sites 'as already happens with ones that carry child pornography'. More than 50 anti-Muslim incidents, including attacks on mosques, have been recorded by the Central Council of Muslims in France since the shootings in Paris last week. A source close to the murder investigation said he did not think it was 'a purely Islamophobic act,' but admitted the events of the past week could have 'stirred up fear and a rise in adrenaline'. He said the alleged attacker was in an incoherent state when he was arrested near the scene. Khaled Idris Bahray, 20, an Eritrean-born Muslim, was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday, Dresden prosecution office has said. His body was discovered the day after 40,000 people joined a weekly march organised by an organisation called 'Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West' (PEGIDA). And on Friday, security was dramatically stepped up for police officers and the Jewish community in Britain  amid fears of a terror attack. Surge: Up to 40,000 people attended a rally with the Anti-Islamic Pegida movement in Dresden, Germany this week. There have been more than 50 anti-Muslim attacks reported in France since the Paris shootings . Intelligence chiefs are worried that Islamist fanatics could try to copy the atrocities in France last week. Fears of similar carnage in the UK intensified on Thursday after commandos in Belgium killed Islamic State fanatics who wanted to behead a policeman or a judge. The plot held chilling echoes of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich.","Mohamed El Makouli was attacked by neighbour who burst into his home .
