"The son of Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara is preparing to launch a motorcycle tour company. Ernesto Guevara has set up La Poderosa Tours, which will begin offering travellers trips around Cuba later this month. The 49-year-old, whose father famously undertook an 8,000-mile motorcycle journey across South America in 1952, will run trips for bikers on two routes across Cuba using Harley-Davidson motorbikes. Ernesto Guevara, the son of Marxist revolutionary Ernesto 'Che' Guevara is preparing to launch a motorcycle tour company. His father famously undertook an 8,000-mile motorcycle journey across South America in 1952, which was immortalised in 2004 film, The Motorcycle Diaries . A lawyer by profession, Ernesto is the son of Che and his second wife Aleida March (above, right) The company has been named after the motorbike that his Argentinian father used on his nine-month journey across South America in 1952. Introducing Mr Guevara, who is a lawyer by profession and the son of Che and his second wife Aleida March, the website states: 'Proud of his people, he always longed to share his experience enjoying the beauty of his country with motorbiking friend who visit the island.

"American Express are trying to retrieve more than $40,000 worth of debt racked up on the credit card of the late radio host Casey Kasem. The broadcast legend died in June at the age of 82 following a long battle with Parkinson's disease. However, according to TMZ, the bank have filed a creditors claim in a bid to get the money back and settle the outstanding fee. The site reported that Kasem would not have been able to use his card a year before his death. American Express are trying to retrieve more than $40,000 worth of debt racked up on the credit card of late broadcasting host Casey Kasem, who died in June at the age of 82 . Mail Online have reached out to American Express for comment. According to the Guidance for Managing Deceased Accounts on their website, customers have to inform the bank of a loved one's death and are still liable for the funds. Even though he died six months ago, Kasem's body is still being kept above ground in Norway as his family await a proper burial. His children, Mike, Kerri and Julie Kasem announced their father's death on social media in June. The message did not include the name of his second wife, Jean Kasem, who had been fighting them in in an ugly court battle over his medical treatment. Kasem was known worldwide as the longtime host of radio program 'American Top 40' and as the voice of cartoon character Shaggy from the Scooby-Doo franchise. In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and that his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. The family of the late disc jockey, who was also the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon series Scooby-Doo, is currently in a legal battle with his widow Jean (pictured) to have his body brought back from Norway . Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia. Earlier this month the site claimed that the late radio icon’s daughter Kerri Kasem has filed documents pleading with a judge to order that Jean, his widow, bring his body back to the US, where they intend to bury him as he wished. The website reports that Casey’s children fear that if the remains are not returned to America soon, they will have decomposed too much. Kerri’s latest attempt to prevent her stepmother from burying Casey in Scandinavia against his wishes comes after she wrote a scathing open letter about Jean to Norwegian government officials. Kerri wrote: ‘As beautiful as your country is, our father has never spoken of any desire to be buried in Norway either to us or to his friends. In fact, it was the opposite. ‘Casey wanted to be buried in his hometown of Los Angeles, California, his home of over 53 years. ‘Do not be fooled into believing his wife, Jean Kasem, who abandoned and isolated him during the last year of his life.’","Broadcast legend died at the age of 82 following suffering from Parkinson's .

"Thousands of workers have been forced to delay their retirement for financial reasons over the last five years, a study shows. Since 2009, it found, 55 per cent of older workers have put back their previous plans to retire, while one in six has had to put off leaving work indefinitely. Charities said the study by Saga debunks the myth of a so-called ‘golden generation’ enjoying their gold-plated pensions and profits from property investments. More than a third of those who delayed leaving their job did so for financial reasons, and one in ten said they were doing it to ‘fund a better retirement’. Nearly a quarter blamed changes to the state pension age . They said low interest rates on savings, combined with a higher state pension age, mean many are having to work for longer. Old age specialists Saga surveyed more than 9,000 workers, mostly aged 50 to 69. One in three said they now expected to keep working later than planned, and one in ten said it would be ‘a lot later’. Only 7 per cent said they had brought forward their plans to retire over the past five years. More than a third of those who delayed leaving their job did so for financial reasons, and one in ten said they were doing it to ‘fund a better retirement’. Nearly a quarter blamed changes to the state pension age. At present, a woman can claim her pension at age 62, while men receive theirs from the age of 65. But under current plans, the age for women will match men at 65 by 2018, then both men and women will rise to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028. Caroline Abrahams, of charity Age UK, said: ‘While many older people really enjoy working and benefit from all the social aspects workplaces have to offer, others who would like to retire are unable to do so. Of those who had deferred their retirement, 44 per cent said they planned to retain their current role and hours, while 40 per cent planned to reduce their hours . ‘Historically low interest rates, spiralling food and fuel costs, combined with a later State pension age, mean that many people looking forward to a well-deserved retirement have had to change their plans and continue working until they feel financially more secure.’ However, the study also found that more than a fifth of those who delayed their retirement did so because they enjoyed working. Of these, 7 per cent said it kept them active. Saga welcomed the figures as a sign that many are now able to work for longer if they want or need to. The default retirement age in the UK was abolished in 2011. Paul Green, of Saga, said: ‘While some older people are continuing in employment for social reasons, others are doing so for financial reasons. ‘Many people approaching what they thought would be their retirement age have found that the impact of the recession has meant that their pensions will no longer provide the income they had hoped to achieve. ‘Rather than compromise on the quality of life in their retirement, they’ve chosen to continue to work, either full or part-time, to boost their income.’ Of those who had deferred their retirement, 44 per cent said they planned to retain their current role and hours, while 40 per cent planned to reduce their hours. Only 4 per cent intended to retrain for another job.","The default retirement age in the UK was abolished in 2011 .

"Florida authorities said Monday that a man who was arrested on three counts of second-degree murder hung his wife from a cord, then beat and shot her. Andy Avalos, 33, is accused of killing his wife, a neighbor and a church pastor. Authorities in Bradenton said the 4-year-old son of Andy and Amber Avalos was at home when the slayings occurred. Andy Avalos, 33, (left) is accused of killing his wife, Amber Avalos (right), a neighbor and a church pastor . Florida authorities said Avalos hung his wife from a cord, then beat and shot her . The 33-year-old Avalos was arrested Saturday at a mobile home park in Bradenton. Officials say he killed his wife and a neighbor, Denise Potter, at his home Thursday. Officials say Avalos then went to the church where his wife worked. He first spoke with Joy Battle, the church pastor's wife, who is the office secretary. Battle said Avalos 'was rambling on about how the world was evil,' according to the report. Avalos was believed to have developed a strong paranoia about his relationship and had begun suspecting every man that walked pass his wife . Detectives were called to Bayshore Baptist Church on Thursday where they found the body of Mr Battle sparking a manhunt for Avalos . Battle's husband, Pastor James 'Tripp' Battle, approached the office and that's when Avalos shot him in the courtyard, the arrest report said. Battle's wife saw him fall to the ground. The motive for the shootings is unclear, said Manatee Sheriff's officials. Assistant State Attorney Art Brown said during Avalos' first appearance in court on Sunday that Avalos admitted to killing the three people. Brown said Monday that his office will review the charges filed by the Sheriff's office. 'The facts will be reviewed by us and we will be making a determination to the appropriate degree of the offense,' Brown said, adding that if the office feels there is enough evidence, the charges could change to first-degree murder, which would have to be presented to a grand jury. Family: Mr Battle and his wife, Joy, (pictured) who is the church's secretary, have a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son . Avalos is being held in the Manatee County Jail without bond and has requested a public defender. The victims leave behind a total of 10 children; the Avaloses have six children, Potter had two and the Battles also had two. The pastor is believed to have counselled the suspect while he was having problems with his marriage. Mr Battle's father Jimmy told the Tampa Bay Times that he believed Avalos was paranoid and began suspecting every man that walked pass his wife. Sheriff Brad Steube said Battle and Avalos met face-to-face in the church courtyard shortly before the shooting. 'The pastor saw this coming, they were facing each other' he told the newspaper. Leslie Howell, who had been renting the home out to the family for the last three years, said she had vague suspicions the couple were having problems because of the poor condition of the home. Killed: Police also found the body of 45-year-old Denise Potter, who lived next to the suspect and his wife . One of Amber Avalos' sisters, who lived in the same home with her three children, arrived at the scene shortly after police. She said the couple had been together for more than 20 years but suggested Avalos had substance abuse problems. She said: 'He's crazy, he's psychotic. He takes drugs and he drinks a lot.' Patrick Duff, her partner, said that Mrs Avalos had left her husband a couple of months before but he had returned home. Judy Smith, a friend of the family, told the Sarasota Herald Tribune that Alavos loved his children but was 'sick' and had a lot of problems. As news of the deaths broke, the devastated church community tried to unite and support the families of the victims. 'We have to be strong for Joy,' church member Linda Stewart told the Bradenton Herald. 'I don't know how she will get through this.' E.W 'Karp' Carpenter, a member of the church since the 1950s, told the newspaper that Battle 'was a great pastor,' and that the church's congregation grew from 30 to more than 100 under his stewardship. 'He was 31 years old and would give you shirt off his back,' Carpenter said.","Witnesses say Andy Avalos, 33, became paranoid about his wife's fidelity .

"Ecologists in Russia are demanding police  prosecute a poacher who killed animals then posted gruesome pictures of his 'trophies' on his social network page. Siberian Pavel Gotovchikov - a university physical education teacher - posted more than 50 pictures of animals he had killed, including one in which a dead beaver is stuck to a post with sticky tape. Among more than 50 graphic  photographs is one showing him with a dead beaver stuck to a post with sticky tape. Ecologists in Russia are demanding police prosecute poacher Pavel Gotovchikov who has killed dozens of animals and then posted gruesome pictures of his 'trophies' on his social network page, like the one above . Gotovchikov is pictured with a whooper swan, which he holds by the throat while resting his gun on its back . The hunter proudly holds his catch aloft; many of the animals he killed were shot when hunting is forbidden . Gotovchikov fixed a vodka glass in the beaver's paw while he also holds a glass, evidently toasting the animal's slaughter. Another shows him kissing the corpses of a baby deer and its mother in the boot of his car. Other images provide further proof of Gotovchikov's illegal poaching. The show him with a freshly killed whooper swan, hares, squirrels, buzzards and an elk. The images date back to 2009. Animals rights campaigners have called the images a desecration of the corpses, but despite their anger it is unclear what action - if any - Russian police will take. Alexei Gribkov, chairman of Geblerovskoe Ecological Society in the Altai region, said Gotovchikov's photos were proof that he was hunting illegally. He said: 'For example, he is depicted in some of the pictures with a killed whooper swan. 'Gotovchikov posted on the photo calling the swan a 'northern goose' but there is no such type of bird. In this photo, dated May 2011, Gotovchikov displays a gallery of dead animals while wearing no trousers . The physical education teacher holds a dead hare by its ears; his fingers are bloodied with the kill . 'Apart from the fact that a whooper swan can't be hunted, the poaching is confirmed by the fact that the bird was killed in April at a time banned by local legislation. 'All in all, there are about 50 photos of corpses and parts of corpses posted in Gotovchikov's profile on the Odnoklassniki website. Over 25 photos confirm he was poaching.' Gotovchikov, a resident of the Altai region in western Siberia, is head of the DOSAAF shooting club. He lists his job as a kettleball coach at the Altai State University. Conservationists point to the dates many of the images were taken, or the weather conditions outside, as evidence he has been killing animals illegally and off-season. For instance in the pictures with dead hares, the grass is green and there are still leaves on trees, yet hunting them is banned during the spring and summer months breeding period. The poacher holds the bloodied head of an elk aloft; it is one of about 50 images he posted online . Gotovchikov holds knife to the tail of a dead red squirrel as he looks menacingly at the camera . Gotovchikov, a resident of the Altai region in western Siberia, is head of the DOSAAF shooting club . Poaching a baby deer no older than three months old is likely to break the Russian Federation Criminal Code. Buzzards, grey heron, and whooper swan also can not be hunted, yet Gotovchikov happily poses for pictures with the dead animals, often with his gun in his hands. Mr Gribkov - whose organisation has appealed to the Altai region prosecutor's office and the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs to investigate - said: 'It is a desecration of the corpse, there is no other word for it. 'The culmination of the impiety is the photo depicting Gotovchikov kissing the corpses of a baby and mother roe in the boot of his car.' Mr Gribkov said since raising concerns over the poaching, Gotovchikov's employers have said he no longer works for the university. His current whereabouts are unknown.

"Mobile app developers are collecting vast amounts of data from children online, including a person's location and even recordings of their voice, according to privacy researchers and consumer advocates. A landmark 2013 law aimed at protecting the privacy of America's youngest mobile consumers hasn't stopped the developers, it has been revealed. Whether mobile app developers seek parental consent first — as required by law — or pass the information on to advertisers isn't entirely clear. An attendee pis pictured playing Fruit Ninja at the Panasonic booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas -  apps like this one collects information from the user for advertisers . But if you prefer to stay anonymous, your options are limited: Wade through each mobile app's privacy policies to make sure you are OK with the terms, or stick the phone on 'airplane mode' to shut off the wireless connection and risk losing functionality. 'Kids are such a lucrative market, especially for apps,' said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy. 'Unfortunately, there are still companies out there that are more concerned about generating revenue than protecting the privacy of kids.' Americans have traded vast amounts of personal data in exchange for the ease and functionality of fun mobile applications on their phones. But how is industry using that information? Chester and other consumer advocates allege that fast food chains are increasingly focusing advertising dollars on digital media, targeting blacks and Hispanics. They also warn that data from phones can be combined with offline information like home prices, race or income in ways that could violate fair lending laws. A new site, PrivacyGrade.org, found that many popular kids' apps like Talking Tom and Fruit Ninja collect information in ways parents wouldn't necessarily expect. Concerned in particular about industries' focus on kids online, the Federal Trade Commission in July 2013 expanded the Child Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, to require app developers to get parental consent before collecting personal data on anyone younger than 13. That includes information like the unique identifying device on a phone, a person's phone number or a device's location. 'It's upped the ante for companies deciding whether they are going to market to kids,' said Michelle De Mooy of the Center for Democracy and Technology. 'And that's a good thing.' But with the number of smartphones expected to reach 3.5 billion in the next five years, according to Forrester Research, the mobile app and advertising industry has exploded. Regulators don't have an easy, automated way of analyzing the hundreds of mobile apps popping up each day. Since the updated regulation went into effect, the FTC has brought about only two enforcement actions against mobile apps. Last September, the commission announced that Yelp Inc. agreed to pay $450,000 and TinyCo. $300,000 to settle separate charges that their companies knowingly collected information on young children through their mobile apps. 'Our ultimate goal is compliance,' said Kandi Parsons, an attorney in the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. But 'that doesn't undermine our desire to bring cases against companies that violate COPPA ... where we find violations, we will bring cases against mobile apps.' According to PrivacyGrade.org, which is run by computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University, scores of apps that collect information are still aimed at kids. For example, Fruit Ninja collects a phone's location, which could be passed on to advertisers. And Talking Tom, where kids can talk to and 'tickle' an alley cat using the touch screen, collects a child's audio recordings along with other information that can uniquely identify a phone. Whether these apps would violate COPPA would depend on a number of factors, including whether and how they seek parental consent. But because these apps collect information in surprising ways, PrivacyGrade.org gave them both D grades. Outfit7, the developer behind Talking Tom, said in a statement that personal information and recordings are never shared with advertisers. The developer says its app also complies with COPPA by providing 'appropriate gate protections ... to distinguish adults from minors and restrict sharing on social media,' according to the statement. Halfbrick Studios, which developed Fruit Ninja, said in a statement that it planned to release updates to Fruit Ninja and other apps to increase privacy protections. 'Parents and players are understandably cautious about the privacy aspects of online games, and the way their data is handled,' said company CEO Shainiel Deo. 'Creating a safe and secure app is no longer enough to answer consumers' needs for assurance. Developers must also ensure that permissions are clearly explained and easy to access at every applicable point in a game.'","Many game apps aimed at children are collecting data from children for advertisers .

"It's her first official visit abroad since announcing her pregnancy. And a protective Prince William made sure he was alongside Kate every step of the way as the royal couple arrived in a chilly New York on their highly anticipated trip to the US. Never more than a foot away from her side, an attentive Duke of Cambridge kept an arm almost constantly on the small of Kate's back, guiding her through the crowds. Scroll down for video . Flattered: Kate and William beamed at the waiting crowds as William kept an arm firmly on Kate's waist . Welcome! Prince William carefully ushered Kate into the Carlyle Hotel at 5.46pm on Sunday night . Embrace: Kate's pregnant tummy was visible in her deep purple coat as William put his arm around her . Judi James, a body language expert, reveals that as well as a gesture of concern and chivalry, the prince's actions show he is 'pretty pleased with himself', showing 'protective alpha signalling'. She told MailOnline: 'Impending fatherhood has a habit of making subtle changes to a guy's body language, and with his second child on the way William is no exception. 'There's a strong whiff of protective alpha signaling here, with his chest pat and hand-rubbing suggesting he's pretty pleased with himself right now, and he takes the role of the ""advanced party"" in these poses, climbing out of the car first and rushing off to meet and greet while Kate catches up in his wake. 'When they connect though there is a raft of mutual signals that are new to the couple's repertoire. William's arm is placed protectively around his wife's waist but she mirrors the gesture, forming a bonded pose that is more Hollywood red carpet than rather more formal UK royals. 'He face-checks her to read her emotions and his suppressed smile suggests pride as well as affection. Kate looks anything but fragile with a confident smile and walk but William still seems keen to play the more traditional protective role, especially now they are on tour abroad.' They've arrived! William and Kate stepped out of their SUV to screaming crowds at New York's Carlyle Hotel . 'It's good to be here': William gushed to door staff as he walked into the hotel hand-in-hand with Kate . Start of a jam-packed few days: The smiling couple will fit in a number of care center visits and dinners . Invited: Guests arrive to the lavish dinner hosted by Martin Sorrell the Prince William and Kate attended last night . Guests: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived in New York City on Sunday, their first official visit to the U.S. since a 2011 trip to California . Hottest ticket in town: William and Kate, who are expecting their second child in April, have scheduled a full slate of events in New York, including a visit to the National Sept. 11 Memorial and Museum and a basketball game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Cleveland Cavaliers . Exclusive: Their visit also will include some events with other high-profile guests. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton are accompanying William and Kate to a New York reception highlighting conservation efforts . Exiting their blacked-out SUV at the exclusive Carlyle Hotel on Sunday, the 32-year-old Duchess showed little sign of the illness that blighted her first weeks of pregnancy. Now at five months, and proudly displaying a small but noticeable bump, Kate looked glowing as she smiled warmly at the waiting fans. But despite her seeming good health, William clearly is still concerned over her wellbeing. As well as shadowing Kate into their hotel, where they will stay for their two day visit, William continued to remain close to Kate when they couple stepped out hours later to attend a private dinner. Once again the prince kept his arm firmly round Kate's waist as they descended the steps of the hotel surrounded by their security. The ‘private’ event, which is expected to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for the couple’s charitable foundation, is being held at the cavernous Manhattan apartment of British media and marketing mogul Sir Martin Sorrell, whose personal fortune is estimated at £174million. But this whirlwind evening looks set to set the pace for the couple's jam-packed two days in New York. And it may be the rather frenzied nature of the visit which has William concerned for his wife. Kate's reported desire to join him in a climb the Empire State Building today has no doubt increased the Prince's worries, but Kate seems determined not to let her second pregnancy slow her down. Taking care: The Duke of Cambridge put a loving arm around his wife who is due to give birth in April . Royal blue: Wills made quite the fashion statement among black suits in a deep blue number . Private: Just thirty hedge fund managers and financiers were invited to dine, starting with cocktails at 6.30pm .","Royal couple on whirlwind two-day visit to New York .

"Three months after a Rutgers University student was mauled to death by a 302-pound bear, the state's final of five scheduled bear hunts is set for this week. State wildlife officials and activists disagree over whether the hunts are needed to control the bruin population or are an inhumane practice that doesn't address public safety. While the overall numbers of bears in the state has decreased since the state instituted the hunt in 2010, some point to Darsh Patel's death as evidence that there is too much focus on killing the animals and not enough on educating the public about how to handle interactions with them. 'The fact that we had a person killed despite having a hunt shows it is not working,' said Jeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club in New Jersey. Controversial: Kim Tinnes, with New Jersey's Division of Fish and Wildlife, weighs a 346 pound male bear on the first day of the last of New Jersey's five state-sponsored bear hunts . Second-year Rutgers University student Darsh Patel, 22,  (left) was mauled to death by a bear in September. Police revealed that he took pictures of the animal as it approached (right) Tensions: Mike Donahue, of Stanhope, New Jersey, stands next to the corpse. Wildlife officials and opponents of the hunt sparred over whether the hunt has been effective and should be renewed . Patel was hiking in the Apshawa Preserve with four friends when they noticed a 300-pound black bear following them. The group scattered, and Patel's friends, who were not injured, called police when they realized he was missing. Tittel said non-lethal methods such as aversion therapy to make bears afraid of people and teaching people how to bear-proof houses and yards are effective. He also stressed the need for warning signs: there were no signs notifying hikers that bears reside in the area of the Apshawa Preserve or lists of do's and don'ts about bear confrontations. Photos released by police show Patel took pictures of the bear with his cellphone before being attacked. About 1,600 bears have been killed in the last four hunts, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. In 2010, there were 3,400 bears living north of Interstate 80, roughly in the upper one-eighth of the state, according to a state Fish and Game Council report that supported the resumption of the bear hunt, in part to ensure public safety. The DEP estimates there are about 2,500 bears in that area now. Only 251 bears were killed last year, a nearly 60 percent drop from the 592 killed in 2010. Freezing rain and bad weather hampered hunters on the first day of the hunt. Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the DEP may recommend holding future hunts earlier in the fall to avoid potentially disruptive weather, and extending the length of the hunt. Deaths: About 1,600 bears have been killed in the last four hunts, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection . Only 251 bears were killed last year, a nearly 60 percent drop from the 592 killed in 2010. Freezing rain and bad weather hampered hunters on the first day of the hunt . 'As a general rule we have slowed the population, but that doesn't mean we are done,' he said. 'We need to make sure we're managing the population on more of a statewide level. The hunt is effective, but it isn't effective as it could be.' The number of reports of aggressive bears has dropped, but with some caveats. Reports of Category 1 bears, defined as bruins that are aggressive and a danger to humans or livestock, fell from 235 in 2010 to 129 in 2013. While home entries and attempted entries fell from 90 in 2010 to 33 last year, they have risen to 44 through late November. In addition, reports of bears killing livestock rose from 21 to 35 between 2012 and 2013. That could bolster Burguess' contention that while the bear population is falling in the more heavily forested areas in western and northwestern New Jersey, bears may be proliferating in areas where hunting is prohibited or restricted, such as in some state parks or nature conservancies that border residential areas. Carried away: A truck with a dead bear leaves a bear hunt check-in station at the Whittingham Wildlife Management Area . Watching: As he waits at a check-in station, Marc Beardslee looks at the 134-pound female bear that he killed at around 7:30am on the first day of the hunt. Bears have been seen in all 21 New Jersey counties . The Fish and Game Council report in 2010 concluded that efforts to educate people about bear-proofing their garbage systems had been effective, as inspections of 4,600 residential properties had found 98 percent in compliance with bear management guidelines. It noted, though, that 'the expense of bear-resistant garbage cans and commercial containers has hampered their widespread use.' Bears have been seen in all 21 New Jersey counties, according to the DEP. The hunts draw animal rights protesters, who have called for the state to ban allowing hunters from baiting bears. Angi Metler, executive director of the Animal Protection League of New Jersey, said at a statehouse rally Thursday that baiting is inhumane and counterproductive because it changes the animals' natural foraging patterns and attracts them to other human food supplies. She and others at the rally called on lawmakers to support a bill that would ban baiting and require other 'bear smart' measures, such as bear-proof trash containers and bans on birdseed in areas populated by bears.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"Celebrities take them to show off their lavish lifestyles and normal people use them to document their movements on social media sites. But experts have linked selfies with mental illness and have suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle from which to portray themselves could in some cases be ill. One leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take a lot of selfies. Obsessed with selfies? Experts have linked selfies with mental illness and have suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle could in some cases be suffering from a confidence-related mental health condition . Dr David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust and The Priory Hospital, told The Sunday Mirror: ‘Two out of three of all the patients who come to see me with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) since the rise of camera phones have a compulsion to repeatedly take and post selfies on social media sites.’ He told MailOnline: ‘Taking selfies is not an addiction - it’s a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) that involves checking one’s appearance.’ Cognitive behavioural therapy is often used to help patients moderate their obsessive behaviour relating to their appearance. Sufferers of BDD can spend hours trying to take pictures that do not show any defects or flaws in their appearance, which they are very aware of but which might be unnoticeable to others. One expert said: 'Taking Selfies is not an addition - it's a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder that involves checking one's appearance (illustrated by stock image) In one extreme case of the disorder, a British teenager Danny Bowman tried to commit suicide because he was unsatisfied with his appearance in the selfies he took. He was so desperate to attract girls, he spent 10 hours a day taking more than 200 selfies trying to find the perfect image, but his habit, which began at the age of 15, caused him to drop out of school and lose almost two stone in weight. He did not leave his house in Newcastle-upon-Tyne for six months, and when he failed to take a flawless shot, he tried to kill himself by taking an overdose. His mother, Penny, managed to save him, but he was forced to seek medical help after his habit had spiralled out of control. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'I was constantly in search of taking the perfect selfie and when I realised I couldn’t, I wanted to die. ‘I lost my friends, my education, my health and almost my life. The only thing I cared about was having my phone with me so I could satisfy the urge to capture a picture of myself at any time of the day.' In an article for Psychology Today, . Dr Pamela Rutledge, Director of the Media Psychology Research Centre in . Boston Massachusetts, said: ‘Selfies frequently trigger perceptions of . self-indulgence or attention seeking social dependence that raises the . 'damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you-don’t' spectre of either narcissism or . very low self-esteem.' BDD . is characterised by a preoccupation with one or more perceived flaws in . appearance, which are unnoticeable to others, according to the BDD Foundation. As well as the excessive self-consciousness, individuals with BDD often feel defined by their flaw. They . often experience an image of their perceived defect associated with . memories, emotions and bodily sensations – as if seeing the flaw through . the eyes of an onlooker, even though what they ‘see’ may be very . different to their appearance observed by others. Sufferers . tend repeatedly to check on how bad their flaw is  - for example in . mirrors and reflective surfaces -  attempt to camouflage or alter the . perceived defect and avoid public or social situations or triggers that . increase distress. People . with BDD can find themselves housebound or seek out needless cosmetic . surgery. They are also at an increased risk of suicide. ‘Preoccupation with selfies can be a visible indicator of a young person with a lack of confidence or sense of self that might make him or her a victim of other problems as well.’ She believes that excessive or provocative taking of selfies is a form of ‘acting out’ in young people and can be a cry for help.","One psychologist from The Priory, London, said that talking lots of selfies is not an addiction, but a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD)

"A quick end: Charles Saatchi pictured  in London on Friday, is said to want a swift divorce . Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi . will be divorced within weeks after reaching a swift agreement to avoid . airing their dirty laundry in public, it emerged yesterday. Documents were lodged with the High . Court last week after the couple – estimated to be worth £150million – . negotiated a settlement through Miss Lawson’s lawyer, Fiona Shackleton. Experts said yesterday it is likely that a pre-nuptial agreement was signed when they wed in 2003. Although the pair, who shared a . £12million Chelsea home, have agreed never to publicly disclose the . terms of the divorce or financial settlements, it is understood Mr . Saatchi dispensed with lawyers to deal directly with Miss Shackleton in . an attempt to keep his multi-million-pound art collection intact. Yesterday, friends of Mr Saatchi said: . ‘He and Nigella agreed – via Fiona Shackleton – to a speedy divorce. Fiona Shackleton is Nigella’s first cousin and Charles highly respects . her. ‘He did not hire a lawyer himself and he has not even spoken to Helen Ward, whom a Sunday paper claimed he has hired. ‘Fiona prepared a full court document, every detail of every asset was listed, and an agreement was reached with no dispute. ‘They have agreed never to make public . the terms of the divorce or financial settlements. Fiona lodged the . divorce document with the court last Friday.’ Baroness Shackleton, who advised the . Prince of Wales in his divorce and represented Sir Paul McCartney, has . been nicknamed the Steel Magnolia for her charm and determination. Miss Lawson’s marriage to Mr Saatchi . unravelled five weeks ago when he was photographed grabbing her throat. The former advertising tycoon initially brushed off the incident as . nothing more than a ‘playful tiff’, but further images revealed Miss . Lawson suffered 27 minutes of anguish and had her nose repeatedly . tweaked and twisted by Mr Saatchi. At one point he even put his finger up her nose as they dined outside Scott’s restaurant in London. Anguish: Nigella is said to have been 'floored and blindsided' by the Saatchi's wish to end their ten-year marriage . Mr Saatchi later accepted a police . caution for assault. Friends say Miss Lawson, 53, was willing right up . until the end to give their marriage another chance and was left . ‘floored’ and ‘blindsided’ by his decision to begin divorce proceedings . against her. They were reportedly arguing over Miss . Lawson’s son Bruno and daughter Cosima from her marriage to journalist . John Diamond, who died in 2001 from throat cancer. Just days ago Mr Saatchi appeared to . blame Miss Lawson for the end of the marriage, claiming he decided to . divorce her after she refused to defend him in public. He also alleged that she had held him by the throat during arguments at home. Jenny Beck, director of family law at . Co-operative Legal Services, said last night: ‘It is also likely that . they will have signed a pre-nuptial agreement as they both came into the . marriage with considerable assets and with family. ‘They may have dusted that off and used it as a basis to help them come to a mutually acceptable financial agreement. ‘Because of the nature of the . allegations they will be compromising a little more. The grounds for . divorce will be the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Broken marriage: Charles Saatchi and Nigella are pictured at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair where the devastating photographs were taken . ‘In this case I think they may have agreed the basis for divorce and agreed the wording between them. ‘It is usual for the division of . financial assets and the divorce to be done together and for the process . to be concluded within months.’ Mr Saatchi’s millions were amassed from . the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, which he founded with his . brother Maurice, now Lord Saatchi, and various astute business deals. He has traded art over the years, . making large profits on works by Damien Hirst and other British artists. His collection is reported to be worth £200million. The Saatchi Gallery, which Mr Saatchi . opened in 1985, has included some of the UK’s most controversial and . talked-about artworks. The current exhibition includes work . from Jessica Jackson Hutchins, who makes papier-maché sculptures of . household objects, and a piece by Jose Lerma and Hector Madera of a . giant bust of a man made from paper. Mr Saatchi also famously bought Tracey . Emin’s work My Bed for £150,000, for which he got an unmade bed . littered with condoms, cigarette packets and underwear.

"A three-year-old boy fell into his grandparents' swimming pool and drowned after he was left unsupervised for 10 minutes, an inquest has heard. When Alfie Hayward disappeared while playing outside, his mother Lauren Pither thought he was just hiding in order to jump out and surprise her. But she found him face down in the 6ft-deep pool, and although he was rushed to hospital doctors were unable to save his life. Drowned: Alfie Hayward was found dead in his grandparents' swimming pool in August 2012 . After a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, police had to separate Alfie's father Kenny Hayward from Ms Pither's relatives as the bereaved family's emotions boiled over. The inquest in Chelmsford, Essex heard that the boy lived with his mother in Colchester. Ms Pither said that on August 18, 2012 she went with Alfie to her parents' house in Ardleigh on the way to Great Yarmouth for a camping holiday. She went into the house with her sister, while her parents left to pick up a camper van and Alfie played in the front yard. 'I told him to stay in the front, I did not want him going around the back,' she told the inquest. However, when she came back out the boy had disappeared. 'We started looking for Alfie, he was missing 10 minutes at most,' Ms Pither said. 'He had gone around the back.' Family: Alfie, who was just three years old when he died, pictured with his father Kenny Hayward . She thought he might be hiding behind a bush in order to jump out at her, which he had done previously, but then found him face down in the swimming pool. There was also a chair, a rock and a rubber ring in the pool, leading Ms Pither to believe that her son had climbed on the chair to throw the rock in before falling into the water. 'It is what I know my son would do,' she told the hearing, adding that she could not have seen the pool from her parents' house. Alfie was taken to Colchester General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, and a post-mortem examination found that he had died from immersion. Insp Lynne Corder, from Essex Police, told the inquest there were no suspicious circumstances. Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: 'It was a tragic accident - I am sure you are all going over and over it in your minds and saying ""What if?"" 'He was probably a lovely little boy with a bright future ahead of him, and I would like to express the court's condolences to all of you.'","Three-year-old Alfie Hayward was on a weekend away with his mother .

"Dr Luke has filed a defamation lawsuit against Kesha's lawyer Mark Geragos after the attorney accused the music producer of raping Lady Gaga. The Grammy-award nominated music whiz, real name Lukasz Gottwald, called the claims - which were also immediately denied by Gaga's representative - an 'outrageous' lie. Geragos, who is representing Kesha in her sexual assault lawsuit against Dr Luke, made the allegations via Twitter after the singer told Howard Stern that she was raped by an older music producer at the age of 19. Defamation: Mark Geragos, who is representing Kesha, alleged that Dr Luke raped Lady Gaga on his Twitter page last week . Back then: Dr Luke and Kesha pictured in 2011, three years before she filed a sexual assault lawsuit against him . He tweeted: 'Guess who the rapist was?' And when a fan asked if it was Dr Luke, he responded '#bingo.' However, Dr Luke describes Geragos's comments as 'maliciously false' in court documents, according to TMZ. He adds that he had not met Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, at the time of the alleged rape nine years ago, and has never 'been alone with her or touched her.' Indeed Geragos's tweets were also firmly denied by Gaga's camp. Her representative told TMZ, the allegations are 'absolutely not true' although refused to comment on the identity of the attacker. Her spokesman later added: 'The Dr. Luke lawsuit is utterly incomprehensible. This simply isn't true and how dare someone take advantage of such a sensitive matter.' At the time, Mr Geragos stood by his claims, telling TMZ: 'I said it because it's true'. He mentioned the allegations against Bill Cosby have 'now made others more courageous about coming out.' The attorney also said he wants to depose Gaga in Kesha's lawsuit against Dr Luke, also telling TMZ that three other women 'not as famous'  claim to have similar experiences to Kesha and will be deposed as well. Back in October, Kesha filed a lawsuit for sexual assault and battery against Dr Luke - Since then, Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert has countersued Dr. Luke, claiming she suffered emotional distress and post traumatic stress disorder after the music producer allegedly raped her daughter. Denial: Lady Gaga, pictured last week in New York, has denied that the man who raped her was Dr Luke . In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Sebert, 58, alleges Dr. Luke raped pop star Kesha, 27, in a way 'as not to be tolerated in a civilized society,' echoing her daughter's claims that the mogul drugged and abused her. Dr. Luke, 41, has denied the claims made by the pair, and himself filed a lawsuit against Sebert in October claiming she orchestrated her daughter's rape claims against him to get the singer out of her recording contract. Meanwhile, Gaga found herself embroiled in the story after telling Howard Stern she was raped by a producer 20 years her senior, adding she 'went through some horrific things' when she was 19 and relied on 'a lot of mental and physical therapy' to help her to heal. Opening up: Gaga was interviewed by Howard Stern last week . When asked about the rape she said: 'I went through some horrific things that I'm able to laugh [at] now, because I've gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy and emotional therapy to heal over the years. 'My music's been wonderful for me. But, you know, I was a shell of my former self at one point. I was not myself. 'To be fair, I was about 19. I went to Catholic school and then all this crazy stuff happened, and I was going, ""Oh, is this just the way adults are?'...I was very naive.""' Asked if she had ever confronted the rapist, who was 20 years older than her, she said: 'I think it would terrify me. It would paralyse me. As she was: Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, on an MTV show back in 2005, when she would have been about 19 - it was around this time that she was attacked . 'I saw him one time in a store and I was so paralysed by fear. Because it wasn't until I was a little bit older that I went, ""Wow, that was really messed up.""'# . The blonde beauty, who is dating actor Taylor Kinney, didn't tell anybody about the incident at the time, but eventually decided to seek help. She said: 'I don't know what I was thinking. I didn't tell anybody. 'And I didn't even tell myself for the longest time. And then I was like, ""You know what? All this drinking and all this nonsense, you have to go to the source, otherwise it just won't go away. It will not go away.""'","Geragos is representing Kesha in her sexual assault lawsuit against Dr Luke .

"Billions of years ago, a lake once filled the 96-mile- (154-km) wide crater being explored by NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity, bolstering evidence that the planet most like Earth in the solar system was suitable for microbial life. The new findings combine more than two years of data collected by the rover since its sky-crane landing inside Gale Crater in August 2012. Scientists discovered stacks of rocks containing water-deposited sediments inclined toward the crater’s center, which now sports a three-mile (5 km) mound called Mount Sharp. Scroll down for video . How Mars once looked: This series of images reconstructs the geology of the region around Mars' Mount Sharp, where NASA's Curiosity Mars rover landed and is now driving. The images, taken on Earth, have been altered for the illustration. A dry period is shown at left, during which rocks in the mountains weather away, creating sediment that is transported down the once-wet river system. The middle panel shows a wet period, where water is flowing. Sediments are transported, building up the fan, delta, and lake floor. In the subsequent dry period shown at right, the water is gone. The exposed fan and lake floor are now at higher elevations due to the transport of sediment. Mount Sharp stands about 3 miles (5 kilometers) tall, its lower flanks exposing hundreds of rock layers. The rock layers – alternating between lake, river and wind deposits -- bear witness to the repeated filling and evaporation of a Martian lake much larger and longer-lasting than any previously examined close-up. Curiosity currently is investigating the lowest sedimentary layers of Mount Sharp, a section of rock 500 feet (150 meters) high dubbed the Murray formation. That would mean that Mount Sharp didn’t exist during a period of time roughly 3.5 billion years ago when the crater was filled with water, Curiosity researchers told reporters during a conference call. Mars was also once an entirely wet and warm planet, with giant, long lasting lakes forming across its surface, the latest data from Nasa's Curiosity rover has shown. This interpretation of Curiosity's finds in Gale Crater suggests ancient Mars maintained a climate that could have produced long-lasting lakes at many locations on the Red Planet. 'If our hypothesis for Mount Sharp holds up, it challenges the notion that warm and wet conditions were transient, local, or only underground on Mars,' said Ashwin Vasavada, Curiosity deputy project scientist at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 'A more radical explanation is that Mars' ancient, thicker atmosphere raised temperatures above freezing globally, but so far we don't know how the atmosphere did that.' Researchers were baffled over why Mount Sharp sits in a crater. Mount Sharp stands about 3 miles (5 kilometers) tall, its lower flanks exposing hundreds of rock layers. The rock layers - alternating between lake, river and wind deposits - bear witness to the repeated filling and evaporation of a Martian lake much larger and longer-lasting than any previously examined close-up. 'We are making headway in solving the mystery of Mount Sharp,' said Curiosity Project Scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. 'Where there's now a mountain, there may have once been a series of lakes.' Gale Crater on the planet Mars as it is today. Gale Crater is 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter, and at its centre Mount Sharp stands about 3 miles (5 kilometers) tall. Mount Sharp as it once was: Observations by the rover indicate Mars' Mount Sharp, where it is currently exploring, was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years. Curiosity currently is investigating the lowest sedimentary layers of Mount Sharp, a section of rock 500 feet (150 meters) high dubbed the Murray formation. Rivers carried sand and silt to the lake, depositing the sediments at the mouth of the river to form deltas similar to those found at river mouths on Earth. This cycle occurred over and over again. 'The great thing about a lake that occurs repeatedly, over and over, is that each time it comes back it is another experiment to tell you how the environment works,' Grotzinger said. 'As Curiosity climbs higher on Mount Sharp, we will have a series of experiments to show patterns in how the atmosphere and the water and the sediments interact. 'We may see how the chemistry changed in the lakes over time. This evenly layered rock photographed by the Mast Camera (Mastcam) on NASA's Curiosity Mars Rover shows a pattern typical of a lake-floor sedimentary deposit not far from where flowing water entered a lake. Mount Sharp compared to mountains on Earth: The elevation of Mount Sharp is given in kilometers relative to the floor of Gale Crater. The heights of Mount Rainier, Mount McKinley and Mount Everest are given in kilometers relative to Earth's sea level. After the crater filled to a height of at least a few hundred yards and the sediments hardened into rock, the accumulated layers of sediment were sculpted over time into a mountainous shape by wind erosion that carved away the material between the crater perimeter and what is now the edge of the mountain. 'This is a hypothesis supported by what we have observed so far, providing a framework for testing in the coming year.' After the crater filled to a height of at least a few hundred yards and the sediments hardened into rock, the accumulated layers of sediment were sculpted over time into a mountainous shape by wind erosion that carved away the material between the crater perimeter and what is now the edge of the mountain. On the 5-mile (8-kilometer) journey from Curiosity's 2012 landing site to its current work site at the base of Mount Sharp, the rover uncovered clues about the changing shape of the crater floor during the era of lakes. 'The size of the lake in Gale Crater and the length of time and series that water was showing up implies that there may have been sufficient time for life to get going and thrive,' said NASA's Mars Exploration Program scientist Michael Meyer. 'We found sedimentary rocks suggestive of small, ancient deltas stacked on top of one another,' said Curiosity science team member Sanjeev Gupta of Imperial College in London. 'Curiosity crossed a boundary from an environment dominated by rivers to an environment dominated by lakes.' Despite earlier evidence from several Mars missions that pointed to wet environments on ancient Mars, modeling of the ancient climate has yet to identify the conditions that could have produced long periods warm enough for stable water on the surface. This image shows an example of a thin-laminated, evenly stratified rock type that occurs in the 'Pahrump Hills' outcrop at the base of Mount Sharp on Mars. The Mastcam on NASA's Curiosity Mars rover acquired this view on Oct. 28, 2014. This type of rock can form under a lake. This image shows inclined beds characteristic of delta deposits where a stream entered a lake, but at a higher elevation and farther south than other delta deposits north of Mount Sharp. This suggests multiple episodes of delta growth building southward. It is from Curiosity's Mastcam. NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Project uses Curiosity to assess ancient, potentially habitable environments and the significant changes the Martian environment has experienced over millions of years. This project is one element of NASA's ongoing Mars research and preparation for a human mission to the planet in the 2030s. 'Knowledge we're gaining about Mars' environmental evolution by deciphering how Mount Sharp formed will also help guide plans for future missions to seek signs of Martian life,' said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at the agency's headquarters in Washington.","Mount Sharp was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years, Curiosity has found .

"It is a war that has been raging since the beginning of agriculture, but now farmers have a new weapon in the battle to keep birds from eating their crops - laser shooting robots. Farmers in Holland have been trialling a new type of scarecrow that fires green laser beams across fields to keep birds away from crops. The system, called Agrilaser, uses an automated robot that can be programmed to sweep lasers at random across areas ranging from 200 acres to more than 3,000 acres. Scroll down for video . Agrilaser, seen here being trialed in an apple orchard in Holland, fires beams of green light at random across fields, tricking birds into thinking there is something moving around the field that may pose a threat to them . Researchers have been developing the robotic scarecrow in an attempt to produce bird repellents that are more socially acceptable than noise based methods that are commonly used. Most farmers combine these loud noises, usually from propane canons or firecrackers,  with traditional scarecrows that mimic the shape of humans, to keep birds away from their crops. It appears the Dutch are at the cutting edge of zany uses for laser technology. Rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen is fitting powerful lasers under two of its trains in a trial to beat the problem of leaves on the line. It is working with researchers at Delft University of Technology to use lasers mounted in front of the train wheels to vapourise leaves that are compacted onto railway tracks to leave a slippery Teflon-like surface. Left untreated this can double stopping distances and make it hard for trains to restart. They have tested the lasers successfully at speeds of up to 50mph and hope it could eventually make the old excuse of leaves on the line for delays  a thing of the past. However, the new device, developed by Dutch bird control researchers at the Centre for Agriculture and Environment, in Culemborg, Holland, chases birds away with no noise. Natural England recently approved handheld versions of the laser and it has been used on farms in Devon and have been used to scare away seagulls in Gloucestershire. The automatic version of the lasers have yet to be used here in the UK. The trajectory of the lasers can be programmed from a laptop and it then makes random sweeps across fields. Tests at an apple and pear orchard saw losses due to birds almost entirely disappear over a three week period, according to Arnold Bosgoed, the farmer who has been trialing the system. He said: 'After the deployment of the laser, the orchard became a lot quieter. The large groups of crows disappeared. 'The system is noiseless and the birds do not seem to get used to the laser beam. The installation was easy and it requires no maintenance.' Depending on the crops, losses due to birds can range between five per cent and 50 per cent of what is planted. The laser is fired from a robotic system mounted on top of a tower to provide maximum coverage of a field . Scary: The random movement of the green laser frightens birds away from crops . The developers of the robotic laser, which looks a little like a CCTV camera and can be mounted on top of a tower to provide maximum coverage. Researchers at the Centre for Agriculture and Environment (CLM) also hope the system can be used to keep birds away airports, where they pose a risk to aircraft, and oil rigs. The laser's trajectory can be programmed using a laptop to ensure it says within field boundaries . Gijs Kuneman, director of CLM, said: 'The damage caused in the fruit industry by birds is well known and seems to be increasing. 'It can lead to substantial reduction in production. The smallest hole in a pear means it can rot and infect the whole crate. 'We've been looking for different methods of chasing the birds away with as little disturbance as possible. 'We had heard about the handheld lasers, which are like a torch which people carry around to scare off birds. 'But now that has been put on a robot that has a pre-programmed field in which it will move, so you can set it up to protect part or all of the orchard.' Mr Kuneman added that the system worked by creating the impression of movement on the field, which scares the birds away without harming them. He said: 'They don't understand the light. 'They consider it a physical object moving through the trees which they can't hear but they can see. 'We tested it on crows - jackdaws and rooks - and they were all scared away. They tend to be the smartest birds so if it works on them it should work on other birds. 'The system is random so there is no pattern they can discern.' However, the laser may create some unwanted light shows in rural areas that may be opposed by some locals. Mr Kuneman added: 'It is only during the few weeks that the fruit is ripe on the trees. 'In a densely populated country like the Netherlands there is already much light pollution so it probably will not lead to many complaints. 'Anything would be an improvement on the traditional way of chasing birds - a cannon that makes a loud boom.' 24-hour operation: Once programmed, the robotic laser,pictured, can be left to scare birds away through the day and night while fruit ripens. It is hoped the device will save farmers a great deal of money . The laser is mounted on top of a tower to ensure it can cover an entire field of up to 3,000 acres .","The lasers sweep at random across an area from 200 acres to 3,000 acres .

"Hollywood actor John Cusack is the latest supporter to visit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in his continued stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy. The American star joined US activist Daniel Ellsberg and Indian-born author and activist Arundhati Roy for a meeting inside the embassy in London. Assange has avoided being extradited to Sweden by taking shelter in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London since 2012. Scroll down for video . Hollywood actor John Cusack (pictured right) is the latest supporter to visit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (left) in his continued stay at the Ecuadorian Embassy - where he has remained since 2012 . WikiLeaks said the three were marking the fourth anniversary of Mr Assange being in 'detention' without charge, as well as 'commenting on the round the clock police presence' outside the embassy. The Australian has been granted political asylum by Ecuador but faces arrest if he leaves the embassy. He is wanted for questioning in Sweden over allegations of sex offences - which he denies - but he fears he will be transferred to the United States. Mr Assange believes if he is sent to Sweden he will be extradited to the US, where he could face 35 years in prison for publishing on WikiLeaks classified documents related to US activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. The American star joined US activist Daniel Ellsberg and Indian-born author and activist Arundhati Roy for a meeting with Assange - he is pictured arriving today at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London . Last month a Swedish appeals court upheld the detention order on Assange, dismissing a challenge by the WikiLeaks founder. Confirming a ruling by a lower court, the Svea appeals court said there is no reason to lift the detention order just because it cannot be enforced at the moment. The court also criticised the prosecutors, who have declined Assange's offer to be questioned in London, for not considering 'alternative avenues' to move the investigation forward. Assange hasn't been formally indicted in Sweden, but is wanted for questioning by police about allegations of sexual misconduct and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the Scandinavian country in 2010. He denies the allegations. In October MailOnline reported Assange fears he is being bugged at the embassy. Last year a covert listening device was found behind a plug socket in the ambassador’s office, but security experts described it as rudimentary and unlikely to have been the work of police or the security services.","Hollywood actor is latest supporter to visit WikiLeaks founder Assange .

"The NFL has said there's noting wrong with a pair of refs celebrating a Broncos touchdown Sunday with a fist bump. C.J. Anderson had just pushed in for his second touchdown of the game against Buffalo on the way to Denver's 24-17 win when the controversial gesture between officials on the field was caught on camera. Line judge John Hussey and umpire Carl Paganelli made the move after the score. The NFL has said there's noting wrong with a pair of refs celebrating a Broncos touchdown Sunday with a fist bump . Buffalo Bills safety Aaron Williams was so offended by the move that we took to Twitter after the game. 'No excuse for my performance but can't win playing 16 vs 11 thought I seen it all Smh,' he wrote along with a clip of the bump. Williams alludes the the question of how refs should have called Anderson's rush through the center line as it would have been difficult for Hussey to see whether the ball was in before Anderson's knee was down. Paganelli is supposed to help make a fair call. Before the bump, Paganelli flashed Hussey a thumbs up, followed by Hussey signaling for a touchdown. A replay confirmed the decision just moments later. ESPN notes that there are nine officials for NFL games, and that that would technically make it '20 vs. 11.' 'The NFL doesn't want legalized betting because their refs would probably get caught more often,' wrote fan Frank Brank ‏on Twitter. 'LRT: I have never seen refs fist bump each other before. I swear these refs are all for the Broncos,' wrote user Samantha Willhauck. But the NFL says the gesture was fine. 'It was an acknowledgment of good mechanics between the two officials involved in making the call,' said Michael Signora, an NFL spokesman.","C.J.

"It was a mission that captivated audiences across the world - and now images have revealed the dramatic moment Orion was safely recovered into the huge well deck of the USS Anchorage. A combined US Navy and Nasa team successfully towed the spacecraft out of the water after a flawless launch and landing. And Orion - which will one day take astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately Mars - will be brought triumphantly back to shore later today. Scroll down for videos . A combined US Navy and Nasa team recovered Orion on 5 December safely onto the USS Anchorage, shown. This was the first at-sea testing of the Orion Crew Module using a Navy well deck recovery method. Orion will make its return to shore later today . ‘This mission exemplifies the US Navy commitment to the research and development of technologies and techniques to ensure the safety of human space flight support,’ said Anchorage Commanding Officer, Captain Michael McKenna. ‘I could not be more proud of my crew.’ The successful retrieval of Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) was part of a US government inter-agency effort to test recovery techniques for future space flights. But although this was Orion’s first trip to space, it is actually the fifth at-sea testing of a module using the Navy well deck recovery method - although the others had used mock-ups. Four tests were conducted prior to the flight to prepare the recovery team and make sure everything went smoothly. The first test was conducted at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in August 2013. The others were conducted earlier in 2014, known as Underway Recovery Tests (URTs). NASA's Orion spacecraft is off loaded from the back of the USS Anchorage at Naval Base San Deigo, California . Navy personnel work as NASA's Orion space capsule is prepared to be unloaded from the USS Anchorage at Naval Base San Diego .

Navy divers are seen here attaching a towing bridle to the Orion Crew Module. The successful retrieval of Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1) was part of a US government interagency effort to test recovery techniques for future flights . Here the air bags are seen inflated, which were used to keep the capsule in an upright position - known as Stable 1 . Divers surround the capsule (in green helmets) as the operation begins to recover Orion . The USS Anchorage was ultimately chosen for EFT-1 as it has a combination of capabilities suited to assist Nasa with the Orion recovery. Called a landing platform dock (LPD) ship, it has a well-deck, advanced medical facilities, helicopters, three dimensional air-search radar and small boats that could all be used in the recovery operation. A specially-trained bridge team were also used throughout the duration of the recovery. And once the capsule had landed in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Baja California, the ship manoeuvred close to it along with small boats in order to safely retrieve it. Navy divers guide the Orion Crew Module alongside the amphibious transport dock USS Anchorage during the EFT-1 recovery . Recovery team members in a Zodiac boat help guide Nasa's Orion spacecraft into the well deck of the USS Anchorage following its splashdown in the Pacific Ocean . Here the Orion spacecraft is seen after it had been pulled safely into the well deck of the US Navy’s USS Anchorage. It's now being transported back to shore on board the Anchorage, and is expected to be off loaded at Naval Base San Diego later today . Divers attached lines from the small boats to guide the capsule toward Anchorage, where a Nasa-designed winch hauled the capsule into the well deck. ‘Orion is meant to be reused, which is why we tailored this recovery to accommodate keeping the capsule safe,’ said Navy Diver 1st Class Matthew Demyers of Explosive Ordnance Disposal Mobile Unit 11. And Chief Boatswain’s Mate Jason B. Roberts, deck department leading chief petty officer, added: 'We practiced this recovery many times with safety as the number one priority. The sailors were focused and completed the mission at hand successfully. 'I couldn't be more proud of our sailors and the work they accomplished here today.’ The spacecraft, which could someday take humans to Mars, made a fiery 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) re-entry into the planet enduring temperatures of 2,200°C (4,000°F), artist's illustration shown . In 11 minutes, Orion slowed from to 20 mph (32kph) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence . Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden, left, Nasa Associate Administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Directorate William Gerstenmaier, and others in Building AE at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, react as they watch the Orion spacecraft splash down . On target: Orion splashed down at its target point 275 miles (442 km) west of Baja, California while travelling at around 20mph (32km/h) On Friday Nasa's new Orion spacecraft made the 'bull's-eye' splashdown in the Pacific  following its dramatic test flight that took it twice around Earth in 4.5 hours. The spacecraft, which could someday take humans to Mars, made a fiery 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) re-entry into the planet enduring temperatures of 2,200°C (4,000°F). Cameras fitted to the rocket and capsule captured the entire mission - giving an unprecedented 'Orion's-eye' view from inside the capsule that could on day take man to Mars. Looking home: Cameras onboard the Orion capsule took this stunning snap of the Earth during re-entry. Flames show the incredible heat the capsule was subjected to, as it hit speeds of 20,000 mph and weathered temperatures approaching 2,200°C (4,000°F) Cameras onboard Orion captured its entire mission, from blast off (left) to its climb into orbit (right) An astronaut's eye view: A camera mounted insde the capsule looking out a windows captured this stunning image of Earth . During the uncrewed test, Orion traveled twice through the Van Allen belt, where it experienced periods of intense radiation, and reached an altitude of 3,600 miles above Earth. The spacecraft hit speeds of 20,000 mph (32,000 kph) and weathered temperatures approaching 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it entered Earth's atmosphere. If astronauts had been onboard Orion, they would have experienced a g-force of 8.2 - nearly twice that generated when Soyuz capsules return from the International Space Station. Orion hit its target point 275 miles (442 km) west of Baja, California, and achieved at least one record: flying farther and faster than any capsule built for humans since the Apollo moon program. 'There's your new spacecraft, America,' Mission Control commentator Rob Navias said as the Orion capsule neared the water. He called the journey 'the most perfect flight you could ever imagine.' The capsule reached a peak altitude more than 14 times farther from Earth than the International Space Station. No spacecraft designed for astronauts had gone so far since Apollo 17, 42 years ago. Nasa needed to send Orion that high in order to set the crew module up for a rapid and fiery entry. That was considered the most critical part of the entire flight - testing the largest of its kind heat shield for survival before humans climb aboard. In 11 minutes, Orion slowed from to 20 mph (32km/h) at splashdown - its final descent aided by eight parachutes deployed in sequence. Earth shrank from view through Orion's capsule window during its trip out to space, and stunning images were relayed back home. Its return was recorded by an unmanned drone flying over the recovery zone, providing more spectacular views. Helicopters then relayed images of the crew module bobbing in the water. Three of the five air bags deployed properly, enough to keep the capsule floating upright. 'Today's flight test of Orion is a huge step for NASA and a really critical part of our work to pioneer deep space on our Journey to Mars,' said Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden on Friday. 'The teams did a tremendous job putting Orion through its paces in the real environment it will endure as we push the boundary of human exploration in the coming years.' After being offloaded at shore the capsule will make the journey back to Kennedy from San Diego on the back of a truck - and officials said they hoped it would arrive by Christmas. Orion is being developed alongside the world's most powerful rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is due to make its maiden launch in 2018 or 2019. Together, SLS and Orion will allow Nasa to send humans into deep space to destinations such as Mars. There were a number of key moments throughout the flight (shown in diagram), designed to test the capability of Orion, all of which it passed without a hitch. In total the flight lasted about four and a half hours . First step towards Mars: Orion's Delta IV Heavy rocket clears the service tower that sits alongside the launchpad at Cape Canaveral. The high-stakes test flight is meant to usher in a new era of human exploration leading ultimately to Mars . Test flight: Orion made two big laps around Earth before re-entering the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (32,200 km/h). Pictured is an artist's impression of the Orion craft with its dummy service module in orbit . Ambition: The earliest Orion might carry passengers is 2021; a mission to an asteroid is on the space agency's radar sometime in the 2020s and Mars, the grand prize, in the 2030s .","A series of images have revealed how a combined US Navy and Nasa team recovered the Orion spacecraft .

"Olympic ski champ Bode Miller and his volleyball player wife Morgan Beck have confirmed they are expecting their first child together. A rep for the athletic duo, who married in 2012, confirmed the pregnancy to People just weeks after Beck, 27, apparently revealed she was expecting while slamming Miller's ex-girlfriend online. Miller, 37, already has a six-year-old daughter and a 22-month-old son from previous relationship. He has famously been at war with the boy's mother, former Marine Sara McKenna, and the one-time couple cannot even agree on a name. McKenna calls the boy Sam, while Miller calls him Nate. Baby joy: Olympic skier Bode Miller, 37, and his wife Morgan Beck, 27, pictured in April, have confirmed they are expecting their first child together. Miller has two children from previous relationships . In November, Beck apparently accused McKenna of fishing a condom out of the trash to get pregnant with Miller's child after they met through a matchmaking service in 2012. She apparently made the bizarre comments in a chat room for a pregnancy website. 'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom,' read the November 18 post on TheBump.com, PageSix first reported. The claims were made under the username '2015mamatobe', which used a photo of Beck and Miller together. After users became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed. At the time in mid-November, she also revealed that she was 13 weeks pregnant, which would mean she is due to give birth next May. When the posts appeared, McKenna also joined the website to stand up for herself and dismissed the suggestion that she had used a used condom to get pregnant. Brood: Miller, left, has a son with his ex, Sara McKenna, right. Despite telling her he didn't want anything to do with his son, he fought for custody of him after his birth. They finally reached a deal last month . Cruel: Last month, a user on pregnancy website TheBump.com shared messages she had received from another user - believed to be Beck - apparently accusing McKenna of fishing a condom out of the trash . Growing bump: The couple, who married in 2012 and suffered a miscarriage in 2013, are pictured together on Thanksgiving. Miller pestered Beck for a date in 2012 after deciding that they were 'soul mates', she said . 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned while we were on vacation in Florida,' she wrote. 'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.' Days before the online accusations, Miller and McKenna, who now lives in New York, finally reached a settlement following a lengthy custody battle. The details have not been released. Miller and Beck, who are represented by the same agent, met in 2012 after he called her and asked her out for dinner - but she said no. When she continued to rebuff his advances, he turned up at one of her tournaments and cheered her along, which she found strange. But after the game they met and she agreed to go out with him. He bought an engagement ring just a month and a half after that first meeting, USA Today reported. Day job: Morgan, 27, is a professional beach volleyball player and model from California . Record breaking: Bode Miller, a five-time world champion, is pictured competing at Sochi in February. He underwent back surgery on Monday but hopes to be back to the sport by next January . But they had many hurdles ahead of them: in early 2013, Beck miscarried their baby and the following month, McKenna gave birth to Sam. Two months later, Miller's 29-year-old brother died after suffering a seizure. The couple call Sam 'Nate' in memory of Millier's brother. Miller, a five-time world champion, underwent minor back surgery on Monday but has said he hopes to be back to the sport by January. The couple lives in California. As well as Sam, Miller also has an older daughter from a previous relationship.","Bode Miller, 37, and Morgan Beck, 27, have confirmed they are expecting their first child together .

"Over the course of two games against Bolton from the Championship, Liverpool have seemingly invented new methods of not scoring. With just minutes of this replay left, however, Brendan Rodgers’ team finally found a way and Steven Gerrard’s dream of a birthday FA Cup final lives on. Liverpool should have won the first game a week-and-half ago. Certainly they should have won this one much more easily than this. However, having hit the frame of the goal three times, they were staring at an embarrassing defeat after Eidur Gudjohnsen’s second half penalty edged Bolton to the precipice of another 2015 FA Cup shock.

With a man advantage after the subsequent sending off of Bolton’s Neil Danns, Liverpool still looked as though they were heading out. With five minutes to go, however, Liverpool’s pressure – and their extra player – finally told. First defender Emre Can – really a central midfield player – delivered a lovely chip over the Bolton defence for Raheem Sterling to volley in the equaliser. Then, three minutes later and with extra time seemingly inevitable, Phillipe Coutinho beat Bolton goalkeeper Andrew Lonergan with a right foot shot from 20 yards to hand Liverpool a fifth round game at Crystal Palace. It was tough on Neil Lennon’s Bolton. Struggling with injuries, the home team played for 90 minutes with a defender – Matthew Mills – up front. Had they not had Danns sent off, they may won. At 1-0 Gudjohnsen spurned a really good headed chance and that also proved significant. Liverpool, though, somehow found a way to win. It’s a habit they must now keep. Rodgers spoke in the run-up to the game about the manner in which his team had improved in recent weeks. It was easy to see his point but it is not an observation that extends to Liverpool’s work in front of goal. They do have mitigating circumstances – their centre forwards are either not good enough or rarely fit enough – but they are in danger of becoming a little like the Arsenal side of a few seasons ago. Lovely to watch but inadequate at the art of scoring. Rodgers spoke of justice being served after the final whistle. 'It was never a penalty,' he said. His defender Martin Skrtel did dangle a leg in front of young Bolton prospect Zach Clough in the 59th minute, though, and had Liverpool gone on to lose Rodgers may well have found that he had few allies when it came to talk of miscarriages of justice. Simply, Liverpool need to start taking a greater share of the chances they create. Wednesday night began with Gerrard shooting tamely at Lonergan when he perhaps should have scored and that pretty much set the tone for the evening.

They were never overrun. They were significantly second best in terms of possession and chances, though, and Liverpool should have been ahead by half-time. In the wake of Gerrard’s early opportunity, there were similar sights of goal for Sterling, Coutinho and the disappointing Adam Lallana. Sometimes Lonergan saved while on occasion the wrong choice was made. There was over-elaboration, too, and some bad luck when Sterling curled a cute effort against the angle of post and bar from 12 yards. In games like this, one of two things usually happens. Either the dam breaks and the water pours in or something goes awry at the other end. On this occasion it was the latter. Liverpool spurned further chances early in the second half as Sterling over hit a simple pass to Lallana and then saw a curling shot touched over by the Bolton goalkeeper. He was also played clear on goal only for Dorian Dervite to tackle him. Bolton’s penalty emerged out of nothing. A cute dart in to the box by Clough was all it took to tempt Skrtel and Gudjohnsen rolled the kick down the centre of the goal. As Lennon pointed out afterwards, his team were not immediately besieged. Liverpool seemed shocked to be behind and left the goal scorer unmarked at the far post soon after. The header was straight at Simon Mignolet. 'That would have sealed the game,' said Lennon and he may have been right.

Danns had already been booked for a first half lunge at Joe Allen and when he did it again he had to go. It was this that finally gave Liverpool some fresh impetus and belief at a time when they looked as though they may be running short on both. The introduction of Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge helped also, the latter finally giving Liverpool’s attacking movements some genuine shape. Still Liverpool couldn’t score, though. Sterling drove a shot goal wards only for it to rebound off a defender’s legs before David Wheater’s head diverted a Henderson shot on to a post and Lonergan’s fingertips touched a super Can shot on to the bar. With the clock ticking, Rodgers had pushed Can forwards into midfield, his natural position. It proved a significant decision as the German’s chipped pass to Sterling was as precise as the subsequent finish. It may yet prove to be one of the most telling goals of Liverpool’s year. As for the winner, it had a rather peculiar trajectory. So, though, has Liverpool’s season. It does, however, remain alive.

"Scientists have mimicked evolution in the laboratory for the first time using droplets of oil. The researchers behind the study claim their work proves that a non-biological system composed of chemicals can be made to evolve. The findings mark an  important step towards creating synthetic life and may also help scientists to explain how the first biological cells appeared on Earth more than 3.6 billion years ago. Scientists used a robot to find the 'fittest' droplets in experiments by selecting desirable properties like division (b), vibration (e) and movement (f) that over time led to the droplets becoming more stable . Evolution was long believed to be a process that only  biological creatures were capable of, but recent research aimed towards creating synthetic life has begun to question that idea. Professor Lee Cronin, regius chair of chemistry at the University of Glasgow who led the new research, used a robot to create tiny oil droplets from a mixture of four  chemicals. Each droplet was dropped into a petri dish of water and analysed for three different types of 'fitness' over the course of a minute using video cameras. Building an entire lifeform from scratch is a daunting task, although many scientists believe it may be possible within the next ten years. They believe that synthetic living systems could be made to order to solve a range of problems, from producing new drugs to creating biofuels. Professor Craig Venter is among those who have been leading the way and has already placed a basic DNA set synthesised in the laboratory into a bacterial cell. However, while these cells could replicate they were not able to survive without crucial nutrients provided by the scientists. This, they insist, is an important safety measure to stop synthetic cells from escaping and replicating in the environment. Yet synthetic life will not necessarily have to be based on the same biochemical molecules as our own. Researchers at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge used an entirely synthetic form of DNA, called XNA, to store genetic information and catalyse simple biochemical reactions. These could eventually be used to evolve entirely new forms of life, the scientists believe. If combined with the oil droplets created by the researchers at the University of Glasgow, it may be possible to create cells that can house the XNA systems and take scientists a step closer to creating entirely artificial forms of life. The robot then selected the droplet that performed best and the chemical composition of this was used to replicate the experiment, tweaking the mixture slightly each time. Over the course of 21 generations, the oil droplets became more stable in the watery world in which they were being dropped. This, according to Professor Cronin, mimicked the process of natural selection, which Charles Darwin proposed for driving evolution. But rather than pressure from the environment and other species driving the evolution of the droplets, it was the robot. Professor Cronin said: 'This is the first time that an evolvable chemical system has existed outside of biology. 'In recent years, we’ve learned a great deal about the process of biological evolution through computer simulations. 'However, this research provides the possibility of new ways of looking at the origins of life as well as creating new simple chemical life forms.' The robotic system initially created oil droplets at random using four chemicals, choosing from octanol, diethyl phthalate, pentanol and either octanoic acid or dodecane. The researchers selected these chemicals with the aim of producing droplets that had a wide range of motility - the ability to move spontaneously and actively - stability, the ability to divide, viscosity and density. In total they examined 225 unique combinations of these chemical by placing four drops of each mixture into a dish. The robot was programmed to look for those that moved around the dish the most, the amount they vibrated in the water and their ability to divide over the course of one minute. The best performing droplet was then selected and its chemical formula used as the basis of a second generation of droplets and again the 'fittest' droplet was selected to form the basis of the next generation. The scientists adapted a 3D printer to create a robot that was able to mix and tweak the oil compounds before using a camera to select those that performed best in a series of tests in a Petri dish (Evo arena) full of water . They found that droplets without octanoic acid were best at dividing and moving around the dish but some octanoic acid is required for the best vibration response. In total 21 generations of droplets were created and they became more stable, dividing into many, fast moving but distinct droplets. The researchers believe their set up can be used to create chemical systems that will evolve freely without the need for the robot. In their paper in Nature Communications, they said: 'While most of the characteristics of ‘life’ are wholly dependent on the robot in the current system, we propose that these dependencies could be removed stepwise, in serial evolutionary experiments, to move the chemical system towards full autonomy, avoiding the all-or-nothing barrier that currently plagues the study of minimal chemical replicators. 'It is therefore our intention to focus follow-up work towards the creation of artificial life-like assemblies, driven by a thesis that is chemically agnostic, thereby opening up investigations of new evolvable chemical systems.' The findings could also help to explain how complex mixtures of chemicals on the early Earth came together to form the oily membranes found in every living biological cell. Scientists believe these first formed capsules inside which the first biochemical processes began to evolve. Four droplets of each mixture were deposited by the robot (top left) into a Petri dish (bottom left) and then monitored for stability in the water and to see whether they divided (bottom right), moved or vibrated . 'We are interested in exploring how life started on planet earth, which was almost certainly due to a large number of high probable  events,' said Professor Cronin. 'But it probably took a long time - between 100 million and a billion years. So to speed up the ‘search’ we have used a cheap-3D printer platform and turned it into a chemical robot that can automatically do precise experiments. 'By hacking together this kit we have in effect built a highly sophisticated machine that can fully automate a life cycle in the life of a chemical proto-cell model and used the robot to explore lots of different types of ingredients to try and come up with ‘interesting’ recipes that show ‘life-like’ behaviours, which include cell-division, movement, vibration, wobbling, clustering and so on. 'We can show that statistically, the chances of droplet evolution happening at the origin of life is higher than a complete biological cell just ‘springing into existence’. 'This means that the probability of life just spontaneously forming just went up dramatically. It is not an impossible miracle anymore.' Professor Cronin added that the technique could also be adapted to help scientists develop new types of chemical compounds for use in industry and medicine. He said: 'Biological evolution has given rise to enormously complex and sophisticated forms of life, and our robot-driven form of evolution could have the potential to do something similar for chemical systems. 'This initial phase of research has shown that the system we’ve designed is capable of facilitating an evolutionary process, so we could in the future create models to perform specific tasks, such as splitting, then seeking out other droplets and fusing with them. 'We’re also keen to explore in future experiments how the emergence of unexpected features, functions and behaviours might be selected for.'","University of Glasgow researchers say it is the first time a non-biological system has been shown to evolve over successive generations .

"Your perspective on the immediate situation at Barcelona probably revolves around how you view sleight of hand and misdirection in magic tricks like find the lady, three-card-monte or the shell-game. It takes great confidence and skill from those who shuffle cards around to hide where the Queen of Hearts is, or to whizz the cups about so that the one with the shell under it is undetectable. ‘Magic’ couldn’t exist without it. However, it’s usually just a con — aimed at robbing you of, at least, your attention, probably your common sense and, at worst, all your cash. Lionel Messi (left) looks to advance past Elche's Chilean defender Enzo Roco on Thursday night . Messi scores from the penalty spot at the Nou Camp during the Copa del Rey last-16 match against Elche . Messi celebrates after scoring Barcelona's third goal against Elche at the Nou Camp on Thursday night . Thus it is that all attention is centred on the farcical did he/didn’t he? mini-drama concocted by a Catalan television station when they announced that Barcelona’s greatest-ever footballer Lionel Messi demanded the removal of current coach Luis Enrique. By late on Friday night, Catalan journalists were running around in a frenzy. The rumours ranged from Enrique quitting, Messi staging some sort of putsch for power — to a decision for him to move to Chelsea already being taken. All of which has served to neatly divert eyes away from the fact that this is very nearly the situation which the football vandalism of the Sandro Rosell era has been on target to create from the outset. In case his name has slipped your mind, Rosell is the man who has always wanted to reinvent the wheel. A vice-president when Joan Laporta came to power in a footballing renaissance fuelled by Johan Cruyff-ist philosophy back in 2003, Rosell always detested the Dutchman’s manner, legacy and influence at the Nou Camp. Smack bang in the middle of Barcelona’s Field-of-Dreams vision and painstaking construction, Rosell walked away from the club in 2005, contending that everyone was out of step except for him. He wanted big, athletic, preferably Brazilian footballers — he wanted physical power and powerful spending. He wanted power. Barcelona were producing intelligent, balletic, technical geniuses like Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Messi while scouting, training and developing to a Cruyff/Ajax/Rinus Michels template. Former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell is the man who has always wanted to reinvent the wheel . Barcelona's ex-manager Gerardo 'Tata' Martino (right) shakes hands with then-Barcelona president  Rosell . It yielded football which has taken its place in the all-time pantheon of excellence in this sport. Laporta’s personal hedonism left a vacuum at the end of his final mandate into which Rosell stepped — winning a landslide presidential victory. But, from 2010 onwards, there has been a steady drive towards this point when, having been nearly unstoppable as recently as the middle of 2012, Barcelona are now unravelling dramatically. Under Rosell’s direction, a director of football Andoni Zubizarreta was appointed who has singularly failed to guide the club to an appropriate coaching appointment following the illness and death of Tito Vilanova, who repeatedly failed to re-stock Barca’s back four or midfield and who was a party to the rule breaking which has caused FIFA to ban the club from two transfer markets. From the beginning of his regime, I predicted Rosell would dedicate himself to finding ‘his’ Messi — an iconic footballer who would, in theory, give Rosell his place in the history books and allow Barcelona to edge the Argentinian towards a vastly lucrative transfer to fund the vanity project of a new stadium. Neymar is probably the guy who is now closest to Messi in the squad. However the at-any-cost pursuit of the Brazilian did two key things. Firstly, Barcelona’s board became blind to the obvious need to reinvigorate the first-team squad with the kind of power, height and pace lost via the departures of Yaya Toure, Thierry Henry, Seydou Keita and Eric Abidal. Secondly, given the club’s vomit of half-truths, the process via which Rosell dashed Real Madrid’s equally determined pursuit of Neymar cost him all credibility and also his position at the club. Throughout Messi’s emergence as a true genius of football, Barcelona had repeatedly chosen to cosset and reassure him. It worked. 'Messi drives Barca to despair' ran the headline on the front of AS after he followed Chelsea on Instagram . 'Barcelona fall apart' ran the headline on Tuesday's edition of Marca after Messi failed to attend training . Catalan newspaper Sport devoted plenty of pages to dissecting the growing crisis at the Nou Camp . Ferran Soriano, now in charge at Manchester City, was part of a strategy, formed with fellow vice-president Marc Ingla and director of football Txiki Begiristain nearly 10 years ago now, to ensure that the player’s contract would be spruced up every 12-14 months. The idea was firstly to ensure the Messi entourage would keep Barca abreast of which club was sniffing about this or that year. Secondly, it emerged that improving his terms and his ‘sense of wellbeing’ regularly began to be wholly in step with the improvement in his performances, worth, and importance to the club’s trophy winning. Rosell’s era became so different that his finance director felt free to moan publicly about having to increase Messi’s salary so regularly. Why on earth break a successful formula? Why make sentiments like that public? But here is the key thing which the recent media misdirection has helped keep in the background. Barcelona were a repeat-Superbowl winning franchise with an almost perfect playbook — and Rosell burned the formula. He launched an offensive against Cruyff so malignant that the club icon handed back his entitlement to be honorary president and hasn’t been to the Nou Camp since. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has previously played down speculation linking his side with a move for Messi . Messi fuelled speculation he could be keen on a move to Chelsea by following the club's Instagram account . Here's what Messi would look like if he was to seal a move to the Premier League's west London outfit . The Cruyff ideology becoming verboten inevitably coincided with Pep Guardiola beginning to feel a cold and distant relationship with president Rosell. It all caused Barcelona to prematurely lose a tired, burned-out coach in whose hands lay the right way to progress and renew this era. The abandonment of the ideals which had guided and created almost unparalleled footballing excellence gradually led to an erosion of the kind of daily intensity, hard-nosed competitiveness and crystal-clear philosophy of positional play upon which this squad depended. So, admittedly, it is a legitimate news line to pursue whether Messi did or didn’t demand the removal of Enrique. But it isn’t the real issue. The central problems include the fact that Rosell, who quit in disgrace, isn’t around to take the criticism for the horrendous botch he made of what he inherited. The next key issue is that, while no player can be allowed to hold a club hostage and dictate their decision-making, Messi is wholly within his rights if he a) chooses to express his unhappiness and b) finally opts that he wants to leave. Messi started Barcelona's defeat against Real Sociedad on the bench before coming on in the second half . Barcelona manager Luis Enrique future at the Catalan club is in doubt after a fall-out with senior players . Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu is reportedly already looking at candidates to replace Enrique . Moyes beat Messi's Barcelona on Sunday night . It was  as if David Moyes had borrowed some of the magic of the FA Cup on Sunday   as Real Sociedad became giant-killers and took the scalp of Barcelona. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL REPORT . Aged 27, it is feasible that the best is yet to come for him. Some will tell you that his best is in the past but such opinions are based on the performances of a genius in a declining team and at a club which has been turning wine into water. If Enrique, who faces Spanish champions Atlético at the Nou Camp on Sunday night, is going to get things right then it will be a dramatic turnaround. He’s given few signs thus far. Irrespective of how many years of his contract he has left, Messi could justifiably demand a summit with the incumbent president and assess the direction in which the club is headed. To assess whether presidential elections in the summer might put Barcelona back on course. Right now, I’m guided, his intention is to catalyse positive changes and stay. But leaving has never been so high on his agenda. The financial behemoth of obtaining Messi’s registration via a forced buy-out, using the €250million recision clause and paying the €100m+ VAT, is unimaginable under current football regulations. Thus, should Messi feel that he needs to leave then he’ll have to demand a transfer. If he were to do that what would it tell you about his club? The club to which he owes a lifelong debt, the club via which he has become an all-time great, the club where he has been immensely happy and settled? Precisely what the player did or didn’t say to a president whose days are numbered about a coach who is not up to the task is of less overall significance than how and why the perfect marriage of Barcelona, scintillating football and Messi is on course to end in the divorce courts.

"Fizzy drinks have been much maligned due to their high sugar content. Now doctors warn the cans that they come in could also be bad for a person's health. A new study has found a common coating used in soft drink cans could cause high blood pressure and put heart patients at risk. The chemical Bisphenol A - known as BPA - is widely used as a lining for cans and plastic bottles, but previous studies found it can leach into food and drink. The chemical Bisphenol A- known as BPA - found in the lining of fizzy drink cans could cause high blood pressure and put heart patients at risk, experts warn . Korean researchers found drinking from cans increased the concentration of BPA in urine by 1,600 per cent when compared to glass bottles. Drinking two cans a day increased blood pressure by 5 mmg Hg, a rise which would cause 'significant problems' for patients with high blood pressure or heart disease, doctors warned. Such patients would also need to seek medical if such a rise was seen, they added. Bisphenol A has already been linked to a host of medical problems, including migraines, obesity, diabetes, infertility, heart attacks and even cancer. The chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in Europe because of safety fears. However, the EFSA - the European Food Safety Authority - last year found that BPA posed no appreciable health risk to anyone apart from very young children. It is currently reviewing its findings, with a new report due before Christmas. The new study, carried out by the Korean researchers, found ingesting BPA was associated with high blood pressure and changes in heart rate. Dr Yun-Chul Hong, of the Seoul National University College of Medicine, said: 'A 5 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure by drinking two canned beverages may cause clinically significant problems, particularly in patients with heart disease or hypertension. Chemicals used to make till receipts could raise the risk of developing harmful diseases such as diabetes, obesity and even cancer, scientists claim. Alarming research suggests that a substance used to produce paper in store tills, credit card machines and ATMs could be absorbed into the blood stream. Researchers say the chemical bisphenol-A - widely known as BPA - can disrupt hormones, raising the risk of a wide number of health problems. The chemical has already been banned in baby bottles in Europe because of safety fears. But the transparent resin is still used to line most plastic and tin food packaging - despite the calls for an all-out ban by campaigners. 'A 20 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease.' A person is normally said to have high blood pressure if the have a pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or above. The study involved 60 adults over the age of 60 who were given soy milk from glass bottles or cans three times over the course of the study. Researchers then measured the level of BPA  in their urine, as well as their blood pressure and heart rate  two hours after drinking each beverage. Soy was chosen as it doesn't contain any ingredients that are known to elevate blood pressure. They found that the concentration of BPA increased by up to 1,600 per cent after consuming canned drinks compared to after consuming the glass-bottled beverages. Researchers controlled factors such as population characteristics or past medical history. Time variables, such as daily temperatures, however, could still affect the results, they said. Dr Hong concluded: 'I suggest consumers try to eat fresh foods or glass bottle-contained foods rather than canned foods. 'Hopefully, manufacturers will develop and use healthy alternatives to BPA for the inner lining of can containers.' Gavin Partington, British Soft Drinks Association director general, said BPA is used in 'virtually all cans used for food and beverage products'. He said: 'BPA has been approved safe by the UK Food Standards Agency and this view is shared by authorities worldwide. 'The scientific consensus repeatedly stated among regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, New Zealand and the United States is that current levels of exposure to BPA through food and beverage packaging do not pose a health risk to the general population. 'The overwhelming majority of soft drinks bottles are made from plastics which do not contain bisphenol A.' The study was published in the American Heart Association's journal Hypertension. Bisphenol A has already been linked to a host of medical problems such as migraines, obesity, diabetes, infertility, heart attacks and even cancer.

"Stand off: Poker star Phil Ivey has had his winnings withheld by Crockfords . Britain's oldest casino is investigating a £7.3 million win by the world’s top poker player – and is refusing to pay him  a penny. Crockfords, the exclusive Mayfair gaming club, has informed the Gambling Commission that it is withholding Phil Ivey’s payout. A source with close knowledge of the  dispute described the situation as unprecedented. Accompanied by a ‘beautiful Oriental woman’, Mr Ivey, a  35-year-old Californian, was playing Punto Banco, which is  a skill-free variant of baccarat, when he struck a remarkable winning streak. The 184-year-old casino initially agreed to transfer the winnings to his bank account, but six weeks on it has returned only his £1 million stake. Instead it began an exhaustive inquiry. Staff, including the female croupier, were interviewed at length amid fears there may have been some form of collusion. This is thought to have been ruled out. While it is unclear what, if anything, Mr Ivey has been accused of, lawyers for both sides are said to be engaged in an increasingly tense stand-off. It is not thought that police have been alerted. Sources said Mr Ivey played for two nights over the August bank holiday for about seven hours in all. Suspicions over the win intensified when it was  discovered that his companion’s membership of another Mayfair casino had previously been  suspended. The reason for this has not been revealed. Crockfords, the oldest private gaming club in the world, is owned by Genting, the Malaysian gaming corporation. Genting investigators flew to London from Kuala Lumpur  to speak to everyone who was working on the two nights in question and to examine hours of film from surveillance cameras. The cards used and the shoe they were dealt from were also scrutinised. ‘No imperfections, or marks, that would have given Ivey an advantage were found. In any case, Ivey at no time touched the cards,’ said a source. ‘The shoe was also thoroughly inspected; once again the investigators drew a blank.’ Scroll down for video . Casino: Doormen outside Crockfords Casino in Mayfair London . Mr Ivey, who once picked up £10 million in a poker tournament in Las Vegas, was playing in a small private room on the ground floor of Crockfords. He sat next to his companion. The only other people in the room were the croupier and an inspector. All the action was recorded on ten cameras. Mr Ivey was initially gambling £50,000 per hand, which can be over in less than a minute. He was later given permission by the management to increase his stake to £150,000. Private club: Crockfords is Britian's oldest casino . Punto Banco is the favoured game of high-rollers. The result is determined as soon as the cards are dealt – it offers marginally better odds than games such as roulette. At first, Mr Ivey’s losses were heading towards £500,000 but he recovered, and at the end of the first night was £2.3 million up. His winning form continued on the second night and by the time that he signalled he was ready to quit he had amassed £7.3 million. He told the management he wanted the money transferred into his bank account. The casino allegedly told him it couldn’t be done straight away because of the bank holiday, but assured him that it would be done on Tuesday, August 28. Mr Ivey left the club and the casino began an immediate investigation. Because of the difficulties involved, instances of Punto Banco cheating are rare. Twelve years ago a Triad gang used covert surveillance footage to read cards being dealt and relay a signal to a receiver outside the casino. The information was then transmitted to the player using a hidden earpiece. There is no suggestion that Mr Ivey is accused of using any of these methods. Although he is a respected figure in the poker world, casinos regard him as a ‘hit and run’ gambler, with a tendency to ‘quit after just a few hands if  he wins big’. On this occasion,  Mr Ivey, a divorcé, assured Crockfords bosses that he would play for a serious amount of time, and transferred £1 million into the casino’s bank. Mr Ivey declined to comment when approached by a Mail on Sunday reporter at a tournament in Cannes last week. ‘Please don’t talk to me. I am concentrating on my tournament,’ he said. His mother, Pamela Ivey, who lives in Las Vegas, said: ‘He never mentioned it. It can’t have been very important to him, or  I think he’d have mentioned it.’ Last night a spokesman for Crockfords said: ‘As a private club we put great store on the confidentiality of the relationship between ourselves and our client and we therefore have no comment to make.’ Chips: The game Punto Banco is the sister game of Chemin de Fer . Punto Banco is the sister game of Chemin de Fer, the high-stakes card game favoured by James Bond. The aim is to hold cards  with a count of nine or closest to nine. You bet that either the hand held by the player (punto) or banker (banco) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table. You can also make a ‘tie’ bet. Tens and picture cards and multiples of ten count as  zero: for example, 7 + 3 = 0;  10 + 4 = 4; king + 10 = 0. Its appeal rests on how the advantage can switch with each new card, lending huge excitement to the action. Like blackjack, the game  is played with several  packs of cards, which are shuffled by a croupier  and dealt from a shoe.

"Lionel Messi has been struggling at the World Cup because he is exhausted, the Argentina superstar's father has admitted ahead of Sunday's final against Germany. Messi failed to make any impact in both the quarter-final against Belgium and the semi-final against Holland, but Argentina have managed to scrape through on both occasions. Against the mighty Germans, however, Messi will be expected to deliver a matchwinning performance if his side are to lift the trophy in the Maracana. But statistics show that Messi has covered less distance on the pitch than any outfield player who has played six games at this World Cup, apart from Brazil's much-maligned striker Fred.

'Leo (Messi) said it looked like his legs weighed 100 kilos. He was very tired,' Jorge Messi told Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo when asked about his son's anonymous performance over 120 minutes against the Dutch. Messi had been one of the stars of the tournament in the group stages, where he scored four goals in the opening three games. The 27-year-old forward then set up Angel Di Maria's late extra-time winner against Switzerland with a marvellous piece of skill, but hos contribution has been next to nothing since then. The four-time Ballon d'Or winner has covered 51.9km during Argentina's run to the World Cup final, while Fred, who has been criticised for his lack of movement, has moved 47.2km. The next lowest is Holland's defensive midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum on 53.9km. But a host of players have covered more ground despite playing less games less than Messi, including Marcelo Diaz of Chile and Michael Bradley of USA, who have both played two whole games less. Wesley Sneijder (69.6km), Arjen Robben (69.1km) and Thomas Muller (68.8km) are the three players to have covered the most ground so far.

Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher has suggested that Messi's lack of running could be in order to protect his suspect hamstring, which caused him to miss a lot of the season with Barcelona. But Carragher also believes Messi is changing hisa game and becoming more of an old-fashioned playmaker. 'He doesn’t seem to be running as much, he is waiting for the ball,' Wrote Carragher after the last-16 victory over Switzerland. 'His running stats were the lowest on the pitch against Switzerland, which is evidence of the change in his game - but he caused maximum trouble and won the match for Argentina.

"Romance is in the air for Arsene Wenger this week. Or it should be. If there’s one Champions League last-16 clash that tugs at the heartstrings then it’s Arsenal’s clash against Monaco. Wenger will, for the first time, go head to head with the club he left in 1994 after seven years — in which time he won a Ligue 1 title and a Coupe de France. However, the Gunners boss, whose side improved their top-four hopes with victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday, is lukewarm about the reunion. Arsene Wenger insists he hasn't thought about the reunion with his former side Monaco this week . Wenger pictured as Monaco manager all the way back in 1987 . ‘Have I thought about Monaco? Not at all — I have enough experience to know that the most important game is the next one,’ said the Frenchman. ‘Honestly, I haven’t. What has been important for me has been to win at Palace. Santi Cazorla has scored more penalties (six) in the Premier League this season than any player. ‘We have fought like mad to come back in a strong position in the league. Not to win at Palace would have been disastrous.’ Perhaps Wenger will show more emotion when he returns to the Principality ahead of the second leg on March 17. The prospect of a place in the Champions League quarter-finals is likely to warm the manager’s heart, too. Arsenal have crashed out at the last-16 stage in the past four seasons, twice against Bayern Munich, once against AC Milan and once against Barcelona. The clash against Monaco, on paper, seems much more winnable. But the Arsenal manager is refusing to count his chickens. Alan Pardew was proud of his Crystal Palace side for their efforts against Arsenal . ‘The last 16 in recent years has been super-tough,’ said Wenger. ‘But this is a 50-50 game. Monaco are very tight defensively and they conceded once in the group stage. It is two good teams. So for us, it’s a tricky but a possible tie. ‘It really is a 50-50. They have followed a similar pattern to us. They have come back in their championship, so their confidence will be high.’ Palace manager Alan Pardew says his players should take huge confidence from pushing the Gunners all the way on Saturday. Going in 2-0 down at half-time following goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud, Palace went within inches of securing a point after Glenn Murray scored in stoppage time before hitting the post in the final attack of the game. Glenn Murray (far right) netted in stoppage time to give Crystal Palace hope against Arsenal . Pardew said: ‘I think we should have a little more confidence in what we have in the dressing room, and I think they showed that against Arsenal. They believed it against Arsenal for the first time since I’ve been here. ‘We’ve won games because we’ve been resilient and we do have attacking flair on the break. 'But we can also mix it and take it to the opposition, and I was very proud of the team today that they believed they could do it, and they almost achieved it. ‘I’m pleased that they believe they can take a game to the likes of Arsenal because we’ve got some big clubs to come here still — Manchester United and Man City. ‘And we can mix it with them and we’ve got to believe that. Of course the next three games are in and around that mid-table and we’ve got to exploit that situation.’","Arsenal face Monaco in the last 16 of the Champions League this week .

"Michelle Williamson beat her businessman boyfriend so severely, he almost lost his arm and will need cosmetic surgery to heal his scars. (Pictured outside Grimsby Crown Court in 2008) This is the first picture of 5ft 1in Michelle Williamson, who beat her businessman boyfriend so severely that he almost lost his arm and will need cosmetic surgery to heal his horrific scars. Ian McNicholl, 49, from Hull, suffered two years of abuse at the hands of his girlfriend, including one attack where she sprayed bleach in his eyes. He also suffered fractures to his skull, cheekbones, and nose, three cracked ribs and horrific burns on his arm from an iron at the hands of his ex-girlfriend. Williamson, who is now serving a seven-year jail sentence for causing grievous bodily harm, also lit cigarettes and shoved them up her partner’s nose after falsely accusing him of having an affair. On one occasion, she also poured two kettles full of boiling water over him - and even attacked him with a vacuum cleaner. Ian, who is now preparing for the surgery, said: 'It was between Christmas and New Year (in 2006) when she first accused me of having an affair with one of her friends. 'This was the first time she lashed out. 'She punched me in the face and I had a black eye.' Williamson begged him for forgiveness, saying it was just a one-off and soon moved into his flat in Grimsby. However a few weeks later she launched another attack with the vacuum cleaner. Ian recalled: 'She began ranting and raving about previous partners of mine. 'Then, all of a sudden, she switched the vacuum cleaner off, grabbed the nozzle and whacked me across the face with it. I could feel my cheek split.' This was the first of many outbursts of domestic violence from the then 34-year-old and the attacks got progressively worse. His worst ordeal came when Williamson poured a kettle full of . boiling water into his lap and, while he was screaming in agony, she . reboiled the kettle and poured it over him again. He continued: 'She would show off my injuries to her friends. 'I felt as though I couldn’t walk away, because she told me she had family who were involved in organised crime who would kill me if I left her. 'I felt I was trading with my life. I was brought up well and taught never to hit a woman - and I didn’t lay a finger on her.' The night before Williamson’s arrest, Mr McNicholl endured an attack that lasted almost seven hours, where he was beaten with a metal bar and his body smashed in places with a claw hammer. An anonymous phone call tipped off the police, who took him to Hull Royal Infirmary and arrested Williamson. Although the violence had come to an end, Mr McNicholl didn’t realise the aftermath would be just as bad. He woke up the following day to find himself in a night shelter for the homeless, wearing his bloodstained clothes from the day before. Injuries: Among Ian McNicholl's injuries were fractures to his skull, cheekbones, and nose. Right, he shows damage to his shoulder that was caused by a hammer attack . Ian McNicholl, 49, from Hull, shows a scar on his arm caused by an iron . He said: 'Michelle had taken control of my finances and run up lots of debt. I didn’t have any money and didn’t know where to go or what to do. 'I was petrified walking the streets of Hull, as I was paranoid her brothers were going to come and kill me. As it turns out, they didn’t exist, but I didn’t know that at the time.' After a phone call to the Salvation Army, he was given accommodation at William Booth Life House, where he stayed for 18 months, and he received psychological help and support from The Men’s Helpline. Now, Mr McNicholl has dedicated his life to helping the homeless - being appointed vice-chairman of Hull’s Homelessness Focus Group. He added: 'I can completely understand why some men will feel embarrassed speaking out - men generally don’t like talking about their feelings. 'But the bigger issue is that lots of men don’t know where to go for help and there’s a lot of gender bias. 'The massive problem is that men are not seen as victims. 'We need a gender neutral awareness campaign, or even a male-specific one.' Despite his experience, Ian isn’t put off having a relationship again. 'It’s going to be difficult when I meet someone who doesn’t know what I’ve been through,' said Ian. 'They will no doubt ask about my scars, and I’m not going to lie. 'My fear is that they will wonder what I did to deserve it.'","Michelle Williamson sprayed bleach in Ian McNicholl's eyes .

"Frolicking in his new home, England’s only polar bear is a picture of contentment. But moving the 75-stone animal from a Dutch zoo to this purpose-built enclosure was a tricky proposition – not least for Victor himself. With his breeding days behind him, the 15-year-old was picked to be the first occupant of an £850,000 facility at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park, near Doncaster, complete with an eight-metre-deep lake and swathes of grassland, designed to resemble the Arctic tundra in the summer. Scroll down for video . Roar or yawn? A sleepy looking Victor the polar bear takes his first steps on English soil at Yorkshire Wildlife Park - his new home after moving from Holland . Victor, who is 15 years old, was transported in a specially-adapted cage for his trip to the park in Doncaster, South Yorkshire . To reach it, however, he had to endure a 12-hour journey locked inside a cramped metal box. After being trained to walk into the cage, he was loaded on to a lorry and then ferried to Hull from the port of Zeebrugge, receiving fish and water through the bars along the way. His new keepers were relieved that upon his arrival on Thursday they were met by a ‘very confident’ and ‘laid back’ character – rather than a polar bear with a sore head. After spending the weekend in a holding area to give him time to adjust, Victor was finally let loose in his new home yesterday. He quickly settled in with a refreshing dip in the man-made lake, before a rest in one of the caves dug into a bank at the side of the water. His enclosure is one of the biggest in the world, and could hold up to ten more animals. Victor is expected to be joined by two others by the end of the year – but for now he has all ten acres to himself. Cheryl Williams, the wildlife park’s director, said: ‘He is quite greedy and loves meat and fish, with his favourite being mackerel, but he is not very impressed by vegetables. I have been told he likes the occasional peanut butter sandwich but we haven’t tried that yet. 'He weighs about 480kg (1058lbs) so he is pretty chunky, but that is his summer weight. When it comes up to winter he will become a real hungry Horace and eat lots more, when it gets colder he will probably be about 500kg (1102lbs). Victor has been retired to the UK because he is no longer needed on a European polar bear breeding programme, as he is the father of most of the continent's bears . Smile! Victor looks up as a photographer takes a picture of him in the hours before he leaves holland . Victor travelled with his keeper at the Rhenen Zoo, Holland, who will stay with him for his first few days in Yorkshire to help him get used to his new climate . The 15-year-old polar bear shows off his teeth as he walks through the cage he was transported in on his journey to Britain . Victor looked confused as to what the digger was before it was used to pick up his cage and place it in a waiting lorry . Icy: Ice cubes are left in buckets near Victor's cage to help him stay cool during the journey to England . Dorine van Appledoorm (pictured), Victor's Dutch keeper, travelled with him to keep him company on the journey . Victor, who retired from a breeding programme after fathering ten cubs, is the first polar bear to live in England for about a decade. He was born in captivity in Rostock, Germany, before moving to Rhenen in the Netherlands. His new keepers hope to use their enclosure to re-home bears living in unsuitable homes in Eastern Europe or tropical countries. The animal, who is such a prolific breeder that he had to be retired because he is father to most of Europe's polar bears, now lives in a 10-acre enclosure which has the environment of an Arctic summer. Park director John Minion said: 'We are delighted to welcome Victor to the park and be able to make a contribution to polar bear conservation. 'Victor has made a great contribution to the European breeding programme and his genes are very well represented now so the decision was made to retire him to the park. Victor was driven to a ferry port in Holland so he could begin his journey to England. He is now the only captive polar bear in the country . Arriving: The giant polar bear is taken off the lorry after getting to Doncaster. Now the keepers have to transport into his enclosure . Can I get out now? The bear appeared eager to be freed from his cage as he arrived at the Yorkshire Wildlife Park after a length journey by ferry from the Netherlands . Let me out: Victor was eager to get out and explore his new home, which includes 8m deep lakes and a realistic Arctic summer climate . Feeling trapped: After a 12-hour journey locked inside the cramped metal cage, the polar bear was let out to meet his new friends who described him as 'very confident' A JCB was used to haul the 1,058lb bear to his new 10-acre enclosure, which has been dubbed Project Polar because of its Arctic conditions . 'He's actually the most prolific breeder across Europe, so most polar bears in Europe are probably his children. 'So because of that he's now been retired from the breeding programme and we offered him a home as we've just built this specialist enclosure which is the biggest in Europe at the moment.' 'But that doesn't stop Victor from being an ambassador for the Arctic. Polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause. The park expect Victor to live for anotjer 15 years at least, but he will not be lonely for long as more bears are expected to join him soon. 'We will have more bears arriving in the autumn and will announce those as soon as details are finalised,' Mr Minion added. Because I'm worth it: Victor had no problem with playing up to the cameras at his unveiling in Yorkshire in Thursday . Drying off: The retired polar bear looks more like a large dog as he shakes the water off his fur . Victor takes a dip in the lake before heading to one of his rocky caves, which provides shelter for the bear as well as his main house . Yum: Fish were on the menu shortly after Victor arrived. Park officials say it only took him 10 minutes to settle into his new home . Hungry: England's only polar bear uses a paw to hold down a chunk of meat as he gnaws at his lunch . Enjoying retirement? Victor wanders around his 8m deep lake where he will spend his retirement. He had to leave his role as Europe's top breeder because too many of the continent's bears are his children . Going for an explore: The polar bear enclosure features landscaped hills, valleys, and large lakes, and will be big enough for any more bears the park takes on . And if Victor is anything to go by, the other polar bears will settle in fine at the large enclosure, dubbed Project Polar, which features landscaped hills, valleys, and lakes with water up to 8m deep. Within 10 minutes of arriving he was seen in his house, eating food and having a drink 'like he had been here all his life', Mr Minion said. He will be kept of out of the public gaze while he acclimatises to British temperatures, but will be able to explore his new home. Mr Minion explained what Project Polar includes: 'The landscaping of the reserves mirror the Arctic Tundra with grass, herbs, shrubs and heathers. There are rocky areas and caves, which provide shelter for the bears as well as their main house. 'The large lake is 8m deep so Victor will be able to swim and dive. We are sure that Victor will enjoy his new surroundings.' Taking a dip: Park officials say Victor has enjoyed taking long swims in the lakes in Project Polar and is often seen in the water . Hello there: Victor wanders towards photographers taking snaps of him. He will not get to meet the public properly until he has aclimmatised to the park . Home, sweet home: Yorkshire Wildlife Park will be moving in more bears in the autumn but have not released any further details yet . Close enough: A cameraman records Victor as he tucks into some lunch, but stays at a safe distance from the large carnivore . Tucking in: Within 10 minutes of arriving, Victor was seen in his house, eating food and having a drink 'like he had been here all his life', park director John Minion said . Fluffy but fierce: Despite their cute and cuddly appearance, polar bears are some of the strongest animals on the planet . Last year Yorkshire Wildlife Park offered a home to Yupi, a polar bear trapped in soaring temperatures and a concrete enclosure in a Mexican zoo. Yupi has been at Morelia Zoo since 1992, after being captured in the wild as a cub. Her current concrete enclosure has virtually no shade, and offers little stimulation, causing campaigners to encourage the zoo to move her to a more appropriate home. The Doncaster park made an offer to rehouse Yupi, but it is yet to be accepted. Ms Williams said: 'We would still be delighted to re-home Yupi, who is over twenty years old. It would be wonderful if she could enjoy the rest of her life in the reserve here, so we wait for further news from Morelia.' There are two other polar bears in Britain, who both live at Highland Wildlife Park in Scotland. One of them, called Walker, is one of Victor's many sons.","Victor, a 1,058lb polar bear, has become England's only polar bear after moving to Doncaster from Holland .

"A holiday with engineer Trevor Cox would certainly be a memorable one. While his fellow travellers are holding up cameras, Professor Cox is likely to be holding up a dictaphone. And instead of taking in the sights of the Alps, the sound engineer is much happier jumping into sewers and camping out in abandoned buildings. Click on the map to experience unique sounds from the region... That’s because the University of Salford professor is on a ‘soundseeing’ mission to capture the sonic wonders of the world. ‘The sounds of many places we visit are part of the experience,’ he said. ‘And in some cases, what we hear is more important than what we see.’ Professor Cox has set up a website detailing his acoustic adventures to ancient mausoleums, eerie caves and creaking icebergs. Professor Cox claims that there is an area under four archways in New York's Grand Central station where you can experience a special sound effect. On the way to the lower concourse, two people standing at opposite ends of the underpass can hear each other perfectly, even though they are 10 metres away. 'The stone walls and ceiling do a great job of . reflecting the sound on a path across to the opposite side of the . underpass,' said Professor Cox. His new book, The Sound Book, also catalogues his journeys to these areas. ‘They're places that you want to visit not for the more typical reason, that they've got beautiful views, but because they've got beautiful sounds,’ he told Smithsonian magazine. St. Paul's Cathedral's whispering gallery in London was an obvious choice for his adventures. Thanks to the design of the building, created by Sir Christopher Wren, a whisper can travel around a wall. The sound is trapped against the inside of the curved dome wall. By tilting the walls inwards at the top, less sound goes upwards and gets lost to the top of the dome. But Professor Cox has also visited some less obvious whispering galleries. One such area is the abandoned spy station at Teufelsberg in Berlin which is on top of Devil’s Mountain rising up from the Grünewald forest. This man-made hill was constructed from millions of cubic metres of rubble created by bombing raids and artillery bombardments during World War II. Professor Trevor Cox (pictured) measured the world's longest echo in an oil tank in the Scottish Highlands . The echo in the oil tank at Inchindown lasts a world-record 75 seconds . ‘There are a number of different sounds effects you can play with in the dome,’ said Professor Cox. ‘Climb on top of the concrete plinth and get into the middle of the sphere and the strong focus creates richocheting sounds when you clap your hands. ‘Alternatively, you can try whispering just off-centre, and see if you can find the right spot for whispering into one of your own ears.’ One of the most interesting sites Professor Cox visited is an abandoned oil tank in Inchindown, in the Scottish highlands. Earlier this year, it earned a place in the record books after producing the world's longest echo. Lasting an incredible 75 seconds, the . reverberation smashed the previous record - also set in Scotland more . than 40 years ago - by more than a minute. It . was recorded by Professor Cox in a tank measuring twice the length of a . football pitch, which was 30ft wide and more than 44ft high. The discovery was made by Professor Cox he climbed into the tank at Inchindown, near Invergordon, and started singing and shouting. 'I was like a toddler sitting at a piano for the first time, thrashing the ivories to see what sounds would come out,' he said. 'Reluctantly, after a few minutes I stopped playing with the acoustics and started preparing for my measurements.' Many of Professor Cox's sonic wonders are also result of natural marvels such as the Kelso Dunes in the Mojave Desert, one of about 40 droning dune sites worldwide. At certain times, avalanches of sand fall down these dunes to create bizarre humming sounds. Professor Cox claims acoustic tourism can be done virtually anywhere – even in his hometown of Salford. ‘Some of my favourite sounds in Manchester can be found underneath the arches and bridges that were built during the industrial revolution,’ he writes in his blog. ‘There are plenty of tourist sites where what you hear is essential to the experience, sometimes to the point of being more important than what you see.’ Thanks to the design of St Paul's Cathedral, created by Sir Christopher Wren, a whisper can travel around a wall. The sound is trapped against the inside of the curved dome wall. By tilting the walls inwards at the top, less sound goes upwards and gets lost to the top of the dome .","Trevor Cox from the University of Salford has created an interactive map documenting some of the world's most interesting sounds .

"The American father who, along with his wife, was imprisoned in Qatar for more than a year after being accused of starving their daughter has revealed he was sexually assaulted behind bars. Matthew and Grace Huang finally flew home to Los Angeles on Thursday after a Qatari judge last week cleared them in the death of their eight-year-old adopted daughter, Gloria. A day after her unexplained death in Qatar in 2013, the couple were thrown behind bars. 'I was physically and sexually assaulted,' Matthew CBS News in their first interview. 'Another inmate tried to rape me. I - as a victim - I fought back.' Scroll down for video . Freed: Matthew and Grace Huang arrived back in the U.S. on Thursday after a two-year legal battle following the sudden death of their adopted daughter, Gloria. They spent more than a year behind bars . The couple moved to Qatar in 2012 for Matthew's job as an engineer for an American firm. They moved with their three children, Gloria, Emanuel and Josiah, who were all adopted from Africa. In January 2013, Gloria - who was severely malnourished before she was adopted age four - started foaming at the mouth, her father said. He tried to save her but she passed away in hospital. Without carrying out a full autopsy of the girl, Qatari police turned their attention to the parents, who are of Asian descent. They were suspicious of the mixed-race family, the couple said. An initial police report raised questions about why the couple would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits'. 'They thought we were human traffickers,' Matthew said. 'They said we adopted our children to either harvest their organs or to do medical tests on them. 'I mean, this is an outrageous charge against us - a loving family. But the Qatari authorities just didn't understand multi-ethnic adoption.' Reunited: The couple appeared with their two adopted sons, Emanuel and Josiah, at their church in Pasadena, California on Sunday - but they said they felt the absence of their daughter . Welcomed back: Pastor Greg Waybright led applause for the family during their first public appearance . Grace added: 'For me, the hardest part, I think, was being asked over and over, ""Are you the real mom?""' Prosecutors said the couple denied food to their daughter and locked her in her room at night. The Huangs said Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in Africa. They were thrown in jail and the boys were sent to a Qatari orphanage for four months. While locked up, Grace said she felt fear for her children and guilt that she could not protect them. 'I was angry with myself,' she said. 'Like, what could I have done to keep them from taking the kids away?' Their case was finally heard for the first time in November 2013 and they were convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. But after a year in prison, holes started to emerge in the prosecution's case and a judge granted them bail. Missed: They were thrown in prison after their daughter Gloria (pictured front) suddenly died in January 2013. She had been severely malnourished before she was adopted and suffered an eating disorder . Ripped apart: Following her death, her brothers were put into a Qatari orphanage for four months . A forensic pathologist hired by the family concluded there was 'no medical evidence' that the girl was starved by her parents and a proper autopsy was never carried out. During that time, the U.S. State Department called the case 'unfair' but failed to lobby for their release - and Matthew said he wonders if that was political. 'The U.S. government could have done a lot more, a lot quicker,' he told CBS. 'Qatar is such an important military base -- for the U.S. I felt like the U.S. government was unwilling to rock the boat and unwilling to make a strong stance with knowing that we were innocent.' But the department argued that Secretary Kerry had discussed it with the foreign minister. Then last Sunday, a Qatari judge finally overturned their conviction - but their passports were confiscated at the airport later that day. Their situation remained tense until the moment of their departure Wednesday, with Mr Huang being detained for several minutes at the airport's passport control station as his wife watched in tears. Return: The Huangs finally left Qatar on Wednesday after a appeals judge threw out their conviction . Back home:The couple was reunited with their children and other relatives after they landed on Thursday . They finally arrived back in Los Angeles on Thursday. 'Mission accomplished. Matt and Grace are in Los Angeles,' The David House Agency, which represents them, tweeted. 'They have not stopped smiling.' The couple said they are relieved to be home and were pictured with their two sons at their Pasadena church on Sunday. 'It was just nice to be there with our church family again,' Grace said. 'But at the same time, we were just sitting in our usual order with the kids in between us, but there was just one who was missing.'

After making two appearances off the bench for the West Country side, Burgess will make his full debut under the floodlights and he will be joined in the starting XV by returning Springboks flanker Francois Louw. It is a must-win fixture for Bath, who have already lost pool games to Glasgow and Toulouse but still have a slim hope of qualifying for the knockout stages.

"Arsene Wenger has taken the unusual step of naming his Arsenal side to face Galatasaray over 24 hours before the match kicks off, with three reserve forwards included in the starting XI. Yaya Sanogo, Lukas Podolski and Joel Campbell have been tasked with leading the line for Wenger's side, despite the fact that first place in the group is still up for grabs. The Gunners have already ensured qualification to the knockout stages, but can still take top spot in Group D if they beat Galatasaray and Borussia Dortmund lose to Anderlecht.

"Amir Khan celebrated his 28th birthday on Monday by declaring himself so much a better fighter than he was a year ago that he is now the future of boxing. If he can demonstrate that to the world with a statement performance against America’s Devon Alexander here on the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday night, he hopes the public will give him the present he wants above all others. Namely, that long awaited fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr. Birthday boy Amir Khan says he's the future of boxing ahead of his clash with Devon Alexander . Khan was speaking to reporters at The Delano in Las Vegas ahead of the big fight on Saturday night . Khan (left) with Alexander (right) pose ahead of their fight alongside Victor Ortiz (centre) Khan hopes victory over Alexander in Las Vegas can propel him into a fight with Floyd Mayweather . ‘I’m focussed on Alexander,’ says Khan. ‘But after I beat him I hope the people will say that I deserve to fight Floyd and will demand that he meets me.’ That picture is clouded by the public’s desire to see Mayweather meet Manny Pacquiao in the richest fight of all time. But if that doesn’t happen Khan expects to be ready and waiting for the fight of his life. He says: ‘I have the fastest hands in the ring. I have some of the best skills in boxing. I deserve to be regarded as among the elite fighters in the world, to be talked about in the same breath as Mayweather and Pacquiao. I believe I am the future of boxing.’ The boy from Bolton has never been short of confidence, even after twice losing world title defences, but his detractors are wrong in confusing that self-belief with arrogance. This is the first time Khan has pronounced himself the equal of the two men widely regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighters on the planet. He does so in the certainty that he has eliminated the mistakes which saw him walk on to devastating punches and now knows how to protect a chin which many regard as made of glass. Mayweather (left) has yet to decide who he will face when he returns to the ring next May . Mayweather outpointed Marcos Maidana in their September rematch to extend his unbeaten record . He explains: ‘Even though I’m just turning 28 I still feel young, I’m still hungry and still a nice person. But the difference is that I’m wiser, smarter and I've learned from those mistakes.’ Khan should have fought Alexander a year ago, when the 27-year-old from St Louis held a world title. He pulled out in anticipation of a Mayweather fight and Alexander lost that crown to Shawn Porter, who subsequently had it taken from him by Khan’s British rival Kell Brook. But Khan does not regret starting that chain of events. He says: ‘Everything happens for a reason and I know now that I’m a stronger, smarter fighter than I was 12 months ago. Khan was top of the table as he spoke to boxing journalists in Sin City to cover the Alexander fight . There's no escaping the Khan vs Alexander fight as huge billboard posters fill the lobby of the MGM Grand . ‘That would have been my first fight coming up to welterweight and there’s no doubt that I’m much more ready for Devon now than I would have been then. ‘I've grown into the division. And in the time I had out of the ring Virgil Hunter (his trainer) corrected my errors. He worked on my balance and my defence. He made me realise that although I’m an attacking boxer I need to recognise when to go on the offensive. ‘It’s in my blood to love a fight and that will always be a big part of me. But I have a better grasp of when to concentrate on boxing with abilities and not walk onto big shots. Anyone who does that gets knocked down by the kind of punches I got caught with. ‘Now I know that this is my time.’ Khan made an impressive debut at welterweight with a comfortable points win over Luis Collazo last May . Khan lands a right hand on Collazo during a dominant performance in which he showed vast improvements . This is his first fight since the birth of his first child and he has spent most of the time since that day away from his daughter, his wife and most of his family at Virgil’s gym near San Francisco. He says: ‘I’ve sparred more than 160 rounds. I’ve learned to eat clean because if you put high quality fuel in a racing car it goes even faster. I’ve missed my family. But I’m making the sacrifices because I want the big fights against the best in the world, the chance to prove I belong in the ring with them and see how well I can do.’ Khan’s father and mentor, Shah, does spend time with him at the training camp. His separation from his mother ended, for a few hours on his birthday, as she welcomed him and his father to Las Vegas as they flew in from San Francisco. His eyes light up when he says: ‘I’ll be flying to New York the day after this fight to see my wife and daughter and spend quality time with them over the holidays.’ He expects to make that trip as a hot contender in what is being described here as ‘the Mayweather sweepstakes'. That will depend on him defeating Alexander, another quick and clever boxer, in eye-catching style on his first bill-topping appearance at the fabled MGM Grand Garden. Khan vs Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late Saturday night. Khan believes he has improved considerably under the tutelage of trainer Virgil Hunter .

"Former England international Delon Armitage allegedly threatened to ‘take the face off’ a Leicester supporter as tempers boiled over at Welford Road on Sunday. The Toulon full-back was involved in an angry exchange after his side’s 25-21 defeat in the European Champions Cup. He has also been accused of calling supporters ‘inbred c****’ as he walked towards the dressing rooms at half-time and European Professional Club Rugby last night launched an investigation into that incident. Delon Armitage allegedly threatened to 'take the face off' a Leicester supporter on Sunday . The Toulon full back (left) exchanged angry words with a Leicester supporter during the French side's loss . Ex-Leicester favourite Martin Castrogiovanni added to the drama in the East Midlands with an expletive-ridden attack on former boss Richard Cockerill. Castrogiovanni apologised on Monday night but EPCR are probing his behaviour, too. An eyewitness to the post-match Armitage spat said: ‘Delon got some banter after he walked into the fan bar instead of the players’ lounge by mistake. As he turned away, someone shouted something, which I didn’t hear, and then he reacted. ‘He said, “If that’s the f****** attitude you’re going to take, then let’s take it where nobody can see what happens. Let’s go and do this in the car park, face to face, where I’m going to take yours off”. Armitage (centre) and Mamuka Gorgodze (right) of Toulon are tackled by Jamie Gibson of Leicester . The full-back (centre, in red) has been involved in controversies off the field in the past . ‘Thank God there weren’t any fisticuffs because that would have taken things to a different level.’ The 30-year-old had stormed down the tunnel at full-time, refusing to shake hands with the Leicester players. According to Sportsmail sources, he told Tigers players: ‘We don’t do tunnels in France’, although he is fully aware it is customary in English rugby. It is not the first time Armitage has been involved in controversy. Last year, he was involved in a spat with former England hooker Brian Moore. He called Moore a ‘fat p****’ and told him to ‘Go write another s*** book’ after criticism of his goading try celebration in the 2013 Heineken Cup final. In 2012, the former London Irish player was arrested for an alleged assault in a Torquay nightclub. During his time at the Aviva Premiership club, he was also handed an eight-week ban for pushing and verbally abusing a doping official. Martin Castrogiovanni launched an extraordinary personal attack on his former coach Richard Cockerill . Cockerill (above) attempted to diffuse the situation after Castrogiovanni's expletive-laden  outburst . Sunday’s alleged altercation adds spice to the return leg. If Armitage is not suspended, he should feature in this weekend’s Pool 3 tie, but he can expect a fiery reception from travelling Leicester fans. ‘Players normally stop for photographs and autographs around the area where it happened, so there were a lot of children around,’ added Sportsmail’s source, who has been a Tigers season ticket-holder for more than 20 years. ‘I was shocked. I’ve seen banter flying around, but never experienced that.’ Armitage has been capped 26 times by England but has not represented his country for more than three years. He is the older brother of Steffon Armitage, whose performances for Toulon have led to calls for him to be drafted into Stuart Lancaster’s squad for the World Cup. Neither player nor club was available for comment when contacted by Sportsmail on Monday. Toulon full back Armitage goes to take a kick during the 25-21 loss to Leicester on Sunday evening .

"The mark of a good team is they play poorly and win. Not as poorly as this, mind you. Manchester United were very ordinary indeed. Still, this is their fifth consecutive victory under Louis van Gaal and they have clawed their way up to third in the Premier League, so they must have something. What they had on Monday night was a world-class finisher in Robin van Persie. Since his title-winning first season at United he has often been criticised, but this was one of those occasions when he was the difference. Poor defending from Southampton — horrid for the first goal, in fact — was equally responsible for United’s win, but a lesser striker would not have taken his only two chances of the game with such assurance. To nutmeg the goalkeeper twice is no accident. Van Persie knew what he was doing. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Southampton 1-2 Manchester United .

If only the same could be said for the rest of his team. United’s defence still has little on its side but mystery at times, and Marouane Fellaini is as capable of having a bad game as a good one. Credit Van Gaal with swiftness of thought, though. Sensing that Fellaini was struggling in the heart of midfield, he introduced Ander Herrera at the expense of Paddy McNair after 39 minutes. Having already lost Chris Smalling to injury, it was a bold move. United were impressive in the last 20 minutes when, having gone in front against the run of play for a second time, they toughed it out as the better teams do. David de Gea was impressive in that period, so too Jonny Evans, Smalling’s replacement. He hadn’t played a League game since September but held up well to what little Southampton had to offer by that time. To be fair, they looked stunned at what had unfolded. At 1-1 many here were no doubt thinking of this as two points dropped. Suddenly they had surrendered all three. Quality players make the difference. Van Persie had two good chances and scored two goals. Shane Long was in similarly excellent positions either side of half-time and missed both. The game was won and lost right there. There were 12 minutes gone when Van Persie gave United the lead from their first attack of note. Credit to Wayne Rooney, who did well to apply pressure to centre-half Jose Fonte, but he cannot have expected to force such a thoughtlessly blind backpass. It fell to the prowling Van Persie, leaving him one-on-one with Fraser Forster. England’s understudy advanced but Van Persie’s smart finish went straight through his legs. At that point, it looked as if it might be another sobering occasion for Southampton against their superiors, following reverses to Manchester City and Arsenal.

Smalling (left) had to be helped off the field by a United physio midway through the first half at St Mary's . But no. Ronald Koeman’s team quickly rallied and within three minutes, Graziano Pelle had headed a Steven Davis corner just wide. From Southampton’s next attack, they were level. Fellaini played a desperately poor pass straight to the feet of Davis who went on a marauding run into the area, feeding Pelle, who was tackled. The ball ran to Long wide on the right and his cross was met by Dusan Tadic, whose shot was charged down, only for Pelle to finish from close range. And that set the pattern for the next 40 minutes at least. Southampton should have been three clear when United scored. In first-half injury time, Nathaniel Clyne crossed from the right, Sadio Mane won the ball and it fell to Long, who missed an excellent opportunity. The second half was little more than five minutes old when Tadic crossed to the far post for Long, who again squandered the chance. After 60 minutes, Tadic played the pass of the night to put Pelle in, but Southampton were found wanting in front of goal a third time.

Pelle (centre) is congratulated on his strike against United by the rest of his Southampton team-mates . Those who followed United through the glory years had seen it all before. Mistakes like that get punished. And sure enough, 71 minutes in, Southampton were handed the bill for their profligacy. Rooney swung in the free-kick, Van Persie lost his man at the far post and the merest clipped touch did the rest. It was a lovely, intelligent finish — far harder than he made it look, and it sucked the life out of the opposition. At that moment, Southampton were outnumbering United on chances by virtually five to one. After it, they seemed lifeless and subdued. ‘We didn’t lose to Manchester United,’ said Koeman, ‘we lost against ourselves.’ He had a point. Is this the turning point for Van Persie? He was meant to be the perfect fit for Van Gaal — Holland’s manager and captain during the World Cup reunited at Old Trafford — but like United has been unconvincing this season. Van Persie hit a wonderful hat-trick for David Moyes against Olympiacos last season, but barely played after that and the manager was gone before he returned to the side. United made their second substitution before half-time with Ander Herrera (second right) replacing McNair (second left) for tactical reasons . Van Persie  and Rooney discuss tactics following their a reshuffle by Van Gaal in the first half . Still, that is his sixth goal in 14 appearances for United this season, not the worst return, and Van Gaal’s team are finally finding ways to win. Liverpool visit on Sunday — the match Sir Alex Ferguson always regarded as the biggest of the season — and United have the forward momentum in that match-up now, make no mistake. For Southampton, it gets no easier. Everton, Chelsea and Arsenal are all to come in quick succession, and in the past nine days they have dropped from second to fifth, West Ham United now stealing their thunder as underdogs among the Champions League elite. Koeman will be only too aware that Southampton’s defeats this season have all come against the biggest clubs — Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Manchester City, now Manchester United — and they will have to overcome that fear of heights in the second half of the season if it is not to drift towards anti-climax. Manchester United fans, meanwhile, will dream of chasing down first City, then Chelsea, just like the good old days. They will need to play better than this, though. Good teams find a way to win when playing badly; but they don’t make a career out of it.

"One of the last letters penned on board the Titanic recalling the 'wonderful' journey has resurfaced after 102 years. The message, written on Titanic headed notepaper, was written just hours before the doomed liner stuck an iceberg and sank on Sunday, April 14 1912 with the loss of 1,522 lives. It was due to be posted by Esther Hart after the ship docked but was kept by the author, who survived the disaster along with her young daughter Eva. A letter written by Esther Hart (right) and her daughter Eva, aged seven at the time (centre), is thought to be the last surviving correspondence written on board the Titanic on the day it sank. Benjamin Hart (left) lost his life, when he went down with the ship on Sunday, April 14 1912 . The note is the only known surviving letter written on the fateful day, when the ship sank on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic. It is now set to sell for £100,000 at auction. Mrs Hart, whose husband Benjamin died on board, going down with the ship, wrote to her mother back in England on the day tragedy struck. She said: 'The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage up to now. There has been no tempest. It is very nice weather but awfully windy and cold.' Mrs Hart tells her mother how the ship was expected to arrive in New York 12 hours ahead of schedule due to the speed it was travelling at - one of the factors that resulted in the ship colliding with the iceberg. And she told how her seven-year-old daughter sang her favourite hymn ‘Oh God our help in ages past’ in the church service that morning. She said: 'She sang out loudly, she is very bonny.' The letter was due to be sent by Mrs Hart when the ship docked in New York . Mrs Hart said in her letter: 'The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage up to now. There has been no tempest. It is very nice weather but awfully windy and cold' And she goes on to tell how the ship was expected to arrive in New York 12 hours ahead of schedule due to the speed it was travelling at - one of the factors that resulted in the ship colliding with the iceberg . Seven-year-old Eva left her own message at the end for her grandmother. She wrote: 'Heaps of love and kisses to all from Eva xxxx' Mrs Hart, from Ilford, Essex, also . revealed an onboard concert in aid of the Sailors’ Home in Southampton . that was due to take place the following night. And she apologised for her handwriting being ‘a screw’ as it was due to the Titanic rolling and ‘shakes my arm’. Eva wrote a short note at the foot of the second page which read: 'Heaps of love and kisses to all from Eva.' After the Titanic struck the iceberg in the north Atlantic, Benjamin Hart, a second class passenger, woke his wife and daughter and guided them to lifeboat 14. He told his Eva to hold ‘mummy’s hand and be a good girl’ and that he would see them soon. His body, if recovered, was never identified. The letter was found in the pocket of Benjamin’s sheepskin coat which he gave to his wife to keep warm. When Esther arrived in New York with Eva she sent a cable to her parents to confirm they were safe but her husband was missing. Eva Hart became one of the most well-known survivors of Titanic, mainly because of her outspoken criticism of White Star Line for failing to provide enough lifeboats. Eva Hart was seven years old when she survived the sinking of the Titanic . My dear ones all, . As you see it is Sunday afternoon and we are meeting in the library after luncheon. I was very bad all day yesterday, could not eat or drink, and sick all the while, but today I have got over it. This morning Eva and I went to church and she was so pleased they sang Oh Lord Our Help In Ages Past, that is the hymn she sang so nicely, so she sang out loud, she is very bonny. She has had a nice ball and a box of toffee and a photo of this ship bought her today, everybody takes notice of her ... the teddy bear. There is to be a concert on board tomorrow night in aid of the Sailors Home and she is going to singg, so am I. The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage, up to now there has been no tempest, but God knows what it must be. When there is one, this roughly expanse of water, no land in sight and the ship rolling from side to side is very wonderful tho they say this ship does not roll on account of its size. Anyhow it rolls enough for me, I shall never forget it. It is nice weather but awfully windy and cold.They say we may get into New York Tuesday night but we were really due early on Wednesday morning. Shall write as soon as we get there, this letter won't leave the ship but will remain for me back to England where she is due again on the 26th where you see the letter all of a screw is when she rolls and shakes my arm. I am sending you on a menu to show you how we live, I shall be looking forward to a line from somebody to cheer one up a bit. I am always shutting my eyes and I see everything as I left it, I hope you are all quite well. Let this be an all sound letter as I can't write properly to all till I can set my foot on shore again. We have met some nice people on board and so it has been nice so far. But oh the long, long days and nights its the longest week I ever spent in my life. I must close now with all our fondest love to all of you,From your loving EstHeaps of love and kisses to all from Eva xxxxxx . The letter was intended for Mrs Hart's mother, Mrs Bloomfield, who lived in Chadwell Heath . Eva (centre) and her mother Esther (right) returning to England after the sinking of the Titanic . Eva pictured (left) on the quay in New York after she and her mother were rescued by the RMS Carpathia, and (right) at Buckingham Palace collecting her MBE . The message is thought to be the last surviving letter written on the fateful day, Sunday, April 14 1912, when the Titanic, pictured setting sail from Southampton, collided with an iceberg and sank, with the loss of 1,522 lives . The two-page letter is now being sold by auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, on behalf of a private collector who bought it from the Hart family around 20 years ago. Andrew Alrdidge, of the auction house, said: 'We have sold a number of letters and postcards that were posted by Titanic passengers at Queenstown in Ireland - the last stop before it crossed the Atlantic. 'But this is the only known letter written on Titanic stationary on board on that fateful day. 'The importance of this document cannot be overstated. It is quite simply the jewel in the crown of Titanic manuscript ephemera. 'The letter and envelope are in remarkable condition and the content of it is excellent as it gives a taste of what life was like on board.' At the time of the Titanic disaster the Hart family were emigrating to Winnipeg, Canada, where they were going to run a chemists. But Mrs Hart and her daughter Eva returned to England to live in Chadwell Heath, east London. Mrs Hart died in 1928 aged 65. Eva went on to become a magistrate and died in 1996 aged 91.

'It is alleged that his language and/or behaviour after the end of the fixture was abusive and/or insulting and/or improper.' Jones had been relegated from the Barclays Premier League following a poor display in Manchester City's 3-0 win at Southampton last week. Morgan did apologise on Sunday and has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge. Referee Mike Jones sent off two of Wolves' players during their defeat at Molineux . 'I would like to apologise personally to Mike Jones. I was extremely angry and frustrated at many of his refereeing decisions, and I still am,' Morgan told the club's official site. 'However, I should not have gone pitch side to vent my frustrations.' Wolves were leading 1-0 when Van La Parra was dismissed for what looked like a clash of heads with Steve Cook while Doherty walked late on after a tackle on Brett Pitman. Both face three-match bans but boss Kenny Jackett has confirmed the club will appeal the decisions. He told the Wolverhampton Express & Star: 'We will certainly appeal on both fronts. Personally, and it's only my opinion, I do think that we have a case. 'The information that I've got from the officials is that Van La Parra led with his elbow and because of that it was a red card.' Danny Graham opened the scoring for Wolves but the visitors replied though Harry Arter and Matt Ritchie .","Wolves lost 2-1 to Bournemouth in the Championship on Saturday .

"Liverpool legend and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has launched a scathing attack on Arsenal defender and World Cup-winner Per Mertesacker. The German centre half looked short on form and confidence as the Gunners lost 3-2 to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, and Carragher believes Mertesacker let his team-mates, and in particular his fellow defenders, down. 'What confidence does that (type of performance) give the young lads around him,' Carragher said on Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football. Jamie Carragher described Per Mertesacker's performance against Stoke City as 'unacceptable' Peter Crouch scored within the first 25 seconds against Arsenal and Mertesacker was partly at fault . 'He's got to help these (younger defenders) and protect them and stop them getting asked questions. 'You're in a game away at Stoke in a tough venue - let your players around you know you're not going to accept what's going on. 'This is your captain on the day. We talk about leadership, character - like (Arsene) Wenger always talks about after the game. 'He's abandoned ship, he's left them on their own and that is not acceptable for a player of that quality and experience. He's abandoned ship. It's just not acceptable.'

"Under-fire Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger came out fighting last night, insisting abuse from his own supporters will not break him. The Frenchman was criticised by disgruntled fans, who want him to leave the club, following Saturday’s 3-2 defeat at Stoke City. Internet footage of furious Arsenal fans aiming a torrent of abuse at Wenger as his side boarded a train back to London went viral over the weekend — scenes that Gary Lineker  labelled as ‘disgustingly disrespectful and totally inexcusable’ on Monday. Arsene Wenger walks out on to the London Colney training pitch for Monday morning's session . Arsenal supporters have grown gradually more frustrated with Wenger, and some have called for him to go . It has also been claimed that fights broke out between pro and anti-Wenger fans as tensions flared over the club’s poor run of form. But Wenger has hit back ahead of Tuesday night’s Champions League clash against Galatasaray here, claiming he is man enough to take it. When asked if such abuse was wearing him down, the Arsenal manager defiantly responded: ‘No, not at all. We have to cope with that. We are professional footballers and football people. I am a competitive person. ‘What is important is the next game and responding in a strong way. It is part of our job. We cannot always look for excuses. We are down. Everyone feels it. ‘When you have a disappointment you have to respond. You cannot guarantee you will never lose a game. Many teams will lose at Stoke. You have to be realistic and the response after a defeat is important. ‘This is my 180th Champions League game and that shows something. Many of those were for this club. ‘We want to be judged at the end of the season, not after every game when emotion is high. Let’s get our stability back and see where we are at the end of the season.’ On the incident at Stoke-on-Trent train station, Match of the Day presenter Lineker tweeted: ‘Just saw the Wenger abuse video. Disgustingly disrespectful and totally inexcusable, regardless of any football results.’ VIDEO Scroll down for Arsenal train ahead of Galatasaray Champions League clash .

Jonathan Walters scores to put Stoke 3-0 up, and despite a comeback, Arsenal couldn't equalise . Wenger, whose side have a chance to top Group D if they beat Galatasaray and Borussia Dortmund lose to Anderlecht, wants a much sounder defensive display than the one against Stoke. The returns of right back Mathieu Debuchy, who will make his first appearance in three months since recovering from a damaged ankle, and goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who has missed three weeks with a hip injury, will strengthen the side. However, 13 first-team players are missing as, in addition to their lengthy injury list, Arsenal have left Kieran Gibbs, Danny Welbeck, Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez, who has been carrying a slight groin problem, in London. Wenger led a training session on Monday before the squad flew to Istanbul ahead of Tuesday's match . That means six youngsters: Chuba Akpom, Gedion Zelalem, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Stefan O’Connor, Alex Iwobi and Glen Kamara could be given a chance to impress. Wenger said: ‘What we want is to come back quickly with a strong defensive performance. Against Stoke, we had a bad start and were punished for it. ‘We showed a lack of experience defensively, but we could have scored four or five. The response during the game was strong and everyone is disappointed. ‘We don’t have to come here to qualify and so do not play under too much pressure. We want to win, of course, but what we also want is a different defensive response. I am sure we will get it.’ GALATASARAY (4-2-3-1): Muslera; Tarik Camdal, Semih Kaya, Hakan Balta, Alex Telles; Felipe Melo, Emre Colak; Bruma, Burak Yilmaz, Sneijder; Umut Bulut .

"Still smiling? Nick Buckles, chief executive of GS4, does not know if all Olympic security staff will be able to speak English . Having been forced to apologise for failing to recruit enough Olympics security staff G4S's boss was left red-faced again today after he admitted he had no idea if those who are working could speak English. Asked whether all the security guards the company had recruited could speak fluent English, chief executive Nick Buckles said it was a 'difficult question to answer'. He added: 'I am pretty . sure that they can, but I can’t say categorically as I sit here today.' Later asked the same question by Sky Mr . Buckles said: 'As part of the SIA (Security Industry Authority) training . and as part of the SIA certification you have to be able to speak . English. That’s the standard for the UK security industry.' The G4S supremo's latest revelation follows his apology for failing to provide enough security for the games -  causing the army to be drafted in to plug the hole. Mr Buckles, who earns £1.2million a year, said accepted full responsibility for the fiasco  over providing guards  for the Olympics and has today confirmed the penalty . payment would be in the range of £10million to £20million as a result of the . firm’s failure to meet its commitments. In a statement late last night, the . company disclosed that it stood to lose up to £50 million on its £284 . million contract with the Games organisers, Locog, as a result of the . fiasco. It said it ‘deeply regrets’ the mistakes . which led to 3,500 servicemen being summoned at the 11th hour to plug . gaps in its Olympics security operation. The admission apparently . followed heated discussions with furious Home Office officials. Today G4S has said it will meet the full cost of deploying thousands of extra troops to the London Olympics after it failed to supply sufficient numbers of security guards. However Mr Buckles said that the bulk of the loss would come from paying the Ministry of Defence to supply 3,500 additional troops to make up the shortfall. 'We accept that we underestimated the task of supplying staff for the Olympics. We deeply regret that,' Mr Buckles told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Despite having signed the initial contract in 2010, Mr Buckles said that he had only realised 'eight or nine days ago' that there would be a shortfall in the numbers. 'We are recruiting a large number of people, they are all working through a process of interview, two or three different degrees of training, licensing, accreditation,' he said. Reinforcements: Police patrol the River Lea near the Olympic stadium in a powerboat. They will be providing extra security and emergency responses if anything happens . 'Our review process was around the number of people applying for interviews, we had 100,000 of those, the number of people interviewed which was 50,000. 'So basically you work through that process of numbers and as they were getting ready for deployment over a period of time, it’s only when you get closer and closer to the Games that your realise that the number isn’t as high as you expect.' The Daily Mail has also revealed . police would also have to deploy several hundred extra officers to do . work which should have been done by G4S guards. Senior police officers welcomed G4S’s apology, but privately expressed fears that it was ‘too little and too late’. G4S said it accepted responsibility for the additional cost of the increased military deployment. It is the first open acknowledgement by chief executive Nick Buckles that the world’s largest security provider has dismally failed in its obligations to provide 10,000 staff for Olympic venues since news of the recruitment scandal emerged on Wednesday. ‘The company is also incurring other significant costs as it endeavours to meet the contract challenges,’ the firm admitted. ‘Whilst it is not possible to gauge the precise financial impact, it is estimated that the company will incur a loss on the contract in the range of £35 million to £50 million, all of which will fall in the current financial year.’ Call up: Extra police have been drafted in to fill the gaps in Olympics security caused by blundering private firm G4S . It is understood the deduction in pay for the Olympics work will take G4S out of profit on the Games contract. In its statement, G4S said it had run into difficulties in processing applicants in sufficient numbers through the necessary training and vetting procedures in what it described as ‘an extremely complex workforce supply contract’ on an ‘unprecedented scale’. ‘As a result, we will be unable to deliver all of the necessary workforce numbers,’ it said. ‘We have worked very closely with Locog throughout the build up. At the point we felt that we could no longer assure the scale of the security workforce we had committed to, we advised them of the situation.’ Mr Buckles, who has been summoned to give evidence before the Home Affairs Select Committee next Tuesday, said: ‘We are deeply disappointed that we have not been able to fully deliver against our contract with Locog and that it has been necessary to call upon the additional military personnel.  In partnership with the military and Locog, we are working flat out around the clock to resolve the situation.  We are determined that together we will deliver a successful and secure Games.’ John Connolly, G4S Chairman, added: ‘It is a significant disappointment to everyone at the Company that we have fallen short of our obligations.’ Debacle: The officers will join an additional 3,500 troops who have been drafted in to help protect the Olympic park . As the apology was released, the Mail learnt that several hundred extra police are to be drafted into the Olympics security operation to fill the gaps caused by the blundering private firm. It comes only two days after 3,500 troops had to be called up to help protect the Olympic Park.The latest move is a major embarrassment to Home Secretary Theresa May, who is coming under increasing pressure over her handling of the affair. A senior security source said: ‘Behind the scenes, some senior officers are seething. They have lost confidence in G4S and are angry that they have been left to pick up the pieces.’ G4S admitted earlier this week it might not be able to provide enough guards, resulting in the Army being called in. Now, amid fears G4S will still not be able to provide anywhere near the revised number of security guards it has promised for the Games, police chiefs have been forced to put hundreds of extra officers on Olympics duties. On guard: Two RAF men show off their sniper rifles as the their helicopter hovers over London as part of the Olympic security effort . A total of 17,000 servicemen and women . will now be involved in the Olympics, including 11,800 soldiers, 2,600 . sailors and marines, and 2,600 airmen . They are expected to carry out basic functions such as guarding entrances, and possibly searching spectators and bags. Around 12,000 officers were already due to be on duty across the Olympic venues on peak days, but this figure is now likely to top 13,000.The decision to call in extra police was seen as a sign of the complete lack of confidence senior officers have in G4S. Retired Met chief superintendent Kevin Hurley said: ‘I suspect a number of senior officers who, with their teams, have worked very hard preparing for the Olympics will feel very disappointed at being let down at such a late stage by a private security firm.’ A total of 17,000 servicemen and women will now be involved in the Olympics, including 11,800 soldiers, 2,600 sailors and marines, and 2,600 airmen. Some 11,000 of these will be involved in the security of more than 30 sporting venues and some 70 non-competition venues, including car parks and hotels, while others will carry out specialist support roles. Overall, the security force for the Games will include a mix of military, private security guards and more than 2,000 unpaid London 2012 volunteers. Pointing the way: A steward directs arriving soldiers to the Olympic Park site using a novelty foam hand . Reinforcements: A group of squaddies walk towards an exit from the Olympic Park . A soldier cycles and carries a second bike on the tow path of the River Lea, where his colleagues are temporarily stationed . Last night it was claimed that management at a G4S vetting centre were aware six months ago that it would not meet recruitment targets it was set to provide security at the Olympics. A former employee told Channel 4 News the company knew in January that there would be serious problems reaching the new level of 10,000 Olympic security staff – a figure revised up from 2,000 by London 2012 organisers Locog in December. G4S has not yet responded to the whistleblower’s allegations. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said several hundred officers would be deployed at venues in Dorset and the West Midlands to plug the gap left by G4S. Met Police Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, National Olympic Security Co-ordinator, said:  ‘This is not impacting on our existing plans for the safety and security operation, which we are confident we can still meet.’ The part of the M4 linking Heathrow with West London which was closed for nearly a week while a crack was repaired was reopened yesterday, but can be used only by cars. Buses or lorries over 7.5 tons are still banned.

"Ross Barkley believes the reputation he is gaining as a diver is unfair, claiming, 'I'm a Scouser – we don't do things like that.'

"Brendan Rodgers has called for cool heads as he reminded Liverpool’s players they are not racing against time in Tuesday’s collision with Basle. Liverpool need a win to reach the Champions League’s last 16 but, as Rodgers pointed out, they only need one goal to knock the Swiss side out of the tournament. Part of Liverpool’s threat under Rodgers’ last season was the devastating starts that blew teams away – beating Arsenal 5-1 is perhaps the best example – and there has been a longing from supporters to see that verve return to their play.

'This is a competition that has a great history. That Olympiakos game [in 2004] was a part of the great history. It’s now up to them to write themselves into folklore. We can’t be relying solely on Steven [Gerrard]. 'It is up to other players to be the catalyst. When you are world class, the weight falls on your shoulders but for us to get the result we need, we need the team to be functioning at a good level. 'We are only focusing on the positive. If we get through we can put it to bed and that will give us confidence. I think we are slowly coming back together after a slow period. I have seen signs in recent games of it coming together again. 'We know it is going to be a tough game but we have seen how the crowd can get behind you. If we get through, we can put it behind us and we will have confidence for the rest of our games.'

We don’t have to win the game in the first minute. We have to retain our patience, play a good technical game. If we retain our focus, I believe we will have a great chance. We do not underestimate our opponent but our objective is to win and our focus is purely on ourselves to do that. 'We were a bit soft in our defending. We conceded a disappointing goal from a corner.

"This year, we pledge, Christmas will be done properly. We’ll all cram onto the sofa as the carriage clocks strike three, wearing our paper crowns and toasting the Queen with glasses of liqueur, while the soft snow floats down outside and carollers in Victorian costume sing festive harmonies on the doorstep. Just over two weeks before the big day, everyone is full of the best intentions. But the truth is that Christmas will overwhelm us, as it always does — too much to buy, too many cards to write, too much to cook. By December 25, all we can realistically hope is that the microwave is still working and the dog hasn’t eaten the last of the Quality Street. But television continues to nurture our false hopes. Jamie’s Cracking Christmas (C4) was downright cynical, as chirpy chef Jamie Oliver staged a get-together with his mates to show us how the festivities should be done. Jamie Oliver sprang to fame as the down-to-earth chef, the blokey cook who served good honest grub. Now he’s peddling culinary illusions that make Nigella look like a realist . Clutching cocktails and Michelin-starred party snacks, all the men were wearing outrageously fluffy reindeer pullovers, while the women gazed in admiration at the guys’ athletic dancing. Either all Jamie’s friends are in the chorus line of West End musicals, or this party was a set-up. Outside, children were throwing snowballs in idyllic slo-mo, and turkeys were skipping around the farmyard, gobbling joyously. Mind you, the turkeys had a lot to be joyous about — Jamie was cooking goose this year. The fantasy was whipped to a peak in the kitchen. Jamie’s goose went onto the top shelf of an oven that was big enough to swallow a rhino. Meanwhile, squashes were roasting in a brick-built pizza oven, Jamie was crushing up peppercorns for a spice rub with a solid marble pestle and mortar, and the veg were sizzling in a beautiful iron pan that would have looked antique in the kitchens at Downton Abbey. Jamie Oliver sprang to fame as the down-to-earth chef, the blokey cook who served good honest grub. Now he’s peddling culinary illusions that make Nigella look like a realist. He still has an unbeatable knack for explaining his recipes. Best of the lot was his opening gambit, a bread and butter pudding made from a pannetone — one of those Italian sponge cakes shaped like a jelly mould, which come in shiny boxes. Slicing off the crusts, he laid them in the base of a cake tin and crumbled the soft inner sponge into a creamy custard, which he poured into the tray, larding it with marmalade. After 25 minutes in that colossal oven, it looked delicious. There was a clever tip for roast potatoes too: squish them down a little with a fish slice, and you’ll get more crunchy surface. And if you’re worried about a soggy bottom on your pastry, grill it for two minutes on the hob: ‘Guarantees a crispy bum,’ chortled Jamie. Mary Berry might approve the technique, if not the language. Actress Sarah Parish was the ‘special guest’ on Christmas Kitchen With James Martin on BBC1 . If you’re really hard-up this Christmas, you can take a tip from the Beeb and cobble something together from leftovers. Christmas Kitchen With James Martin (BBC1) stuffed a hole in the afternoon schedules using repeats, promotions and a free-for-all around the studio cookers. Actress Sarah Parish was the ‘special guest’, which meant she spent ten minutes urging everyone to watch her Saturday night adventure series Atlantis. Co-host Brian Turner cheerfully admitted that he had never bothered watching it, and the look Sarah flashed at him suggested he has been expunged from her Christmas card list. Brian made a pie from eggs, bacon, sausages and all the other bits that might go to waste when everyone is too hung over to face breakfast on Boxing Day morning.

"Five inmates who escaped from a California jail have now all been caught and are back in custody two days after they broke free. Roel Soliz, 29, Juan Lopez, 33, Jorge Lopez-Diaz, 26, Abel Ramos, 25, Ricardo Cendejas, 19, are now all back in custody after they got out of Madera County Jail in California. Soliz was the last person to be caught this afternoon. He was apprehended in Fairmead after police received an anonymous phone tip. The four other escapees - who were being held for various charges including attempted murder and armed robbery - were caught late on Saturday evening. Breakout:  Roel Soliz, was the last person of the five escapees to be captured. He broke out of Madera County lockup on Friday with four others including Juan Lopez, right . Captured: Abel Ramos, another inmate who broke out, was being held for a total of eight charges, including attempted murder . The Madera County Sheriff's Major Crimes Unit and Madera Special Investigations Unit made the capture of the four inmates last night. The authorities listed in a Facebook post the charges each man had been held for. Ramos was being held for eight charges: attempted murder, recklessly evading a peace officer, burglary, felon in possession of a firearm, probation violation, receiving stolen property, carrying a concealed weapon, and carrying a loaded firearm. Lopez was being held for four charges: attempted murder, parole violation, strong armed robbery, and probation violation. Escaped: Ricardo Cendejas, left, and Roel Soliz, right, were gone for about an hour before corrections officers discovered they were missing around 9:15 p.m., sheriff's spokeswoman Erica Stuart said. Soliz is the only member of the gang of five who is still missing. The men reportedly escaped from Madera County Jail . Cendejas was being held for five charges: attempted murder, armed robbery, strong arm robbery, carjacking and promoting/assisting further felonious acts with a street gang. Soliz was held for four charges: parole violation, burglary, probation violation, and possession of a controlled substance. Lastly, Lopez-Diaz was being held for strong arm robbery and interfering with an officer. The men were last seen wearing either orange jumpsuits or white T- shirts with blue shorts and orange jail-issued sandals. It is not clear whether they knew or were associated with each other prior to their arrests, Stuart said.","Inmates were hunted down after they broke out Madera County lockup .

"[caption] . Click here for a full report of the game David Moyes was treated to with 10 players booked, two sent off, both coaches dismissed . David Moyes stepped up his quest for summer signings by flying to Lisbon to make a personal check on at least three top transfer targets. Knowing he will be armed with a massive budget for team strengthening at the end of the season, the Manchester United manager attended Porto’s Portugal Cup semi-final with Benfica at the Estadio da Luz, in an attempt to narrow down a long list of candidates to bolster his side in all areas. Sportsmail understands the two players under closest review were highly-rated centre-back Eliaquim Mangala and his Porto team-mate Jackson Martinez. In addition, Moyes has also been alerted to the form of Benfica’s on-loan left-back Guilherme Siqueira and was keen to see him in action.

Mindful that Mangala is also being seriously considered by Manchester City, as Manuel Pellegrini looks to bring in a suitable defensive partner for skipper Vincent Kompany, Moyes seized the opportunity to run the rule over the lynchpin of Porto’s back four before deciding whether to follow up his interest with a bid. He is evidently reluctant to meet the central defender’s £37.8million buy-out clause but may take the chance to sound out Porto officials to see if there is room for manoeuvre. Man in the stands: United boss Moyes, pictured here watching Fleetwood Town vs Chesterfield last October, was watching in Lisbon . Moving on? Fabio Coentrao gestures to Neymar in the Copa del Rey final... but will the Portuguese be joining Manchester United? Top target: United are chasing the signature of Luke Shaw - and will tempt Southampton with a £30m offer . Colombia marksman Martinez has established himself as one of the Portuguese League’s most prolific finishers, to such a degree that he has attracted the attention of Roma, Arsenal and Chelsea, as well as United, in recent weeks. Moyes has long been linked with Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao and is closing in on Southampton’s Luke Shaw, as revealed in Sportsmail. But as a contingency plan, he is keeping an eye on the form of Siqueira, who is on loan at Benfica from Granada.","Manchester United boss flew to Lisbon to see a trio of targets .

"From the American Civil War to modern day Afghanistan, these heartwarming pictures reveal the enduring bond between soldiers and their dogs over the centuries. Many of the images capture cherished pets providing fleeting moments of respite for battle-weary troops during times of war. They show a common theme across the globe, with soldiers from the UK and U.S. to Russia and China all pictured with faithful dogs in tow. Soldier's best friend: A member of the Irish Guards with an Irish wolfhound in 1987. The handsome breed has been the regiment's mascot since 1902 . One picture shows famous Second World War officer General George Patton playing with his favourite bull terrier, while others show Allied troops accompanied by pet dogs while on patrol in Iraq and Afghanistan. The use of dogs in warfare dates back to ancient times. As well as providing soldiers with affection and companionship while far from home, dogs have also been trained to act as scouts, sentries and trackers to aid their masters in battle.

In ancient times the Greeks and Romans regularly used dogs as sentries during times of war, and sometimes the animals were taken into battle. Attila the Hun used powerful Molosser dogs in his campaigns, while the Spanish Conquistadors were said to have used armoured dogs that had been trained to kill. The soldiers set the dogs on natives as they travelled the globe conquering territories. In the U.S. the American pit bull terrier was used in the Civil War both as a means of protection for soldiers and to send messages. The dogs also appeared on propaganda and recruiting posters in the U.S. during World War I. In recent years in the U.S., some troops in Afghanistan and Iraq have been accompanied by military working dogs. The animals are paired with a handler after being trained for detection work, such as helping to search for survivors after an explosion.","Touching photographs capture the bond between soldiers and their pets over the centuries .

"The Premier League's sale of TV rights for the 2016-19 seasons will go ahead as planned after broadcast regulator Ofcom rejected a bid from Virgin Media to halt the process. The sale is expected to deliver another bumper payday for top-flight clubs and should be completed this month - possibly even by the end of this week - after the Premier League sent out its invitation to tender (ITT) in December. Ofcom is still investigating a complaint from Virgin Media about how the Premier League sells its TV rights but rejected the application to halt the sale until the investigation is completed. Arsenal and France striker Olivier Giroud is challenged by oncoming Aston Villa defender Jores Okore . Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis slides to challenge Chelsea attacking midfielder Eden Hazard . A statement from Ofcom said: 'Ofcom has today decided to reject the application, as it does not consider that there is an urgent need to intervene to delay the auction. 'There will be a significant gap, of around 17 months, between the auction and the start of the 2016-2017 season when broadcasting of the relevant matches will commence.' The regulator did say however it could enforce action if its investigation does find fault with the league. The statement added: 'In the event that Ofcom's investigation concludes that there is an infringement, Ofcom has the necessary powers to require the Premier League and Premier League clubs to make changes to arrangements for the broadcasting of matches within the time available before the start of the relevant season. Chelsea forward Diego Costa and Liverpool midfielder Emre Can jump and compete for the ball . 'The investigation is ongoing and will consider the potential harm to competition and consumers arising from joint selling under the auction.' The Premier League has also confirmed to Ofcom it will put in place arrangements in any contracts with broadcasters to address any consequences if the investigation find it has breached competition rules. Ofcom said it expects to publish a further document in March into the complaint by Virgin Media that the Premier League's joint selling means domestic consumers pay too much to watch matches on TV. The current three-year deal with Sky and BT Sport is worth just over £3 billion to the Premier League clubs. Brigitte Trafford, Virgin Media's chief corporate affairs officer, said: 'We welcome Ofcom's confirmation that it can, and will, intervene after the auction if it reaches the conclusion that it needs to remedy any consumer harm. The Premier League has acknowledged this and has agreed to implement any action Ofcom may take.' Tottenham playmaker Christian Eriksen scores a 20-yard free-kick against West Brom at The Hawthorns .

"Chelsea Martin managed to keep her hair whilst having chemotherapy for breast cancer . With not one, but two, requests to be a bridesmaid for close friends, Chelsea Martin had every intention of looking her absolute best as she walked down the aisle at each wedding. And a major preoccupation was what to do with her hair. Her concern went beyond which style to go for. Facing gruelling chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, her worry was whether she would have any hair at all. 'As a cancer patient, your first concern is: 'Will this disease kill me?' ', explains Chelsea, 30, an advertising manager who lives in London with her boyfriend. 'But what can make things so much harder is the fact that when you lose your hair, you look like a cancer patient. I didn't want pitying looks. 'I didn't want anyone who wasn't close to me knowing I had the disease or was undergoing treatment. When you look normal, you feel so much better. It's such a morale boost to go out and find no one treats you any differently.' With the weddings looming just months after she started chemotherapy in May, Chelsea was persuaded to try 'scalp cooling' to help her retain her shoulder length, strawberry blonde hair. Chemotherapy works by attacking rapidly dividing cells - that is, cancer cells. However, healthy cells that also divide rapidly can be affected, including cells in the stomach (which is why chemo can cause nausea), and the hair follicles - the tiny openings in the skin that produce hair. If the amount of chemotherapy drugs reaching the follicles can be reduced - especially during the peak period of treatment a couple of hours after chemo has started - there is a chance the hair is less likely to fall out, explains Dr Craig Macmillan, a consultant clinical oncologist at Northampton General Hospital. Scalp cooling or 'cold cap' treatment involves wearing a lightweight silicone cap that's connected to either a small refrigeration unit or filled with a liquid cooling gel, both of which can reduce the temperature of the scalp to around -4c, to reduce blood flow to the scalp. The cold cap is placed on the patient's head about an hour before chemotherapy begins - it's worn throughout the session while the drug is being given, as well as for an hour afterwards as the drugs may still be circulating in the blood (there are no long-term health effects but some users may experience headaches). She wore a lightweight silicone cap which can reduce the temperature of the scalp to around -4c . The treatment isn't guaranteed to stop hair falling out - and even for patients who keep the majority of their hair, some follicles can still be damaged by the chemo drugs, leading to some hair loss, or thinning hair. The cap is worn during each chemo session - Chelsea had the treatment during all six rounds of her chemotherapy, for four hours a time, over four-and-a-half months - and it worked. She was able to wear her hair long for one of the weddings, and up for the other. 'I just loved every moment being a bridesmaid,' she says. 'My boyfriend says he would love me any way I looked, but it meant so much to me that we could go on dates and that I could feel pretty. 'It may not be for everyone. But for me it meant I could go on with day-to-day life without being reminded that I had cancer.' Research published by the United States National Library of Medicine found that 47 per cent of female patients considered hair loss the most traumatic aspect of chemotherapy. Yet according to the breast cancer charity Walk the Walk, which has been raising money to place scalp coolers in all UK hospitals, many are unaware this technology exists, even though it's available in many areas (although there aren't enough devices nationally to offer all patients who might need them). There needs to be far greater encouragement of the use of the cold cap, where appropriate, adds Justin Stebbing, professor of cancer medicine at Imperial College, London. 'We need to raise awareness that it's the little things that make people feel better. 'It's something women should at least be given the option of trying, since clearly in some cases it does work and with minimal additional cost to the hospital,' he says. For patients who keep the majority of their hair, some follicles can still be damaged by the chemo drugs . When Michaela Beth, 37, a mother-of-four from Leeds, had chemotherapy for breast cancer last year, she says she wasn't given any encouragement to use the cold cap - though she knew about it after researching on the internet. 'I was told that for every symptom I had such as nausea, the hospital could help me - with the exception of hair loss,' she says. 'When I broached the cold cap, I was shown it in a cupboard and told by the breast care nurses: 'You don't really want to use that. It's so freezing cold and it's not always effective. So why put yourself through it?' ' In fact, a 2012 review of 1,411 breast cancer patients found that around 50 per cent retained enough hair during their treatment that they didn't feel the need to cover their heads. Michaela continues: 'At the time, I was feeling pretty vulnerable and looking back I simply didn't have the determination to pursue the cold cap. So I lost my hair after the second session, which was awful. Your morale just drops through the floor and it was frightening for my children. 'It would have been nice if someone could have encouraged me to at least try it.' The cold cap isn't suitable for patients whose disease is at an advanced stage and has spread significantly, says Dr Macmillan. 'There is a very remote chance that cancer cells may have escaped to the scalp and if you cool the scalp they could be sheltered there. And in theory, once the treatment stops, the cancer cells could move and grow elsewhere.' For similar reasons, it's not used for patients with blood cancers, such as leukaemia, as the cancer is circulating around the body. Nor is it suitable for those having continuous chemotherapy over several days, as it's impractical to keep the scalp cooler on so long. Chelsea had the treatment during all six rounds of her chemotherapy - and it worked . Chelsea had never heard of the cold cap until she was diagnosed with grade 3 aggressive cancer having noticed a thickening in her right breast a few months earlier. 'It was a terrible shock as I was young, fit and there was no disease in my family,' she says. 'There was so much to take in, but among the things I read was something about the cold cap. 'I've always had a lot of hair, and at the London Oncology Clinic, where I was due to have my chemotherapy, they were very encouraging of using the cold cap.' The treatment wasn't entirely comfortable, she says: 'It was absolutely freezing - almost like a burning sensation, or that kind of 'brain freeze' feeling you get when you eat very cold food.' Despite having a heating pad and heavy blankets for her four-hour treatment, she was still 'desperately cold, and my head felt like a block of ice, but I coped'. Chelsea's hair did become a little thinner, but not noticeably so. So why isn't the cold cap more widely used? A review found that around 50 per cent retained enough hair using a scalp cooler, such as the one pictured . Professor Stebbing says it may be because patients have to spend longer in the chemotherapy department and some departments don't have the capacity as there are too many patients. Also, he says: 'It can be painful and uncomfortable and perhaps that deters some centres from encouraging use of it.' And when it doesn't work, the disappointment can be crushing. When Debbie Madison, 44, a sales assistant from Hale, Cheshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010, the first thing she asked her oncologist was whether she would lose her hair. Told that she would, she immediately asked about the cold cap, having heard about it from a friend. 'The hospital was happy for me to give it a try. Their approach was, well we doubt it'll work, but have a go. 'It was horrendous, I had absolute brain freeze it was so cold. I kept thinking I can't do this. But I persisted through the session, which went on for about four hours. 'I was due to have more chemo three weeks later, but after week one, my hair began to fall out. I was so disheartened, I didn't have the energy or fight to carry on and see if it would make a difference.' However Chelsea was more than happy with the results: 'It helped so much knowing that despite the treatment I was keeping my hair.'","Chelsea Martin, 30, from London was persuaded to try 'scalp cooling'

"A dog walker playing fetch on a beach reached for a pebble to throw to her pet - only to find she had picked up a Second World War grenade. After picking up the dangerous explosive, Clair Watson, 41, called over to another walker and he phoned his son - who just happens to be an Army explosives expert. He set up a cordon - averting a potentially deadly game of fetch - and called in a bomb disposal team to the beach at Dovercourt, near Harwich, Essex, yesterday. Clair Watson, pictured with husband Michael and dog Bonnie, found a  grenade while walking along a beach . Mrs Watson mistook the World War Two hand grenade for a pebble during a game of fetch with Bonnie . She sought help from a fellow walker, whose son - an Army explosives expert - called in a bomb disposal team . Mrs Watson and her dog Bonnie found the fifth grenade in as many weeks on the beach, prompting the police to issue a warning to walkers. Speaking of the heart-stopping moment, Mrs Watson said: 'I was going to throw it for the dog. 'It wasn't until I picked it up that I thought that is a weird looking stone. 'It didn't look like a hand grenade at all at first, but then I looked it. 'I said to my husband: ""What the hell is that?"". He said it looked like a hand grenade.' A bomb disposal squad, police officers and the coastguard rushed to the beach and safely removed the explosive. The beach, in Harwich, Essex, is popular with families with young children, especially during the holidays . Lucky escape: Mrs Watson says she feels lucky as the grenade 'could have blown up' in her hand . Mrs Watson said: 'I am a bit worried about walking the dog there now. 'I am still in shock. It could have been a kid that picked it up and they would have thrown it, and the fact there are people in the sea swimming around. 'It could have blown up in my hand, it wasn't even heavy, I do feel quite lucky.' 'I joked to the policeman [and said] I had been about to throw it for the dog but I would never have thrown it.' Bomb disposal experts conducted a controlled explosion on three grenades found on the beach in July, and were called out to another grenade discovered on Saturday. Juliet Willis lives near to the beach and saw the team in action then. She said: 'Two bomb disposal guys arrived, walked over to the grenade, then one picked it up. 'My mouth hit the floor. 'There was about 20 people watching, the area was cordoned off with a police car and policemen a coastguard vehicle and police tape.' This is the fifth time a grenade has been found there in five weeks, with police warning walkers to be vigilant . Inspector Paul Butcher, of Essex Police, said the grenades might have been in a crate that ended up in the sea during WWII. He said: 'That crate might be breaking up or has been disturbed by dredging and has resulted in these devices being washed ashore along the same stretch of beach. 'We are asking people to be vigilant if visiting this beach and to dial 999 if they find any of these devices. 'Some of them have been covered in barnacles but the one yesterday looked almost as new despite being in the sea, possibly for many years. 'Anyone who finds a grenade should not touch it or move it but should call police immediately.' Councillors are also considering a metal detector 'sweep' of the beach to search for any more explosive devices that could be hidden among the pebbles.","Clair Watson, 41, picked up hand grenade on Dovercourt beach in Essex .

"As the daughter of Greg Scarpa, a notorious mobster, Linda Schiro has lived constantly racked with guilt about the brutal beatings and murders that her father carried out. The 42-year-old, who is writing a memoir about growing up with one of the most renowned men in the New York crime underworld, recalls how her father could kill someone and then watch TV with her 'five minutes later'. Scarpa, who was known to peers as The Grim Reaper, was an integral part of the Colombo mob war - boasting that he gave up counting his murder victims after killing 50 people. Brutal: Linda Schiro is writing her memoirs about growing up with notorious mob boss, Greg Scarpa, as her father. Scarpa - known as The Grim Reaper - boasted that he gave up counting his murder victims . In an interview with the New York Post, Schiro describes her upbringing as ‘like growing up with a serial killer.’ Remembering her painful childhood, Schiro, who was known as Little Linda while her mother was dubbed Big Linda, told the paper: 'He could transform himself. He could go kill someone and five minutes later he’d be home watching Wheel of Fortune with my brother and me.' And Schiro reveals how her gangster father would take savage revenge on anyone who interfered with her, including one a boy who dared kiss her on her doorstep. A particularly haunting memory dates back to 1983, when 14-year-old 'Little Linda' was assaulted by Jose Guzman, a driver who was taking her to school. Guzman pulled over the car before tearing the buttons off the schoolgirl’s shirt and licking her hand. Gangster: Greg Scarpa Sr., pictured here with his wife, 'Big Linda', was one of the most feared mob bosses in New York's organised crime world - he is thought to have killed at least 50 people . Mafia marriage: Big Linda Schiro, right, was wife of mobster Gregory 'The Grim Reaper' Scarpa, a Colombo who once said he had stopped counting the number of his murder victims at 50 . Thinking quickly, she avoided further abuse by telling her attacker she would meet him after school instead. She called her mother from the school in floods of tears. Of course, Big Linda told Scarpa who found out where Guzman lived and marched to his home – armed with a cane. After charming Guzman into walking with him to the park, Scarpa’s gang pounced and carried out a violent attack that left the driver with a broken nose, wrist and ribs. Scarpa himself beat Guzman so viciously that he broke his cane. Weeks later Guzman was gunned down in broad daylight by Scarpa’s oldest son, Greg Jr. No one was charged with the killing. Widow: 'Big Linda' was left widowed after Greg Scarpa died of AIDS in 1994 . Schiro remembers her father telling her that she didn’t have to worry about that guy anymore. The so-far innocent teen found out what her father meant when she later overheard the gang, gathered in her living room, discuss how Guzman tried to run for his life before being shot in the head. But friends of the girl who committed far less serious transgressions were also attacked by The Grim Reaper. A 14-year-old boy, whom Schiro described as her ‘best friend’, had his face beaten in after he smoked marijuana with the mob boss's daughter. ‘How he survived, I don’t know — it was a massive beating,' Schiro recalls to the Post. 'Greg said, ""See, this is what happens when you give my daughter drugs!"" ' Scarpa called himself ‘The Killing Machine’ – even signing letters to his family ‘KM’  but Schiro also remembers him as a ‘loving father.’ 'My father was a different type of gangster. He let us know what was going on — street business, if they need to hit someone. It made me fear telling him things. But I was so much of a daddy’s girl. And he was extremely loving and caring towards us. He was my best friend,' she told the Post. However, describing him as a ‘family man’ would be fanciful as Schiro believes that among his victims was Scarpa's own brother, her uncle Sal. Another victim of the gang life was Scarpa’s son, Joey, who was shot in the eye during one fight before being shot dead less than a year later in the early nineties. Schiro also recounts discovering her father's big secret - that he was also working for the FBI. Broken family: Scarpa with daughter 'Little Linda', wife 'Big Linda' and son Joey, who died in a mob shooting . After confessing that FBI agent Lindley DeVecchio was his boss, Scarpa instructed his daughter not to mention the cop's name outside their house. She said: 'He used to tell us he was James Bond. So I asked, ‘What do you mean, you’re an agent?’ He loved those movies. He’d say, ‘I’m Bond, Greg Bond.' Scarpa himself was arrested in 1992 for murder and racketeering, and died just two years later from Aids. But despite the wealth he enjoyed while he was alive, his millions vanished after his death, leaving his family with nothing. Until recently, Schiro supported her mother and three young children by working as a liquor and beer-sales rep. She described writing the book as ‘very hard’ emphasising that she did not want to ‘hurt people [or] glorify this life.’ ‘This life destroyed my family,’ she added. Linda eventually got married, at age 21, to a banker from Long Island. Scarpa initially supported the marriage, but came to believe the husband was a threat. She said: 'He said, ‘I want to kill him, but I need your permission. I don’t want you to live with the guilt.''I said, ‘You can’t do that!’ But ultimately, he was right. My husband tormented me.'","Linda Schiro, 42, was daughter of notorious NYC mobster Greg Scarpa .

"For some, drones represent a frightening future where people will be constantly surveyed. But one startup thinks small, unmanned aircraft should be seen as approachable and has even positioned them as flying pets that can be taken for a walk on a leash. There are strict rules governing where drones can be used and by whom, but keeping a drone on its lead could side step safety and some privacy concerns. Scroll down for video . High Flyer: One start-up thinks small unmanned aircraft should be friendly and has even positioned them as flying pets that can be taken for a walk on a leash (pictured) Fast: Fotokite is built to be launched and fully operational in under one  minute, unlike more complex drones which take time to check and calibrate. Easy to navigate: The drone does not rely on trained operators, GPS or sophisticated sensing for controlled flight. To the user, flying the camera is as simple as holding a kite, and framing the picture is as easy as rotating your hand-held monitor. Accountable and safe: Existing drones can be difficult to manoeuvre in windy conditions and can be dangerous. The Fotokite's tether provides a safer way to fly and allows close-proximity operations. The tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners, the company said. Rule-abiding: The drone can be regulated as a kite under FAA UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) guidelines. Fotokite is a small quadrocopter that is compact and simple – designed to be used by people for taking aerial photographs of places and events such as family parties and weddings. It does not rely on GPS, machine vision or even a compass for navigation, which should decrease the chances of crashes. Sergei Lupashin, the Zurich-based roboticist behind the innovation, told the BBC: ‘Should something happen, the leash gives a robust fail safe - the vehicle reduces thrust and it automatically comes back to the operator.’ Unlike more complex ‘professional’ drones, the Fotokite prototype can be launched and working in under one minute and can be flown by people with no experience of operating complicated systems, radios and complicated aircraft.

It enables close-proximity operations and the tether provides visual accountability for bystanders and property owners,’ the start-up said. Dr Lupashin told MailOnline: 'We are passionate about making aerial photography safer and more accessible to everyone.' Importantly, because the aircraft is tethered to a leash, it can be classified as a kite and therefore skirt laws governing the use of drones, the company claims. On a tight leash: 'The Fotokite's tether (pictured) provides a safer, more direct way to fly.

They must never be flown beyond the . normal unaided ‘line of sight’ of the person operating them. This is generally . measured as 1,640ft (500m) horizontally or 400ft (122m) vertically. An . unmanned aircraft fitted with a camera must always be flown at least 164ft (50m) distance away from a person, vehicle, building or structure. An unmanned . aircraft fitted with a camera must not be flown within 492ft (150m) of a . congested area or large group of people, such as a sporting event or concert. Consideration . must be shown to other airspace users. Therefore unmanned aircraft should not . be used in the vicinity of airports or within restricted airspace. Commercial . drones are banned in the U.S. and there are laws banning their flight . within close proximity of people, buildings and bridges for example in the UK. Ben Gielow, general counsel for the Association . for Unmanned Vehicles Systems Internet is unsure whether the leash would bypass such laws. The UK's Civil Aviation Authority told MailOnline that it is difficult to know whether the aircraft would fall within current rules and regulations without knowing more about where it would be flown and other specifics. Dr Lupashin was inspired to create the drone on a . leash during street protests in Bolotnaya Square in Moscow when he . realised how useful an aerial perspective would be for journalists . reporting the event. But the idea evolved in an unlikely direction and Dr Lupashin saw potential for the technology to be used as a toy as well as by photographers, archaeologists and architects. He has created a prototype of the ‘pet’ drone based heavily on a quadrocopter he bought from a shop, which he demonstrated at the recent TED conference using a leash for a small dog. His device can shoot video as well as take photos and he thinks that while people fear military drones and large unmanned vehicles flying high above them, they will be less suspicious of a flying camera on a leash used by normal people. He said: ‘People treat you normally - it is like a flying pet. It always has a physical connection to the operator’. There is no launch date or price for the drone yet, but it will be available to pre-order 'soon'.

"Sexual threats and menacing one detainee with a power drill are expected to be among controversial CIA torture techniques revealed in a report later today. The report will detail interrogation techniques used by CIA agents in the wake of 9/11, including threats to sexually assault one captive with a broomstick, according to sources. It also describes how terrorist Abdel Rahman al Nashiri, suspected mastermind of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, was threatened with a buzzing power drill. The tool was not used on him. The White House has increased security at U.S. facilities across the globe today in preparation for a global backlash at the contents of the report. Scroll down for video . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sparred with reporters today over news reports claiming that Secretary of State John Kerry called the chairwoman of the Senate committee discharging the torture report to ask her to delay its distribution, arguing that Kerry 'strongly supports' the release of the declassified document 'for the same valued-based reasons that the president does' Meeting: President Obama today as he held brief talks with Prince William. The president has held talks with his predecessor over the report but the contents of the calls are not being disclosed . However the Obama administration remained committed to publishing the incendiary details, insisting that the torture program 'should never happen again'. The report, which took years to produce, charts the history of the CIA's 'Rendition, Detention and Interrogation' program, which President George W. Bush authorized after the Sept. 11 attacks. Most of the program was shut down by Bush before he left office, while Obama outlawed 'enhanced interrogation techniques' after his inauguration. Yesterday a government official sparred with journalists over reports claiming that Secretary of State John Kerry tried to have the report delayed at the 11th hour. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that Kerry 'strongly supports' the release of the declassified document 'for the same valued-based reasons that the president does'. At the same time he declined to extend the administration's proclaimed zeal for transparency to possible phone calls between the current president and former president Bush to discuss the contents of the report. Earnest said any talks that may have taken place between Obama and Bush would remain private. Even though the redacted paper will reportedly absolve the former president and his White House of knowledge of the extent of which the CIA was allowed terrorism suspects to be tortured in Europe and Asia in the wake of 9/11, Bush has openly opposed the the release of the document. 'We’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,' he told CNN’s Candy Crowley during an interview that aired Sunday. 'These are patriots. And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base,' he continued, calling the CIA operatives and directors about to be chastised 'really good people'. Bush has been joined by other Republicans and members of the intelligence community in calling on the Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate's Intelligence Committee, to bag the truncated version of the still-classified 6,000 page report. 'I think this is a terrible idea,' House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, told Crowley on Sunday. 'Our foreign partners are telling us this will cause violence and deaths. Foreign leaders who have approached the government say you do this, it will cause violence and deaths. Our own intelligence community has assessed that this will cause violence and deaths,' he said. According to a report by Bloomberg View, Kerry called Feinstein on Friday to voice similar concerns and asked her to keep a lid on the report a little longer. After word of Kerry's call to the California senator spread like wildfire, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement that Kerry 'called his former colleague to discuss the broader implications of the timing of the report's release because a lot is going on in the world.' 'He wanted to make sure that foreign policy implications were being appropriately factored into timing,' including 'our ongoing efforts against ISIL and the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,' she said. 'That anyone would mischaracterize this call or question reasonable, proper, private discussions raises questions about what they’re trying to accomplish,' she added. John Kerry allegedly tried to have the report delayed at the 11th hour and 'called his former colleague to discuss the broader implications of the timing of the report's release because a lot is going on in the world' Asked today about claims that Kerry tried to get Feinstein to shelf the report, White House spokesman Earnest pointed reporters to the State Departments statements and reiterated the administration's approval of the Senate committee's decision to make public certain sections of classified document. 'I will allow Secretary Kerry to explain exactly why he made the phone call,' Earnest said. He later stated that he stated that the legislative branch is constitutionally guaranteed oversight of the executive branch and it is 'free to exercise that oversight authority without inappropriate interference' from president and his administration. At another point he said the White House has 'been candid from the beginning we believe it's the committee's decision to determine the appropriate timing for the release of this report.' 'The administration has taken the prudent steps to ensure that the proper security precautions are in place' and has been preparing 'for months now for this report's eventual release,' he said today. Earnest refused to tell reporters what precautionary measures had been taken and at which embassies, saying that 'wouldn't be a wise security strategy,' but a Defense official told CNN on Monday that more than 6,000 Marines deployed abroad had been put on standby. Pointing out that in his first days in office Obama used executive action to put a stop to the harsh interrogation procedures detailed in the report, Earnest told reporters that the president 'does not believe' they were 'justified . The president's spokesman said Obama believes that regardless of where one comes down in the debate, 'the use of these techniques was not worth it because of the harm that was done between our national values.' Torture: The report concentrates on the activities of the CIA under the Bush administration, which also saw the establishment of a detention center at Guantanamo Bay which al Qaeda suspects continue to be held . The Obama administration official said that it doesn't matter if the torture tactics did 'unearth useful information.' 'Even if they did,' he said the president believes 'that it wasn't worth it, and it did not enhance the national security of United States of America.' Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published on Sunday that the interrogations undermined 'societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of.' 'Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again,' she said. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden on Sunday pushed back against critics of the agency's behavior under his direction during the final years of Bush's tenure, from 2006 to 2009. 'To say that we relentlessly over an expanded period of time lied to everyone about a program that wasn’t doing any good — that beggars the imagination,' he said on CBS' Face the Nation. Hayden and other former CIA directors who served under Bush have promised to release a report of their own setting the record straight once the Senate has published the redacted document that it spent five years making. 'Once the release occurs, we’ll have things to say and will be making some documents available that bear on the case,' John McLaughlin, a former deputy director under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush told the New York Times on Sunday. McLaughlin, who also served as acting director of the CIA for a short time in 2004, criticized the Senate report  and claimed it 'uses information selectively, often distorts to make its points, and as I recall contains no recommendations.'","One detainee threatened with sexual assault with broomstick, it is claimed .

"Liverpool lost in the region of £25m in the deal which saw Luis Suarez join Barcelona. The sale of Suarez was always going to happen this summer as reported in this column FIRST. But the predicted £100m fee that Liverpool wanted did not materialise. Unmistakeable: Luis Suarez joined Barcelona with a trademark grin . Costly: Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini hit Liverpool hard in the pocket . Everton and Tottenham still want Romelu Lukaku despite his poor World Cup showing. But the Belgium striker is being pursued by Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg. That was because an auction between Barca and Real Madrid did not happen. Madrid withdrew any interest after Suarez’s bite saga at the World Cup. But Liverpool feel they have done well at £75 million, even though the Uruguayan’s confirmed buy-out clause was £100m. Wilfried Zaha is poised to leave Manchester United for Newcastle. Manchester City wanted to sign Lionel Messi this summer. City would have gone as far as paying Messi’s buy out clause from Barcelona of £200million. With the addition of crowd funding with sponsors the deal had been a matter of negotiation for months with City’s hierarchy and several agents. But Messi recently signed a new contract with Barca worth £16.3million a year. Leader: Lionel Messi has dragged Argentina to the World Cup final with a string of fine displays . Happy to stay: Messi's new deal at Barcelona is worth over £16m a year . Lionel Messi is 9-2 to be first goalscorer in the World Cup final with Coral. City could afford the money given their oil rich Arab owners and other partners. But the Argentine, who is the central figure of the World Cup final, is satisfied with how he has been looked after by Barca. Even given the massive amount Messi has been paid he showed a sense of loyalty. City were willing to outbid Barca, but the impact of FIFA's Financial Fair Play regulations de-railed their bid. Manchester United are still trying to lure Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich in a £40 million deal. Liverpool and Tottenham are in a battle for Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony. After signing Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal . will try to lure German midfielder Sami Khedira in a £24m move as the . Gunners seek to re-assert themselves as a Barclays Premier League title . contender. I-Say . No, I’ve never seen a game quite like it and I doubt I ever will again. Germany 7 Brazil 1. In a World Cup semi-final. In Brazil. It was fantasy fussball from Germany. Brazil expected fireworks in the favelas but in the end it became a funeral pyre. In many ways, they got what they deserved. Having abandoned their romantic roots of stylish samba soccer in favour of a mean, rough, win at all costs approach insisted upon by manager  Big Phil Scolari, they were simply outplayed by a group of superior players, in a superior system, who were never going to be out muscled. Brazil, having sold their soul ended up in hell; Dante’s Inferno, indeed. The Brazilian player Dante, like all his team-mates, ended up being tortured before being condemned. Germany passed them to death. It was, to turn a phrase on its head, just like watching Brazil but with added efficiency. The football was sublime but ruthless too. History makers: Germany celebrate their stunning 7-1 win over Brazil in the World Cup semi-finals . Yes the absence Neymar and Thiago Silva made a difference but in that respect it was a case of bonfire of vanities for Brazil. The Neymar fixation, right down to Scolari wearing a cap bearing his name when they arrived at the stadium, and the players waving his shirt during the national, undermined them. Even when Pele was in his pomp the team did not rely so heavily on him. There were plenty of others who could play Jogo Bonito like Rivelino, Tostao, Gerson and Jairzinho. But having shelved the samba soccer Brazil didn’t have a clue what to do without Neymar in attack and without Silva had no spine or leadership. David Luiz went from being King of the Copacabana to playing like Coco the Clown. Fred and Hulk?  They wouldn’t even get into the England team and that’s saying something. In the 1970 semi-final, West Germany lost a titanic battle 4-3 to Italy after extra time, in a match which became known of The Game of the Century. Last Tuesday in Belo Horizonte we surely witnessed The Game of this Century. Distraught: David Luiz (left) is comforted by his captain Thiago Silva after Brazil's shambolic defeat . But for the Germans to remember it with pride not just nostalgia then they have to crown it all in Rio on Sunday and win the World Cup. Of course, Argentina won’t roll over like Brazil did. And there is a certain Lionel Messi to deal with. But if Germany produce another performance close to that level then surely they will crack  Argentina so that the names of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm, Toni Kroos , Thomas Muller  Miroslav Klose and  Manuel Neuer et al  will be up there with World Cup legends of any era. And after such an entertaining World Cup, it would be fitting if the winners are the team who have consistently played the best and we are left to reflect that Germany delivered Fussball Uber Alles. Back Heel . Most people’s abiding memories of the 1986 World Cup are Diego Maradona’s two goals against the England; the Hand of God in the 51st minute in the quarter-final then three minutes later the Greatest Goal as Argentina won 2-1. Maradona then scored two more remarkable goals in the semi-final win over Belgium. In the final Maradona did not notch. But after Germany had come from a two goal deficit and with Argentina on . the ropes Maradona produced a sublime pass that was ‘half a goal’, as . he released Jorge Burruchaga who raced clear to score the winner six . minutes from time. Hand of God: Diego Maradona handles the ball past Peter Shilton of England in 1986 . Brilliant: Maradona scores his second, sublime goal against England in the last-eight clash in 1986 . Libero . It seems a long time since England shuffled out of the World  Cup after a woeful showing. But the English game still has a massive allure given the global popularity of the Premier League. It’s what attracts so much TV and sponsorship money. And it’s good to see some companies putting something back too. As part of their Vodafone Firsts project, the mobile network giant flew over an Under 15 team from Ghana, the Anokye Stars, to compete against four British teams in London last week. The action was streamed back to their village at a pop up cinema. But clearly there is plenty of work to do at grass roots level in this country given the Ghanaians won the tournament with some ease. Ones to watch: Ghanaian side Anokye Stars celebrate their win in London . Humble beginnings: The team from Ghana faced four English sides and won the tournament . BTW . It seems there are some West Ham fans who are getting hot under the collar about the change to their club badge. The club have ditched the back drop of the Boleyn Castle, given they will move to the Olympic Stadium in a couple of years, and now have a simpler crest of two hammers, like the club had in the glory days of the Sixties. They have also added the name London. Both moves seem sensible to enhance the club’s brand without ditching the heritage. Exploiting the name London is especially shrewd. Besides, over the years West Ham have had 15 badge designs, eight of which have not had the castle. And to those stick in the muds, in the early 1900’s the club was advertised as West Ham London . Y-factor . Why do footballers keep lying ? On the one hand Luis Suarez says he is ‘Leaving Liverpool with a heavy heart’. But then he says that ‘playing in Spain is a lifelong dream.’ The truth is he couldn’t wait to get out of Liverpool this summer despite having led them to Champions League football so that he could fulfil an ambition and earn more money. So why not just admit it? Or bite his lip?

"Founder: Wikipedia chairman Jimmy Wales and his Wikimedia Foundation have changed the way the site works in order to attract new contributors . Wikipedia is in decline according to experts after it was revealed that the numbers of the site's volunteer editors has shrunk by a third since 2007. The crowdsourced information site, which gets at least 10 billion hits every calendar month, depends on the contribution of volunteers to regulate content which is uploaded by the public. But fewer and fewer people are bothering to manage the online encyclopedia after a raft of changes made by the Wikimedia Foundation, which funds the infrastructure of the site. In a bid to combat online vandalism and spoof entries, Wikipedia has begun using programs instead of people to automatically delete suspicious content. As a result, a lot of users' hard work and genuine knowledge was erroneously censored by bots. According to a new study from the University of Minnesota, the deletion tools are just one aspect of the site's intended modernisation ideas which have disenfranchised loyal 'Wikipedians'. Another unpopular move by the Wikimedia group came when they changed the way content was uploaded to the site. Whereas an uploader once had to be familiar with the language of the site, called 'Wikitext',  to properly upload entries, now someone with next to no web editing experience can post articles live. The Wikimedia Foundation changed the content editing system to something which is similar to a word processor. Good cause: Wikipedia has tried to empower more people by make the site more user friendly, but the changes have angered loyal 'editors' who feel are frustrated at the lowering of standards . They hoped that new users would be encouraged to contribute as a result, but more experienced editorial staff have become frustrated at the ease with which spoof articles can now be added. The result is the steep decline in the numbers of Wikipedia editors, which one expert believes could be the beginning of a perpetual 'decline phase.' One editor, speaking to the tech website Raw Story said, 'it’s like they keep lowering . the bar, then asking us to limbo. At a certain point, you’re tripping . over the stick instead of walking under it.' Aaron Halfaker a university Grad student at the University of Minnesota, who has published extensively on the decline said: 'I categorize from 2007 until now as the decline phase of Wikipedia'. His report established that when the new controls began to take effect, the likelihood of a new participant’s edit being immediately deleted has steadily climbed. Biased: A lack of new editors on the site means there are more articles on subjects like computer games and porn then there are women's literature and feminism . Over the same period, the proportion of those deletions made by automated tools rather than humans grew. Unsurprisingly, the data also indicate that well-intentioned newcomers are far less likely to still be editing Wikipedia two months after their first try. The allegations of a downward spiral has been rejected by Sue Gardner, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation. Ambitious: Wikipedia's aim has been to attract keen young 'reporters', but the plan has backfired (picture posed by model) She said that dropping 'Wikitext' would attract a new type of uploader to the site, which she called 'eager cub reporters.' Gardner said: 'The Wikipedians remind me of the crusty old desk guy who knows the style guide backwards' 'But where are the eager cub reporters? You don’t get the crusty old desk guy out at three in the morning to cover a fire. 'That’s for the new guy, who’s got a lot of energy and potential. At Wikipedia we don’t have a sufficient influx of cub reporters.”","Changes by Wikipedia to modernise the site have disenfranchised loyal 'Wikipedians', claims study .

"A trainee Mormon priest who flashed at two women said he became 'confused' after watching too much Babestation TV. Royston Thompson, 25, was initially caught exposing himself to a woman he was attracted to while in his dressing gown. After being released on bail ahead of . his sentencing he exposed himself again - this time to a female doctor . who he asked to inspect his genitals. Flasher: Royston Thompson, 25, exposed himself to a woman who had parked outside his house and to a doctor, the court was told . He left a note on his first victim's car which said he would 'love to give her a full body rub and make love to her.' As she got into her vehicle parked outside Thompson's front door she spotted him performing a sex act in his doorway in Darlington, County Durham. At a previous hearing, Thompson said his behaviour was merely . 'flirting' like the women on the Babestation channel which features glamour models . writhing provocatively while they urge callers to ring in. He told the court on that occasion: 'I . have learnt my lesson but it was nothing more than harmless flirting, . like the women on Babestation do every night.' Teesside Crown Court heard today that Thompson had watched 'too much pornography' and become confused before committing the act. Ian West, prosecuting, West said Thompson told police he was in 'training to be a priest in the Mormon Church.' He was found guilty of exposing himself on August 10 last year after a trial at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates on January 19. After being released on bail ahead of his sentencing he exposed himself again - this time to the female doctor who he had asked to inspect his genitals. Thompson went to see her about a bad back and after she examined it he then complained about a lump on his left testicle. He insisted that she had to have a look at it - despite her suggesting he saw a male doctor. He then dropped his trousers revealing that he was aroused, the court heard. At a previous hearing, Thompson said his behaviour was merely 'flirting' like the women on the Babestation channel which features glamour models writhing provocatively while they urge callers to ring in. Mr West said: 'She (the doctor) examined his testicles to confirm there was no lump. The defendant asked her if she was sure about that and if she wanted to check again.' When Thompson pulled his trousers back on, he asked the doctor: 'How was that for you?' Mr West told the court. The doctor warned Thompson to be careful what he said because she had read about his exposure to his first victim in the newspaper. Thompson was arrested and initially denied the offence but later decided to plead guilty. Today Judge Howard Crowson sentenced him to 16 weeks behind bars. He told Thompson he should expect to serve a further 32 days in prison on top of the time he has already spent on remand. The court heard Thompson has an extensive record of offending, beginning when he was just ten-years-old and continuing until he was 21. Martin Towers, defending, passed on a message on behalf of Thompson, from Darlington, County Durham. He told Judge Crowson: 'He is sorry, he had been watching too much pornography and he had, in his words, become confused and he asks me, again on his behalf, to assure the court that nothing like this will happen again.' The judge said Thompson’s actions 'must have been distressing' to his victim. He told the defendant: 'I hope very much that what is said on your behalf is true and you have learnt your lesson.' Thompson replied: 'Definitely,' and later told the judge: 'I won’t be coming back again.' He was ordered to sign the sex offenders register for the next seven years.","Royston Thompson, 25, left a note on a woman's car saying he would 'love to give her a full body rub'

"A man who gave an emotional interview after the disappearance of his friend was 'spotted on camera walking with her into deserted garage and driving out in his car despite insisting he was parked somewhere else.' Plano, Texas Police say that Enrique Arochi, the last person seen with Christina Morris before she disappeared on August 30, made many false statements over the course of the investigation. 'Arochi has made numerous false statements and omitted pertinent information to Affiant during the course of the investigation into Morris’ disappearance,' Plano Detective Cathy Stamm wrote in the affidavit for the search warrant, reports Dallas News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Made false statements: Enrique Arochi said that he was parked in a different garage than Christina Morris on the night that she disappeared but surveillance footage shows him driving his car out of the same garage . Missing: Christina Morris disappeared on the morning of August 20 and was last seen with Enrique Aroche . 'Affiant believes Arochi has intentionally made false statements which have hindered detectives in locating Morris.' One such claim was that Arochi parked his car in a different garage than Morris. Surveillance footage shows him walking with Morris and later shows him pulling his car out of the garage at 3:58 a.m. When police showed Arochi the footage of him driving away he said, 'I must have parked there.' 'The inconsistency was where I parked because both parking lots look exactly identical,' Arochi told KRLD 1080. 'And I don’t have a sense of direction so I didn’t really know where I parked'. Under investigation: Plano police has since investigated Arochi's car looking for fluids, hair, and DNA evidence in connection to Christina Morris' disappearance but haven't yet reported their findings . Missing: Christina Morris has been missing since August 20th and was last seen with Enrique Arochi who has told police many different versions of his story . CBS reports that while Arochi says that Morris was never in his car, police believe she may have been inside when he was pulling away from the garage in the early hours of the morning on August 30. 'So we walked and we split and after I saw my car, I went to my car. I don’t know where she went, or if she went to her car. I just went to my car and left.' 'I honestly didn’t see anything. I was just walking to my car,' said Arochi in an exclusive interview with CBS. Plano police has since investigated Arochi's car looking for fluids, hair, and DNA evidence but haven't yet reported their findings. According to a warrant, police say they also have video of Arochi examining strange parts of his car at a grocery store in Allen just hours after Morris' disappearance. Also following the disappearance, Arochi had 'bruising to his right forearm' and 'abrasions to his right hand.' Protests: Christina Morris' supporters have protested outside of Enrique Arochi's home with signs reading 'tell us the truth Enrique' in the hopes he will divulge more information . Disbelief: Christina Morris' mother, Jonni McElroy, says she doesn't understand how Enrique Arochi doesn't have any more information about her daughter's disappearance since he was with her just hours before . He told police that he punched his car fender but police took pictures of the vehicle and the damage didn’t match Arochi’s description. A co-worker of Arochi's told investigators that the day after Morris' disappearance, Arochi looked like s**t, was walking with a limp, and supposedly had bite marks on his arm. Arochi told his co-worker he was in a fight the night before but that story changed as well. He says his injuries have nothing to do with Morris' disappearance and says that he had an accident that day changing his tire. 'I didn’t have any bite marks on my arm, I had an accident that day changing my tire – and there’s proof of that cause I texted my girlfriend telling her I was changing my tires and that’s been cleared,' said Arochi. Arochi has admitted to police that the night of Morris' disappearance; he had taken Adderall and consumes 10 shots of liquor and 3-5 beers. Another one of Arochi's false statements was that he says he didn't contact Morris' boyfriend Hunter Foster the night she disappeared. Police say that Arochi's phone shows him making calls and texts to Foster at 3:50, 3:53, and 3:55 the morning she disappeared. Despite Arochi's holes in his story, he has stood by his innocence. Morris' mother wants to know where her daughter is and she believes that Arochi has the answers. 'I feel like the one person that walked her to the parking garage has to know something,' Jonni McElroy, Morris’s mother, told CBS 11 News. Arochi says he hasn't spoken with Morris' mother despite protestors standing outside his home with signs reading, 'tell us the truth Enrique.' Arochi still says he has nothing to do with Morris and said,'I had nothing to do with her disappearance,” said Arochi. 'I just want them to come forward. It’s not only affecting her family, it’s affecting a lot of people around us. It’s just not fair if someone’s holding onto that piece of information that may lead to where Christina may be. I just want them to be honest and come forward.' Arochi says he has been told by Plano police that he is not a suspect but that he is only a person of interest.","Police say that Enrique Arochi, the last person seen with Christina Morris before she disappeared, made many false statements .

"Killed in battle: Members of the Plantagenet Alliance are to launch an application for judicial review regarding the Ministry of Justice's decision to granted the University of Leicester a licence for King Richard III's burial . Distant family members of King Richard III, whose body was unearthed in a council car park, are set to challenge plans to bury the monarch - claiming they are a breach of human rights. The Ministry of Justice granted archaeologists from the University of Leicester permission to decide where the body should be buried after their unexpected discovery of the Plantagenet king's body. But the group of fifteen living relatives has objected to the plans and are expected to launch an application for judicial review of the MoJ's decision to grant the licence to the academics. The debate over the king's final resting place has been propelled by the significant tourism boost that will inevitably be attached to the location. Under a licence granted by the MoJ, the University of Leicester group decided that King Richard, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, should be buried at Leicester Cathedral. The Richard III Society - a partner of the university team with an interest in the monarch - has already developed plans for a tomb inside the building. But the campaigners have argued that Richard III would have wanted a burial in York Minster cathedral. An application for judicial review is to be lodged by lawyers on behalf of the family group, known as the Plantagenet Alliance. The family will argue that the MoJ failed to consult them over the terms of the burial licence, claiming that this was a breach of the right to family life under article 8 of the European Convention on . Human Rights. A petition calling for King Richard to be re-interred in York has been signed by more than 23,000 people, while a similar petition backing a Leicester burial has attracted below 8,000 signatures. Final resting place: The remains are expected to be interred in Leicester Cathedral in May next year, with a large memorial service . Alternative: The Plantagenet Alliance argue that the remains should be buried in York Minster cathedral . Tomb: The Richard III Society, which was behind the excavation along with the University of Leicester team, has proposed a simple tomb . An exhibition centre has been earmarked by Leicester City Council for a Victorian building  overlooking the car park where the king's body was unceremoniously buried after being killed by Henry VII's troops. After his naked body was brought back battle on the back of a horse, his remains were buried in a shallow grave without a coffin on the site of what was once Greyfriars church. DNA tests from one of the monarch's closest living relatives, a furniture maker from Canada living in London, were used to confirm the remains were those of the monarch. Michael Ibsen himself has supported the Leicester burial plans, despite opposition from the other group of distant relatives. Memorial: A stone referring to King Richard III at Leicester Cathedral, where the recently discovered remains are planned to be interred . Stephen Nicolay, a 16th great-nephew . of the monarch and member of the Plantagenet Alliance, said: 'We have . every hope that (we) will succeed in our quest to have Richard's . remains buried at the most appropriate site, York Minster.' Matthew Howarth, from Leeds-based law firm Gordons, said: 'We have now written officially to the Ministry . of Justice and University of Leicester, notifying them that we plan to . issue these claims. 'We will follow up by issuing the . judicial review and other proceedings as soon as possible, but certainly . within the next few weeks.' King Richard grew up at Middleham Castle in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times during his 26-month reign. Known as Richard of York before his coronation, he also funded part of the city's medieval gated walls. The monarch's links with the area are . celebrated to this day, with a Richard III Hotel in Middleham, a . Yorkshire-made Richard III Wensleydale cheese and a Richard III Museum . in York. But the University of Leicester disputed the group's grounds for judicial review. In a statement, the university described its  licence as 'legitimate', therefore making it 'responsible' for the re-interment. The statement read: 'Our decision was, and remains, that Richard III should be reinterred at Leicester Cathedral. 'The plan for reinterment in Leicester Cathedral was clearly stated and unambiguous at the start of the project and announced in a statement on Friday August 24 2012. This was before the dig started. 'Reinterment on the nearest consecrated ground is in keeping with good archaeological practice. Richard has lain in the shadow of St Martin's Cathedral, Leicester, for over 500 years.' The group added that Leicester City Council initially gave permission for the excavation on the basis that the body would be buried at the nearby cathedral. Remains: The skeleton found under Greyfriars car park in Leicester which was eventually found to be that of King Richard III . Reconstruction: The world's only facial reconstruction of Richard III unveiled 528 years after his death by Philippa Langley, originator of the 'Looking for Richard' project . They also refuted the group's right to be described as family members, saying: 'Richard III is believed to have no living descendants. Any distant relations are therefore descended from his siblings. Statistically speaking, many tens of thousands of individuals alive today are descended in this way.' 'There is no obligation to consult living relatives where remains are older than 100 years.' The university also referred to a statement from York Minster made in February supporting the monarch's reburial in Leicester. The spokesperson continued: 'The attempt to invoke Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights seems particularly odd given the distance of any relations and the years that have past.","MoJ granted the licence to decide burial plans to University of Leicester .

"Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp analyses Germany's extra-time win against Argentina in the World Cup final, including Lionel Messi's performance, Christoph Kramer's forgettable night and another midfield masterclass from Javier Mascherano. Parking the bus? Not a chance . The match was a real battle of styles. The Argentines were happy to soak up the pressure, defend aggressively and play on the counter attack. They were not parking the bus, with Gonzalo Higuain, Lionel Messi and Ezequiel Lavezzi up front they always knew one flash could unlock their opponents. The Germans, on the other hand, were a mixture of tiki-taka and power, looking to score from a 30-pass move or a corner. They dominated possession, but Argentina often looked not far from a goal. Target man: Miroslav Klose (left) goes up for a header with Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay (right) Argentina looked more tired than their opponents. It could have been because they had a day less to prepare, were taken to extra time and penalties in the semi-final whereas the Germans cruised through against Brazil. It had a real impact on how the game played out and made for a thrilling match. Midfield maestro: Toni Kroos (left) holds off the challenge of Lucas Biglia (right) during the first half . Kramer has a real stunner . World Cup finals are the biggest stage of all and it creates nervy games. Five of the last seven have been goalless at half-time and this one was no different. What a night to remember for Christoph Kramer — if he can recall any of it. The 23-year-old was called up for his first competitive start for Germany after Sami Khedira pulled out with a calf injury in the warm-up. Kramer had made just two last-minute substitute appearances against Algeria in the last 16 and France in the quarter-final. It was such a shame, then, that he took a blow to the face in the 20th minute as the full force of Garay ran through him when he was looking the other way and eventually had to come off after 32 minutes. He looked dazed and confused when he left the field with concussion. Down and out: Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer was forced off after suffering a head injury . Mascherano the middle man . Javier Mascherano has proven at this World Cup that he is a midfielder and not a defender. Why on earth do Barcelona play him as a centre back? He is not tall enough for the position and it does not suit him. But when Mascherano is in midfield he is a different animal. Man in the middle: Javier Mascherano (centre, circled) even gave a team talk before extra time as Lionel Messi (left, circled) appeared to walk away . As soon as the team loses the ball he slips into the defence, he can sense danger and he can deal with it. In the semi-final he made the tackle of the tournament against Arjen Robben, who looked set to score the goal which would have knocked Argentina out, and he was a nuisance for Germany again. Midfield engine: Argentina's Mascherano (right) attempts to win the ball back from Ozil (left) in midfield . Pain for Higuain . I would normally have put my life savings on Gonzalo Higuain to score when he was handed a gift of a chance in the first half. After all the goals he has scored for Napoli and Argentina he looked certain to find the net. He had so much time when Toni Kroos headed the ball right into his path but he just snatched at it. It just goes to show what happens to players when they are under that much pressure. Missed opportunity: Argentina's Gonzalo Higuain drags a shot wide despite being clean through on goal . Messi saves best till last . Lionel Messi had clearly stored up something extra for this final. He showed the pace and sharpness that he has lacked in the past few matches. He gave Mats Hummels a torrid time, picking the ball up on the right flank and dribbling with a spring in his step. Hummels has been one of the standout defenders but Messi left him for dead in the first half with a rapid change of pace and was unlucky not to find a team-mate when he got to the byline.

"The family of  Martin Luther King were left shaken after their bus almost collided with a van following a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the March of Washington. Relatives of the famous civil rights activist were travelling through the American capital when the driver of their chartered bus suddenly slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting a van which had driven through a red light. Passengers on board - which included King's sister Christine King Farris and family friend and TV personality Omarosa Manigault - were all thrown forward due to the force of the driver's braking. Worrying: The family of Martin Luther King were left shaken after their bus almost collided with a van yesterday. This picture shows members of the King family greeting President Obama . Near miss: Christine King Farris, sister of late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr was onboard the bus when it narrowly avoided the collision. She is pictured speaking at yesterday's event . As reported by the New York Daily News, the force of the sudden stop resulted in Manigault hitting her head on the seat in front of her. Writing on Twitter afterwards, she said: 'Yikes just got banged up a lil bit on bus- I am ok! #HitMyHead ouch.' The family members had been travelling back from a rally honoring the 50th anniversary of the 'I Have a Dream' speech in Washington. According to TMZ, the driver of the bus needed hospital treatment following the near miss.

"Scientists have uncovered what they believe to be the oldest complete fossil anywhere on Earth. The 3.5 billion year old fossil is the remains of what was once a purple and green slimy collection of single-cell microbes. These microbes are likely to be a distant ancestor of humans and would have had a strong stench of rotting eggs, according to researchers. The 3.5 billion year old fossil is the remains of what was once a purple and green slimy collection of single-cell microbes. Shown here is a rock surface displaying cracks in the 3.48 billion years old Dresser Formation, Pilbara region, Western Australia . The Pilbara region of Western Australia is one of the rare geological regions that provides insight into the early evolution of life on Earth. Mound-like deposits created by ancient bacteria, called stromatolites, and microfossils of bacteria have previously been discovered in this region. However, a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures, or MISS, had not previously been seen in rocks of this great age . MISS not only demonstrate the presence of life, but also the presence of microbial ecosystems that could co-ordinate with one another. Nora Noffke of Old Dominion University in the U.S. found the remnants of this life in sandstone rock in western Australia. The tiny fossilised mat, about one-third of an inch (8.3 millimetres) thick, would be about 300 million years older than previous complete ancient fossils, said study co-author Robert Hazen, a mineralogist at the Carnegie Institution of Science in Washington. He said life on the mat probably had turned sunlight into energy, but produced ‘horribly smelly’ sulphur in the process, instead of oxygen. He added that if you had walked the . Australian beaches of 3.5 billion years ago, you would see a ‘slimy mass . of purple or brown fibres emitting this stench of sulphur compounds but . living very happily.’ ‘This is not a place you would want to go to on your summer vacation,’ he said.

"In a meeting room in London, a group of women are shrieking and hollering at each other while wielding cricket bats. It all looks slightly deranged - and dangerous - but they've signed up for a session with the Tantrum Club. It's a new support group (call it legitimised ranting) in which stressed-out executives and harassed housewives come together to let off steam - without getting either fired or divorced. The idea was the brainchild of Adele Theron, 35, who founded the Naked Divorce, a 21-day programme to help separating couples. Tantrum Club is a new support group (call it legitimised ranting) in which stressed-out executives and harassed housewives come together to let off steam - without getting either fired or divorced . The first day of the programme was dedicated to releasing anger and, as word spread, Adele found herself inundated with inquiries from people who weren't getting divorced, but who still wanted a slice of the shout-it-out action. Realising she was on to something, the Tantrum Club was born. The first few groups proved so successful that Adele - who runs the service for no charge - is in negotiations to set up Tantrum Clubs in gyms nationwide.

"Louis van Gaal’s war of words with Manchester United legend Gary Neville has escalated over his analysis of a ‘lucky’ 2-1 win at Southampton. Neville claimed United — up to third in the Barclays Premier League after a fifth straight win — had ‘got away with murder’ after winning with two goals from Robin van Persie. The Sky pundit also said United’s game with Liverpool on Sunday could be ‘the Dog and Duck versus the Red Lion’ but a furious Van Gaal said: ‘He is an ex-legend, a legend, a former player of Manchester United. Murder? That’s an English expression — maybe. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was not happy with Gary Neville's post-match comments . Neville said Manchester United's match against Liverpool at the weekend will be like a pub game . Former Manchester United right back and captain Neville has been branded an 'ex-legend' by Van Gaal . Appearances: 602 . Honours: Eight Premier League titles . Three FA Cups . Two League Cups . Three Community Shields . Two Champions Leagues . One Intercontinenal Cup . One FIFA Club World Cup . ‘He can say everything because he is an ex-legend, but as an ex-legend, or as a legend, you have to know what you are saying. ‘You can interpret that how you like. It’s not difficult. When I say that, he has to pay attention to his words.’ Despite Van Gaal’s criticism he admitted United ‘got lucky’ at St Mary's. Neville said on Monday Night Football: 'I don't think (they can win the league), they don't have the quality. 'They've been decimated with injuries. To say can they go and win the title? I think they're too short defensively at this moment in time. I don't think they're at that level I really don't. 'They're going to have to step it up. They look shaky on the ball. They lack counter attack, they lack speed, they didn't have anything. 'They've got away with murder tonight. United will be happy with the result but they will have to play better than that. 'I think they will get better, they're showing a bit of resilience. That's a good quality to have but they need to play better.' Neville does not believe Manchester United can challenge for the Premier League title despite the fact they won their fifth consecutive league match against Southampton . Manchester United striker Robin van Persie helped his side claim all three points by scoring a double . Van Gaal added: ‘Only three players played well. The others were not good. Normally you have six, seven, eight players who are good. But there were too many not good. ‘It’s fantastic now to be third in the table, but I hoped we’d do that with a better performance because we were the lucky team. ‘When you are the better team, you deserve more, but it is the goals which count. We have played the first six or seven matches and not won, but we were always the better team.’ Van Gaal also admitted he was forced to substitute rookie central defender Paddy McNair in the first half because of a succession of mistakes. Paddy McNair was replaced by Manchester United team-mate Ander Herrera in the 39th minute . The Dutch coach said: ‘He had no confidence, he had given three chances away. It's very disappointing for me and for Paddy, but I had to because as a manager I am responsible. It's tough but it's also in his best interests. ‘I have made a lot of changes and all the boys can survive. It is only one match, one moment in a lifetime.’ Van Gaal also admitted Van Persie, who now has sixth in the Premier League, was one of the only three players on the pitch who could make a difference. He added: ‘I think that not only the goals are telling us something about Van Persie, but also his performance. ‘He was one of the three players on the pitch of Manchester United who were good, or maybe very good. He had a great influence on the result. Very positive.’ Chris Smalling was forced off with a groin injury during Manchester United's encounter against Southampton . Van Persie added: ‘We didn’t play well but this is our fifth straight win and we are on the way up. In the end we nicked it. 'I felt good and fitness wise it gets better each week. If I am fit the goals and assists will come. ‘The first goal was a gamble. Nine out of 10 it doesn’t come off but you make your own luck. I was a bit lucky because the ball went under the keeper’s legs. ‘Next up is Liverpool and although we take it game by game we are happy we are on the up and we have to keep the momentum.’ United have more injury concerns ahead of Sunday’s clash with Liverpool at Old Trafford after Chris Smalling was forced off in the first half with a groin problem.

"The job description for the next FA chief executive surprisingly puts as the major priority winning the World Cups in 2022 and 2023. This aim, detailed in the first paragraph of the recruitment advertisement, elevates women’s football, which has its flagship tournament a year after the men, to unprecedented heights. It comes at a time when the women’s game is the fastest-growing team sport in the UK. The Wembley crowd for last month’s England v Germany women’s game — 55,000 — far surpassed the attendance of 40,181 when Roy Hodgson’s side played Norway in September. FA chairman Greg Dyke is behind the focus on women's football, according to an FA spokesman . But such belated gender parity at the FA comes after it took their board 148 years to appoint their first female board member. It is also puzzling the FA nominations panel should put such emphasis on Qatar 2022 when Euro 2020, with semi-finals and finals at Wembley, is widely regarded as England’s best opportunity to win a major tournament. An FA spokesman said the stated ambitions reflect those of FA chairman Greg Dyke and the huge growth in women’s football. The nine-month battle between Lord Coe and Sergey Bubka for the IAAF presidency began at the Olympic Congress in Monaco, with Bubka saying: ‘I do all my work only in athletics.’ This was a clear dig at Coe’s varied roles, but Bubka’s strong anti-drugs offensive has come late in his career while Coe has been campaigning on that subject since the 1980s. Meanwhile, a notable face on Coe’s team is the respected Jan Paterson, director of Olympic relations at the BOA who was England chef de mission at the Commonwealth Games. The nine-month battle between Lord Coe and Sergey Bubka for the IAAF presidency began in Monaco . lAAF president Lamine Diack will not stand in the way of the ethics committee investigating the Russian doping scandal that has embroiled his son Papa Massata. Diack junior was exposed in a German TV documentary as having links with Singapore based company Black Tidings that was used as a slush fund to cover up payments to ensure serial positive drugs tests in Russia were not reported. Papa Massata told German broadcasters ARD that he was involved commercially with the Chinese controller of Black Tidings. IAAF vice-president Lord Coe said: ‘Lamine will wait for the investigation and if names are in the fray then clearly those names are going to be subject of that investigation. Lamine’s not curtailing the work of the ethics committee.’ Lewis Hamilton, who no longer has a management team advising him, should have been told that staying for only 20 minutes at the Autosport awards evening partly sponsored by the world champion’s Mercedes outfit was a PR own goal. Former team-mate Jenson Button received a far more rapturous reception than Hamilton at the Grosvenor House Hotel. Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton left the Autosport awards after only 20 minutes . Swimming, athletics and shooting are in danger of losing disciplines at Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics to make way for host city flexibility that might see the addition of baseball, softball, squash and karate. However, the suggestion of Dick Pound, Canada’s IOC representative, that the triple jump and race walking were under threat didn’t impress Lord Coe, who described the former as ‘sacrosanct’ and race walking as being hugely popular in parts of the world . The 40 Olympic recommendations rubber-stamped at the IOC Congress were a triumph for new president Thomas Bach, who ensured all consultation and approval for the reforms were in place before the unanimous support he received on Monday. The way the IOC go about their business is the polar opposite of FIFA. Ironically, FIFA president and IOC member Sepp Blatter did not oppose the age limits introduced. Blatter said: ‘I am a team player with the IOC, but FIFA is a different team.’ Dick Pound suggested that the triple jump and race walking were under threat at the 2020 Olympics . The Premier League TV rights auction is not expected to be delayed by the Ofcom inquiry into Virgin Media’s complaint about the selling process.

"Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has admitted his team were lucky to beat Southampton 2-1 on Monday night. Robin van Persie opened the scoring after a poor back pass from Jose Fonte before Saints striker Graziano Pelle ended his goal drought mid way through the first half to level the scores. But Van Persie earned all three points for his side with a smart finish from a second-half set piece. The victory couldn't mask a poor performance from United though, who had just three shots all game. Louis van Gaal admitted his team were lucky to escape St Mary's with all three points on Monday night . Van Gaal told Monday Night Football: 'We lost the ball too easily. We didn't have very good positional play - that was not good in spite of our good result. 'You need confidence on the ball and that we don't have that. 'I think Southampton played better than Manchester United but we were the lucky guy. The performance was not good enough. We were the lucky team.' Paddy McNair was substituted before half time after a nervy performance, and while it will undoubtedly dampen the defender's confidence, Van Gaal insisted he had no choice. Robin van Persie had all three of United's shots against Southampton, and he scored from two of them . Van Persie's form was perhaps the one highlight for Manchester United supporters . 'He (McNair) had not any confidence, he had already given three big chances away I have to do it. 'It's very disappointing for me and also for Paddy but I had to because as a manager I am responsible for the win and after we played better.' The one highlight for United supporters will be the ever-improving form of striker Van Persie, and the Dutchman believes he is finally getting back to his best. Van Persie said: 'We didn't play our best football today. We were sloppy but we gave absolutely everything but in the end we nicked it. We're on the up. 'I've been feeling quite good over the last couple of weeks. I can play 90 minutes easy and each game it gets easier. That's what you want - then the goals and assists will come. 'We're looking forward to that (the Liverpool game). We are really happy we're on the way up now we just have to continue.'

"Louis van Gaal said he had no option but to substitute Paddy McNair in the first half against Southampton because the defender's 'confidence' was shot - but believes that it will benefit the youngster in the long run. The 19-year-old was hooked by Van Gaal after only 39 minutes at St Mary's Stadium on Monday night during Manchester United's 2-1 victory over the Saints. McNair was struggling to contain Southampton strikers Shane Long and Graziano Pelle, forcing Van Gaal into replacing him prematurely.

But in spite of the fact United won the game, McNair was exposed time after time in defence and was substituted - even though Chris Smalling had already departed early with an injury. Jonny Evans came on to replace Smalling, before McNair made way for midfielder Ander Herrera as Michael Carrick dropped back in to the centre of defence in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system. And, despite admitting it will be difficult for McNair to accept being replaced so early, Van Gaal insisted that it was a necessity which will serve the Northern Irishman well long term. Van Gaal continued: 'Of course, it's tough (for McNair), but it's also in his best interests.'

"David Warner honoured the memory of Phillip Hughes by blasting an emotionally charged century - the best, he said, of his career - on day one of the rearranged first Test against India. A cloud hung over the Adelaide Oval though when captain Michael Clarke was forced to leave the field with a back problem when he was 60 not out, and, like Hughes on that fateful day, looking good for a century of his own. Warner’s hundred was the perfect tribute to Hughes on a day that started with 63 seconds of applause for the 25-year-old, who died after being hit on the head by bouncer when he was 63 not out playing domestic cricket two weeks ago. Warner was fielding at gully on that day and rushed to Hughes’ aid when he fell and sat with his friend on the buggy that took him from a cricket field for the very last time.

Bowler Ryan Harris wipes his eye during the tributes to Hughes before the start of play at the Adelaide Oval . Around 20,000 spectators were in attendance for the first day's play of the first Test of the Australian summer on Tuesday . This was no ordinary opening day of a Test match. The Adelaide Oval stood as one, on a Tuesday, to pay their respects to Hughes before the start of play. Players, management and match officials lined up in front of a large white 408 – Hughes Baggy Green number - painted onto the pristine outfield while a video tribute was played out on the big screen. Players wore black armbands, sported 408 on the chests of their playing shirts, and stood shoulder to shoulder to honour their mate. If Warner had been moved by the tribute, he dealt with the emotion through his bat. Boundary after boundary was unleashed in an exhilarating first hour, as he punishing Varun Aaron in particular. With every one of Warner’s fours, there was a sense of relief and release from the crowd as they applauded fervently. Their energy surely translated to the opener, whose innings was punctuated with poignant milestones. First there was the half century, reached off just 45 balls. When his ninth four whistled to the boundary he raised his bat gently, closed his eyes and tilted his head back to the heavens. Then, on 61, he swept to deep square leg, ran two, and as he reached 63 not out, the crowd rose once again in spontaneous applause. Warner threw his head up to the skies for a second time, raised his bat and momentarily sank to his haunches. The No 408 is painted on the outfield at the Adelaide Oval, the number of Phillip Hughes' Test cap .

Australian players line up their bats in honour of Hughes at the Adelaide Oval before the first Test against India . A spectator writes a tribute to Hughes, who died aged 25 after being hit on the head by a bouncer in a freak accident . He was already removing his helmet as he jogged the single that took him to three figures midway through the afternoon session. He kissed the badge on his helmet with feeling, raised his bat and helmet to the skies, looked long towards the heavens, and after two weeks of tension and grief he finally leapt into the air and was engulfed in a bear hug by his batting partner Clarke. As Warner buried his head in his captain’s chest, you could have been forgiven for thinking the left-hander's shoulders shook just a little. It was his 10th Test century but the most meaningful and highly charged of them all. He eventually departed to yet another ovation when he tried to hoik India’s debutant leg spinner Karn Sharma into the Chappell stand and was caught at deep midwicket. Clarke had received a stirring reception when he came out to bat after Watson was caught at second slip for 14 – the second wicket of the day after Chris Rogers edged an attempted cover drive to the cordon. Before Watson had left the outfield the members were already on their feet, turning their backs to the field of play and looking up towards the dressing room, waiting for the Australia captain to come jogging down the steps. Australian captain Clarke was passed fit to play and elected to bat first after winning the toss .

Chris Rogers was caught at second slip by Shikhar Dhawan off the bowling of Ishant Sharma for nine . India celebrate their first wicket after being hammered by Warner for the first half hour of play at the Adelaide Oval . Sharma then welcomed Shane Watson to the crease by bowling him a bouncer with his very first delivery . Clarke cut a desperately sad figure though, limping back to the dressing room 60 runs later, with his back crocked again, having put a on century stand with Warner. He grimaced after withdrawing from a pull shot, and tried to stretch his back on the outfield, receiving treatment on the ground, before eventually leaving to be further assessed. Until that point he had been batting fluently and moving freely. He was just three runs short of 63. Questions will linger as to whether Clarke was genuinely fit enough to play this match, or whether the personal enormity of the occasion encouraged him to take a risk. Regardless of the hamstring, which has troubled him in the build up, his back has been an ongoing issue and there must be some doubt as to the role he will be able to play through the rest of the Australian summer. The first bouncer of the match came 20 minutes into the day's play. It was bowled by Aaron and was roundly applauded by the crowd as Warner ducked safely beneath it. The next delivery was short, too, but played less safely as Warner upper cut it without control over cover point. There was no shortage of short stuff; Clarke got a bouncer first ball and stared down Aaron after he delivered it; Watson looked less comfortable against Ishant Sharma, swaying away and almost toppling over. Warner looks and points to the sky after going to a brisk 50 on the first morning in Adelaide . Warner was in no mood to hang around as he reached his 50 in just 45 deliveries with eight boundaries .

Warner looks to the sky and raises his bat after reaching 63 not out - the score which Hughes was on when he was hit by a bouncer . Warner and Clarke head off for lunch on day one in Adelaide, at which stage Australia were on 113 for two . India generally started off bowling too short though, and Aaron could learn a lot from Sharma’s control. A flurry of late wickets came when the new ball was pitched up after tea. Four scalps in the evening session, including that of Warner, made India feel better about their day’s performance.

"Manchester City fear striker Sergio Aguero could be out for longer than was first thought. Manager Manuel Pellegrini had hoped to have the Argentine back within four weeks but scans have revealed that Aguero, who injured his knee in Saturday’s 1-0 win against Everton, has a twisted medial ligament that is expected to take longer to recover from. Sergio Aguero was left in tears after suffering ligament damage in Manchester City's win against Everton . The City talisman fell after a challenge from Muhamed Besic (right) and his injury is worse than first feared . Team-mates surround Aguero as the extent of his injury becomes clear at the Etihad Stadium . Aguero leaves the field and is expected to be out for an extended period with knee ligament damage . If Sergio Aguero is out for the same length of time as David Silva, he will miss the following fixtures: . December 10 Roma (A) Champions League . December 13 Leicester City (A) December 20 Crystal Palace (H) December 26 West Bromwich (A) December 28 Burnley (H) January 1 Sunderland (H) January 3/4 Sheffield Wednesday (H) FA Cup Third Round . January 10 Everton (A) January 18 Arsenal (H) The injury is similar to the one David Silva suffered on October 29 and the Spaniard has not played since. Now, the responsibility for leading City’s attack in their crucial Champions League clash at Roma on Wednesday night will fall to Edin Dzeko. The 28-year-old has only two Premier League goals this season and none in Europe. After their home win against Bayern Munich last month City still have the chance to qualify for the last 16. Meanwhile, City have been left exasperated after FIFA concluded that there was insufficient evidence to open disciplinary proceedings against Croatian side HNK Rijeka over an alleged incident of racial abuse towards young midfielder Seko Fofana during pre-season. The club’s Elite Development Side, managed by Patrick Vieira, were playing in Novigrad in July when Fofana, 19, was sent off by the referee for kicking out at an opponent. David Silva (above) suffered a similar injury to Aguero and has been sidelined since October 29 . Edin Dzeko (right) will lead the line for City against Roma on Wednesday night in Aguero's absence . City later said that they believed Fofana was racially abused moments before he lashed out. Once alerted to Fofana’s complaint, Vieira went on to the pitch and, after holding discussions with the referee and City officials, the decision was taken for his players to leave the field. The news reverberated around Europe but Sportsmail can reveal that FIFA will take no action against the Croatian team. A FIFA spokesman confirmed that there was not enough evidence to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings. Seko Fofana, pictured on loan at Championship side Fulham, was allegedly racially abused by HNK Rijeka . Fofana, seen here tussling with Chelsea's John Swift, is part of Manchester City's Elite Development Squad . He added: ‘The chairman of the FIFA disciplinary committee, based on the information at his disposal, was pleased to observe Davor Suker (president of the Croatian Football Federation) and Patrick Vieira engage positively to work through the issue.’ The relevant parties were notified on Friday when, ironically, FIFA emphasised their zero-tolerance stance against any form of discrimination.

"Close your eyes for a moment and you will recall Robin van Persie’s maiden season at Manchester United and the 26 goals that took Sir Alex Ferguson hurtling towards his 13th league title. Then there was the World Cup in Brazil, when his flying header in the 5-1 defeat of Spain was immortalised by some street artists inside a favela. It was dreamy stuff, alright. Since then there have been times when you want to shake Robin van Persie like a rag doll and ask him straight out whether he will ever be the same again. Please Robin, say yes. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Southampton 1-2 Manchester United . Robin van Persie scored what turned out to be the winning goal for Manchester United . Van Persie, pictured with Juan Mata (left) and Marouane Fellaini (right) celebrates after scoring the opener . The Dutchman celebrates with Ashley Young (right) and Ander Herrera after scoring his second goal . Van Persie helped Manchester United claim all three points against Southampton at St Mary's . He remains a ruthless finisher, scoring the two goals here at St Mary’s that have taken United into third place in the Barclays Premier League. There is a sense they will stay there now. Certainly there were flashes here, against Southampton, that Van Persie wants to add to the single Premier League trophy he has to show for brilliant career in front of goal. In our heart of hearts we know that Van Persie, who scored in each half of this 2-1 victory, is every bit as good as Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero or Chelsea forward Diego Costa. Perhaps we have grown accustomed to Van Persie over the years, scoring goals for Arsenal, United and Holland, and have simply grown accustomed to his name appearing on Jeff Stelling’s ticker. These days we seem to talk ceaselessly of Aguero and Costa, arguing blindly on twitter, on bar stools or with colleagues about who is the better striker. Perhaps it is Van Persie. He has been forgotten in all this, assumed to have taken his eye off the ball after Holland blew it all in the World Cup semi-final against Argentina in Sao Paulo. Van Persie now has six in the Premier League: one each in games against Leicester, West Ham, Chelsea, Hull and the two here against Southampton. Van Persie joined Manchester United for £24million in 2012 after leaving Arsenal . Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa have been in outstanding form for Manchester City and Chelsea respectively . Both were tidy finishes, beating Fraser Forster in the first half with a weighted shot to put United in front and then reading Wayne Rooney’s flighted free-kick to win it. When he scored the opener, he nodded his head and ran towards the outstretched arms of his captain. He still has it; maybe you never lose it. The goals were good, but there was also much to admire about his improvisation when his spin made Southampton’s central midfielder Steven Davis look a mug in the second half. This was the real Van Persie, the man who took responsibility for launching United’s title charge when he made sure Arsenal sold him in July 2012 for £24million. The little boy inside him called it right. It is easy to look back at last season, when injury affected his game and many regard it as a failure. He still scored 12 times in 21 Premier League appearances and infamously claimed ‘to be learning something new every day under David Moyes’ in a ridiculous interview with United’s matchday programme. It is fair to say that he was never at his best. Van Persie and Rooney have managed to keep Radamel Falcao out of Louis van Gaal's starting line-up . Van Gaal gives fellow countryman Van Persie a celebratory hug after the striker inspired his side to victory . Here at Southampton he had just two shots on target and scored from both of them, which goes a long way to explaining why he is such a revered finisher. United did not play well and yet Van Persie’s two finishes made the difference on a night when Southampton lost their third successive fixture (Manchester City and Arsenal were the other two). Working alongside Rooney, who has taken complete responsibility for the words of encouragement during the game to his strike partner, they suddenly appear to be a formidable partnership. Undoubtedly they work better together when they Louis van Gaal dispenses with the nonsense of who is ‘nine’ and who is ‘10’. They were made to play together and their relationship benefited as a result. His first goal was a deft finish and so was his second, arriving at the back stick to meet Rooney’s accurate 71st minute free-kick. It was there that he ran straight toward the thousands of travelling United supporters chanting ‘Louis van Gaal’s red and white army’ throughout the second half. Make no mistake, Van Persie is one of them again.","Man United ace Robin van Persie scored two goals against Southampton .

"ARE THEY FRIENDS OR FOES? Best of enemies? It didn’t look that way when Ronald Koeman and Louis van Gaal shook hands before kick off at St Mary’s.

Chris Smalling's 19th minute injury means he joins Angel di Maria, Luke Shaw, Daley Blind, Rafael, Phil Jones and Jesse Lingard in the bulging treatment room at Old Trafford.

"An African-American man was shot dead today by St Louis police officers after allegedly robbing a convenience store with a knife. A large crowd gathered behind police tape as news of the fatal shooting spread, raising their arms and chanting, 'hands up, don't shoot', a refrain which has become the war-cry for protesters on the streets of nearby Ferguson following the cop killing of Michael Brown. A St Louis police chief  waded into the crowd on Tuesday to explain what had happened in an effort to calm tensions following the second police shooting in the city in ten days. The suspect, 23, charged at officers  waving the knife when he was killed at 12.30pm,  Police Chief Sam Dotson said. There are now fears that the shooting could cause tensions to boil over again tonight in Ferguson. On Monday 78 arrests were made, the majority for people refusing to disperse when ordered by police.

Firefighters hose off the area where St Louis police say officers shot and killed a 23-year-old man who was wielding a knife and refused to drop it on Tuesday after robbing a convenience store . St Louis police Chief Sam Dotson explains to a crowd of people what occured when a St Louis police officer shot and killed a 23-year-old man who was wielding a knife on Tuesday in an effort to calm tensions . Ferguson's leaders urged residents on Tuesday to stay home after dark to 'allow peace to settle in' where the fatal shooting of 18-year-old  Brown has sparked nightly clashes between protesters and police. Today's shooting took place outside the Six Stars Market, four miles from Ferguson which has been rocked by unrest over last week's cop shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. No officers were injured in today's incident. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. The suspect stole two energy drinks, according to KMOV, left the store but then returned to take a pastry. Fox reported that the man, who was behaving 'erratically', got into a dispute with the owner who called 911. When police arrived, the man reportedly shouted: 'Shoot me now, kill me now.' The 23-year-old was holding the knife in an overhand grip, the police chief said today. A suspect who had a knife was shot dead by a police officer in North St Louis on Tuesday, authorities confirmed . St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson waded into the crowd today following the shooting to try to reassure citizens as tensions run high in the Missouri city . The officers left their patrol car without their weapons drawn and warned the man multiple times to drop the weapon, the police chief said. However when the man charged at them with the knife raised and was within three or four feet, they opened fire and killed him. The officers who shot the man were placed on administrative duty pending an investigation into the death. Chief Dotson waded into the crowd today to share more details about the police's initial investigation, in an apparent effort to calm tensions. Bystanders asked why the man was not Tasered, according to a reporter for Msnbc. Tasers are not standard issue for the St Louis Police Department, Christopher Hayes reported. A large crowd had already gathered at the scene of a convenience store shooting in North St Louis on Tuesday, ten days after another cop killed a teenager four miles away in Ferguson . The store owner of Six Stars Market (pictured) called police today after a man tried to rob his store with a knife and was acting 'erratically' A heavy police presence was on the scene cordoning off the area with crime scene tape and blocking intersections with patrol vehicles. The cop shooting on Tuesday comes ten days after a police officer in a St Louis suburb shot dead an unarmed teenager. Officer Darren Wilson fired at least six shots at 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9 in Ferguson, killing him in the street. The National Guard arrived in Ferguson Monday but kept its distance from the streets during another night of unrest. Protesters filled the streets after nightfall Monday, and officers trying to enforce tighter restrictions at times used bullhorns to order them to disperse. Police deployed noisemakers and armored vehicles to push demonstrators back. Officers fired tear gas and flash grenades. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is in charge of security in Ferguson, said bottles and Molotov cocktails were thrown from the crowd and that some officers had come under heavy gunfire. Demonstrators no longer faced the neighborhood's midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew, but police told protesters that they could not assemble in a single spot and had to keep moving. After the streets had been mostly cleared, authorities ordered reporters to leave as well, citing the risk from the reported gunfire.

"Robin van Persie scored both goals in Manchester United's 2-1 win at Southampton on Monday night, but the game's statistics at St Mary's make for alarming reading for Louis van Gaal's side. United were poor for large patches of the match and this was highlighted by the fact they only managed to muster three shots throughout - and all from the left-foot of Van Persie. The trio of strikes from the Dutchman is the lowest recorded by the Red Devils in any Premier League game since August 2003, as well as by any side in England's top flight this season. Robin van Persie scored twice from three shots - the only efforts Manchester United managed all match . Van Persie, pictured with Juan Mata (left) and Marouane Fellaini (right) celebrates after scoring the opener . Under Van Gaal it seems United are still searching for the right tactic to employ as the club’s crippling injury list continues to force the 63-year-old's hand when it comes to picking his strongest XI. The inconsistency in his team selection is clearly hampering the attacking flow of his charges and this was exemplified by the fact the Red Devils only had six touches in the opposing penalty box over the course of the 90 minutes - 26 fewer than the Saints. What's perhaps more surprising is the fact that Radamel Falcao - a striker who cost United £6million to bring to Old Trafford for a season on loan and who they would need to stump up another £40m to sign next summer - remained firmly on the bench despite the lack of firepower up front. United boss Van Gaal said before the match that Falcao can 'only play for 20 minutes' due to a lack of 'match fitness', and clearly he decided the Colombian could not be risked at St Mary's. And this despite the fact Falcao's wife Lorelei Taron posted on her Instagram account a picture of the striker training with the caption: '100% ready to give everything !!!'. Van Gaal's counterpart Ronald Koeman was flabbergasted at how his side lost the match, but was quick to acknowledge the predatory instincts of Van Persie. Van Persie helped Manchester United claim all three points against Southampton at St Mary's . But Louis van Gaal's side registered the fewest number of efforts on goal in the Premier League this season . United had Radamel Falcao on the bench but Van Gaal did not opt to use him despite his side's lack of shots . The 31-year-old's second saw him register his seventh goal in as many games against the south coast outfit and took his career tally to 140 Premier League  strikes - making him the 10th player in history to achieve the feat. Despite United's fortuitous win, the three points move the Old Trafford club to third in the Premier League as they recorded five league victories in a row for the first time since winning seven on the spin in March 2013. That year, United won the title. Although they are a long way from achieving that feat this campaign, Van Gaal won’t care if his side can continue their run by merit or by fortune.

"Veteran Secret Service agent Julia Pierson has been sworn in as the agency's first female director. It's the latest stage in a long career journey for Ms Pierson - described a tough, no-nonsense operator - that had its unlikely beginning at Disney World in Florida. Ms Pierson, who is from the Sunshine State, even cites that high school job as good preparation for her three-decade and counting career with the agency responsible for protecting the president.

Well-earned: President Obama shakes hands with U.S. Secret Service agent Julia Pierson after she is sworn in . Honor: Pierson's appointment does not require Senate confirmation. She takes over an agency that has been marred by scandal, including a prostitution scandal last year in Colombia . During an Oval Office ceremony, . President Obama said Ms Pierson is breaking the mould in the . male-dominated agency. And he joked she would have more control over his . and Vice President Joe Biden's lives than anyone except their spouses. The Secret Service is charged with . protecting the president, vice president and their families, as well as . investigating financial crimes. Ms Pierson's appointment does not . require Senate confirmation. She takes over an agency that has been . marred by scandal, including a prostitution farce last year in Colombia. 'Over her 30 years of experience with . the Secret Service, Julia has consistently exemplified the spirit and . dedication the men and women of the service demonstrate every day,' Obama said as he announced the appointment. Unlikely start: Ms Pierson's first high school job was at Disney World in her home state of Florida, where she even wore character outfits. She said the experience helped her learn how to deal with large crowds . At the Secret Service, Ms Pierson has . served as deputy assistant director of the office of protective . operations, assistant director of human resources and training and chief . of staff. She started in 1983 as a special agent in Miami. Before that, she was a police officer in Orlando, Florida. And before that, as a teenager, she . was was a worker at Florida's Disney World theme park, where she even . wore one of the character outfits so beloved by the attractions young . visitors. It's a role she believes helped prepare her for her career in the Secret Service. She told Smithsonian.com in 2007: 'I . started off in the parking lot, advanced to watercraft, and I wore one . of those character outfits for a while in Americans on Parade. 'I think the experience of dealing . with large crowds at the park had a good influence on my ability to do . that sort of work with the Secret Service. Obama seems to agree . He said: 'Julia is eminently qualified . to lead the agency that not only safeguards Americans at major events . and secures our financial system, but also protects our leaders and our . first families, including my own. New direction: Named the agency's first female director, Obama's choice, Pierson seen left, signals his desire to change the culture at the male-dominated service, which has been marred by scandal . 'Julia has had an exemplary career, and I know these experiences will guide her as she takes on this new challenge to lead the impressive men and women of this important agency.' Thirteen Secret Service employees were caught up in last year's prostitution scandal. After a night of heavy partying in the Caribbean resort city of Cartagena, the employees brought women, including prostitutes, to the hotel where they were staying. The incident became public after one agent refused to pay a prostitute and the pair argued about payment in a hotel hallway. Eight of the employees were forced out of the agency, three were cleared of serious misconduct and at least two have been fighting to get their jobs back. Replaced: U.S. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, seen in May of 2012, announced his retirement last month following a prostitution scandal among his agents in Cartagena, Colombia last year . The incident took place before Obama arrived in Colombia and the service said the president's safety was never compromised. But news of the scandal broke during his trip, overshadowing the summit and embarrassing the U.S. delegation. Sullivan issued a new code of conduct that bans employees from drinking within 10 hours of starting a shift or bringing foreign nationals back to their hotel rooms. Sullivan apologized for the incident last year during testimony before a Senate panel. 'I have known and worked with Julie for close to thirty years,' said Sullivan in a statement on Tuesday. 'She was an excellent Assistant Director and Chief of Staff, demonstrating sound judgment, leadership, character, and commitment to our Country, the men and women of the U.S. Secret Service and those we serve and protect.

"Abigail Hernandez has been safely reunited with her family after disappearing nine months ago. The 15-year-old vanished on October 9 from her home in New Hampshire. Zenya Hernandez, Abigail’s mother, said today 'we are the happiest people on earth', according to a release from the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. A press release this week said that the . facts and circumstances surrounding Abigail's disappearance are still . under investigation. Scroll down for video . Abigail Hernandez, a New Hampshire teenager, has been safely reunited with her family after disappearing ten months ago . The family had received a glimmer of hope after Abby wrote and posted them a letter in the weeks after her disappearance. Authorities . revealed few details about the letter at the time out of fear copycats could hamper . the investigation and asked the family to do the same. Investigators had given no updates as to whether the letter has produced any leads. Mrs Hernandez told ABC in December that she believed her daughter was still alive. She said: 'If Abby comes back, she won't be the ''missing girl''. We can get our lives back to normal. 'I . would meet her anywhere she needs me to. She needs to know she is not . in trouble with anyone. I just love her and want her home safe.' Zenya Hernandez posted this heartbreaking letter begging her daughter to come for the holidays after she has been missing since October 9 . Contact: Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya, pictured left with the teenager's sister Sarah, wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter begging her to come home in December. She has now safely returned . In a heartbreaking open letter with a . little sketch of a Christmas tree, the distraught mother wrote: 'I . thank God every day that you are alive! 'I miss hearing your voice and your sense of humor. Please let me know what I can do to help you. 'Please come home for Christmas.' Earlier . on December 12, she wrote on the family's site: 'I will ALWAYS love . you. I will ALWAYS have hope. i will NEVER stop looking. Love, MOM.' Abigail Hernandez wrote her mother a letter postmarked October 23 that was received by the family on November 6. Officials . delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed . in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager. Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety. One . FBI investigator had suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to . the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten . years by Ariel Castro. Returned: Abigail Hernandez, pictured in security footage on the day she disappeared, returned home Sunday . The content of the letter or where it was postmarked has not been revealed as police fear copycats could send letters that would hamper the investigation. Abigail was last seen on Wednesday, October 9, leaving Kennett High School in North Conway. Police . said she walked her normal route home and sent several texts to a . friend between 2:30 and 3pm. At first, police said she made it home but . later this was proved false. Authorities . also released a picture of necklace that the teenager often wore along . with a purse she was carrying at the time of her disappearance, in the . hope of jogging someone's memory. Ms Young said: 'This is a child. She was 14 when she disappeared and had her 15th birthday a few days later.' She . added that the missing girl has no source of income, so someone is . helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe'. FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated. Since . her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public . pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that . they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is . in serious trouble.

I want to be me.’ Scroll down for video . Cleveland house of horrors survivor Michelle Knight wants to assume a normal life having grown frustrated with the fame that has followed her escape from Ariel Castro and 11 years in captivity . She says she now becomes frightened when crowds sometimes gather around her as she walks alone. She also finds it annoying when people snap cellphone photos without asking. Meanwhile people from her distant past have reappeared, feigning friendship but ultimately seeking money. ‘You have to be careful every day because of the book and the money and the “it” factor of who you are,’ she said. ‘They're not coming at me to be my friend. They want what I have.’ The girl who grew up without a toothbrush is also very grateful for the opportunities that have come her way since her escape in May 2013. Putting the past behind her: Michelle Knight speaks during the sentencing phase for Ariel Castro, right, in a Cleveland courtroom in Aug, 2013 . Knight – who these days prefers to be called Lily Rose Lee - and the other two women kidnapped by Castro split $1.4 million in donations collected after their escape. Phil McGraw of Dr. Phil television fame presented Knight with an oversized check for more than $400,000 from his foundation. She now has her own apartment after her book, Finding Me, spent five weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers List. In her book Knight writes that she grew up under less than ideal circumstances. Food and clothing were hard to come by. Strangers drifted in and out of the house at all hours. She said her mother kept her home from school for days at a time to care for her twin brothers and assorted cousins who lived there.

Knight's book, Finding Me, spent five weeks on the New York Times Bestsellers List . She ran away from home at 15 and lived beneath a highway underpass and then with a drug dealer for a few months. It was the most nurturing period of her early life, she now says. Knight was 21 when Castro lured her to his home in August 2002. Amanda Berry was abducted in April 2003 just a day shy of her 17th birthday, and Gina DeJesus was 14 when he kidnapped her a year later. The women escaped from Castro's home on May 6, 2013. Castro took a plea deal to avoid a potential death sentence and received life in prison plus 1,000 years. He hanged himself in his prison cell a month after sentencing. While Berry and DeJesus were reunited with loving families who had prayed that they would someday return, Knight refused to meet her mother who had flown to Cleveland from Florida. She spent the first four months of her freedom in an assisted living facility because she had nowhere else to go. Knight said her 3,911 days in captivity have helped instill in her a deep appreciation for what's good in the world. ‘It's just the little stupid things, like picking up a phone or writing in a book or looking out a window or just seeing a bird fly by,’ she said.

"Jim Soar, 53, suffers from cluster headaches . When did you last behave like a two-year-old in public? I mean the full tantrum package: red face, crying, wailing, shouting and stamping. It was probably when you were a toddler. My last such performance was two months ago in a Sainsbury's car park, and I'm 53. Very undignified. In fact, bent over in agony on the driving seat of our car, I made such a racket that two concerned shoppers called an ambulance. My excuse is that, like at least 60,000 others in the UK, I suffer from cluster headaches, which leave those they afflict in temporary agony. A cluster headache is unlike the headaches that almost everyone has from time to time - the pain is extraordinary: women who suffer from cluster headaches say it's worse than childbirth, and neurologists have described it as 'the most severe pain experienced by mankind'. Attacks, while not life-threatening in themselves, are so excruciating that some sufferers have taken their lives, hence the alternative name 'suicide headaches'. I am a fairly textbook case: I was 38 when my cluster headaches started - most sufferers are diagnosed in their 30s or 40s, and the condition is five times more common in men, though it's not clear why. The pain affects the face and head on just one side. During an attack, my left eyelid droops and my left nostril runs; others may have right-sided pain; a few find that it can swap sides. Again, no one knows why. In my case, the epicentre shifts from my temple to the ear, eye socket and nose. It has troughs, peaks and plateaus, surging, almost vanishing, then returning redoubled. During an attack I can't think or speak. To distract from the pain I pace, rock, chant, wail or sing. Any phrase or snatch of pop song will do. To any stranger watching and listening I must seem raving mad. But after the pain has fully escalated I don't care. Painkillers don't help - for me the only thing that can provide relief during an attack is breathing pure oxygen from a canister, via a mask. Cluster headaches are one of a small group of so-called primary headaches, i.e. those for which no cause has yet been found. In some cases there is probably a genetic link (though no one else in my family has them) and they are more common in smokers (I was formerly a heavy smoker and still smoke a few cigarettes each day). Jim made do with paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen but to no avail (picture posed by model) The pain comes from behind the sinuses, from a cluster of nerves called the trigeminal ganglia. Thanks to advanced scanning techniques, neurologists know that the impulses that set off the agony in these nerves originate in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls circadian rhythms - our 'body clock'. The connection with body clock rhythms may help to explain the cluster headache pattern: they occur in bouts over a period of one to three months, once or twice a year. I've had one such bout a year, lasting six weeks, since 2000, normally from July to September. Within this time, you experience any number of attacks. The attack frequency builds to a peak, then recedes. One day you feel a mild twinge, a few days later another, worsening until headaches happen about eight times a day, every day.My early attacks, though terrifying, were 15-minute wonders, each ending abruptly as if some invisible hand had flipped a switch from 'Torture' to 'Pain-free Bliss'. But by 2007 they were lasting 30 minutes and taking longer to subside. Last summer it was up to an hour. Number of GP consultations for headaches and migraines . You usually get less than a minute's warning. For some it's a droopy eyelid, for me a dull ache in the nose. After that it's downhill fast. At home, I try to reach an oxygen cylinder as fast as possible; it's the most reliable way to take the edge off, though it does little to quell the strongest spells. Attacks make you sweat profusely, and between them you are exhausted - I also get nightmares throughout a cluster headache bout. My long-suffering wife, daughter and dog are all used to the different creature I become during a bout. Yet it could be worse. Unluckiest of all are the 20 per cent of victims whose headaches never, or hardly ever, go away. They are said to have chronic cluster headache. What triggers an attack is another mystery, though exercise, heat, strong sunlight and alcohol can all provoke a monster headache - alcohol especially, though outside a cluster bout it has no unusual effects. The bad news for 'clusterheads' is that the condition is a lifelong curse. The good news is that periods of remission tend to lengthen with age and there is hope of major medical progress. 'It's not unreasonable to think a cure may be found,' says Professor Peter Goadsby, one of the world's leading experts on cluster headache, who is based at King's College Hospital, London. 'The brain knows how to stop the pain of an attack - it's us who don't. We have to find that piece of the puzzle.' The Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headache (or, for short, OUCH - which hardly does justice to the agony sufferers endure), has helped to organise further brain-imaging investigations to try to discover why cluster headaches occur. He started using oxygen canisters in 2007 . In Norway, scientists were able to numb the side of the face to relieve pain during a cluster bout by injecting Botox up patients' noses through the membrane at the back of the sinuses, to reach the nerve complex. Other research has suggested that small doses of LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in 'magic mushrooms') can banish cluster headaches for months or even years. The reasons have yet to be explained. In the less exotic and entirely legal world of the NHS, the first hurdle is getting a diagnosis. According to OUCH, this used to take 25 years on average. Now it's down to six years. One problem is that often it takes a neurologist to identify the symptoms properly. It is common for GPs to mistake cluster headache for other conditions - for instance, trigeminal neuralgia, which causes extreme facial pain. I was lucky. After an MRI scan had ruled out a brain tumour in 2001, I stumbled on my symptoms in a book about headaches and told my GP, who agreed. At first I made do with paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen - handfuls of them - but to no avail. I moved on to more powerful opiate painkillers, including liquid morphine, but even that wasn't fully effective. The standard remedies for cluster headaches are the migraine medication sumatriptan (to abort attacks) and blood pressure drug verapamil (to prevent them) and I tried both over the seven years after my diagnosis. For me, suma-triptan tablets proved ineffective, though the nasal sprays worked better. Verapamil, which you take at the first sign of symptoms and is the first-choice treatment, might have proved a boon, but then I had a heart attack, which meant I had to stop taking it. In fact, my GP ruled out both drugs - sumatriptan because it narrows blood vessels, raising the risk of a blocked artery, and verapamil because it affects the heart muscle. I started using oxygen canisters in 2007. Available on prescription from the GP, oxygen remains my chief general weapon against the pain. I strap on a special mask and inhale deeply and repeatedly for as long as an attack lasts. It doesn't take long to drain a large canister. It's not clear exactly how it works, though oxygen has been shown to lessen sensitivity in facial nerves and it helps in 75 per cent of cases. Yet according to Professor Goadsby, only one cluster headache sufferer in ten is prescribed it, as neither they nor their doctors are aware it's an option. Five years ago, I was referred to leading specialist Dr Manjit Matharu, at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, in London. He has given me regular injections with steroids and painkillers in the back of my neck - these act on the greater occipital nerve, which runs from the spine to the back of the head. There are nerve pathways between the occipital and trigeminal nerves. These injections don't always work for cluster headaches, but in my case they seemed to help. The first ended my bout after a week, but the effectiveness of subsequent injections has been less clear - it may be that the bout would have ended when it did anyway. At the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Dr Sarah Miller and others are conducting a trial of R-verapamil, a version of the drug that doesn't affect the heart muscle. If it works and is approved, I'll be first in line. Meanwhile, I am taking the clinically unproven preventative melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the body clock. Does it help with cluster headaches? Well, this year's bout has ended, though it lasted even longer than usual. I suspect that, despite being in expert hands, I have plenty more pain in store. Not to mention humiliating trips to the supermarket.","Jim Soar, 53, suffers from agonising cluster headaches .

"Chilling audio recordings heard by the Ferguson grand jury have been released, revealing the shots that killed Michael Brown and the police scrambling for back up as the unarmed teen lay dead in the street. In one, a clearly shaken officer arriving on the scene just moments after the August 9 shooting urgently states, . ‘We need several more units over here..there’s going to be a problem.’ A wail of anguish and weeping is audible in the background. SCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN TO AUDIO . Aftermath: Officer Darren Wilson stands over the body of Michael Brown in the aftermath of the fatal encounter. New audio reveals how Ferguson Police called for help with 'crowd control' Seen: Video footage captured officer Wilson pacing near Michael Brown's body after he had shot the teenager . Police presence:  Audio recordings disclose that Ferguson police asked for more officers to come to the scene . Shooting: Officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown dead in August after a confrontation between the unarmed teenager and the officer . The recordings are part of a second evidence dump promised as part of Prosecutor Bill McCulloch’s controversial decision to publicly release Grand Jury evidence without a judge’s sanction and while Federal and Department of Justice investigations into the shooting remain ongoing. The Ferguson dispatchers repeated calls for all available units in Ferguson and St Louis County provides an audible timeline of the situation on the ground in the Missouri town where angry, mourning crowds – estimated by some to number in the hundreds – had gathered on the stretch of street where Brown’s body lay, uncovered for four hours. The recordings filed in sequence reveal that medical services were only requested after several calls for police backup and detectives were placed. In his own testimony Wilson admitted that he made no calls for medics and no witness statement has him approaching Brown to test for any signs of life. After the dispatcher puts out a call for ‘any available Ferguson units,’ the officer on the ground renews his request with increased urgency: ‘We’re going to need crowd control over here.’ Ferguson grand jury’s decision not to indict former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, 28, for the fatal shooting this summer which saw him pump six bullets into unarmed teen was the spark that saw protests catch fire across the country. Protest: Demonstrations have swept America under the 'hands up, don't shoot' slogan and have now embraced the 'I can't breathe' slogan prompted by the death of Eric Garner as a police officer used a chokehold while arresting him in Staten Island, New York, for selling single cigarettes. SloganSlogan: Cleveland Cavaliers' star LeBron James warms up before an NBA basketball game against the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center wearing an 'I can't breathe' t-shirt before a match watched by Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge . Spreading: LeBron James, the Cleveland Cavaliers star became the latest sportsman to wear t-shirts with slogans inspired by the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner as he warmed up ahead of a basketball fixture watched by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge in Brooklyn, New York. Marching under the banner, ‘Hands up Don’t Shoot’ – taken from the widely discredited testimony of Brown’s companion that day, Dorian Johnson – protesters took to the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, St Louis and beyond. Five St Louis Rams players drew praise and opprobrium in equal measure when they walked onto the field with their hands held up in support of Michael Brown. A New York grand jury’s decision not to indict Staten Island officer Daniel Pantaleo for the fatal chokehold arrest of Erica Garner was met with similar outrage by protesters in the streets of New York, Washington and cities across the States. New York Mayor, Bill Blasio refused to endorse the Grand Jury’s decision. He described the failure to indict in the face of damning video footage and the Medical Examiner’s finding of ‘death by homicide,’ as ‘a national moment of grief..and frustration.’ Last night spectators at the basketball game attended by Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge wore ‘I can’t breathe’ T-shirts, a reference to Garner’s dying words as he begged Pantaleo to release him from his fatal hold. Summit: New York mayor Bill de Blasio met President Obama at the White House over the escalating concerns about relations between police and the black community after the Eric Garner and Michael Brown rulings . Escalation: In Berkeley, California, there has been violence four nights in a row with police using tear gas an baton rounds against protesters. Secret wedding: Officer Wilson married his partner Barbara Spradling shortly before the grand jury reached his decision . Pantaleo remains at work, though off patrol. Officer Wilson who had been in hiding and on paid administrative leave last week resigned from Ferguson Police Department citing as his reasons the threat to his brother officers’ safety that his continued service would bring and his hope that his action would ‘help the community heal.’ He married his partner, fellow Ferguson cop Barbara Spradling during his time in hiding and announced that they are expecting their first child in a post Grand Jury television interview. And though he resigned without severance pay, fundraising efforts of his supporters have garnered him a potential war chest of $1million. Brown’s family may yet bring a civil case against the officer. And while Wilson’s supporters have pointed to conflicting eye witness accounts of the shooting and insist that the officer feared for his life, MailOnline last week revealed that Wilson himself changed his story about just what happened in the crucial moments that lead to his fatal encounter with Brown. In Wilson’s now very public account of his encounter with Michael Brown and Dorian Johnson on August 9 he has claimed that he asked Brown and Wilson to move to the sidewalk rather than walk in the street. When they walked on, Wilson has repeatedly stated, he realized they matched the description of two suspects wanted in connection with the robbery of nearby Ferguson Market. A youth matching Brown’s description had stolen a box of Swishers cigarillos. It was this realization, he stated, that caused him to reverse his vehicle and sparked the car-side confrontation that left Brown dead on the street with six bullets in his body. But the sworn testimony of Wilson’s squad supervisor directly contradicts this account. Wilson’s supervisor was the first officer to speak with the 28-year-old cop following the shooting. The men spoke before St Louis County Police had even been notified of the incident and before the medical examiner or investigating officers had arrived on the scene. At that time, the Supervisor admitted,‘He [Wilson] did not know anything about the stealing call.’ When pressed by the attorney questioning him the officer reiterated that Wilson, ‘did not know anything.’ Asked, ‘He told you he didn’t know about there being a stealing at Ferguson Market?’ The officer responded, ‘Correct.’ Nor did he make any mention of reversing back towards the youths. In fact the Squad Supervisor stated that, in several subsequent conversations, Wilson said ‘he did not have that call.’ The first batch of Grand Jury evidence, released on the day of their decision and reviewed by MailOnline, has revealed a litany of failures to follow protocol. Wilson handed in and bagged his own gun in direct contradiction to recognised St Louis County procedure which demands strict guidelines in the securing and sealing of a weapon when fired by an officer with fatal consequences. Theft: Officer Wilson's evidence that he was aware of the robbery of a store in Ferguson by Michael Brown directly contradicted what he had told his squad supervisor immediately after the shooting . The weapon was not brushed for fingerprints, key measurements were not taken at the scene, interviews were not recorded or annotated. Photographs were not taken because a battery was flat in the relevant officer’s camera. And though Wilson claimed that he had feared for his life and that, punched twice by Brown in a tussel by his squad vehicle, he feared a third punch might kill him, medical records show him to have sustained nothing more serious that mild bruising to his jawline.","Audio recordings played to Ferguson grand jury now made public .

Take one of the nation's most beloved summer pastimes - backyard cricket and if you mix it with one of the countries most used outdoor items, an esky and it's the Cricket Cooler (pictured x3) Cool or what! The new Cricket Cooler (pictured) is equip with stumps (also used as a handle and rotate) cup holders, wheels and is 33 litre capacity . A prototype was put onto Kickstarter by two Adelaide lads which had pledges of more than $40,000 . Combine an Aussie tradition with an well used Aussie item and you get the Cricket Cooler . Adelaide lads Adam Dubrich and Leigh Warren came up with the idea when they struggled to drag all of their stuff from the car to the park one day with family and friends. They had an abundance of gear from coolers, picnic rugs, hampers, bats, balls and the rest. 'We knew we could help solve this and in the process make something really cool and useful at the same time,' they said. 'You only need to take a look at any beach in Australia or drive past the local park and you will see children, teenagers and adults playing our beloved sport, Cricket.' 'Instead of stumps (wicket) they will use a bin, a body board, a chair or any other item that can double as a wicket.' The Cricket Cooler (pictured) has a 33 litre compartment capacity . It's so handy the stumps double as a handle and rotate 270 degrees . You can also opt to put the stumps down on the Cricket Cooler (pictured) WOW! cup holders too. The Cricket Cooler is an essential for every Aussie . So to kill two birds with one stone, the boys imagined and designed what is now the Cricket Cooler which they say perfectly reflects the Australian culture. 'Good times with friends and family, sport, recreation and the outdoors lifestyle.' With the 2015 cricket season approaching, which includes the Cricket World cup, they pledged their idea to Kickstarter to go towards the production of the unique product.

"A Mexican couple have been accused of beating a four-year-old boy to death because he couldn't count. The child, named by police as Raúl Antonio, was allegedly beaten in by his aunt and uncle till he showed no signs of life, in Ecatepec, in the suburbs of Mexico City, on Tuesday. MarÌa Guadalupe Tovar Hernández, 33, and Guillermo Delgadillo Becerra, 43, confessed to killing Raúl and dumping his tiny dead body on waste ground, a statement from Ecatepec police said. Confession: MarÌa Guadalupe Tovar Hernández, 33, (left) and Guillermo Delgadillo Becerra, 43, (right) have admitted killing four-year-old Raúl Antonio by violently beating him as punishment for not being able to count to 10 . The young boy had been abandoned by his . mother and was then raised by his aunt and uncle -- his two legal . guardians. According to his aunt, the boy had been living with them in the Guadalupe La Venta colony in Ecatepec, Mexico and she claimed that Raul had left the home and had not returned. The couple originally reported Raúl Antonio as missing. Officials began investigating the couple when their original statements contained details that did not match. The aunt and uncle on Wednesday admitted that Raúl Antonio was beaten the day before, as punishment for not knowing how to count to 10. They revealed in their confession that they were beating him to discipline him. When Raúl failed to show signs of life, they realised he had died. They then moved the body to an abandoned lot in Chapultepec, a neighboring town to Ecatepec. Police in Ecatepec City investigated the location described by the couple where they found the lifeless body of Raúl Antonio, reports El Universal. María Guadalupe Tovar Hernández and Guillermo Delgadillo Becerra have been detained by the authorities of Ecatepec and murder charges have been filed. Physical punishment as a means to discipline children has become increasingly frowned upon by the international community. The United Nations Committee on the rights of the Child called for ending physical punishment in 2006 stating that it ""legalized violence against children"" and it should be eliminated via ""legislative, administrative, social and educational measures.""","Four-year-old Raúl Antonio beaten to death for not being able to count .

"Arsene Wenger made his first ever signing as Arsenal manager exactly 18 years ago on Monday when he brought 17-year-old striker Nicolas Anelka to the club from PSG. The long-serving Gunners boss has been responsible for bringing in some of the greatest talent the Premier League has seen during his time in north London, as well as some flops along the way too. Here, Sportsmail picks out the best signing from each of Wenger's 18 seasons in charge of the club. Nicolas Anelka Arsene Wenger's first signing as Arsenal manager, 18 years ago on Monday . 1996-97 . Nicolas Anelka - £500,000 from PSG . Anelka was Wenger's very first signing for Arsenal and the young French striker went on to top score for the club in the 1998-99 season with 17 Premier League goals. He earned the PFA Young Player of the Year award but fans turned on him because of a perceived poor attitude and Wenger sold Anelka to Real Madrid for £22m. The young French striker was Arsenal's top scorer in the 1998-99 season before he was sold to Real Madrid . 1997-98 . Marc Overmars - £7million from Ajax . The pacey Dutch winger thrilled Arsenal fans with his direct style of play down the left flank and Overmars scored in the FA Cup final in his debut season. He went on to make 100 Premier League appearances for club before moving to Spanish giants Barcelona for £25m, making him the most expensive Dutch footballer at the time. Marc Overmars joined the Gunners from Ajax for £7m and was sold to Barcelona three seasons later for £25m . 1998-99 . Freddie Ljungberg - £3million from Halmstads BK . The little-known midfielder became a transfer record for a Swedish player when Wenger brought him to Highbury and he went on to develop a reputation for scoring important goals in big games. Ljungberg scored more than 70 goals for the Gunners and made more than 300 appearances during a nine-year spell at Arsenal winning two Premier League titles and three FA Cups. Freddie Ljungberg became the most expensive Swedish player ever when he joined Arsenal for £3m . 1999-00 . Thierry Henry - £11million from Juventus . Arsene Wenger's greatest ever signing, Henry joined the club from Juventus as a left winger before he was transformed into one of the Premier League's most deadliest strikers. Henry is fifth on the all-time goalscoring list and was the star player in Arsenal's title-winning invicibles side in the 2003-04 season as he netted 30 times. Arsene Wenger turned Thierry Henry from a winger into one of the deadliest strikers in Premier League history . 2000-01 . Robert Pires - £6million from Marseille . Arsenal fought off competition from Real Madrid to secure Pires' signature from Marseille and the former France international was worth every penny of the £6m fee. The graceful midfielder contributed goals and assists as he played a key role in the Gunners' double-winning season in 2001-02 and reproduced his scintillating form as he was selected in the PFA Team of the Year for three consecutive seasons. Former France international Robert Pires played a key role in Arsenal's double-winning side in 2001-02 . 2001-02 . Sol Campbell - Free transfer from Tottenham . The former England international made the contentious move to switch north London allegiances after joining Arsenal from fierce rivals Tottenham on a free transfer. Any danger of supporters not taking to the commanding defender was quickly dispelled as he helped Wenger's side claim the double during his first season at the club. Sol Campbell made switch from Tottenham to Arsenal and helped Gunners win the double in his first season . 2002-03 . Gilberto Silva - £4.5million from Atletico Mineiro . A series of impressive displays during the 2002 World Cup with Brazil earned Gilberto a move to the Premier League champions and the midfielder fitted seamlessly into Wenger's side. The Brazilian made 35 Premier League appearances during his debut season and formed a formidable partnership at the heart of the Arsenal side with Patrick Vieira. Brazilian Gilberto Silva formed a formidable partnership with Patrick Vieira in the middle of midfield . 2003-04 . Cesc Fabregas - Free transfer from Barcelona . Pinched from Barcelona as a 16-year-old, Fabregas, one of Wenger's greatest success stories, broke into the Arsenal side as a teenager and eventually took on Vieira's No 4 shirt after the Frenchman left for Juventus. The Spain international went on to captain the Gunners despite his young age, becoming one of the best Arsenal players post-invincible era, but he could not resist the overtures from boyhood club Barelona and sealed a £35m switch before joining Chelsea last summer. Cesc Fabregas joined Arsenal as a 16-year-old and went on to captain Wenger's side . 2004-05 . Mathieu Flamini - Free transfer from Marseille . Another young player plucked from relative obscurity by Wenger, Flamini endeared himself to the Arsenal fans with his no-nonsense tough-tackling approach. But after staking his claim as a regular and an important player in Wenger's side in 2007-08, Flamini refused to sign a new contract at Arsenal and left on a free that summer to join AC Milan. Mathieu Flamini broke into the Arsenal team but left on a free transfer to join AC Milan . 2005-06 . Theo Walcott - £9million from Southampton . Walcott burst on to the scene as a 16-year-old as a product of the famed Southampton academy and convinced Wenger to sign him after making just 21 appearances in the Championship. Walcott enjoyed his best season in 2012-13 when he netted 14 Premier League goals but has endured two years of injury hell that has prevented the pacey forward from fulfilling his early promise. Wenger signed a 17-year-old Theo Walcott from Southampton and he has gone on to make 159 appearances . 2006-07 . Alex Song - £1million from Bastia . The central midfielder, currently on loan at West Ham, was another from Wenger's crop of young stars that went on to enjoy huge success in the first team. Originally considered nothing more than a destroyer in the middle of the park, Song's technical ability and range of passing was evident in his final two seasons with the club as he struck up an accord with Robin van Persie, setting up a number of the Dutch striker's goals before he moved on to Barcelona. Alex Song joined Arsenal for £1m and was eventually sold to Barcelona for £15m . 2007-08 . Bacary Sagna - £6million from Auxerre . Another in the long list of French players Wenger successfully brought to Arsenal, Sagna became one of the Premier League's best right backs during his seven years at the club. Equally adept at going forward as he was defending Sagna was twice named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year before leaving the club at the end of his contract to join champions Manchester City last summer. Bacary Sagna was signed by Wenger in 2007 and became one of the Premier League's best right backs . 2008-09 . Andrei Arshavin - £15million from Zenit St Petersburg . The little Russian forward was hugely influential for Arsenal during his first 18 months at the club after singing on transfer deadline day in January 2009 following a series of impressive displays at Euro 2008. Arshavin scored all four goals for the Gunners in a 4-4 draw against Liverpool shortly after joining and scored 10 league goals the following season before a catastrophic drop in form saw him leave the club. Andrei Arshavin enjoyed a blistering start to his Arsenal career before his form completely slumped . 2009-10 . Thomas Vermaelen - £10million from Ajax . The Belgian centre back arrived from Ajax and appeared to be the solution to Arsenal's vulnerability in defence and even scored on his Premier League debut during a 6-1 win against Everton. His commanding displays saw him elevated to club captain after Fabregas left for Barcelona but Vermaelen was dropped from the Arsenal side before he followed in the footsteps of his predecessor and joined the Catalan club last summer for £15m. Thomas Vermaelen appeared to be the answer to Arsenal's defensive frailties before falling out of favour . 2010-11 . Laurent Koscielny - £10million from Lorient . The French defender joined the club with a lack of top-flight experience and Koscielny did little to dispel concerns that he lacked Premier League quality with a slow start to his career in north London. But the 29-year-old has gone on to earn a reputation as one of the best centre-backs in England and is now one of the first names on Wenger's team-sheet. After a slow start at Laurent Koscielny is now considered one of the best defenders in the Premier League . 2011-12 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - £12million from Southampton . Another signing from the Southampton academy, Oxlade-Chamberlain has excited both Arsenal and England fans in equal measure but his progress has been slowed by a number of injuries. Chamberlain earned rave reviews following an imperious display in central midfield against AC Milan in the Champions League during his first season, and at 21 he already has 20 international caps to his name. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's progress has been stalled by a series of injuries but is a clear talent . 2012-13 . Santi Cazorla - £16million from Malaga . Spain international Cazorla was signed from Malaga with the club in financial difficulty and the fee paid was considered a bargain for a player of his quality. Cazorla scored 12 Premier League goals during his first season in England and is hitting similar heights this campaign, scoring important goals to help Arsenal into third in the table. Signed by Wenger in 2012, Santi Cazorla scored 12 goals in his first season at the Emirates . 2013-14 . Mesut Ozil - £42.5million from Real Madrid . He was the singing that Arsenal fans had craved, the marquee that Wenger had proved so reluctant to bring to the club, and Ozil made a blistering start to his career at the Emirates. The World Cup winner's form tailed off towards the end of his first season before injury curtailed this campaign. But Ozil has been in fine form since his recent return to the side, reminding supporters why the club smashed their transfer record to take him from Real Madrid. Mesut Ozil was brought to Arsenal after the club smashed their transfer record . 2014-15 . Alexis Sanchez - £35million from Barcelona . Another world class talent, the Chilean has enjoyed a brilliant first season in England and is the club's leading Premier League scorer with 12 goals. Sanchez, who scored 19 La Liga goals for Barcelona in his final season in Spain, has an infectious enthusiasm that seems to inspire his team-mates and the 26-year-old should still have his best years ahead of him. Alexis Sanchez was Arsenal's big-money summer signing and is the club's leading Premier League scorer .","Arsene Wenger signed Nicolas Anelka 18 years ago on Monday .

"Krystian Bielik is only 16 years old, but has impressed at Legia Warsaw . Arsenal are keen on Legia Warsaw teenage midfielder Krystian Bielik. The 16-year-old has already broken into the Polish side's first team and is earmarked for a bright future. He is under contract until 2017 but Legia would consider offers for the 6ft 2ins defensive midfielder. Arsenal's Premier League rivals Everton have also watched Bielik but are focusing their attention on his older teammate midfielder Ondrej Duda. The 20-year-old Slovakia international has been watched by Roberto Martinez's trusted chief scout Kevin Reeves and has scored five goals this season. Arsene Wenger is no stranger to using players from his youth ranks, having named Chuba Akpom, Gedion Zelalem, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Stefan O'Connor, Alex Iwobi and Glen Kamara on his bench for the Champions League tie against Galatasaray on Tuesday night. Arsenal have already qualified for the Champions League knockout stages, but the game could still prove vital as the Gunners have a chance to finish top of their group.

"A British gang of suspected cyber criminals have been arrested over their involvement in the world’s biggest online marketplace for drugs. The five men and one woman were released on bail after being questioned by officials from the National Crime Agency. They are allegedly ‘significant’ players in the notorious secret website known as Silk Road 2.0, which is at the centre of the ‘dark web’ trade in illicit drugs, forged documents, criminal devices and even firearms. The British gang were arrested over their alleged involvement in Silk Road, the world's biggest online marketplace for drugs . It was targeted by a joint European and US operation across 17 countries which culminated in the closure of over 400 other websites and services. US agencies also announced the detention of the website’s alleged boss Blake Benthall, a 26-year-old from San Francisco, this week. The British arrests included a 20-year-old man from Liverpool, a 19-year-old man from New Waltham in Lincolnshire and a 30-year-old man from Cleethorpes. In Aberdovey, on the west coast of Wales, a 29-year-old man and a man and woman, both aged 58, were also held. The international operation involved dozens of cybercrime specialists who spent six months mapping the structure of the illegal sites. Raids around the world on those responsible for running them led to the seizure of drugs, guns, cash and $1million of virtual currency Bitcoin. The alleged homepage of Silk Road 2.0 website, which was taken down in a blaze of publicity by the FBI last year . Roy McComb, of the NCA, said further arrests are likely. He said the agency is ‘determined’ to prosecute people committing crime on the dark web, adding: ‘This is just like any other organised crime network.’ The original Silk Road website was taken down in blaze of publicity by the FBI in September 2013. Since the second version began trading a year ago, it is thought to have allowed more than 100,000 people to buy and sell contraband.

"President Barack Obama got unusually personal during an interview about race relations that aired Monday night on BET. The president spoke about his experiences as a young black man and opened up about concerns he has about the way his daughters, Sasha and Malia, and future grandsons could be treated in society because of their skin color. 'I want my children to be seen as the individuals that they are, and I want them to be judged based on the content of their character and their behavior and their talents and their gifts,' he told BET's Jeff Johnson. 'I don't want them to be objects of fear simply because of misguided attitudes.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama opened up about his personal experiences as a young black man during an interview with BET that aired on Monday night and shared his fears about the way his daughters and their future sons will be treated in society because of the color of their skin . Obama said that part of what makes the racial tension exploding in America 'so heart breaking and frustrating for a lot of folks' is 'the recognition that simply by virtue of color, you've got less margin for error.' That's particularly true for black boys,' Obama said. 'Young men, teenage boys, sometimes they're gonna do stupid stuff. That's true whether they're white, black, Hispanic, it doesn't matter.' The president said that 'most of the time it's harmless, sometimes it's careless' but then they grow up and become contributing members of society, though. 'And so it's not simply that we want to make sure that the perfect young man is treated OK. We also want a boy who is a boy, or a young man who is maybe a little confused, maybe makes some mistake, we want them to be given the same benefit of the doubt as any other man would or any other boy would be given,' he continued. 'I want my grandsons to be treated like anybody else's grandsons. If they're messing up, I think they should be corrected. They'll first be corrected by me, or their mother or their father. 'But I dont want them to be subjected to the kind of constant bias that makes them feel as if this is not their home. That they're not safe in their own neighborhoods, or that they cannot trust the institutions that are put in place supposedly to serve and protect them,' he stated. Obama said he believes the video of a New York City policeman holding down Eric Garner and choking him 'troubled' Americans of all walks of life and helped them reach the conclusion that it's time for a national discussion on racial profiling. 'It used to be that folks would say, well maybe blacks are exaggerating, maybe some of these situations aren't what they described,' Obama told Johnson. 'But we've now seen on television, for everybody to see, gives us an opportunity to finally have the kind of conversation that's been a long time coming.' The president said that 'a country's conscious sometimes has to be triggered by some inconvenience,' and that's what the Garner situation did for America. 'I think a lot of people who saw the Eric Garner video are troubled, even if they haven't had that same experience themselves' are not minorities themselves, he said. 'I think there are a lot of good, well-meaning people, I think there are a lot of police officers who might have looked at that and said, that is a tragedy what happened,' and we've got to try to figure out how to bring this sort of violence to an end, Obama continued. President Obama said today that he wants his daughters, Sasha, left, and Malia, right, pictured here at the National Christmas Tree lighting with their parents last week, to 'be objects of fear simply because of misguided attitudes' Furthermore, the peaceful protests that have followed that grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who killed Garner 'reminds the society, this is not yet done.' Obama said he believes that as long as protests are peaceful - as he and Johnson agreed the majority have been - they are 'necessary.' 'When they turn violent then they're counter productive,' he said. Drawing on his past experience as a community organizer in Chicago, Illinois, Obama acknowledged that his administration feels an 'enormous' amount of responsibility for the state of race relations in America, 'not just because as president you're always responsible for what happens in this country, but because of my particular experiences that I bring to this office.' The president said his meeting last week at the Oval Office with young civil rights activists, whom he described as primarily between the ages of 18 and 25, reminded him of his own youth. The young people told him they had been 'stopped for no reason' or 'generated suspicion' for being in neighborhoods that 'supposedly they didn't belong.' 'My mind went back to what it was like for me when I was 17, 18, 20, and as I told them, not only do I hear the pain and frustration of being subjected to that kind of constant suspicion, but part of the reason I got into politics, is to figure out how can I bridge some of those gaps of understanding so that the larger country understands this is not just a black problem or a brown problem, this is an American problem,' Obama told Johnson. The president hit back at his critics in the African-American community who feel that as someone who identifies as black, he's not reacting with the appropriate amount of outrage to recent cases of police brutality. 'Sometimes peoples' concerns are not based on fact because if you look after what happened with Michael Brown and you look at what happened after Trayvon if you look at the decision after Eric Garner, I'm being pretty explicit about my concern,' he said, 'and being pretty explicit about the fact that this is a systemic problem that black folks, and Latinos and others, are not just making this up.' 'I describe it in very personal terms,' he continued. The president observed that what some people in communities of color 'are frustrated by is me not simply saying, this is what the outcome should have been.' 'That I cannot do institutionally,' he contended. 'It is my Justice Department that is investigating these cases. And part of the rule of law is that I'm not putting my fingers, my thumb on the scale of justice. Obama said it 'could compromise investigations if it appeared that I was trying to steer it to a particular outcome.' Even so, the president said at another point in his interview with Johnson that he believed that Attorney General Eric Holder was correct to launch an investigation into Garner's death. Still, it's very important that investigations are being conducted at the state and local level properly because a 'high bar' exists for federal cases, he said.","'I want them to be judged based on....their behavior and their talents and their gifts,' Obama told BET's Jeff Johnson .

"The distraught older sister of 12-year-old Tamir Rice was tackled, handcuffed and held in the back of a police car in plain view of her grievously wounded brother, their mother claimed today. Speaking for the first time since she buried her son, Samaria Rice also demanded indictments, trials and convictions for officers, Frank Garmback, 46 and Tim Loehmann, 26, who shot her son dead on November 22 in a Cleveland, Ohio park. Speaking to ABC News, Samaria said that when she arrived at the park in a frantic state she saw her 14-year-old daughter languishing in the back of the same squad car that the officers arrived at the park in before the shot the boy dead. Anger: Samaria Rice described the moments after she arrived at the Cleveland, Ohio park where her son Tamir was shot dead last month . 'I couldn't believe they tackled her and put her in handcuffs and in the back of the same police car that was on the grass that the officer got out of and shot her brother so my daughter is sitting there looking at her brother on the ground,' Rice said this morning. Having already filed a wrongful death suit, Samaria has said she wants both the officers to be held accountable for what they have done. 'I'm looking for a conviction for both of the officers,' she said to ABC News. Her attorney is Benjamine Crump, who represented the parents of Michael Brown in Ferguson has said that the blame lies with the police. Tamir Rice, 12, was shot dead by cops in Cleveland on November 22 while carrying a pellet gun . 'If the Cleveland police is unequipped to deal with children playing with toys and toy guns, then we need to outlaw toy guns in Cleveland so we have no more children getting killed,' said Crump. 'You can't kill children playing at the playground with toy guns a few yards from their house,' he added. 'It's unimaginable and we have to address this very seriously.' The family filed a federal lawsuit on Friday against the city and the two officers who they claim acted recklessly when they confronted Tamir Rice outside a recreation center. Surveillance video, released by police, shows Tamir being shot within two seconds of a patrol car stopping near him at a park on November 22. It showed the boy reaching in his waistband for what police later discovered was an airsoft gun, which shoots non-lethal plastic projectiles. Tamir died the next day. Police have said rookie officer Tim Loehmann believed the boy had a real firearm. The shooting has sparked several protests across the city. Tamir was laid to rest on Wednesday. Two hundred mourners, many wearing white 'R.I.P. Tamir' t-shirts, paid their respects to the young boy at his funeral service at Mount Sinai Baptist Church. The boy's mother, Samaria Rice, hid behind sunglasses as she took her seat next to the boy's father, Leonard Warner, and their daughters, while mourners pored over photographs of Tamir. During the service, the boy's great-uncle called for people to fight for change through peaceful protest and called for the congregation to give Tamir a voice. Heartbroken: Samaria Rice, center, leaves the funeral services of her son Tamir Rice in Cleveland on Wednesday, 10 days after he was shot by a police officer who thought he was carrying a real gun . Tragic: Pallbearers carry out the 12-year-old boy's casket from Gaines Funeral Home on Wednesday . 'Tamir can no longer speak for himself. This is why Tamir must live through us. We must now be his voice,' Michael Petty said. 'Through us, Tamir will be heard from the grave. Through us, Tamir will prevent further senseless shootings... not only in Cleveland, but in this nation.' He added that police need to change how they train officers and take a closer look at how they communicate with dispatchers after messages were apparently not properly relayed to the officers in Tamir's case. 'We must now be his advocate for change and reform,' Petty said, NBC reported. 'Through peaceful protest, civil disobedience, and legislation, Tamir will be heard.' A teacher who taught Tamir at Marion C. Seltzer Elementary School also spoke at the services and said he was 'well liked' and 'would laugh and talk with students he didn't even know'. She said that while he loved to draw and play basketball, he was sometimes challenged by school work. She then turned to Tamir's mother. 'I thank you for your son's life,' she said. 'He will be greatly missed.' Loved: A mourner hold a program showing the  boy, who was shot dead by the officer on November 22 . Support: Tamir's uncle, Michael Petty, left, embraces pastor Jay Matthews as pastor Henry Curie (R) looks on during the funeral. Petty called on the congregation to give Tamir a voice through peaceful protests . The boy was remembered ten days after 26-year-old rookie cop Timothy Loehmann fatally shot him in a city park following a 911 call saying the boy was 'waving around a gun' and pointing it at people. It has since emerged that the 911 dispatcher did not rely the caller's comments that the weapon might be fake, and the officer shot the boy less that two seconds after he arrived on the scene. Footage of the incident shows the officers pulling up beside the boy in a park and yelling at him to put his hands up, authorities say. But rather than raise his hands, the boy apparently reaches towards his waist band and Loehmann shoots the boy. He died the following day. After the shooting, it emerged that the boy was just 12 and was carrying a replica 'airsoft' gun. Airsoft guns fire non-lethal spherical plastic pellets and have orange tips to show they aren't real firearms, but police said the one the boy had didn't have the bright safety indicator, making it indistinguishable from a real firearm. Following his death, protesters demonstrated in the street and blocked up major intersections. Final moments: In footage released by the Cleveland Police Department, a police car pulls up alongside the boy. But rather than raise his hands, his reaches for his belt line, they claim. He was then shot . The rallies came a day after a grand jury announced they would not indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for shooting dead Michael Brown, another black, unarmed youth. Loehmann had only joined the Cleveland police in March after spending six months in 2012 with the police department in suburban Independence. Personnel files released on Wednesday that showed police supervisors in Independence decided he lacked the maturity needed to work in their department. A letter in his file said there was a pattern of a lack of indiscretion and of not following instructions. 'In law enforcement there are times when instructions need be followed to the letter, and I am under the impression Ptl. Loehmann, under certain circumstances, will not react in the way instructed,' the letter said. Loehmann resigned from the Independence police department in December 2012 after meeting his supervisors about their concerns. A grand jury will now consider whether charges are merited. Sadness: After the 12-year-old's death - and in the wake of the grand jury's decision not to indict Michael Brown's killer in Ferguson - protesters took to the streets in Cleveland to call for change . Shooter: Rookie officer Tim Loehmann, (pictured far left), was put on leave after the shooting.

"Andy Carroll insists there is nothing to stop West Ham United challenging for the Barclays Premier League title this season. The 25-year-old scored his first goals of the campaign on Sunday as his brace helped the Hammers record a 3-1 win over 10-man Swansea City and move up to third in the table for more than 24 hours, before Manchester United leapfrogged them. Sam Allardyce's side remain in the top four after 15 games, having won eight of their opening fixtures, as Carroll struck twice and Diafra Sakho scored late to see off the Swans, who had taken the lead through Wilfried Bony. West Ham United are flying as Andy Carroll (left) celebrates scoring their second goal against Swansea City . Hammers striker Carroll celebrates scoring his first league goal in 878 minutes of football . Sam Allardyce has steered West Ham to fourth in the Premier League after 15 games . Despite earning plenty of plaudits for their attacking approach, many expect West Ham to drop off the pace during the hectic winter schedule but Carroll believes they should now be considered contenders. 'I think there is no limit, we can go all the way to the top,' the England international replied when asked how high the Hammers can finish. 'We have a great squad and I can't say we are going to give up now we are in the top three, we have got a great team and we can go all the way. 'I think with the team we have got and the manager, the way he is playing and coaching everyone, it is fantastic and I don't think we will be giving up at all.' Much was made leading into the clash with Swansea over the fact Allardyce had plumped to sign Carroll rather than Wilfried Bony in the summer of 2013. Former Barcelona man Alex Song has brought a touch of class to the West Ham midfield . Diafra Sakho came off the bench to fire West Ham into a 3-1 lead at Upton Park on Sunday . The West Ham boss said his decision would prove right over time, despite the fact Carroll had scored only twice in the league ahead of the fixture. Carroll has missed plenty of football through injury but has not felt the pressure to come back hitting the ground running with the likes of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho performing well in attack in his absence. 'I've not seen anything about it. But he chose the right one didn't he?' Carroll replied when asked about Allardyce's comments. 'I have been out for a long time and the last couple of games I've been playing I haven't been fully fit. 'There have been a lot of injuries and I was put in unexpectedly really and played a couple of 90 minutes before I was fully fit. Now I'm feel good and strong and I can put myself about a bit more. Allardyce embraces Carroll following the striker's second goal of the game against Swansea . 'It is always easier (to come back into the side) when you have got a big squad. You are not relying on one player; we have a big squad and all quality players that can come in. 'That is why the players who are not playing are disappointed and the players who are in are putting the performances in to not be left out.' Swansea could have leapfrogged West Ham with a win at Upton Park but, having taken the lead, they slipped to defeat and have still only won once on the road this season. Their task was made more difficult when goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski was sent off with the Swans 2-1 down and, as manager Garry Monk suggested in his post-match press conference, the club have appealed against the decision. Carroll soars at the back post to head Carl Jenkinson's delivery across Lukasz Fabianski and into the net . Gerhard Tremmel came on the for the closing stages and was beaten by substitute Sakho in the closing stages but, if Fabianski's appeal falls on deaf ears, he is ready to step in heading into Christmas. 'West Ham has always been a tough place to come to; they try to push us high and we could not really find a way through,' he said. 'Today, we were 1-0 up, we had that advantage and we could not get anything out of it. That is quite disappointing, but it is just one game of many. 'When I saw Lukasz coming off his line I knew it was going to be very close for him to reach the ball. I'm always looking forward to playing for Swansea, and this will be no different. 'We have some important fixtures coming up. We need to get as many points as possible to sit comfortably in the table before the New Year. It is a very important phase for us and we want to get as much points as possible.' Carroll adds a a genuine aerial threat, which can trigger panic among modern central defenders .","West Ham United beat Swansea City 3-1 at Upton Park on Sunday .

"Hundreds of Eric Garner protesters descended on the Brooklyn's Barclays Center hosting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Monday night in the fifth day of protests. Star players including LeBron James and Kyrie Irving joined the demonstration by wearing 'I Can't Breathe' shirts as they warm up for a game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets. And pop royalty Jay Z supported the statement by posing for a picture with four Nets players wearing the customized shirts. The protest, dubbed #RoyalShutdown, comes almost a week after a grand jury refused to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo for the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner. Scroll down for video . 'Royal shutdown': Hundreds staged a die-in outside the Barclays Center as Wills and Kate sat inside . Black lives matter: The group led by activist group The Justice League chanted for Pantaleo to be fired . Dressed for the occasion: Protesters wore tiaras for the event staged to coincide with the royal visit . Statement: LeBron James took the opportunity of worldwide attention to wear an Eric Garner tribute t-shirt . Cleveland Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving warms up before the game in his customized t-shirt . Police allegedly used pepper spray as they lined the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City, while the crowd of protesters wearing tiaras and chanting 'black lives matter' grew in numbers. A vast portion of the crowd fell to the ground in a staged die-in holding up signs that read 'Who are you protecting?'. As a dressed-down Prince William, his five-months-pregnant wife Kate and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver were seated in the stadium after the players concluded their televized warm-up, during which many players wore 'I Can't Breathe' t-shirts. The words are a reference to Eric Garner's last words as he lay on a New York City sidewalk after being arrested for selling loose cigarettes. Meanwhile, the Justice League of New York, an activist group, led the crowds in protest. The group is demanding that Pantaleo be fired and police chokeholds be made illegal. By half time, when the Cavaliers were in the lead, police were sending reinforcements to the Flatbush entrance of the stadium, where crowds were threatening to break through security. Earlier on Monday, James told ESPN it is an honor to play for the royal couple, who were sat next to former Houston Rockets player Dikembe Motumbo - and across from pop royalty Beyoncé and Jay Z. 'It's a huge honor,' James said. 'The stuff that you read about, people like them are only in books growing up. And to hear that they're coming to town to see me play and they want to see me do what I do best, it's a huge honor.' Royal visit: The Duke of Cambridge looked casual alongside his silver-clad wife Kate and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver as they arrived for the Brooklyn Nets v Cleveland Cavaliers game . All smiles: The excursion was a treat for Wills and Kate, who left their son Prince George with Kate's mother . Sports fan: Prince William, who is president of Britain's Football Association, looked excited for the game . Support: Jay Z supported the statement by posing with four Nets players in their customized shirts . Pop royalty: Beyoncé and Jay Z joined William and Kate to watch King James in action on Monday night . Lively: The royal couple looked animated sat next to former Houston Rockets player Dikembe Motumbo . Shout out! Like many Nets fans before, Wills and Kate were awarded the honor of a shot on the big screen . Anger: It is the fifth day of protests over the jury decision not to indict Daniel Pantaleo for Eric Garner's death . Chokehold: One man is seen making reference to the chokehold that killed Eric Garner in July . Connected cases: This protester referenced the Michael Brown shooting with his 'don't shoot' sign. Many claim Brown, 18, had his hands up and shouted 'don't shoot' when he was killed by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson . Protesters shouted 'black lives matter' and 'no justice no peace' during the game on Monday . Message for Kate and Wills: Many of the protesters fashioned signs directed at the Duke and Duchess . Unrest: The protest is one of hundreds that have been staged across the US in the wake of police killings . Kevin Garnett and Deron Williams were among four Nets wearing the shirts before the game in support of the family of Eric Garner, who died July 17 after a police officer placed him in a chokehold when he was being arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Chicago star Derrick Rose wore one before a game Saturday and James said Sunday he wanted one. He got it from Nets guard Jarrett Jack, who provided them to players on both teams. 'Obviously as a society we have to do better, we have to have empathy better for one another no matter what race you are, but it's more a shout-out to the family more than anything,' James said before warming up. Irving had already gone to the court in his as James spoke. James said at the time it was a 'possibility' he would do the same, and he was wearing the shirt when he unzipped his yellow and gray jacket in the layup line. Reinforcements: Police were called to stem the flow of protesters at one entrance of the stadium . 'All I want for Christmas is to live': Protesters held signs with the names of people killed in police conflict . Rampage: At one point the protesters ran with their signs to storm Target across the street before returning . Freezing: The marching crowds braved the cold temperatures to make their stand . James and Irving were two of six players wearing the t-shirts. They are contractually bound to wear Adidas . 'I respect Derrick Rose and all of our players for voicing their personal views on important issues but my preference would be for players to abide by our oncourt attire rules,' Silver said. Players are required to wear attire of Adidas, the league's official apparel provider. Irving also said his thoughts were with Garner's family. 'What happened is a tragedy, I feel terrible about it, but my emotions are just more or less condolences for the family,' Irving said. Police force the door closed to block protesters at the entrance to the Target store in the Atlantic Terminal Mall . Anti-police brutality protesters enter the mall  across the street from the Barclays Center stadium . Forceful: The protesters put on a strong front as they powered through the doors chanting at police . Clash: Reporters clamor to hear protesters stating their demands inches from a line of police .

"Animal cruelty charges have been dropped in the case of a pig smuggled into the Gabba sports ground during the last Ashes series. David John Gunn, 33, was charged with animal cruelty after a domestic brown pig was found with its snout taped shut and dressed as a baby in the Gabba stands in Brisbane last November. The case was set to go to trial on Thursday but a prosecutor for the Crown told the Brisbane Magistrates Court no evidence would be offered against Gunn. David John Gunn was cleared of all animal cruelty charges at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday . The 33-year-old had been charged after a pig was found with its snout taped at the Gabba sports ground during the last Ashes series . The case was struck out. Outside court, defence lawyer Kate Clark said her client had always maintained his innocence in the face of 'significant public vilification'. Mr Gunn has always argued that the pig was brought into the sports ground by someone else. The pig named Ash was found dehydrated and stressed after being smuggled into the ground in a baby harness . This was later confirmed by police via CCTV footage according to the Courier Mail. The pig named Ash was found dehydrated and stressed after being smuggled into the ground in a baby harness on day one of the first Ashes test. Ash has since made a full recovery and has been adopted by a Brisbane couple.

"Norway's CycloCable bike escalator is revolutionising urban transport. While pedal power is an inexpensive - not to mention healthy - way to get around a big city,  hills can often be the bane of cyclist's existence. A steep ascent is no problem however for the  residents of Trondheim, in Norway's north east, thanks to Jarle Wanvik, the inventor of the Trampe. Scroll down for video . Norway's CycloCable bike escalator is revolutionising urban cycling in the city of Trondheim . Developed to help cyclists tackle the city's steep inclines, the CycloCable is like a ski lift for bikes . The bike escalator, or Trampe lift, as it was known, was built in 1993 by Wanvik, a commuter who grew tired of showing up to work sweaty and exhausted. In 2013, the lift was upgraded and rebranded as the CycloCable - and it has quickly become a tourist magnet. So far, it's already ferried 200,000 cyclists up the hill at Brubakken near Gamle Bybro, from the bridge almost all the way up to the Kristiansten Fort. It was first built in 1993 - then called the Trampe lift - by Jarle Wanvik . In 2013, the lift was upgraded and renamed the CycloCable - quickly becoming a tourist magnet . The 420 feet-long device climbs at a gradient of between 10 and 18 per cent, and all the user has to do is put their foot on one of its 11 foot plates attached to a wire rope. An accelerated starting point gets users moving but after the initial first burst it's a simple case of keeping one foot on the plate and the other off the ground to cruise up the hill at 5mph. It's quite simple to use, with no reported injuries since it's opened. When standing beside the CycloCable, the cyclist puts their left foot on the left pedal of their bike and their right foot in the starting slot of the base station. At 420 feet long, the wire rope with 11 foot plates attached, climbs at an incline between 10 and 18 per cent . The CycloCable can also ferry baby strollers (left) and scooters (right) up the Brubakken hill . Up to five individuals can use the lift at any given time, using their bike or scooter as a form of support . Stretching your right leg backwards, keep the right foot on the start slot to receive the push of the soft-start mechanism. The lift then carries the cyclist the remainder of the distance, with the bicycle acting as merely a means of support. Up to five people can use it at the same time and it's actually not limited strictly to bicycles - strollers and scooters are also acceptable.","CycloCable is a ski lift-inspired bike escalator to assist cyclists on hills .

"The Northeast is bracing for a strong, slow-moving storm expected to bring heavy rains and high winds to a wide swath of the coast and a half-foot or more of snow to some inland areas. The messy system moving into the region threatens to bring 2 or more inches of rain to southern New England on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. Wet, heavy snow and gusty winds farther inland could take down tree limbs and cut power. Flood watches are in effect in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island beginning Tuesday morning and stretching into the evening, with significant flooding possible in urban areas and areas with poor drainage. Scroll down for video . Get ready! A strong low pressure system will move over New England, resulting in a rain and snow with windy conditions, and rain and mountain snow will be expected over the Northwest. Coming soon? Parts of the Northeast may see as much as 18 inches of snow, according to Accuweather . Some coastal areas are also bracing for high winds. The weather service is predicting winds of 15 to 25 mph with gusts of 50 mph possible. 'It's a significant coastal storm that's going to be approaching southern New England from the south' on Monday night, said Kim Buttrick, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Taunton, Massachusetts. 'We do have multiple hazards with this storm. ... There's a lot going on.' Minimal snowfall is expected along the heavily traveled Interstate 95 corridor from Philadelphia to Boston, but winter weather advisories have been issued for parts of Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts and New Hampshire that are farther inland. In Massachusetts, the storm is expected to bring mostly rain and strong winds to the eastern part of the state, but some parts of western Massachusetts could see 6 or more inches of snow on Tuesday. Brrrrrr! Precipitation is expected to fall in many parts of the Northeast on Tuesday . Bundle up: Strong wind gusts may also hit New York City, Boston, as well as Portland . Some higher elevations, including New York's Catskills and Adirondacks, could get up to 2 feet of snow through Thursday before the plodding storm takes its leave. The heavy, wet snow and gusty winds could combine to bring down tree limbs and power lines, causing outages. In New Hampshire, which is expecting a mix of rain, snow and sleet, power companies were making preparations for the storm, which comes less than two weeks after nasty Thanksgiving weather knocked out electricity to more than 200,000 people.","A slow-moving storm system heading into the region reportedly threatens to bring 2 or more inches of rain to southern New England on Tuesday .

"Right, that’s my autumn holiday to America sorted out. First, I’ll drop in on my cousin, Barack Obama, and bed down at the White House for a few days. Then I’ll move on to Cousin Kim’s in LA — that would be Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star — and catch up with Kanye West, her rapper husband, and my other cousin, their baby daughter North West (yes, really). And, if they insist on me playing a guest role in Kim’s show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, along with my cousins Kourtney and Khloé, it would be churlish to refuse. Family ties: Harry Mount discovered that he, David Cameron and Kim Kardashian all have a shared ancestor in the shape of Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet and MP for Glamorgan from 1670-1679 and 1681-1689 . If it helps, I’m delighted to change my name to Kharry to maintain the family naming tradition. I’m prepared to forgive them, too, for not inviting me to Kim and Kanye’s mammoth wedding spectacular last May in Florence. After all, we’re really quite distant relatives — Kim is my 13th cousin; North my 13th cousin, once removed; and Barack, again, is my 13th cousin. I only found out yesterday that I shared a bloodline with these famous faces, thanks to a genealogy website, Geni.com. In return for $119.40 (£72) for a year’s membership, the website connected me up to a family tree of 5,000 blood relatives, including one David Cameron. I did know about that one, incidentally — he’s a second cousin, slightly closer than Cousin Kim and Cousin Barack. Famous faces: The genealogy website Geni.com, which works on crowd-sourcing, revealed that President Barack Obama is Harry's 13th cousin . Cameron, too, is a 13th cousin of Kim Kardashian, through the same link as me. We all have a shared ancestor in the shape of Sir Edward Mansel, 4th Baronet and MP for Glamorgan from 1670-1679 and 1681-1689. Sir Edward lived in Margam Castle, a thwacking great country house overlooking Port Talbot in South Wales. The castle and its 850-acre estate are now owned by the council — how lovely it would be if Cousins Kim and Kanye bought it back for the family. I’d love to think I’m somehow special with all these gilded relations. But the truth of it is that we’re all related to famous people, if you stretch the net far enough — or, in this case, the internet. Geni.com — part of a new wave of genealogy websites, including WeRelate and WikiTree — works through a sort of crowd-sourcing, along the lines of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia written by its users. As more and more members of the public add their own mini-family trees online, they connect them up with pre-existing family trees, until they grow together into one enormous forest. Using these vast, spreading maps of connections, you can build up impossibly huge family trees. One keen genealogist, a New York writer called Al Jacobs, has managed to connect himself to 78,783,197 people, including his distant cousins Daniel Radcliffe, Sir Paul McCartney, Albert Einstein, Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush, and the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, aka the Milwaukee Cannibal. Oh, and they’re all related to George Clooney, who is George  H.W. Bush’s 12th cousin, twice removed. You can also add into that family tree Neil Armstrong, Frank Sinatra and Patrick Swayze. ‘In a few years, we may have a single tree containing nearly all seven billion humans on earth,’ says Mr Jacobs (a relative of the artist Jackson Pollock and the writer Saul Bellow, too). ‘The Family Of Man will no longer be an abstract cliche. We’re all related — we just have to figure  out how.’ Next summer, Mr Jacobs — also a distant cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow, the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, and the musician Quincy Jones — is planning the biggest family gathering in history, the Global Family Reunion, in the New York Hall of Science, on the site of the 1939 and 1964 World’s Fairs. In a bid to beat the current record for the biggest family gathering ever — held by the 4,512 members of the Porteau-Boileve family in France — millions of Mr Jacobs’s living relations will be invited. Astonishing: The Queen is an 11th cousin, four times removed of socialite Paris Hilton (right), through a mutual relation, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge in the mid-19th century . Mr Dahmer, however, will not be attending, given he was beaten to death in 1994 by a fellow prisoner at Columbia Correctional Institution in Wisconsin. Ah well, there are bad apples in every family tree. Log on to trace yours online, and astonishing links are magically, instantly made. The Queen, I learn, is an 11th cousin, four times removed, of the socialite Paris Hilton, through a mutual relation, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge in the mid-19th century. The Queen is also a fifth cousin, twice removed, of David Cameron — and so I can stick her on my list, albeit too, through the slightly weak link of ‘cousins by marriage’. The singer Prince, once known as The Artist Formerly Known As Prince, is a 20th cousin, three times removed, of Nick Clegg, once known as The Politician Formerly Known As An Impressive Prospect. Prince and Clegg are connected through shared blood with John of Gaunt, Edward III’s son and a great powerbroker in 14th-century England. The higher you go in society, the greater the connections between the great and the good. Cousin Al: Comedian Al Murray is just one of Harry Mount's 5,000 blood relatives as listed by the genealogy website that he subscribed to . And not just in Britain — all the American presidents, except for the 19th-century president Martin Van Buren, are distantly related to each other. Spend enough time on your computer, and genealogy becomes curiously addictive. And it’s not just me: ancestry websites are the second most popular sites on the internet after pornography. (I suppose they’re related pursuits — after all, they’re both dependent on sex.) As I followed the higgledy-piggledy lines on my family tree, more and more curious names popped out from behind the thicket of interconnected branches. I — and Cousins Kim, Barack and Dave — are all relatives of William Makepeace Thackeray, the great Victorian novelist, author of Vanity Fair. My four-times great-grandfather, John Talbot Shakespear, a senior civil servant with the East India Company, was Thackeray’s uncle. Oh, and while we’re hovering in that particular corner of the family tree, it turns out that Thackeray was the three-times great-grandfather of the comedian Al Murray, aka the Pub Landlord, and now aka Cousin Al — to me and my 5,000 other blood relatives listed on the website. Of course, as with all crowd-sourcing websites, there’s tremendous room for error. Geni.com has 120 volunteer curators and eight million users, all constantly merging their family trees and making them bigger and bigger. That said, I couldn’t see a single mistake in my own. All you have to do is add details of your own immediate family — and you can be pretty sure of the accuracy of that — until you find a relative who appears to belong to someone else’s family tree, too. The website — which holds details of millions of people’s names, lifespans and relationships — will flag up likely ‘matches’, which the user can verify simply by checking if the relative’s details appear to tally. As more matches are made, a reliable guide to your wider ancestry begins to take shape. And these online family trees stretch right back to time immemorial. Using mine, I could trace my ancestors — and relations of Cousins Dave, Kim and Barack — all the way back to 1175,  when my who-knows-how-many-times great-grandfather, Richard Talbot, died. Still, the 12th century is nothing in the internet’s genealogy fraternity. Al Jacobs tracked down his 97th great-grandfather, King David, who ruled Israel and Judah in 1,000 BC. Admittedly, that sounds pretty dodgy but, then again, if you go that far back, the chances are that millions of us around on earth today are related to King David. If all of those generations, down to the present day, had just two children, that would leave King David with 1,267,650,600,228,229, 401,496,703,205,376 descendants. Of course, if you do go that far back, you can hardly claim to share much blood with your famous ancestor. But, still — as I’ll tell Cousin Kim, when I rock up on her doorstep this autumn — family’s family, isn’t it?","Harry Mount discovered that Kim Kardashian is his 13th cousin .

"A YouTube star has been accused of sexual assault after pinching women's behinds in a viral video. British prankster Sam Pepper, 25, has since insisted that all the girls were in on the joke and that it was simply to highlight how people have different reactions to assaults on men and women. But the video, which has since been removed by YouTube, still has viewers in uproar, with some expressing skepticism over whether the girls knew, while others pointed out that he has created other insulting videos, including 'Easiest Way To Get A Number' and 'How to Pick Up Girls with a Lasso'. Pepper, who has more than two million subscribers on YouTube, posted the video to his account on Friday showing him pinching women's bottoms after pretending to ask them for directions. Scroll down for video . Cruel: YouTube star Sam Pepper shared a video showing him pinching women's behinds; here he illustrates how he hid his arm. The video caused uproar - but he has now claimed it was all part of a social experiment . 'Trick': Pepper pretended to ask women on the street for directions before grabbing their bottoms . Shock: The girls in the video look surprised and look around them to see who is responsible for the grope . The women are all shocked, with some looking around them for the culprit, while one clearly says she doesn't like it. 'It’s completely inappropriate. It's against the law, and it just sends the wrong message,' women's advocate Britni Soto told KCAL after the video went viral. Fellow YouTube stars also lambasted Pepper for the video. 'Sexually harassing women is vile to begin with, but normalizing it by calling it a prank? So harmful,' Tyler Oakley tweeted. The video gained more than 1.3 million views before it was removed by YouTube for violating YouTube's 'Terms of Service'. Pepper, who first gained fame in the UK after appearing on the country's reality TV show Big Brother in 2010, stayed largely quiet about the scandal until posting about it on Twitter on Monday. 'If you've seen something one way, will it change what you would of thought of it another way?' he wrote, before sharing a similar video showing a woman pinching men's behinds. Prank: The women look shocked as he pinches them - but he later insisted the girls were all on the prank . Denial: He later posted a video showing women grabbing men's behinds, and on Tuesday he shared this video explaining it had been a social experiment to prove how people regard assaults on men different . This video, which has also been removed by YouTube, sparked some disgust too, but not the same amount as the earlier video, Pepper said. On Tuesday morning, he shared one final video to YouTube explaining that the two videos had been part of a social experiment to show our flippant reactions to assaults on men. He explained that he had been inspired by a male friend who was in an abusive marriage and whose accounts were doubted by police, as well as his own experiences being sexually assaulted by fans. 'At multiple events some of my viewers will grab my bum and giggle about it among their friends,' he said. 'I don't like it. And if the roles were reversed would people think it was OK to pinch a female celebrity? 'I wanted to do something that would highlight the difference between abuse towards a woman and abuse towards a man in a social experiment with you as unwitting participants at the heart of the experiment.' He added: 'I don't want to turn off a light on a very real and scary issue women face I just want to shine a light on an otherwise dark corner - abuse on men.' Explanation: On Twitter, he said he could have carried out his plan in a smoother way - but that he was glad that it had made people think about how differently they treat men and women . He added that the videos had all been 'staged and scripted' and thanked the women by name for helping him put them together. Some fans applauded Pepper for the series. 'To help out a friend who was afraid to admit he was being abused, @sampepper risked everything he's worked for. So much respect man,' one Twitter user said. Yet others weren't quite so convinced. 'So were all the other videos where you pressure women to kiss you also 'social experiments' too?' one asked on Twitter. Pepper added on Twitter on Tuesday: 'In hindsight we would all do things different in our lives, I could have executed this neater, but would have it as reached as many people?'","British prankster Sam Pepper shared a video to YouTube last week showing him grabbing women's behinds as he asked for directions .

"David Cameron has been forced to shrug off an attack by a Chinese newspaper that described the UK as ‘just an old European country’ only fit for tourists and students. The Prime Minister said he would concentrate on the ‘facts and figures’ showing rapidly increasing Chinese investment in Britain, rather than the excoriating article in the Beijing-based Global Times. The piece accused Mr Cameron of acting provocatively in meeting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama last year, an encounter which plunged Sino-British relations into a deep freeze from which they are only now recovering.

China's yuan currency overtook the euro in October becoming the second-most used currency in trade finance, global transaction services organisation SWIFT has said. The market share of yuan usage in trade finance, or Letters of Credit and Collection, grew to 8.66 percent in October 2013. That improved from 1.89 percent in January 2012. The yuan, also known as the renminbi, now ranks behind the U.S. dollar, which remains the leading currency with a share of 81.08 percent. The top five countries using the yuan for trade finance in October were China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Germany and Australia, SWIFT said in a statement. Franck de Praetere, SWIFT's Asia Pacific head of payments and trade markets said: 'The RMB is clearly a top currency for trade finance globally and even more so in Asia.' The RMB remained the 12th payments currency of the world, with a slightly decreased share of 0.84 percent compared with 0.86 percent in September. RMB payments increased in value by 1.5 percent in October, while growth for all payments currencies was at 4.6 percent. The world's second-largest economy is accelerating the pace of financial reform to promote its currency to international players beyond Hong Kong. China aims to lift the yuan's global clout and reduce its reliance on the U.S. dollar. Yuan trade settlement has expanded quickly since it first began in 2009 and the percentage of China's total trade settled in yuan has risen from 12 per cent in 2012 to nearly 20 per cent.","Prime Minister is on an official business trip to China .

"Nasa's Kennedy space Center is already seeing the effects of climate change - and may have to abandon some of its launchpads within a decade, it has been claimed. Researchers who have been studying Cape Canaveral's dunes and beach since 2009, say the impacts became most apparent after Hurricane Sandy. They found dunes that protected the launchpads were levelled, fences left teetering and a railroad track regularly topped by waves. Scroll down for video . Orion Orion blazed into the morning sky at 7:05 a.m. EST on Friday, lifting off from Space Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. Now, the area has been revealed to be at risk from climate change. Nancy Bray, director of center operations for Kennedy Space Center, said Nasa is taking the situation seriously and has plans for dealing with it. The John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) was originally built for the Saturn V, the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history, for the Apollo manned Moon landing program proposed by President John F. Kennedy. It has been used to launch every NASA human space flight, including Skylab (1973), the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1974), and the Space Shuttle program (1981-2011). KSC also has a facility which was used for landing the reusable Space Shuttle orbiters when weather permitted. They say the problem is so bad it could soon affect operations at the centre which has seen launches of everything from the Shuttle to Nasa's Orion rocket just last week. Scientists at the University of Florida geologists say the problem has been ignored until now. 'We were a little blind to it, like pre-Katrina New Orleans,' said one of the researchers, assistant professorPeter Adams of the UF Geological Sciences department. 'Now that we've seen it, we're sensitive to it.' Adams and associate professor of geology John Jaeger, who have been studying Cape Canaveral's dunes and beach since 2009, say the impacts became most apparent after Hurricane Sandy. 'Sandy got a lot of press up north, but it really did a tremendous amount of damage at Cape Canaveral,' Jaeger said. 'Areas that had previously been relatively stable for decades … suddenly they were gone.' Adams said a combination of climate change-related sea-level rise and increased wave energy is almost certainly to blame. 'Certainly it's occurring now,' he said. 'Is it affecting NASA infrastructure? The answer is yes.' Nancy Bray, director of center operations for Kennedy Space Center, said NASA is taking the situation seriously and has plans for dealing with it. A similar plan has been prepared for NASA's Wallops Island Flight Facility in Virginia, though Wallops has not yet seen the effects that have shown up at Kennedy. Dunes that historically protected Kennedy Space Center from high seas even during the worst storms were leveled during Tropical Storm Fay in 2008, Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. 'We do consider sea level rise and climate change to be urgent,' she said. The research came about after NASA partnered with the U.S. Geological Survey and UF to figure out why chronic erosion was happening along a roughly 6-mile stretch of beach between launch pads 39A and 39B – the ones used for Space Shuttle and Apollo missions. The problem had been occurring for years but seemed to be growing worse, beginning with the spate of hurricanes that struck Florida in 2004. Jaeger said he, Adams and doctoral students Shaun Kline and Rich Mackenzie determined the cause was a gap in a near-shore sandbar that funnels the sea toward that section of beach. Faced with the question of what was causing the increased vulnerability in that part of the shoreline, they soon came to the conclusion that the culprits were sea-level rise and wave climate change. Dunes that historically protected Kennedy Space Center from high seas even during the worst storms were leveled during Tropical Storm Fay in 2008, Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. A stretch of beachfront railroad track built by NASA in the early 1960s that runs parallel to the shoreline has been topped by waves repeatedly during recent storms. Though idle now – one vulnerable section has even been removed to make room for protective manmade dunes the track serves as a useful yardstick for the Atlantic Ocean’s growing incursions. One 2010 NASA report predicts it will be permanently breached by 2016. After Sandy, one washed-out section of shoreline was so close to a launch pad at adjacent Cape Canaveral Air Force Station that a fence surrounding the pad was left teetering and near collapse . As for what could be at risk next, the first item on the list is a two-lane road the runs parallel to and slightly inland from the railroad track. Buried beneath it are electrical power lines and pipelines used to transport liquefied gasses. In the short term, NASA has built new dunes to replace the natural ones that were lost on the threatened section of shoreline. Visitors on tour buses can look out over one of the new dunes from an elevated mound on the beach. 'Without that secondary dune line, we could have saltwater intrusion at the launch pad,' Bray said. Looking further into the future, the agency is taking an approach it calls 'managed retreat.' That means if sea-level rise becomes insurmountable, Bray said, it may eventually have to move roads, utilities and perhaps even launch pads – a costly and complex possibility. 'When you put immovable infrastructure right next to a dynamic environment,' Jaeger said, 'something has to give.'","Major damage to area was seen after Hurricane Sandy hit .

"A senior Korean Air executive is facing up to 10 years in prison over claims that she delayed a plane leaving JFK over the way she was served nuts. Heather Cho, a senior vice-president at the airline, demanded the removal of a crew member from a flight on December 5 for failing to serve nuts on a plate. Cho, who is also the eldest daughter of airline Chairman Cho Yang Ho, forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal to drop of the inept employee. Scroll down for video . Heather Cho, a senior vice-president at Korean Air, is facing up to 10 years in prison over claims that she delayed a plane leaving JFK over the way she was served nuts . South Korea’s Transport Ministry announced on Monday that they are investigating if Cho violated the Aviation Safety Law, which states that passengers should not cause disturbances, including using violent language or yelling, for safety reasons. Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12:50 a.m. departure from JFK when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker placed some macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class, reports the Korean Times. The junior flight attendant's faux pas was to serve the nuts inside the bag that they came in rather than presenting them on a small dish - as is protocol. Cho screamed at the attendant and told him to bring out the company’s in-flight service manual so he could read the proper nut-handling guidelines. When he failed to find it, Cho lost her cool and ordered him to get off the flight. Korean Air Flight 86 was already on the runway for its 12:50 a.m. departure from JFK when Cho lost her temper after an unidentified worker broke protocol and placed the snack of macadamia nuts in front of her as she sat in first class . 'The chief flight attendant failed to get the right manual, and this led Cho to believe he was not qualified for that job,' a Korean Air official told the Korean Times. Without giving the 250 passengers on board a warning, the pilots decided to give in to her demands and return to the airport to drop off the attendant. As their investigation gets underway, the Transport Ministry must try to figure out if Cho’s behavior warrants a prison sentence. 'We’ll see whether her behavior was against the law,' a ministry official told the Korean Times. 'It is an unprecedented case, so we need to see the related regulations.' 'Even though she is senior vice president at the company, she was a passenger at that time, so she had to behave and be treated as a passenger,' they added. 'She could have taken other measures after coming back to Korea, such as strengthening service training.'

"President Obama's one-night stay in Brisbane for the G20 summit cost taxpayers $1.7 million, a report has revealed. The cost is said to have covered 4,096 rooms at three separate hotels for his entourage of security guards and assistants on November 15. According to the Justification document published by the White House, it was 'fair and reasonable based on the pricing available across the city of Brisbane at the time of the visit'. Lap of luxury: This was President Obama's $2,000 room in Brisbane which added to the $1.7m one-night bill . Fleeting: He stayed in the Australian city one night for the summit, and paid more than any other leader . The revelation from The Weekly Standard comes just eight months after MailOnline revealed Americans footed Obama's $2.9 million bill for hotels and rental cars in Brussels. The president's own room was the most expensive of all the world leaders at the summit as he based himself at the $2,000 (AUS$2,500) a night Marriott Hotel. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott opted for the thrifty $270-a-night Rydges hotel, while Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe required just $170 of public funds for his stay at Novotel. China's Xi Jinping came closest to Obama's bill, spending $1,450 on his room, followed by UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who handed British taxpayers a $1,070 bill for his stay. Obama's room at the Marriott was the 1,410-square-foot presidential suite on the top floor, with a king sized bed and panoramic views of Brisbane River. Booked up: The presidential entourage required 4,096 rooms, which a report estimated to cost $423 each . The Weekly Standard estimated that his staff's rooms amounted to $423 each. The building comprises of 28 floors of 263 rooms, four of which are suites. There are also 10 meeting rooms - 7,750 sq ft of total meeting space. Ahead of his visit, US security officials stripped down an entire floor surrounding the presidential suite to ensure Obama was not being spied upon. Mirrors and beds were removed from these rooms, and the suite itself was combed and verified as being safe for Obama to engage in private phone calls.","President Obama spent one night in Australia for Brisbane G20 summit .

"It's one of the world's most famous clubs but is not quite as exclusive as we may have thought. New figures show more than a tenth of Britons have got it on up in the air and joined the Mile High Club. Revealing figures from a Lastminute.com survey says of that number, 30 per cent say their  attempt to get raunchy at 30,000-feet was been thwarted by the cabin crew. In the battle of the sexes, one sixth of British men admitted their 'achievement' compared to one twelfth of women. One tenth of Britons say they've joined the Mile High Club, reveals a survey by lastminute.com . A toilet tryst is not a mystery to one in 10 Brits, but one in three say they've been thwarted by cabin crew . French - 27 per cent . Germans - 18 per cent . Britons - 11 per cent . Italians - 6 per cent . Spanish - 4 per cent . Racy flyers from Birmingham are the most likely Brits to be members of the 'club' with one fifth of those surveyed from the West Midlands saying they've been there up there, double the national average. But compared to the frisky French and game Germans, we're relative prudes. One in four of the 1,000 French jet-setters have frolicked in the air while one in five Germans were wily enough to slip by the staff and into the loo. Surprisingly perhaps, Brits are ahead of Latino lovers with those from Italy and Spain lagging behind. Lastminute.com, who surveyed 2,000 British travellers, says food service time in the best to sneak away . Along with the survery, Lastminute.com has issued advice to wannabe Mile High Clubbers keen to follow in the footsteps of alleged Mile High pioneer, pilot Lawrence Burst Sperry. Mr Sperry, or so the story goes, made the most of his autopilot-equipped Curtiss Flying Boat with socialite Mrs Waldo Peirce near New York in 1916 and famously founded the MHC. Lastminute's tips include forking out the extra cash for business class, where the toilets are slightly more comfortable than the average three by three foot of economy and passengers get a bit more leeway. They add that a night flight taking off after sunset is a good choice for high-altitude romance as most passengers will be asleep, lights will be dimmed and flight attendants patrol the aisle less frequently. Engaged! One in four French flyers say they've got down and dirty in a plane's convenience . Time is also of the essence, according to their toilet tryst tips, with drinks and food service an opportune time to sneak into the lavatories while the staff are busy. Even seat choice can be factored in, with an empty row the optimum if it can be selected at time of check-in online. An anonymous lastminute.com spokesperson, who is a member of the Mile High Club, said the most important thing is to 'be strategic and don't walk down the aisle hand in hand.' Pioneering pilot Lawrence Sperry is said to be the founder of the Mile High Club . 'Rather let one person sneak in first and use a coded knock for the door to ensure your plans get a smooth flight,' the amorous staffer said, adding the poll lived up to stereotypes about French lovers. 'It doesn't come as much of a surprise to see the French top this poll, they are certainly doing what they can to live up to our expectations, proving to be the most amorous in Europe,' the spokesperson says. 'Perhaps these results will give Italy the shake-up they need to take on the French in the romance stakes.

"Young couple Erin McFadzen and Erik Clancy thought they were signing a lease to the perfect apartment: a rent-stabilized unit in a newly-constructed high-rise with a porch overlooking the Manhattan skyline. Instead, they ended up with a cage. These are the bleak wire fences the couple found when they moved into the Q41 apartment in July, which they believe were erected to keep residents in the building paying market value from becoming jealous of their extra space. Roped off: Erik Clancy 29 years old and Erin McFadzen 30, behind the so-called 'poor fence' on their Queens apartment . McFadzen and her live-in boyfriend Clancy told the New York Post that they picked the sixth-floor unit because of its wrap-around terrace - but later found they were being separated from the whole balcony . Caged in: Young couple Erin McFazden and Erik Clancy signed a lease on this apartment in Queens, New York for its wraparound porch. But when they moved in, they found this 6-foot wire fence erected, which keeps them from using the full space . 'Poor fences': The couple, who are in a rent-stabilized unit, believe the fence was erected to keep residents paying market value from becoming jealous . Defense: However, the buildings owners say the fence was installed to cordon off an area where window washers will set up . Before: What the porch looked like when the couple decided to sign a lease on the building in March . Residents say the Q41 tower in New York City is fencing in tenants in rent-controlled apartments so they don't get access to the building's huge balcony — and make people paying market-rate jealous . McFadzen and her live-in boyfriend Clancy told the New York Post that they picked the sixth-floor unit because of its wrap-around terrace. They checked out the apartment in March when there was no fence — and were outraged to see the barricade there on move-in day in July. Erin McFadzen and her boyfriend Erik Clancy say they can't get to the terrace due to a 6-foot wire fence . 'We’re caged in,' McFadzen, who pays $2,186 for her two-bedroom place, told the Post. 'Every time someone comes over, I have to explain why the fence is there — and tell them we’re rent stabilized, like it’s a badge I have to wear.' A similar balcony on a market-rate apartment going for $3,692 per month has no wiring, claims the report. Clancy told the Post he couldn't imagine a prospective market-rate tenant being told: 'You get this beautiful view of Manhattan behind a giant metal fence.' At least eight units are fenced in, the Post reported. One terrace has been rendered useless with wiring that leaves just a couple of feet of room. The 117-unit building's developer, Queensboro Development,  told the couple the fence was necessary so window washers could set up before clean up, according to the Post. 'It has come to our clients’ attention that you are exceeding your area of usage,' the building's attorney, William Slochowsky, wrote the couple on October 28, according to the Post. But a former super told McFadzen and Clancy 'the fence is there to stay' because of market-rate residents with tiny balconies, the newspaper reported. The 17-story Q41 building, at 23-10 41st Avenue in Long Island City, had been stalled until the city pumped $7.6 million in subsidies, according to the Post. Calls to Queensboro Development went unanswered, the newspaper reported. This is not the first building in New York City to offer separate amenities for rent-controlled and market-rate tenants. Developer Extell has drawn much criticism for its plan to build a posh tower on Manhattan's Upper West Side using massive tax breaks —  but then make its affordable-housing tenants use a different entrance from high-paying residents . The building's 'poor door' wouldn't be its only difference: under its original plan, some of the higher-paying residents would also have access to different amenities. Erin McFadzen claims the fence is there so tenants with smaller balconies and who pay market-rate don't get jealous of the amenity she gets for a lower price . Plans for the luxury skyscraper at 1 West End Ave. were slightly altered in August: the building still has separate entrances, but all residents will now have access to such building amenities as a courtyard and river-view roof deck . The affordable segment's lobby will also be stylishly appointed and set facing a park, the developer claims. Some residents and officials still see the divisions as discriminatory. Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration has said it aims to bar separate-door schemes.","Residents Erin McFazden and Erik Clancy believe fence was erected on their porch because they live in a rent-stabilized unit .

"Apple is set to release the latest version of its Mac software to a million users tomorrow, as part of its biggest ever test program. The Yosemite software will eventually allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if the phone is in another room. The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser. Scroll down for video . Apple's Federighi (pictured) unveiled the radical overhaul of Apple's Mac software, called Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite earlier this year. The firm is making it available to users tomorrow in a special 'preview' version . Apple is set to release the test version of Yosemite tomorrow, but will limit users to a million, it said. Users can visit apple.com to sign up - and user's machines will then be updated to the final, free version of the software when it is released later this year. However, the firm did warn that Yosemite is still 'beta' software. The software is the first to be overseen by Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive, who was recently given responsibility for the design of both hardware and software at Apple. The software was first revealed at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in San Francisco. During the Mac OS announcement, Apple's . Federighi joked that OS X Weed was one of the names considered, before . revealing the latest version of the software will be called Yosemite. It is available in an unprecedented public beta which begins tomorrow. The . software has been redesigned to look ‘flat’- to resemble the latest . version of the iOS software seen on iPhones and iPads. It . also has a new mode that lets users easily change the colour scheme, . and comes with a new online storage service called iCloud Drive, . allowing users to automatically synchronise files across multiple Macs, . iPhones, iPads and even Windows PCs. The first thing that strikes you about Yosemite is that there is less to look at. Gones are the bells and whistles, the fake leather and other distractions of previous versions. Instead, what you have is, without doubt, the best looking operating system ever seen. Apple's obsession with detail is clear, and when combined with high high resolution retina display of the firm's latest laptops, the difference is incredibly obvious. Even the tiny details, such as a new font Apple designed, give everything a crisp, uncluttered feel. Menus also now have a transparent feel, giving the system an almost glass-like feel as you move windows around. Yosemite now has a similar notification screen to the iPad and iPhone . Although iOS 8 is not yet available so we were unable to try out the call and 'handoff' features, the new notification centre on screen gives a real sense that the iPhone, iPad and Mac are now one system, system than three separate gadgets. Notifications can carry over from your iPhone, and the 'today' view mimics that iPhone users are used to. Also surprisingly useful are the upgrades to Spotlight, the Mac's search system. Searching now shows you information from Wikipedia pages, and you can even search the web without having to open a seperate browser window - although it does Bing rather than Google. you can also do basic sums, and even currency conversions form the spotlight window, and even show you cinema times if you search for a film - a real timesaver. The spotlight search system is also far smarter - for instance, search for movies, and it will show you what's on at the local cinema . The mail app has also been updated, with a new 'markup' feature that lets you easily draw on images - which is great fun to play with. Surprisingly for what is still a test piece of software, Yosemite also feels incredibly fast and snappy. While it is still officially 'beta' software, once you've tried Yosemite, going back to the previous version is hard - as well as being the best looking OS we've ever seen, Yosemite really does give a glimpse into the future of Apple, where all your devices work together seamlessly - as long at they are made by Apple. Mark Prigg . The . software update will improve battery life, according to Apple, and . it has added a new ‘markup’ option to let users easily annotate pictures . they are emailing. The firm has also improved the way Macs, iPads and iPhone work together. For example, a new feature called Continuity lets people drop files onto their phone from a Mac, while Handoff lets people swap between devices and automatically pick up where the user left off - even if an email is half written. Elsewhere, Yosemite now has SMS and phone call support to Macs, meaning people can send texts from their Mac, and even use it as a speakerphone - although this is not available in the test version as iOS8 has not yet been released. The new Yosemite software will be made available to a million users tomorrow as part of Apple's biggest ever test of its Mac software. The final version, which users of the trial version can upgrade to for free, will be available later this year .

Apple boss Tim Cook said the firm’s software had been completely redesigned to work ‘seamlessly’ together. Although the preview release of Yosemite will not support these features as iOS 8 has yet to be released, the final version will be able to: . Make and receive callsWhen you receive a call on your iPhone, you can now answer it on your Mac, using the built-in speakers and mics as a speakerphone. you can also click a phone number anywhere in OS X to make a call through your iPhone. Send and receive SMSThe Mac can now send and receive SMS and MMS text messages through your iPhone. HandoffThis useful feature allows you to start an activity on one device—and pick it on another. If you start writing an email on your iPhone and want to finish it on your Mac, your iPhone hands it to your Mac with the cursor in the same location. The new software allows you make and receive calls using your iPhone from a Mac - even if your phone is in another room . Speaking to 5,000 developers at the California's Moscone centre,  earlier this year, Cook said: 'While the industry declined by 5 per cent, Macs grew by 12 per cent.' Cook also took aim at Microsoft’s poorly received Windows 8 software. 'Over 50 per cent of our users are on the latest release. Windows 8 shipped a year before Mavericks, and it’s at 14 per cent.

"Nokia fans, look away now. If you were upset by the news that the Nokia branding was to be dropped from all future Microsoft phones, then you won’t want to see these new images. Microsoft has now unveiled what its phones will look like once the branding switch to ‘Microsoft Lumia’ is complete, bringing to an end nearly three decades of Nokia phones. Dry your eyes mate: Microsoft has revealed what its phones will look like now that the Nokia brand name has been dropped from all future devices, shown in this image. From now on all Nokia Lumia and Windows Phone devices will simply be called Microsoft Lumia, although existing phones will continue to be supported . Earlier this week it was reported that Microsoft was to drop both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in favour of just using Lumia. The company is beginning a transition to change all of its branding to simply Microsoft Lumia, just in time for the holiday season. From now on, Microsoft devices will carry the company's name in the place where the word 'Nokia' used to appear. The change was first confirmed by Nokia France on their Facebook page on Tuesday when they wrote: ‘We are on the verge of becoming Microsoft Lumia!’ The move brings an end to Nokia’s name being on mobile phones, a long run that stretches back into the 1980s. It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft’s own site. Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France. Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business in April in a £4.5 billion ($7.2 billion) deal. Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status. And now in a post on Microsoft’s Conversations blog, Senior Vice President of Marketing for Phones at Microsoft Tuula Rytilä has unveiled the changes. ‘This is a very exciting time for us and for Lumia products,’ she said. ‘You might have seen that in the last couple of months, we have already made some name changes to our apps to better reflect that these apps now come from Microsoft. ‘Our global and local websites are going through a transition as we speak and in the coming days our social channels will get a new name too - they will be called Microsoft Lumia. ‘We would like to invite our Lumia fans to continue to follow us and always be up to speed with the latest device news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.’ She would wouldn’t give a specific date, she said the first Microsoft Lumia device would be released revealed ‘soon’. She added: ‘This is of course a natural progression as all devices that once came from Nokia now come from Microsoft.’ From now on, Microsoft devices will carry the company's name in the place where the word 'Nokia' used to appear, as shown in this image posted on Microsoft's Conversations blog . She was quick to add that this did not make Nokia Lumia smartphones currently on the market obsolete. ‘Microsoft continues to sell and support the Nokia Lumia phones that are out in the market, such as the recently announced Lumia 830 and Lumia 730/735,' she said. ‘We will continue to honor customer warranties and provide world-class care services as before.’ And it’s not entirely the death of Nokia; Ms Rytilä says some entry-level Nokia-branded phones, such as the Nokia 130, will still be sold, as Microsoft still has a 10-year license on the Nokia brand. According to The Verge, Microsoft only had 18 months to use the Nokia brand on smartphones, but can use it longer on regular phones. Microsoft also revealed yesterday that, in the most recent quarter, the company had seen a small increase in the 8.8 million Windows Phones sold last year to 9.3 million this year. It’s not entirely the death of Nokia; Ms Rytilä says some entry-level Nokia-branded phones, such as the Nokia 130 (shown), will still be sold, as Microsoft still has a 10-year license on the Nokia brand . The change by the Washington firm will see all Microsoft smartphones simply called Microsoft Lumia from now on (Lumia 730 shown). Both the Nokia brand name and Windows Phone are being dropped in the shake-up of Microsoft's phone business. On the middle phone you can see where the word 'Nokia' used to appear . The change was first reported by The Verge on Monday and was confirmed by Nokia France on their Facebook page on Tuesday. They wrote: 'In the coming days, you will receive a Facebook message regarding the change of name of this page. 'Some of today’s press reports related to rumours about Microsoft dropping the Nokia brand have declared the death of the Nokia brand,' said Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs. 'But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.” 'Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength. 'We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere. 'Remember, Nokia started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. Over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves. 'We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!' 'We are on the verge of becoming ""Microsoft Lumia!"" 'Stay-tuned for more soon.' The move brings an end to Nokia’s name being on mobile phones, a long run that stretches back into the 1980s. It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft’s own site. Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France. Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business in April in a £4.5 billion ($7.2 billion) deal. Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status. Nokia has been quick to assure customers that the company will live on, albeit no longer in the mobile phone business. In a blog post back in September Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs at Nokia said: ‘To paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.” ‘Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength. ‘We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere.’ He continued: ‘We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!’ The move brings to an end nearly three decades of Nokia phones, which will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 (shown) in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age upon its release in 2000 .

"Drama in the writer's room: Aaron Sorkin (pictured) kicked a writer out of a script-writing session after she protested a sub-plot about campus rape which aired in this week's penultimate episode of The Newsroom . A writer on Aaron Sorkin's soon-to-end HBO series The Newsroom, says she was kicked out of a script-writing session when she objected to a controversial story line about rape on college campuses which aired on this week's episode. And now Sorkin, who came to fame writing A Few Good Men and The West Wing, says he's 'disappointed' writer Alena Smith violated the privacy of the writer's room. Sunday night's penultimate episode featured a sub-plot about a news producer dispatched to Princeton University to pre-interview a rape victim for the fictional nightly news show. The sub-plot's subject matter was especially sensitive considering the timing of the episode, airing just days after Rolling Stone issued an apology for their 'misplacement of trust' in a University of Virginia student, whose account of being gang raped at a campus fraternity is now in question. The Newsroom scene follows show producer Don Keefer (played by Thomas Sadoski) speaking with a female student who set up a website that lets rape victims like her report their attackers' names anonymously. Their conversation largely covers how campus rape is under-prosecuted by law enforcement and universities alike, and the journalistic ethics of reporting a rapist's name when the suspect has not been charged. While Don told the victim he believed her story, he finished the interview by urging her against coming on the show since he was 'morally obligated' as a journalist to consider the rapist innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Viewers and critics were mostly aligned online, in their tweets criticizing Don's extreme care in covering both sides of the story, which ends up silencing the victim. Apparently The Newsroom writers had a similar debate when they were writing the story months ago. Writer Alena Smith, who joined the show's writing staff for the third and final season, revealed on Twitter that she had been kicked out of a script-writing session when she disagreed with show creator Aaron Sorkin's decision to push forward with the rape story. Sensative topic: The constroversial scene in question follows show producer Don Keefer (played by Thomas Sadoski, pictured) interviewing a rape victim at Princeton University, and telling her he's compelled to believe her attacker's story until he's proven guilty . 'So when I tried to argue, in the writers' room, that we maybe skip the story line where a rape victim gets interrogated by a random man...I ended up getting kicked out of the room and screamed at,' Smith wrote. 'I found the experience quite boring. I wanted to fight with Aaron about the NSA, not gender. I didn't like getting cast in this outdated role,' she added, referring to another plot line in the episode about NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Sorkin himself later responded to Smith's comments, and admitted that he did 'excuse' her from the writing room. 'I heard Alena’s objections and there was some healthy back and forth. After a while I needed to move on (there’s a clock ticking) but Alena wasn’t ready to do that yet. I gave her more time but then I really needed to move on. Alena still wouldn’t let me do that so I excused her from the room,' Sorkin told Mediaite. However, Sorkin says he was surprised to hear Smith's unhappiness about the episode, since he went on to write another draft of the script that she allegedly gave her 'enthusiastic support'. He added that he was disappointed that Smith broke the confidentiality of the writer's room by tweeting about the episode. 'It was a room in which people felt safe enough to discuss private and intimate details of their lives in the hope of bringing dimension to stories that were being pitched. That’s what happens in writers rooms and while ours was the first one Alena ever worked in, the importance of privacy was made clear to everyone on our first day of work and was reinforced constantly. I’m saddened that she’s broken that trust,' Sorkin said. This isn't the first time Sorkin has made the news, with his show about the news. When The Newsroom debuted in 2012, he was largely criticized for his one-dimensional portrayal of female characters - especially a gossip reporter character he allegedly modeled off a woman he dated who worked for the New York Post's Page Six. Finale: The Newsroom, which follows a team of journalists putting on a fictional nightly news show, will air it's final episode next Sunday. Above, main character Will McAvoy, played by Jeff Daniels .","Sunday night's episode of HBO show The Newsroom featured a sub-plot about a character interviewing a rape victim at Princeton .

"A 24-year-old man charged with shooting dead three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers and wounding two others in June pleaded guilty Friday to first-degree murder charges. Justin Bourque also pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted murder. He recently was found competent and mentally fit to stand trial. The June 4 killings and ensuing manhunt brought the city of Moncton, New Brunswick, to a near-standstill until an arrest was made about 30 hours later. Charges: Justin Bourque, left, pleaded guilty on Friday to shooting dead three Mounted Police . Armed with high-powered firearms, Bourque was spotted three times as the city of about 60,000 people near the Maine border was all but shut down. Victim: Douglas James Larche was shot dead while responding to a call on June 4 . Constables Dave Ross, Fabrice Gevaudan and Douglas Larche were killed after responding to a report of a man with firearms in a residential neighborhood. Constables Eric Dubois and Darlene Goguen were wounded. It was the deadliest attack on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police since four officers were killed by a gunman in the western province of Alberta in 2005. That attack remains the deadliest on Canadian police officers in 120 years. Police have not yet identified any motive in the June shootings, but a portrait of a man obsessed with guns and anti-government rhetoric began to emerge following the shootings. Neighbors of his parents and others who knew Bourque spoke of a quiet man from a well-liked, Catholic family, but what appeared to be Bourque's most recent posts on social networks told a different tale. A friend, Trever Finck, said he noticed changes in Bourque's behavior over the past year, particularly after he created a new Facebook page for himself in February and filled it with anti-police messages and conspiracy theories. Tragic: Fabrice Gevaudan, left, and Dave Ross, right, were killed after responding to call about gunfire . His profile picture shows him standing in the woods with a friend, wearing camouflage gear and clutching a shotgun, with what appear to be dozens of spent shell casings at their feet. Bourque's case returns to court October 27 to file victim impact statements and pre-sentencing documents. Members of his family declined comment when they left court.","Justin Bourque is facing three murder charges and two attempted murder charges over June 4 attack .

"A senior fireman has been arrested for hitting four boys with a golf club after they threw candy at his son on Halloween, police say. Captain Carl Holmberg was trick-or-treating in Revere, Boston, on Friday with his wife and six-year-old when the group aged 11 to 17 confronted them. According to his charge sheet, the captain of 15 years reacted by attacking the children. Charged: Captain Carl Holmberg has been charged with assault for allegedly hitting four boys with a golf club on Halloween after they are said to have threatened him and his six-year-old son with fake weapons and candy . Two were hospitalized and an 11-year-old boy as left with welts on his head. Holmberg is charged with threee counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and one count of assaulting a child, MyFoxBoston.com reports. His wife Serena Holmberg tearfully told WCVB through her letterbox that he was defending himself in the incident at 7.30pm. One of the group had a fake machete that looked real, she said. 'About eight or 10 kids came and started throwing things at him, and then they left and came back with more kids, and then they stood there and taunted us and told him they were going to [mess] him up,' 'Defending himself': Holmberg's niece said he was defending himself from the 'dangerous' group of boys . Angry: The father of the 11-year-old boy left with welts on his head said they were not threatening the captain . 'I'm horrified. I can't even talk. It was scary. My six-year-old is horrified; he won't come home,' she said. 'My husband is an awesome person; he would do anything for anybody. He's a firefighter; that's what he does. He helps people. He was protecting his six-year-old and his wife.' However, the father of the 11-year-old boy who suffered injuries to his head claimed they were trick-or-treating and nobody threatened the family of three. Holmberg has been placed on paid leave awaiting arraignment today.","Captain Carl Holmberg was trick-or-treating with son, 6, and wife on Friday .

"What was once a hub for ski lovers and home to more than 100 ice sheets may be stripped of its very identity as climate change affects the ecosystem. Glacier National Park may have to undergo a name change in the next 16 years -- the time the Park's namesake glaciers are expected to disappear completely, The New York Times reports. U.S. Geological Survey reports that the Park's glaciers have rapidly declined in number since its establishment in 1910. The Times reports that the Park was once home to some 150 ice sheets, now that number is less than 30. Decline: Above are photos of the Boulder Glacier Terminus in 1913 ( left) and the glacier photographed in 2012 (right) illustrating the decline in the size of the Park's glaciers . The cause of the glacial recession in the Park that boasts nearly 1,600 square miles is no secret: climate change. The Times reports that small ski areas that once riddled the park have since closed due to shorter Winter seasons and snows too light to keep them open. Streams in the Park that are fed by melted snow are reaching peak spring flows earlier than in the past and low summer flows earlier than usual. Glaciers: Above are photos of the Grinnell Ridge glacier in 1910 (left) and photographed again in 2012 (right) Farmers who depend on the snow melt in the warmer months fear that the water they need will not be available. Dried out soil from warmer, drier summers have resulted in an increase of wildfires in the park, according to the Times. Even the wildlife is suffering, the Times reports that the Bull Trout population is decreasing as water temperatures rise. Ecosystem: Daniel B. Fagre, a USGS research ecologist, (above) said that the dwindling glaciers impact the Park's ecosystem . The Montana park has been called the center of the 'Crown of the Continent Ecosystem,' -- the Rocky Mountain Range joining northwest Montana, southwest Alberta, and southeast British Columbia, according to the Montana Travel Site. Daniel B. Fagre, a USGS research ecologist, said that dwindling glacier size means 'we're on the cusp of bigger changes.' 'We’re a snow-driven ecosystem, and glaciers are just a part of that,' Fagre said. 'The way the snow goes is the way our ecosystem goes.' Montana: Glacier National Park is located in Montana on the Canada–United States border and is nearly 1,600 square miles .","Glacier National Park may be losing its namesake as rising temperatures have claimed nearly all of its glaciers in the last century .

"Doctors have diagnosed Kansas City Chiefs' Eric Berry with Hodgkins lymphoma, confirming fears that the  safety has cancer. It comes two weeks after the squad's medical team discovered a mass on Berry's chest, prompting a series of MRI scans. The 25-year-old will now be entered into a program of chemotherapy, sidelining him for the rest of the season - his fifth with the Chiefs. Diagnosis: Kansas City Chiefs safety Eric Berry, 25, has been diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma . Kansas City Chiefs players paid tribute to their safety Eric Berry on Sunday as they awaited test results . His surgeon, Dr Christopher Flowers at the Emory University School of Medicine, insists the disease is a 'very treatable and possibly curable' form of cancer. 'I will embrace this process and attack it the same way I do everything else in life. God has more than prepared me for it,' Berry said in a statement. 'I want to thank the Emory University School of Medicine, along with Dr. Flowers and his team, for all of their hard work and effort in diagnosing and creating a plan for me to battle this thing.' Hodgkin's disease, also called Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a cancer of the immune system that only represents about 8 percent of all diagnosed lymphomas. According to the National Cancer Institute, more than 9,000 people will be diagnosed with it in the United States this year. Support: Fans at Arrowhead Stadium hold up banners for Berry. Doctors found a lump on his chest last month . A core team member: A fan holds up a sign with Berry's No 29 and a loveheart on at Arrowhead Stadium . The survival rate in 1960 was about 40 percent, but advancements in medicine combined with earlier detections have increased the survival rate to more than 80 percent. 'The goal of Mr. Berry's treatment is to cure his lymphoma and we are beginning that treatment now,' Flowers said in a statement issued through the Chiefs. Berry experienced discomfort in his chest after Kansas City's defeat by the Oakland Raiders on November 20. A mass was found on his chest on an MRI scan, and the team announced that he would miss the rest of the season. Kansas City Chiefs players took to the field wearing red-on-red - which Berry likes - rather than white pants . On Sunday night the Chiefs hosted Peyton Manning's Denver Broncos, their AFC West rivals, and honoured their safety. Players wore shirts with Berry's No 29 on the back during their warm-up while a message on the big screen at Arrowhead Stadium read 'be bold, be brave, be Berry'. The Chiefs took to the field wearing red jerseys and red trousers, a look that Berry likes, rather than their normal white trousers. Spectators also held up banners and signs in support of the 25-year-old safety.","Eric Berry has been ruled out for the rest of the season .

"Saturday Night Live planned to air a sketch about the Ferguson, Missouri protests this weekend, but cut the controversial sketch because the show was short on time. NBC has now released the dress-rehearsal version of the sketch online, which follows morning show hosts in St Louis trying to remain cheery about a night of violent demonstrations for police shooting victim Michael Brown. Instead, the show tackled the national protests over police brutality on Weekend Update and with a  a sketch about Al Sharpton's reaction to a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to indict the NYPD officer who killed Eric Garner. Scroll down for video . Awkward: The sketch featured Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson as co-hosts of a St Louis morning show, struggling to remain cheery in the wake of the Michael Brown protests . Unfortunate: James Frano appears as a chef promoting a cookbook, with the unfortunate name of Darrel Wilson . In the five-minute sketch, castmembers Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson play Jenny and Kip, the co-hosts of St Louis morning show 'Rise and Smile',  who feel uncomfortable keeping up with their typically silly banter and feel-good segments in light of the unrest. James Franco, who hosted the December 7 episode, appears as a chef promoting his new cookbook who has the unfortunate name of Darrel Wilson - just a letter difference to Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot dead Brown. Appearing to give updates on the traffic is new castmember Leslie Jones, who eventually abandons the show and flies her helicopter out of St Louis. 'Is that the Chicago skyline?' Cecily ask. 'Hell yes, and I am NOT coming back,' Jones replies. The clip finishes with Cecily deciding to end  'Rise and Smile' 53 minutes early, when a visiting quartet starts singing Billy's Joel's hit 'We didn't start the fire'. More than a dozen Ferguson businesses were torched in the Brown protests. Bye: New castmember Leslie Jones plays a traffic reporter who decides to flee St Louis for Chicago . Cut the tape: Cecily decides to end the show 53 minutes early when a singing quartet starts singing the questionable song 'We didn't start the fire' Before each live televised show, SNL hosts a dress rehearsal where they run through all of the sketches in contention, and cut segments for time or that don't register enough laughs with the studio audience. It's unclear why the SNL producers ultimately decided to nix the sketch, though they were clearly proud enough to release it online in it's unpolished version. Race has been a tricky subject for SNL in the past, and just last season was criticized for the lack of diversity among the cast. That led show creator Lorne Michaels to start a nationwide search for a black female cast member, which ultimately ended in the mid-season hiring of Sasheer Zamata. Four of the 15 current repertory and featured castmembers are African American with this season's addition of Jones.",Sketch follows two St Louis morning show co-hosts struggling to remain cheery in the wake of the Ferguson protests .
"Despite the rising costs involved in attending university, the pursuit of a degree-level education is becoming increasingly common with each generation. Roughly 41 percent of Americans aged 18 to 24 are currently enrolled in a two- or four-year degree-granting institution, compared with 25.5 percent enrolled in 1967, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. There is good reason to pursue a bachelor’s degree as in 2013 the typical American adult with a degree earned more than double someone with only a high school diploma. Lake Havasu City-Kingman, Arizona, has topped a list of the least educated cities in the United States . Half of America's least educated cities are in California, although worst of all was Lake Havasu City-Kingman, Arizona . But as people with the best education move to areas with the best paid jobs, left behind are the nation’s cities with the lowest education levels. These metropolitan areas are ‘stuck in a vicious cycle’, according to Pedro Noguera, professor of education at New York University. ‘Low levels of education make it difficult for them to attract businesses that pay higher wages.’ To rank the ten least educated cities in the U.S., 24/7 Wall St. reviewed metrics including cities with the lowest percentage of adults 25 and older with at least a bachelor’s degree, median household income, median earnings and the poverty rate. The results produced a list of cities that have historically been dependent on agriculture and mining and which now find themselves without a foothold in the technology sector and other industries which are running the economy. In second spot was Dalton, Georgia. Known as the carpet capital of the world, its economy was hammered by the Great Recession . The top ten least-educated cities are: . 10. Vineland-Bridgeton, New Jersey . Bachelor’s degree or higher: 13.7 percent . Median household income: $45,978 (148th lowest) Median earnings - bachelor’s degree: $53,187 (30th highest) Median earnings - high school diploma: $23,818 . Poverty rate: 20.6 percent (58th highest), compared to less than 16% nationwide. 9. Merced, California . Bachelor’s degree or higher: 13.5 percent . Median household income: $40,687 (54th lowest) Median earnings - bachelor’s degree: $41,719 (116th lowest) Median earnings - high school diploma: $32,000 . Poverty rate: 25.2 percent (13th highest) Less than 68 percent of adults living in Merced had finished high school, compared to 87 per cent nationwide . Nearly 16 percent of the population did not have U.S. citizenship last year - one of the highest percentages nationwide. Non-citizens are less likely to attend college. 8.

Median household income: $39,422 (29th lowest) Median earnings – bachelor’s degree: $50,569 (73rd highest) Median earnings - high school diploma: $20,515 . Poverty rate: 30.1 per cent (4th highest) Nearly 19 percent of the workforce were employed in agricultural sectors, versus just 2 percent nationwide. 7. Houma-Thibodaux, Louisiana . Bachelor’s degree or higher: 13.2 percent . Median household income: $54,070 (96th highest) Median earnings – bachelor’s degree: $46,659 (139th highest) Median earnings - high school diploma: $38,000 . Poverty rate: 13.6 percent (88th lowest) 6. Madera, California . Bachelor’s degree or higher: 13.0 percent . Median household income: $39,758 (36th lowest) Median earnings – bachelor’s degree: $49,994 (90th highest) Poverty rate: 23.6 percent (21st highest) Once had a flourishing lumber industry, Madera now has a diversified agricultural industry . Like several other cities with low educational attainment rates, Madera also has a relatively large immigrant population. Last year, an estimated 16.2 percent of the area population were not U.S. citizens, one of the highest percentages nationwide.

It is believed the theft could delay production. The Bond films are famous for the spy's cars being fitted out with state-of-the-art gadgets and weaponry, so new luxury vehicles may have to be extensively altered.

"The American government believed a rogue FBI mole was passing secrets to the IRA at the time the group were plotting to assassinate Margaret Thatcher, it was reported last night. Files released to The Guardian show that federal agents launched a series of investigations into alleged plots to murder the former Prime Minister during visits to the US. One trusted source told the FBI that a ‘female, secretary type’ in the agency’s New York bureau was giving the provisional IRA ‘access to computers, name checks and ID’. The documents, released after a freedom of information request following Lady Thatcher’s death, reveal this claim tallied with independent allegations of a leak. Files show that federal agents launched a series of investigations into alleged plots to murder the former Prime Minister during visits to the US. Pictured, Ronald Reagan  meets the PM at the White House in 1981 . Fears that the New York field office may have been compromised led William Sessions, then the FBI director, to order that access to all material relating to an apparent plot against Mrs Thatcher by two men linked to Sinn Féin must be restricted to a pair of senior officials. The precautions followed several years of alleged plots detailed in the files. In February 1981, two men with ‘English or Irish accents’ were overheard by an FBI source ‘of proven reliability’ in the cocktail lounge of the Boar’s Head restaurant in Falls Church, Virginia, seemingly discussing a ‘hit’ during a visit by Mrs Thatcher. ‘This will even the score for H,’ one man was overheard saying. FBI agents took this as a reference to the H-blocks of the Maze prison in Northern Ireland, where IRA members were being held. ‘The Iron Maiden is no better than any other bloody PM,’ the man went on. The man was also said to have been heard referring to Bloody Sunday, ‘war’ and ‘blanket men’. Several IRA prisoners carried out a protest against their prison uniforms, in which they wore only blankets for several years. The man’s drinking partner was said to have tried to ‘quiet him down’. Two men with ‘English or Irish accents’ were heard by the FBI discussing a ‘hit’ during a visit by Thatcher to 'even the score for H'. FBI agents took this as a reference to the H-blocks (pictured in 1983) of the Maze prison in Northern Ireland, where IRA members were being held . The FBI carried out surveillance of the restaurant while interviewing staff and alerting field offices around the region. New York said that ‘three known IRA terrorists’ were known to be in the area. Suspects were identified, but their names were redacted in the files released on Monday. Also included were poor photocopies of photographs of the suspects that were circulated between agents. Delta Airlines was co-opted to help locate their flight records. In the end, Mrs Thatcher’s visit to New York and Washington, where she was to collect an honorary degree from Georgetown University, passed without incident. By March 1981, the case was declared closed, the files show. Several more threats against the Tory leader – of varying significance – emerged in the following years. In 1987, a suicidal man from Florida was said to have threatened to kill Mrs Thatcher but ‘got lost’ on his way to Camp David, the presidential retreat where she was staying with Ronald Reagan. In December 1989, a man with an English accent called the FBI from Southampton to warn that Mrs Thatcher and then president George Bush Sr were the targets of an assassination plot by a group going by the name ‘God’s Soldiers’. A fresh plot emerged in July 1992, following Thatcher’s departure from 10 Downing Street and in advance of a speaking trip to the US. In February 1981, two men with ‘English or Irish accents’ were overheard by an FBI source   discussing a ‘hit’ during a visit by Mrs Thatcher. Picture posed by model . A tip-off arrived from a trusted FBI asset based in Boston, who was apparently working undercover in American-based IRA circles and had learned of the plot in a New York bar identified as a ‘hotbed’ of IRA activity. The investigation was taken very seriously. Dozens of pages of files were created, and the mole inquiry was launched. Two known IRA operatives thought to have been behind past attacks in the UK and said to have fled California for New York, were identified as the prime suspects – although their names were also redacted in Monday’s release. However, Mrs Thatcher’s visit again passed without an attack. She was able to complete her 12-day itinerary, which as well as a visit to President Bush in the White House and lunches with high-powered American officials, included six separate hair appointments.","FBI source said a ‘female secretary’ was leaking data to provisional IRA .

"The Salvation Army found an unusual surprise inside one of its red donation kettles: a diamond engagement ring given by a widow in honor of her late husband. The charity said Monday the anonymous benefactor placed the diamond ring — valued at $1,850 — and her wedding band in one of the kettles placed outside Boston's North Station last week. It says the rings were accompanied by a note in which the woman said she hoped they would be sold and the money used to buy toys for needy children. She said her husband always had a giving spirit — especially at Christmastime. Scroll down for video . Hidden treasure: This photo shows a diamond ring, valued at $1,850, and a wedding band, that were placed in a red donation kettle outside Boston's North Station by an anonymous widow in honor of her late husband . Bell-ringer Robert Barr told WCVB 'I remember the lady coming in. She was saying it was two checks. I didn't - she didn't say nothing about the rings.' 'To honor his memory, I donate this ring. I'm hoping there's someone out there who made lots of money this year and will buy the ring for 10 times its worth. After all, there's no price on love or the sentimental value of this ring. But money will help the kids. May everyone have a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!' her note read. Salvation Army Major David Davis said Monday the 'incredible' donation warmed the hearts of bell-ringers and other volunteers. 'We're so moved and incredibly grateful to the generous individual who made such a loving and kind donation,' Davis said. 'This heartwarming gift boosts all of our staff, bell-ringers and volunteers.' 'This is, like, one of those precedent-setting things, so we don’t necessary have a protocol to turn to [for selling the rings],' Lieutenant Michael Harper told The Boston Globe. The newspaper noted that the ring's value may have changed, since the appraisal included with the rings and the note was reportedly done in 2003. The Salvation Army says the red kettles date to 1891, when Salvation Army Capt. Joseph McFee wanted to help feed the needy in San Francisco. The containers were modeled after those McFee saw at ferry landings in Liverpool England, where people would sit with small kettles and collect spare change from travelers.

"New Zealand Rugby League officials have slammed the Australian junior team for their 'provocative and disrespectful' reaction to a pre-match haka after a brawl almost broke out between the Junior Kiwis and Junior Kangaroos. Officials had to step in to separate the two teams after they started pushing and shoving each other following the traditional pre-game challenge at Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland on Saturday night. NZ Rugby League president Howie Tamati described the incident as disappointing. Scroll down for video . A fight almost broke out between the Junior Kiwis and Junior Kangaroos after the pre-match haka . Referees stepped in to separate the two teams before things escalated in Auckland on Saturday night . 'In regard to the actions of the Australian boys to walk up and get in the New Zealand boys faces, that was really provocative and disrespectful,' Mr Tamati told stuff.co.nz. He added that the haka was misunderstood to be 'all about war'. 'The haka can be many things... But the battle is to come, the game is to come. It's not a situation where you're looking to fight. 'That was disrespectful by the Australians, and deliberately so I would say.' Junior Kiwis coach Brent Gemmell said the Australian team stepped too far forward before the New Zealand team started advancing to perform their haka, which saw the two teams come face to face and 'over-hyped things'. He said a new protocol of a 10m gap between teams should be introduced for future games. Some rugby fans took to their page to express their opinion on Kiwis' pre-match haka . anahera waru tweeted: 'Hows that for pre-match feeling!' after the Kiwis' pre-match haka . Both teams were standing toe to toe while the young Australian players linked arms during the performance on Saturday, which Australian media described as 'the most aggressive haka of all time'. 'That was interesting viewing for sure,' Mr Gemmell told NZ Herald. 'When I saw Australia advance and they crossed halfway and I knew our boys were still to walk forward and still to stick a hand out at them. 'I thought this could potentially turn really sour but it calmed down and we got on with the footy which was good.' New Zealand beat Australia 15-14 with a field goal in the last minute of the game.

"Hotel chains and booking websites have been accused of working together to ‘fix’ prices for consumers looking for a discount. Websites such as Expedia and Booking.com have joined forces with hotel groups to protect their profit margins by ensuring the rates on ‘discount’ websites are actually the same as the normal price, an industry insider has said. Dorian Harris, CEO of discount hotel site Skoosh.com, has said he was forced out of the market after attempting to undercut his rivals by offering cheaper prices. Intercontinental Hotels Group, which operates luxury hotels such as the Intercontinental London Park Lane (pictured) is under investigation by the OFT . Mr Harris has even said he was threatened with violence by hotel owners angry at the possibility of their rooms being sold at rates cheaper than those agreed with the major booking portals. Usually if hotels have spare rooms available, they sell the capacity on to estate agents and discount booking agencies, which then mark up their prices by about 25% before offering them to the public. As well as earning the hotels more money overall, these high prices also protect the reputation of the hotels, and let them keep their prices high. But Mr Harris says that when he decided to beat the competition by offering rooms on Skoosh.com at a smaller mark-up he lost 70% of his business after hotel chains demanded he raise his prices to stay in step with the rest of the industry. He told The Sunday Times: ‘We started getting some calls from angry and confused hoteliers insisting that we were selling their rooms too cheaply ... I realised a [rival] website had been on to them threatening all sorts of nonsense if they didn't either remove their hotel from Skoosh or force Skoosh to raise its prices.’ In a phone call recorded by Harris, a hotel manager in Prague whose hotels he had discounted told him: ‘You're gone. You will see what's going to happen to you in one week. If you are in Prague then you will see what it means to be threatened.’ Expedia is also under investigation for its practices around offering discount hotel rooms . The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) opened an investigation into Expedia and Booking.com in 2010, looking at allegations they had colluded with InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), the world's biggest provider of hotel rooms. It opened a public consultation on new industry proposals, which ended on Friday. In them the three companies proposed a set of commitments, which would allow discount sites cut into their profit margin to offer cheaper rooms. However, the companies added that offering these commitments was not an admission of any past wrongdoing. Anti-competitive business agreements, such as price-fixing, are illegal in the UK, and in the most severe cases can result in an unlimited fine and up to five years in prison. Legal action has also been launched in America. Papers filed in Texas claim that a British conference firm organised seminars where hoteliers would meet with discount site representatives to agree prices for their rooms. Searches of discount websites for hotels in the InterContinental portfolio in London and Chicago have shown that several discount websites offer the same prices as booking directly. Another insider told The Sunday Times: ‘Most people know this is going on but the big firms are benefiting and the small operators are often too scared to speak up for fear of repercussions.’ The OFT said it could not comment while its investigation was going on. However, the watchdog has said in the past that it would like hotels and websites to be more transparent about the discounts they offer. It has not yet been determined whether Booking.com, Expedia or IHG have broken the law. Booking.com declined to comment on the OFT probe. IHG said it had ‘worked closely with the OFT’ to agree commitments on how to operate in future. Expedia said that it welcomes the draft commitments, and said it expects the OFT to close its investigation without taking any action. IHG declined to comment on Mr Harris's allegations, but has said previously that it has 'worked closely with the OFT' during the probe.","Dorian Harris, CEO of discount site Skoosh.com, said sites and hotels were working together .

Alexis Sanchez capitalised on two Sunderland howlers to earn Arsenal a second away win of the season and move them to the edge of the top four — but improvement will be required to secure a Champions League berth. The first goal came courtesy of Wes Brown, who effectively passed the ball into Sanchez’s path with only keeper Vito Mannone between the South American forward and goal — and Sanchez duly snaffled the chance. The second goal, scored in the final moments to flatter the scoreline, was laid on a plate by former Gunner Mannone. The Italian was faffing around with the ball at his feet when he could have simply hoofed it clear and Sanchez simply nipped in, took the ball and scored.

Man of the match: Sanchez . The match as a whole was mediocre, Arsenal operating at training pace for long stretches and Sunderland desperate to make sure they did not succumb to a second successive monstering after being embarrassed 8-0 at Southampton last week. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger naturally took the positives at the end of a week in which he celebrated his 65th birthday with a late comeback victory at Anderlecht in the Champions League. ‘Of course I am happy because we had a difficult game on Wednesday night,’ he said. ‘I believe we were in control. Before scoring a second goal, of course you can concede a goal and drop points. We didn’t do it today, we were focused. ‘We won at Anderlecht and we won here, two and a half days later. That is never easy.’ Wenger praised Sanchez for the ability and talent that allowed him to make the most of the hosts’ errors. ‘He took advantage of the mistakes they made,’ Wenger said. ‘He has a super quality, he is quick on his feet. That’s why he wins many balls that normal players don’t win. ‘His transition from offence to defence is very quick and he wins the ball back very quickly and he can take advantage of that.’ This latest reverse for Sunderland leaves them with just a single win to go with five draws and three defeats. Manager Gus Poyet insisted he was heartened by the response to last week’s drubbing but was disappointed that individual errors had again been so costly. ‘It’s difficult to analyse the game because the commitment, reaction, desire and organisation compared to last week was there,’ he said. ‘But we forgot to leave the mistakes in the dressing room.’ Poyet also said his team were angry. ‘They fought hard for the result and two actions cost us.’ But he believes Sunderland’s problem is psychological rather than any technical or tactical issue. ‘We’re getting paid to win games and we’ve won one and need to change that,’ he said. ‘It’s about character now, being brave enough to go on the pitch and believe we can win.’ Poyet made two changes to his starting line-up, bring in Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson as Jordi Gomez and Connor Wickham dropped to the bench.

Alexis Sanchez              90           11.0      6.8 . Sunderland pushed forward at the start and had the first sight of goal in the second minute, Rodwell heading wide from Will Buckley’s cross. If that looked promising it was a false dawn because their only other efforts that carried threat in the first half were headers from John O’Shea and Rodwell, and both of those were blocked. Arsenal’s first chance was in the seventh minute from a corner taken by Santi Cazorla. It was headed clear only as far as Kieran Gibbs, but he lashed wide from the edge of the area. Cazorla fed Sanchez a minute later and he also shot and missed. At the other end, Brown nodded on to O’Shea, whose header was blocked. Then came the clearest chance up to that point of the match when Danny Welbeck, who received the ball on the left corner of the area, switched it on to his right foot and smacked the ball just over. Gibbs was booked for taking out Johnson, the first of a spate of yellows cards either side of the break, with Welbeck and Mikel Arteta among others to go into Kevin Friend’s book. Welbeck was booked for an alleged dive in the second half but it looked a harsh decision because his movement was impeded by O’Shea. Arteta’s booking five minutes after that was arguably lenient, for a high kick on Rodwell that might well have given him a facial injury. Arsenal went ahead in the 30th minute thanks to Brown’s error in the centre circle. First, he failed to control a simple pass from a team-mate and then he made a hash of an attempted back pass, twisting his kicking leg and making minimal contact with the ball. In doing so, he gave possession to Sanchez with nobody between the Chilean forward and the Sunderland goal. Sanchez dashed forward and chipped over Mannone. Cazorla had a chance to extend the lead three minutes later but his left-footed shot flew wide right. On the hour, Sanchez’s effort from outside the box forced a save from Mannone and then another former Arsenal man, Seb Larsson, elicited a save from Wojciech Szczesny at the other end. Jozy Altidore, on as a substitute for Rodwell, headed on target and Szczesny saved again. Sanchez rubbed Sunderland’s noses in it with his late second goal when Mannone was clearly at fault. ‘Vito has been educated at Arsenal so of course I have some sympathy,’ Wenger said. ‘He is like anyone else [at Sunderland], his confidence has dropped a little bit because of the defeat last week. But he has shown his qualities since he arrived here and will show that again.’ Arsenal must demonstrate their own, more clearly and more often.

"State police had to be called to a high school football game after a sideline brawl saw coaches accusing each other of choking players and shouting racial slurs. Officers had to order both teams and fans to leave the field so not to risk further violence at Saturday's Class D football game between Rensslaer and Whitehall high schools in Whitehall, New York. Rensslaer High School are now pursuing assault charges against Whitehall's assistant coach, after he allegedly pinned down one of their players, choking him during the second-quarter brawl.

"Everywhere Brendan Rodgers turned he was confronted by evidence of how success can happen when it is least expected. From the image of Luis Garcia lofting a ball over a tumbling John Terry, the Olympiacos pennant hanging in a cabinet to, above all, the Champions League trophy glistening proudly in a cabinet outside Anfield’s trophy room, the spirit of Istanbul abounded. When you factor in that Rodgers was holding court on the 10th anniversary of the goal Steven Gerrard scored against the Greek club that launched them on the way to their fifth European Cup, Liverpool’s manager could have not been in a better place if he was looking for omens. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: We have to be patient to get the result . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard is expected to start against Basle after being on the bench vs Sunderland . Gerrard (left) scored a  late winner to see Liverpool qualify for the 2004-05 Champions League last 16 . Gerrard (centre) celebates his goal against Olympiacos as they progressed to the knockout stages . Expected starting line-ups for Tuesday's game . Rodgers enjoys daring to dream and, in some part of his mind, he believes that a victory against FC Basle on Tuesday evening has the capacity to propel Liverpool on another giddy European adventure: what happened in 2004-05 shows how strange things can happen. For all that Rodgers is prepared to embrace fantasy, though, he also deals in realism and if Liverpool are to preserve their place in this competition, history will have nothing to do with it. What he needs is a display full of vibrancy to show why they deserve a place among the elite. So far, this Champions League campaign has been hugely anti-climatic; a scruffy win on Match-day One against Ludogorets was followed by three consecutive defeats before a grinding 2-2 draw in Sofia provided a shot at redemption. Rodgers knows Liverpool have to deliver. ‘Once you get through the group stage anything can happen,’ said the manager. ‘I know come February, when the Champions League starts again, we will be a better team because of the players we will have available if we manage to get through. That is what I am looking forward to. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has told his players to keep their composure against Basle on Tuesday .

Champions League Group B after five matches . ‘We have seen that the best team doesn’t always win the competition. You can get a good draw, a bit of luck. But first things first, we need to get through. This would give the players a huge amount of confidence, having not consistently played that well all season. The key is to get a big win. ‘It may not come with a big performance but the main objective is the win. Get that and we have seen over the years that qualification gives you confidence. We’ve had big performances in my time and want to deliver another to give us that platform.’ Rodgers was speaking at Liverpool's pre-match press conference on Monday ahead of their Basle clash . The Reds need to beat Basle at Anfield to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League . 6 - Liverpool have gone six Champions League games without a clean sheet - their longest run since conceding in eight straight games in the 2008-09 season. The topic of failure has not been broached in the dressing room. Fail to beat Basle - who only need a point - and the second half of the campaign will look even more onerous, with a schedule of playing on Thursdays and Sundays. ‘If you end up in the Europa League, you are still in European football even if it is not the competition you want to be in,’ Rodgers argued. ‘That is what comes with it but for me the focus is on winning this game. The consequences of that will come after it. ‘I haven’t given the Europa League a second’s thought, to be honest. We qualified for this great competition, deservedly with our level of performance, and now we’re here we want to do well in it. We saw ourselves as a team that can get out of the group and nothing has changed.’ Liverpool players are put through their paces during the club's training session at Anfield on Monday .

Referee: Bjorn Kulpers (Holland) Coral  Bet: Liverpool to win 1-0 - 7/1 . WHAT LIVERPOOL NEED TO DO: . Only a win at Anfield on Tuesday night will do in order for the Reds to progress. That message was shared by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet. While it was not as forthright as the speech Gerrard gave 10 years ago - ‘I don’t want to be waking up in the UEFA Cup’ - Mignolet is not contemplating Liverpool capsizing at this particular hurdle. ‘We have to do the job in hand and look at ourselves,’ said Mignolet. ‘We have to be ready. Nobody is thinking about not getting through. The only thing that matters is getting the result we need.’ Do not think, however, this will be a night when Liverpool have things all their own way. Rodgers spoke at length about what the emotion and atmosphere inside the stadium will do for his players but that is not to say it will overpower their rivals. Rodgers will be hoping the talent of Raheem Sterling (left) will play a major part in Tuesday's crunch tie . Basle boss Paulo Sousa says they plan to put Liverpool under pressure in their crunch Champions League tie . Basle exposed Liverpool’s soft underbelly in October when they met and Paulo Sousa, their urbane Portuguese coach, believes the pressure that will be on Rodgers and his players can be exploited. The message he will convey is that Liverpool are vulnerable. ‘We will put them more under pressure and hopefully we can have another magical night where the performance will be outstanding and the result will be in our favour,’ said Sousa, who ruled out any idea that Basle are coming to defend. ‘I am always looking for a win. It is something we keep working on. In my leadership and feedback to the players it is always playing to win. We have a game-plan, hopefully it is the correct one.’ Basle only need a draw to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League on Tuesday night .

"A Harvard University student group plans to hold a re-enactment of a satanic ritual on the school's historic campus, drawing criticism from local Roman Catholic officials, who expressed 'deep sadness and strong opposition' to the plan. The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club said in a statement posted online that it plans to host 'a historical re-enactment of a black mass ceremony that has a narrator providing historical context and background.' It said the event was intended to be educational and would be preceded by a lecture on the history and origins of the black mass, a ritual that parodies the Catholic mass, in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed. Satanic verses: A narrator will provide historical context and background on the ritual as it happens at the Queen¿s Head Pub at Harvard¿s Memorial Hall (pictured) The re-enactment will be performed by the Satanic Temple, a Satanist group that attracted attention earlier this year after it proposed the placement of a seven-foot (2.1-meter) tall statue of Satan next to an existing Ten Commandments monument in Oklahoma. 'Our purpose is not to denigrate any religion or faith, which would be repugnant to our educational purposes, but instead to learn and experience the history of different cultural practices,' the club said. The Archdiocese of Boston has voiced sharp criticism of the planned re-enactment, calling on its faithful to pray for those involved and on Harvard to disassociate itself from the event. 'The Catholic community in the Archdiocese of Boston expresses its deep sadness and strong opposition to the plan to stage a ""black mass"" on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge,' the Archdiocese said in a statement posted on Facebook.

"Loretta Macpherson, 65, died shortly after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication . A 65-year-old cancer patient who died unexpectedly in an Oregon hospital was fed the wrong drug by a pharmacy worker, officials claim. Loretta Macpherson, 65, died shortly after she was given a paralyzing agent typically used during surgeries instead of an anti-seizure medication. It was one of several mistakes revealed on Monday that killed the mother-of-two, who had gone to the emergency room at St Charles Medical Center in Bend following brain surgery to remove a tumor. According to Michel Boileau, chief clinical officer, Mrs Macpherson had been correctly prescribed fosphenytoin to stem seizures, and the medication was successfully delivered to the hospital. However, an internal investigation showed a pharmacy worker filled the IV bag labeled 'fosphenytoin' with a paralyzing drug: rocuronium. Mrs Macpherson, from Oregon, stopped breathing and suffered cardiac arrest and brain damage on Wednesday. Macpherson came into the ER two days earlier with medication dosage questions after a recent brain surgery. Her son Mark Macpherson told News 21 his mother was taken off life support and passed away Wednesday. She was recovering after having a brain tumor removed at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle last month. 'Very speedy recovery, she was expected to make a full recovery,' her son said who explained he had move near her to help with her care. 'She was doing very well.' He said she worked as an interior designer for 25 years in Newport and before that, she worked as a clerk in Salem, where her late husband, Gordon Macpherson, had served as a state representative. Her son Mark Macpherson (right) said his mother (left) was recovering after having a brain tumor removed at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle last month . 'She was the most amazing person on the planet,' Mark McPherson said. 'There wasn't a person that she didn't get along with. Everyone loved her.' Macpherson would not confirm whether he's planning legal action against the hospital, and instead said he wanted to make sure the experience was not repeated for anyone else. Three employees involved in the error have been placed on paid leave. The organization is conducting an investigation, but doesn't yet know how the error occurred. The hospital notified the Deschutes County district attorney, who did not immediately return a call for comment. Deschutes County District Attorney Patrick Flaherty told NewsChannel 21 in an e-mail Thursday that, as in all accidental deaths, 'the law required a death investigation. 'However, I did not and am not requesting an autopsy, because there is no question about the cause of death.'

"Many women in their 70s are cleaning people's homes or local offices, or sitting behind the tills at their local supermarket (posed by model) More than 300,000 people who are aged 70 and above have a job, with many blaming the fact they are too poor to stop working, official figures revealed yesterday. The ballooning number of older workers highlights a social revolution in Britain with people forced to work at an age when many assume they would have stopped years ago. The figures, compiled exclusively for the Daily Mail by the Office for National Statistics, shows 193,000 men and 111,000 women are still working at the age of 70 and over. The National Pensioners’ Convention warns the majority are ‘ordinary, working-class people who are having to take jobs because they can’t make ends meet any other way.’ A spokesman added: ‘Anecdotally, they are not exactly doing jobs like becoming the Governor of the Bank of England.’ The ONS’s research also reveals a clear gap between the types of job that older men are doing compared to those that women are doing if they are still working in their sixties. For older men, the most common jobs are managers, directors and senior officials. For women, they tend to do more low-skilled jobs, such as being a cleaner or a secretary. It comes as a report, also published by the ONS, shatters the traditional dream of retiring at the age of 65 with a comfortable pension and dreams of foreign travel. In reality, many women in their 70s are cleaning people’s homes or the local offices, or sitting behind the tills at their local supermarket. More than a third of men and nearly a quarter of women ‘stopped working after the age of 65’, it said. While the majority work part-time, around a third of people who are still working after State pension age are ‘employed full-time’, according to the ONS. At present, a man reaches State pension age when he is 65 and a woman currently reaches State pension age at the age of 61 and six months. But both these ages are being increased. By 2020, the State pension age for both men and women will be 66, rising to 67 by 2028 – and it will keep on rising to 68 and beyond. For many pensioners, it is a positive choice. They enjoy their job, find it satisfying and are also keen to remain active in their old age. But many others are being forced into working – or even going back to work after retiring – because they simply cannot afford to stop. The self-employed make up a greater proportion of the workforce post-retirement than pre-retirement (left), while the retirement age has been steadily rising since the turn of the century . A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'Given more of us are living longer, it's important people can choose to work for longer and fund their retirement. 'That's why we made it illegal to sack someone just because they reached the age of 65.' Keith Simpson, chief executive of Skilled People, a recruitment website for people over the age of 50, said he is ‘absolutely sure’ the trend of people delaying their retirement will increase. He said: 'We asked people if they will have to work beyond the age of 65 to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Nearly 70 per cent of people said ""yes"".' It comes as just a third of private sector workers are saving into a company pension. Of those who have one, it is typically worth just £26,000, which buys an annual income of just £850. Graph showing the rise of older workers since the mid-1980s . New rules forcing bosses to pay into a pension for their workers are designed to stem the growing pensions crisis, with up to 11million workers being ‘auto-enrolled’ into a pension. But a separate report, from the insurance firm Aviva, found 37 per cent of private sector workers will opt out and refuse to save into a pension. It warned the success of the Government’s scheme 'hangs in the balance as many workers focus on making ends meet in challenging economic times'. The National Association of Pension Funds warned Britain is 'miles off course when it comes to saving enough for its old age'. Last night, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: 'We have said we expect around a third of people to opt out of automatic enrolment. 'Our ongoing advertising campaign is achieving high levels of awareness among employers and individuals of the need to put something aside so they can afford a decent quality of life in retirement.'","Many women in 70s are cleaning people's homes or offices .

"When I look at Liverpool without Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge, they badly lack pace and need Raheem Sterling. He turned 20 on Monday and it is a lot to ask for a young man to be their talisman, but he has got to live up to that. Raheem Sterling will be Liverpool's danger man in their Champions League showdown against Basle . Liverpool want him getting on the ball, dropping deep and dribbling with it, threatening through the centre off the striker. I don’t want to see him out wide that much. There are not too many Liverpool players who want to go beyond the opposition, but Sterling is their one player who can change the game in a split second. He’ll be the man Basle are most afraid of. This game has got that feel about it where they will need a hero — and he has got the ability to be that man. Sterling talks tactics with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers in training on Monday . Stopping Shkelza Gashi . In Shkelza Gashi the Swiss side have a free-scoring attacking midfield player who will be the main threat to Liverpool’s goal. He is Basle’s top scorer with 12 goals in all competitions and eight in his past eight games. If Lucas starts in front of the back four he will need to be on top of his game to keep the Albanian quiet. It is crucial that Liverpool do not concede early on in this match so they must be wary of Gashi’s danger. Shkelza Gashi (centre) will pose a threat to Liverpool's defence on Tuesday night . Let Gerrard play . If Brendan Rodgers plays Lucas in that deeper role it will also give Steven Gerrard licence to play in midfield. Not off the front man just behind the striker, but simply in midfield. Due to how well Gerrard played in front of the back four last season, he has been caught between playing there or at the top of a diamond. He needs to shed that. Why can’t Gerrard just be a midfield player? Look at Yaya Toure for Manchester City, he’s just a midfield player. He is given that freedom. That’s what Liverpool need with Gerrard, let him roam box to box. Big Champions League nights need big players and that’s what he is. Steven Gerrard leads the way during training on Monday ahead of the big game . Gerrard looks relaxed in the build-up to the Anfield clash - a decade on from his heroics against Olympiacos . Avoiding the Basle graveyard . It is impossible not to forget the humiliating night in 2011 when Basle beat Manchester United 2-1 to dump them out of the Champions League, when they only needed a draw to go through. Liverpool’s record against them is not great, either. They are yet to win and have drawn twice and lost once. Basle have played English opposition nine times and only lost once. Wayne Rooney looks dejected as Manchester United crashed to a shock defeat in Switzerland back in 2011 . Having little patience . Liverpool have to score, they must win to go through and the fact a draw is good enough for Basle means the Swiss side could sit back. They are likely to rely on hitting Liverpool on the break. That could play into Liverpool’s hands. They have the capabilities to open up their opponents, but they might need to take their time and not rush anything in order to win.

Now, following a major internal overhaul and interior design revamp, the property has been transformed back into a magnificent 4,932 sqft five-bedroom townhouse. Paris born Simone was trained by Rose Valois, the leading Paris Milliner of the 1930s to 1950s. In her twenties she had a passionate affair with medical student Serge Mirman, who she later married, and the pair eloped to London. In London Simone originally worked with renowned couturier Elsa Schiaparelli before establishing her own salon at this property, 9 Chesham Place, in 1952. Behind the retained stucco façade the house has six floors of luxurious living space . On the ground floor, Simone’s shop, has been replaced by a magnificent 14 seater dining room with parquet flooring, elegant fireplace, metallic silver wallpaper and 13 ft high ceiling with bespoke chandelier . The two ground floor rooms served as a shop, with hats and headpieces displayed all around the spaces, and also up the main staircase. The first floor main reception room served as a salon for VIP clients. On the two floors above were workrooms for a dozen ladies who created the hats from Simone’s initial sketches. Finally the top floor housed a flat for Simone and Serge, with a kitchen, dining room and staff flat on the lower ground floor. Simone’s clients included Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, Vivien Leigh, Valerie Hobson, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, Christian Dior, Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. The grand entrance hall, with its sweeping staircase that used to display Simone’s various hats and headpieces, is now a stunning showcase for luxury with marble flooring and granite-effect wallpaper . Luxury loo in its latest incarnation. For major fashion events in the first floor salon, the queue outside the ground floor bathroom would often contain notables such as Vivien Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor . The other clients – film stars, celebrities and the cream of London society – would regularly come to 9 Chesham Place for viewings and fittings. For major fashion events in the first floor salon, the queue outside the ground floor bathroom would often contain notables such as Vivien Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor. If only walls could speak, this house could write its own celebrity-laden biography. In 1980 Simone closed her salon and returned to France, later retiring in 1990 to Menton in the South of France. Now, after a major refurbishment and a new interior design scheme by Sue Fisher of Fisher ID, 9 Chesham Place exudes the luxury and quality of its heyday. Behind the retained stucco façade, designed by Thomas Cubitt in 1831, the house has six floors of luxurious living space.

"Thousands - perhaps millions - of various types of fish, some endangered, have died in the Midwest, as record summer temperatures  dry up rivers and raise water temperatures in some spots to nearly 100 degrees. About 40,000 shovelnose sturgeon were killed in Iowa last week as the water reached 97 degrees. Meanwhile, Nebraska fishery officials said they've seen thousands of dead sturgeon, catfish, carp, and other species, including the endangered pallid sturgeon, in the Lower Platte River. And Illinois biologists said the hot weather has killed tens of thousands of large - and smallmouth bass - and channel catfish, and is threatening the population of the greater redhorse fish, a state-endangered species. Thousands, perhaps millions of fish like these from a Missouri pond are dying in the Midwest as the summer heat dries up rivers and lakes . So many fish died in Illinois's Powerton Lake two weeks ago that the carcasses clogged an intake screen near a power plant.  A spokesman for the coal-fired plant said workers shut down one of its two . generators for several hours because of the low water levels at the lake, which it uses for cooling. 'We're talking hundreds of thousands (killed), maybe millions by now,'  said Dan Stephenson, a biologist with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. 'If you're only talking about game fish, it's probably in the . thousands. But for all fish, it's probably in the millions if you look . statewide.' 'It's something I've never seen in my career, and I've been here for more than 17 years,' said Mark Flammang, a biologist with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 'I think what we're mainly dealing with (is)...extremely low flows and this unparalleled heat.' Indeed, it seems the fish are victims of one of the driest and warmest summers in history. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows nearly two-thirds of the lower 48 states are experiencing some kind of drought; while the Department of Agriculture has labeled more than half of the nation's counties - nearly 1,600 in 32 states - natural disaster areas. More than 3,000 heat records were broken over the last month. Iowa officials said $10 million worth of sturgeon turned up  dead in the Des Moines River, a value partly based on their coveted eggs, used for caviar . Iowa DNR officials said the sturgeon found dead in the Des Moines River were worth nearly $10million, a value partly based on their highly sought eggs, which are used for caviar. The fish are valued at more than $110 a pound. However, Gavin Gibbons, a National Fisheries Institute spokesman, added of the sturgeon deaths that they don't appear to have reduced the supply enough to hurt regional caviar suppliers. Flammang, meanwhile, added that weekend rain improved some of Iowa's waterways and and lakes, but temperatures were on the rise once more, straining a sturgeon population that develops health problems when water temperatures climb into the 80s. 'Those fish have been in these rivers for thousands of thousands of years, and they're accustomed to all sorts of weather conditions,' Flammang said. 'But sometimes, you have conditions occur that are outside their realm of tolerance.' In Illinois, heat and lack of rain has dried up a large swath of Aux Sable Creek, the state's largest habitat for the endangered greater redhorse, a large bottom-feeding fish. Illinois biologist Stephenson said fish kills happen most summers in small private ponds and streams, but the hot weather this year has made the situation much worse. 'This year has been really, really bad - disproportionately bad, compared to our other years,' he said. About 40,000 shovelnose sturgeon were killed in Iowa last week, while Nebraska officials said thousands of fish died in the Lower Platte River . A stretch of Nebraska's Platte River has dried up, killing a 'significant number' of sturgeon, catfish, and minnows, as well as an unidentified number of endangered pallid sturgeon, said Daryl Bauer, fisheries program manager. 'It's a lot of miles of river, and a lot of fish,' Bauer said. 'Most of those fish are barely identifiable. In this heat, they decay really fast.' Bauer worries dry conditions in his state will continue, causing a repeat of a memorable stretch in the mid-2000s that weakened local fish populations. Kansas has also seen declining water levels that pulled younger game fish away from shore lines and forced them to cluster, making them easier targets for predators, said Doug Nygren, fisheries chief with the Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism. Nygren said he expects a drop in adult walleye populations in the shallower, wind-swept lakes in southern Kansas. But he said other species, such as large-mouth bass, can tolerate the heat and may multiply faster without competition from walleye. 'These last two years are the hottest we've ever seen,' Nygren said. 'That really can play a role in changing populations, shifting it in favor of some species over others. 'The walleye won't benefit from these high-water temperatures, but other species that are more tolerant may take advantage of their declining population.' Geno Adams, a fisheries program administrator in South Dakota, added that there have been reports of isolated fish kills in its man-made lakes on the Missouri River and others in the eastern part of the state. But it's unclear how much of a role the heat played in the gruesome fish deaths. One large batch of carp at Lewis and Clark Lake in South Dakota had lesions, a sign they were suffering from a bacterial infection. Adams said the fish are more prone to sickness with low water levels and extreme heat. But he added that other fish habitat have seen a record number this year, thanks to the 2011 floods. 'When we're in a drought, there's a struggle for water and it's going in all different directions,' Adams said. 'Keeping it in the reservoir for recreational fisheries is not at the top of the priority list.'","More than 3,000 heat records broken across U.S. last month .

"Australia captain Michael Clarke was forced to retire hurt because of a back injury before tea on the opening day of the first Test against India in Adelaide on Tuesday. The injury puts a question mark over his participation in the remaining three matches of the series as well as Clarke's ability to lead Australia into the 50-over World Cup early next year. The 33-year-old was only playing after coming through a fitness test on a third hamstring strain in three months, problems which are related to his long-term degenerative back injury. Michael Clarke retired hurt on the first day of Australia's first Test against India in Adelaide . The Australian captain needed treatment from the medical team after suffering an apparent back problem . Clarke left the field unbeaten on 60 runs having put on a 118-run stand with David Warner . A Cricket Australia spokeswoman said Clarke had hurt his lower back when batting at the Adelaide Oval and it was causing him 'considerable pain'. She added that he had left the ground for treatment. Clarke had made 60 not out when he twisted to avoid a short ball from Ishant Sharma. He tried to stretch out the injury with medical staff but trudged off minutes later with Australia on 206 for two. They ended the day on 354 for six. Australia's captain had appeared in full control against India's bowlers and his retirement subdued the crowd of over 20,000. Clarke has missed just one of his country's 40 Tests since he assumed the captaincy in 2011 but may come in for some flak for putting sentiment ahead of team interests by playing in Adelaide. Clarke struggled with back and hamstring problems in the months leading up to the Test series . The Australian captain was looking set and batted his team into a strong position on day one . Clarke has spent much of the last two weeks leading the nation in mourning for his friend and former team mate Phillip Hughes, who died after being struck on the back of the head by the ball in a domestic match. The man who bowled that delivery, Sean Abbott, made his return to cricket for New South Wales against Queensland, taking two wickets. Hughes's memory was being honoured throughout the match at the Adelaide Oval, where the left-handed batsman played his state cricket for South Australia for the last couple of years. Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said last month that Clarke risked breaking down with another hamstring strain on his first run-out after his return from injury regardless of how long he was rested.","Michael Clarke was forced off the field at the Adelaide Oval .

"Remedy: A glass of low-fat or fat-free milk every day could dramatically lower osteoarthritis in women's knees . A glass of milk a day could help stop women's knees from creaking, claim researchers. A new US study found women who frequently drink fat-free or low-fat milk may have less osteoarthritis in the knee. But eating cheese increased the problem in women. Drinking milk made little difference in men, and eating yogurt did not affect progression in men or women. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain and swelling of joints in the hand, hips, or knee. Lead author Dr Bing Lu, from Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, said 'Milk consumption plays an important role in bone health. 'Our study is the largest study to investigate the impact of dairy intake in the progression of knee OA.' More than six million people in the UK have osteoarthritis in one or both knees including a fifth of people in their 50s and half of people aged over 80, according to the charity Arthritis Research UK. Osteoarthritis, the most common form of the join disease, is more common in women than in men and more than one million adults per year consult their GP due to the disease. When doctors assess the severity of osteoarthritis, they use imaging studies to quantify joint damage by measuring the space that exists between the bones of a joint. Narrowing joint space indicates cartilage loss and worsening osteoarthritis. At the start of the study dietary data was collected and joint space width was measured using X-rays, says a report in the journal Arthritis Care & Research. Ladies only: The study found men do not enjoy the same benefits as women do from a glass of milk . A total of 888 men and 1,260 women with knee arthritis took part who had follow-up checks up to four years later. As the intake of milk increased per 8-ounce glass, the amount of joint damage in women fell. Although all the women experienced some narrowing of joint space, it was least evident in women drinking more milk. When women went from drinking no milk, to less than 3 glasses, from four to six glasses, and more than seven glasses per week, the joint space width in women decreased by 0.38mm, 0.29mm, 0.29mm and 0.26mm respectively. There was a slight worsening of the condition among women eating cheese every day. Yoghurt: The study at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston found yoghurt has no effect for either sex . Results persisted even after allowing for disease severity, body mass index (BMI) and dietary factors. Milk consumption improved knee joint health in men only at high intakes. 'Our findings indicate that women who frequently drink milk may reduce the progression of OA' said Dr Lu. 'Further study of milk intake and delay in OA progression are needed.' He said it was unclear why milk helped women, it may be due to boosting calcium levels as women often have low intakes or as part of a healthy diet it could help combat obesity. Drs Shivani Sahni and Robert McLean, from Harvard-affiliated Hebrew SeniorLife Institute for Aging Research, in a commentary said it was the 'first evidence' that increasing milk consumption may slow the progression of the condition.","Daily low-fat milk lowers osteoarthritis in women's knees, study found .

"Michael Johns with his widow Stacey Vuduris in March last year . The best friend of American Idol contestant Michael Johns, who died in August, has claimed that the singer's widow covered up that he was killed by alcohol abuse. Torrey Gambill and Johns' widow Stacey Vuduris have been involved in a bitter dispute, both filing legal documents against each other. In the documents, obtained by TMZ, Ms Vuduris claimed that Mr Gambill had been sending her abusive text messages and blaming her for her husband's death. But in documents of his own, Mr Gambill said Ms Vuduris lied about the Idol star's death after he was found in his apartment in Orange County, California. Johns died on August 1, aged 35, reportedly from a blood clot which had developed from a sprained ankle, though the autopsy came back inconclusive, pending toxicology results. It was known that Australian-born Johns had been drinking heavily before his death, though it is not certain how soon before. In the legal documents filed by Mr Gambill, texts are quoted from Ms Vuduris saying: 'I'd rather it be said he died at home if that's ok with u .. he would want that,' and 'I rather that then ""alcoholic"" stuff ... his good friends would never say anything ... so I don't think that will come out. At least blood clot sounds sudden.' [sic] . He also claimed that the couple were separated when Johns died, that Ms Vuduris may have had a boyfriend and that she had been the cause of his friend having a very difficult year. According to TMZ, the feuding pair managed to settle their dispute without a judge's order. Scroll down for video . Michael Johns died from alcohol abuse, not a blood clot, his best friend Torrey Gambill has claimed . The American Idol star (centre) died in August, and Mr Gambill claims Ms Vuduris (left) covered up the cause . Johns finished eighth in the seventh season of American Idol in 2008, and got to rehearse with Dolly Parton . Shortly before his death, Johns had sprained his ankle and it swelled to his knee. He sought medical attention the day before he died, though it is not known whether he was taking pain relief for the injury. He reportedly died in his sleep and was in full cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived on the scene, and could not be revived. He was said to be in huge amounts of pain from the injury in the lead up to his death. Johns was born and brought up in Australia, before moving to America when he was 18 after he met and received advice from his idol - You Am I frontman Tim Rogers. Simon Cowell was one of many who took to Twitter to show his sadness at Johns' passing . A post from Johns' brother, Alan Burke, after discovering the news of his death last month . His family, who live in Perth, spoke of their devastation but said that they had been supported by the love of his fans around the world. In a statement, they said, 'Our family is devastated by the passing of our beloved Michael, a wonderful husband, son, brother, uncle, and friend. 'We appreciate the outpouring of love and support we have received from all corners of the globe. Please keep Michael in your thoughts and respect our need to grieve privately in this difficult time.' Johns met Ms Vuduris in 2003 and married her in 2007, before competing in the seventh season of American Idol in 2008. During the show his supporters called themselves 'The Aussie Posse'. He finished eighth in the show, during which he got to rehearse with Dolly Parton, and went on to release an album which sold 20,000 copies. He planned to release a new album, titled 'Reckless', later this year.","Australian-born Michael Johns died in California on August 1, aged just 35 .

"Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has raised eyebrows by claiming that Angel Di Maria is city rival Real's best player, above the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. Simeone watched from the sidelines as his Atletico side held their Madrid rivals to a 1-1 draw in the Spanish Super Cup first leg on Tuesday night. Di Maria's late introduction from the bench changed the game, with the Argentina winger - a target for Manchester United - setting up an the opening goal for James Rodriguez. Atletico levelled the tie through Raul Garcia with just two minutes remaining. VIDEO Scroll down for Angel di Maria chips Fabio Coentrao in Real Madrid training . Up for grabs? Angel Di Maria is wanted by Manchester United with his Real Madrid future uncertain . Dream team: Di Maria celebrates with James Rodriguez (left) after setting up the Colombian's first goal for Real . VIDEO Di Maria Real's best player - Simeone . Stats for 2013-14 season (club only) Angel Di Maria . Games 46 Goals 8 Assists 22 . Cristiano Ronaldo . Games 41 Goals 48 Assists 11 . Gareth Bale . Games 39 Goals 21 Assists 16 . James Rodriguez . Games 34 Goals 9 Assists 12 . Simeone hailed Di Maria's impact after the game and insisted it did not surprise him that his compatriot was so effective. 'The game changed with Di Maria,' Simeone said. 'It's logical - he's the best player they have.' When pressed whether Di Maria deserved to be singled out above Real's so-called galacticos - Ronaldo, Bale and Rodriguez chief among them - Simeone insisted: 'He's the player most likely to create openings in the opposition half.' It seems the Atletico manager has a point, as his fellow Argentine - while well behind Ronaldo and Bale in terms of goals scored - created the most last season, 22, compared with 11 made by the Portuguese and 16 by the Welshman. Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti would seem to disagree with his Simeone, however, having started the game with Di Maria on the bench. High praise: Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone (right) said Di Maria is Real's star player . That hurts: Cristiano Ronaldo might have something to say about Simeone's claim over Di Maria . But Louis van Gaal is desperate to add Di Maria to his paper-thin squad at Old Trafford following United's opening-day Premier League defeat at home against Swansea. United are prepared to commit as much as £100million to their pursuit of Di Maria. Van Gaal needs world-class additions and has told executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to do all he can to bring the 26-year-old winger to the club. It is understood United have told Di Maria that, with performance-based incentives, they will pay him around £200,000 a week. Over a five-year deal that would take the club's investment to £100m when a transfer fee of around £50m is included.","Real Madrid and rivals Atletico drew 1-1 in Spanish Super Cup first leg .

"Charla Nash, the woman who underwent a face transplant after she was mauled by her friend's chimpanzee, has revealed in a newly-released video that she feels like she is locked in a cage. She appeared in the footage in a last-ditch appeal to legislators to sue the state for $150 million, saying the attack that robbed her of her hands, her sight and much of her face has left her life forever changed. 'It’s . a different world to not be able to see again or to use your hands and . just do things for yourself. That you have to depend on other people for . help now, it’s very hard,' Nash said. 'I feel like I’m locked up. I feel like I’m in a cage.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Prison: Charla Nash has appeared in a seven-minute video that will be shown to Connecticut lawmakers as she attempts to sue the state for a chimpanzee attack that left her needing a face transplant . Difficult: Nash lost both of her hands in the attack, as well as her eyes and much of her face . The . nearly seven-minute video will be sent to members of the General . Assembly’s Judiciary Committee. She says the state had the authority and . obligation to seize the dangerous animal. The . state generally is immune to lawsuits, unless allowed by the claims . commissioner. The legislative panel is scheduled to meet Friday to hear . testimony on a bill that would override the June decision by State . Claims Commissioner J. Paul Vance Jr., who dismissed Nash’s request for . permission to sue the state government. Nash also may appear in person . at Friday’s hearing. 'I’m hoping that the legislation will allow me to have my day in court, that I will be able to have a judge listen to the evidence that is brought before him about the vicious attack on me and that it shall not happen to any other person again,' Nash says on the video. Difficult: In her video, Nash demonstrates how basic tasks - like getting around - are hard because she is now blind from the attack . Final plea: Nash is pleading with lawmakers to give her the chance to bring her case before a judge . In her room at a Massachusetts . convalescent center, where she is awaiting a second attempt at a hand . transplant, Nash describes the difficulties she has endured over the . past five years. The 60-year-old single mother was blinded, lost both hands and underwent a face transplant following the attack in Stamford. Nash went to the home of the chimp’s owner, Sandra Herold, on Feb. 16, 2009, to help her friend and employer lure the 200-pound animal, known as Travis, back inside. But the chimpanzee went berserk and ripped off Nash’s nose, lips, eyelids and hands before being shot to death by a police officer. Nash reached a $4 million settlement in 2012 with the estate of Herold, who died in 2010. Nash’s attorneys say that will only cover a small portion of her medical costs. Violent: Nash, pictured before the attack (right), was attacked by her friend's chimp Travis (left) in 2009 . Injuries: She was left with a thumb on one hand and lost the other hand between her wrist and elbow . Denied: Connecticut Claims Commissioner Paul Vance denied Nash the permission to sue the state of Connecticut . It is unusual for state lawmakers to . overturn denials issued by the state claims commissioner, but Nash hopes . her appeal will resonate. 'It’s . a shame that this attack had to happen, unfortunately,' she said. 'But . now I’m trying to work the best I can to have my sanity. I want to be as . normal as I can be.' In . an appeal of Vance’s decision, Nash’s lawyers in July claimed the state . law that was in place at the time of Nash’s attack prohibited the . ownership of primates weighing more than 50 pounds without a permit. The . state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection had the . 'unequivocal authority to seize an animal whose existence threatened . public health and safety,' Nash’s attorneys wrote. Because the chimp was . owned illegally by Herold the lawyers contend the state was obligated . to seize it. Life changing: An illustration, left, shows how Nash's face was damaged in the attack - she lost her eyes, nose and lips. But the transplant, right, gave her back these features . Intense: A team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, residents and other clinical staff are pictured at work during the 20 hour procedure at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston . After the transplant: She underwent a face transplant in 2011, pictured, and was given glass eyes . Months . before the attack, a state biologist warned state officials in a memo . that the chimpanzee could seriously hurt someone if it felt threatened, . saying 'it is an accident waiting to happen.' Vance . concluded that no law at the time of the attack prevented Herold from . owning the chimpanzee. He added: 'If there was a failure by the DEP (now . referred to as DEEP) to seize the animal … the duty owed was to the . general public and does not create a statutory obligation to ensure the . safety of a private individual.' State Attorney General George Jepsen has said state law on the issue was ambiguous and difficult to enforce. In . the video distributed to state legislators, Nash is seen attempting to . navigate down a hallway of the nursing home, feeling her way along the . wall. 'I really miss . seeing a whole lot,' she said. 'I think there’d be so much more I could . be doing handicapped if I could see what I was doing. I think I could . figure out how I could use a foot or a toe to do something. Not being . able to see makes it a lot harder.'","Charla Nash lost her eyes, nose, mouth and hands when she was attacked by a friend's chimpanzee in Connecticut in 2009 .

"Switzerland progressed to the last 16 of the World Cup with an impressive 3-0 victory over Honduras courtesy of an exquisite hat-trick from Xhedran Shaqiri. The Bayern Munich playmaker fired home a brilliant curling opener to set Ottmar Hitzfeld's side on their way before adding to his tally on the half-hour mark following a neat one-two with Josip Drmic. Shaqiri completed the hat-trick by slotting home Drmic's square ball with twenty minutes to go. Switzerland will now face Lionel Messi's Argentina in the next round. Click here to read the match report . Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant World Cup Match Zone . Honduras: TBA . Switzerland: TBA . Host commentator . Switzerland are through to the last 16... and will face Lionel Messi's Argentina! Following Ecuador's goalless draw with France, the Swiss progress to the next round on six points with the South Americans finishing third on four points. Honduras finish the tournament without a single point to their name. That game will forever be remembered for Shaqiri's three goals - what a player! Hat-trick hero Shaqiri is replaced by former Bolton Wanderers midfielder Blerim Dzemaili. What a sublime performance from the Swiss playmaker. I can see why Liverpool like Shaqiri. His reading of the game is brilliant and he can obviously finish, too. Might have added a bit to his price tag, though. Switzerland's deadly duo of Drmic and Shaqiri celebrate . Switzerland: Michael Lang comes on for Granit Xhaka . Honduras: Oscar Garcia is replaced by Andy Najar . Josip Drmic - who looks a real handful and will join Bayer Leverkusen this summer despite reported interest from Arsenal - is replaced by Haris Seferovic. Shaqiri grabs his hat-trick and Switzerland are out of sight! Super play by the Swiss - Josip Drmic totally exploited the space afforded to him on the left and charged forward before beating his man and laying the ball off to Shaqiri who stroked the ball into the net. Jerry Palacios picks up the first booking of the evening - obviously his younger brother Wilson takes after him. Jerry Palacios is bundled over in the box by Djourou but referee Nestor Pitana waves play on. A definite penalty and the Hondurans are right to feel aggrieved. Exactly play by Rodriguez as he covers for the keeper and nips the ball off the line after Bengtson had rounded Diego Benaglio in the Swiss net. Honduras frontman Bengtson raced into the box and looked likely to get on the end of a teasing ball but bizarrely attempted to score with his head despite the fact the ball was barely off the ground! Had he stayed on his feet the New England Revolution forward would have surely found the back of the net. ...and Honduras make their second change of the evening as Roger Espinoza is replaced by Marvin Chavez. Switzerland lead Honduras at the interval and it's fair to say that first-half was very much the 'Shaqiri Show'. Here's some brilliant snaps of Shaqiri's opener... So, Switzerland lead 2-0 and it's fair to say the first-half has very much been the 'Shaqiri Show'. Here's some brilliant snaps of the playmaker scoring his opener... Costly, Honduras' fourth all-time top goalscorer, has looked in some discomfort for a while now and has been forced off through injury. Jerry Palacios, Wilson's older brother, comes on in Costly's place to earn his 25th cap. Sportsmail reported last week that Liverpool were interested in Shaqiri after losing interest in Southampton's Adam Lallana. Click the above link for the full story. Brilliant again from Shaqiri. And once again I'm not convinced by Victor Bernardez's defending there. Looking good for Switzerland so far. This could be a hammering unless Honduras find a way of holding possession. Shaqiri doubles his own tally to extend Switzerland's lead. Great movement by the playmaker as he latched on to Josip Drmic's through ball and found himself one-on-one with Valladares. The Bayern Munich man then kept a cool head to slot the ball into the corner of the net. So good. Really well-worked goal. Made it look easy. Switzerland have been slightly under-rated during this summer's tournament. As well the experience and know-how of Hitzfeld, the Swiss have an abundance of talent among their ranks. Shaqiri, Gokhan Inler, Stephane Lichtsteiner, Valon Behrami, Ricardo Rodriguez, Granit Xhaka... a host of stars used to playing for top clubs in Europe's main leagues. The ball falls to Brayan Beckeles in the area after Granit Xhaka failed to properly head clear a free-kick but the Honduras full-back can only volley wide on the turn. After six years in charge of Switzerland, Ottmar Hitzfeld is set to retire following the World Cup. The German has won 19 club trophies during spells with Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Grasshoppers and Aarau. Let's hope the Swiss progress so that Hitzfeld can go out on a high. The last time these sides met it was 0-0. Typical of this World Cup, this game has already given us more. Belter of a goal. What a stunning strike from Xhedran Shaqiri. The Bayern Munich midfielder sends a curling effort into the top right hand corner to give the Swiss the lead. Must be said, however, Noel Valladares should have perhaps done better - didn't even dive; just made a lackluster jump for it and watched it sail in. Huge early chance for Switzerland. Mehmedi broke down the left after a weak challenge from Wilson Palacios - what a poor World Cup he's had - and Drmic shoots straight at Valladares. Maynor Figueroa, Roger Espinoza and Wilson Palacios - who all played for Wigan, amongst others, in the Premier Leag - will be looking to guide Honduras to their first-ever Wrld Cup victory. Meanwhile former Arsenal defender Johan Djourou starts at the back for Switzerland while ex-West Ham man Valon Behrami plays in midfield. The Swiss, usually so sound at the back having conceded just six goals in qualification, conceded five against France in their last matc as they lost 5-2. However, having claimed a dramatic late win in their first World Cup game against Ecuador, the Swiss can go through with a draw providing the South Americans lose to the French. This will be the second ever meeting between these sides. The previous match played out involving these teams came in the 2010 FIFA World Cup; it ended 0-0 and it was also the last group game for both sides. Honduras have never won against European opposition at a World Cup (D3 L3). Honduras have failed to score in their last 4 games against European team at World Cup. Switzerland have never lost against a CONCACAF team at World Cup (W1 D2). ................................................................................................................................

Valladares, Figueroa, Bernardez, J Garcia, W Palacios, Bengtson, Costly, B Garcia, Espinoza, Claros, Beckeles. Both sides still have a chance of progressing to the last 16.

"A fault on the new A380 superjumbo which caused the grounding of every one of the jets has been blamed on British engineering. Airbus has now traced the cause of small cracks developing on the wings of some of the £250million double-decker A380s to a small component engineered in its design centre in Filton, Bristol, it is understood. The manufacturer has been forced to order a global reacall fix for the offending aluminium brackets which hold the wing’s skin to the structure. It will affect the entire fleet of 69 planes currently flying. Discovery: Qantas discovered the wing cracks in the A380 after the compnay ordered a complete aircraft inspection following an engine blowout . The Airbus A380 is a superjumbo that took its first flight on April 2005. There are a total of 115 A380s in operation as of November 2013. It is a double decker jet with a wingspan of 79.75 metres . The news is a major blow to British . industry. The wings are the only part of the cutting-edge A380e which . are built in the UK. Airbus employs 9,500 people in its Filton . design centre and manufacting complex in Broughton, Wales. The wings are then taken by sea to be assembled in Toulouse from parts built across Europe. It is feared the issue could cost Airbus more than £80million in compensation. A senior industry expert told The . Times: ‘The issue is around the type of aluminum being used and the . fitting which, as a result of the assembly, creates the crack’, with a . source close to the problem adding, ‘It is a design and process . engineering failure’. The minor cracks - no more than two . centimetres long - were discovered after Qantas ordered a fleet-wide . inspection following the explosion of a Rolls-Royce engine during a . flight, last year. Airbus has insisted there is no threat . to safety posed by the flaw and safety agencies on both sides of the . Atlantic have given the planes the all clear to continue flights. But Airbus is bringing in the aircraft . for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of . hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem. Scrutiny: Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under fire again, after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine and return a flight to Singapore yesterday . First class travel: Inside the A380's first class cabins. It is the latest safety incident to hit the world's biggest passenger plane, which cost a staggering £250million each . Stretching out: There are just fourteen berths in the first class section of each A380. The plane can seat up to 853 passengers . * If all seats are in economy class configuration . An Airbus spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are not commenting on individual sites and areas. 'Everyone in the company is absolutely focussed on resolving the issue. 'We are all one Airbus and the issue involves many parts of our global organisation. 'The issue is related to the material being used combined with the way parts are assembled on that specific area of the aircraft.' The A380 made by Airbus, a unit of . European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.,was hailed as the next . generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry. It was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before. Industry experts say it is not unusual . for new planes to develop unforeseen faults in the first few years of . flight. These are normally quickly identified and ironed out. The A380 aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern. The planes have been in service for five years. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide. British Airways is due to take . delivery of 12 A380s next year, while the first of Virgin’s eight . superjumbos will arrive in 2015. Singapore Airlines, one of the . carriers that operates A380s in and out of Heathrow airport, was the . first airline to take delivery of a superjumbo, with the debut passenger . flight taking place in October 2007. Superjumbo services to Heathrow began in March 2008, with Manchester airport services starting in September 2010.","All 69 A380s in service require overhaul to wings to fix faulty part .

"The FBI has alerted businesses to destructive cyber attacks, after Sony . Pictures was hacked last week allowing Brad Pitt's film Fury to be illegally downloaded 1.5 million times. Four unreleased films have also been made available on the internet since the attack on Monday, including a remake of 1982 musical Annie and Mr Turner, a biopic about the eccentric British painter. A group calling themselves Guardians of Peace froze Sony Pictures' computer systems worldwide, posting a message that warned it would release 'top secrets' unless its 'request be met'. Scroll down for videos . Brad Pitt's new movie Second World War drama Fury has been illegally downloaded 1.5 million times . By last night, the hotly anticipated Annie, starring Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx, had been illegally download 220,000 times, according to Excipio, an IT forensics firm that tracks breaches of copyright. Mr Turner had been downloaded 74,000 times, Still Alice - a drama, starring Julianne Moore, about a psychologist who is found to have Alzheimer's disease - was downloaded 118,00 times and To Write Love on Her Arms had been downloaded 24,000 time. Second World War drama Fury, starring Pitt alongside Shia LaBeouf, is currently showing at cinemas but it has not yet been released on DVD. Without naming any affected companies, the FBI on Monday warned businesses about the threat of an extremely dangerous new malware. Sony Pictures Entertainment is investigating to determine if hackers from North Korea were responsible for breaking into their server and shutting their computer system down . It was the fifth most downloaded on the popular BitTorrent file-sharing platform last week, according to TorrentFreak news website, and the tenth most popular film on the Pirate Bay file-sharing website. According to website Re/code, Sony and security consultants were investigating the possibility that someone acting on behalf of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible for the hacking attack. The hotly-anticipated Annie remake backed by Jay Z has been released online after a 'cyber attack' The hack came just under a month before Sony Pictures was due to release The Interview, which is a comedy about two journalists, played by Seth Rogen and James Franco, who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in June. Re/code said a link to North Korea had not been confirmed but it had not been ruled out. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Sony Pictures was investigating every possibility, adding no link to North Korea has been uncovered. But North Korea has refused to deny involvement in a cyber attack. When asked if the country was involved in the cyber attack a spokesman for the North Korean government would only reply: 'Wait and see.' 'I personally don't care if (the movie's) disrespectful to Kim because he's evil. But that's not the intent,' Rogen posted on Twitter on Sunday. 'North Korea has produced tons of propaganda films that portray America's destruction.' The FBI's five-page, confidential 'flash' warning issued to . businesses late on Monday provided some technical details about . the malicious software that was used in the attack, though it . did not name the victim. An FBI spokesman declined comment when asked if the software . had been used against the California-based unit of Sony Corp. The FBI occasionally issues 'flash' warnings to provide . businesses with details about emerging cyber threats to help . them defend against new types of attacks. It does not name the . victims of those attacks in those reports. The FBI did, however, confirm to the Associated Press that they are investigating an attack - though not specifically the type outlined in the flash warning - that was made on Sony and caused major internal computer problems at its film studio last week. Sony's corporate email and other internal systems were knocked offline, according to reports by Variety and other trade publications. The Interview stars James Franco (left) as a host of a tabloid television show and Seth Rogan (right) as the show's producer. They are given a rare interview with the North Korea dictator but the CIA tries to turn them into killers . Sony workers reportedly saw a message appear on their computer screens that said 'Hacked by (hash)GOP,' which may be the initials of a group calling itself Guardians of Peace. According to one insider who spoke to industry website, TheWrap, 'Every PC in the company is useless and all of the content files have either been stolen or destroyed or locked away.' No demands have been issued by the hackers but a Reddit thread outlined the data allegedly mined by the Guardians of Peace. This includes A-list actors' passports, their bank details, salaries for film appearances, their password information and also email correspondences. According to the Reddit thread, the actors who have had their data compromised included Jonah Hill, Cameron Diaz and Angelina Jolie. California-based Sony Pictures said in a statement Monday that it is continuing 'to work through issues related to what was clearly a cyber attack last week'. The company has restored a number of important services to ensure ongoing business continuity and is working closely with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter.' Along with the FBI, Sony has brought in forensic experts from the Mandiant division of FireEye, a Silicon Valley cybersecurity company, according to a source familiar with the case who did not want to be named because the companies have not yet announced the arrangement. It is rumored that Sony has a hunch the hermit kingdom had a hand in hacking into their system a month before the release of The Interview, which North Korea has denounced as an act of war . Mandiant helps companies determine the extent of breaches and repair damages. The firm has worked on other high-profile computer breaches, including the one at Target last year. Monday's FBI report said that the malware overrides data on hard . drives of computers which can make them inoperable and shut down . networks. It is extremely difficult and costly, if not impossible, to . recover hard drives that have been attacked with the malware, . according to the report, which was distributed to security . professionals at U.S. companies.","The FBI is investigating the cyber attack on Sony Pictures last week .

"She has wowed audiences with her high-energy dance routines and incredibly toned physique. And now X Factor finalist Fleur East has revealed to Femail the secrets behind her incredible body - gallons of coconut water and lots of bottom exercises. 'I’m such a gym freak,' confesses the 26-year-old Londoner, speaking  from the contestants' house. 'I’m usually in the gym five days a week.' Scroll down for video . On Saturday night, the X Factor front-runner received rave reviews from the judges and subsequently on social media for her high-octane performance of Uptown Funk . On Saturday night Fleur looked super-toned in a red PVC dress (left) singing a Christmas song, followed by tiny hotpants and a black crop top (right) for her stand-out performance of Uptown Funk . No wonder she managed to strut her stuff on the ITV show on Saturday night wearing a red PVC dress followed by tiny hotpants and a black crop top without a wobble in sight. With a gruelling rehearsal schedule, Fleur admits that gym time has fallen by the wayside  but says, 'I've been eating a lot healthier to compensate'. So what goes into her body to help her look so good? 'I've been hyper-conscious about staying away from rubbish. I don’t eat white bread, white rice or cereal unless it’s porridge.' But the finalist, who makes herself beans and eggs on toast for breakfast every morning, says crazy dieting isn't her style. 'I would never totally deny myself any specific type of food.' 'I also love coconut water,' Fleur says. 'I have it all through the day – it's so hydrating and even better than water.' The moment Fleur discovered the public had voted her through on Saturday . Feeling emotional with fellow contestants Ben Haenow (centre) and Andrea Faustini (right) She adds: 'Every morning I take a dose of Baroca too, which gives me an energy boost and is full of vitamin C.' Fleur's usual workout involves lots of exercise classes and running. 'I do body conditioning, spinning and yoga,' she says. 'On the treadmill I’ll do intervals of running flat and then on incline. I'll do that for an hour. 'I find the running is amazing for my abs.' And what about that very toned derriere? 'I do loads of squats with weights,' she says. 'It's great for your bum and legs.' On Saturday night, the X Factor front-runner received rave reviews from the judges and subsequently on social media for her high-octane performance of Uptown Funk, a track from Mark Ronson's upcoming album, and admits she felt something special in the studio. 'It was incredible – I never expected this kind of reaction,' she admits. 'It's the first time I’ve ever felt anything like that from the audience. As soon as I stepped up there, the roar in that room – wow. I kept telling myself just enjoy it.' 'For my Tina Turner performance  I was originally wearing a massive hat (pictured left during rehearsals), but Simon took one look and said, ""Hmmm, I don’t like that hat"", so I lost it'. Pictured right during the live shows . But Fleur says: 'I’m not going to lie. Initially when Simon suggested changing the song, I thought, ""This is a huge risk"". Simon suggested I take five minutes to think about it and call him back. 'I was standing on the street outside the rehearsal and I was waiting for a sign. Then suddenly from nowhere I heard this funk song playing - and I thought I have to go for it. 'When I went back into the rehearsal room and told the music team I was going for it, they all cheered. I only had Friday afternoon to learn the dance routine but I decided not to stress and enjoy it.' The decision paid off as Fleur sailed straight through to the finals on Sunday's results show. The black and gold gettup was also her favourite outfit of the competition. 'I was comfortable and I thought it was sexy but classy - and I loved the gold jacket and gold jewellery.' Fleur describes her  style as 'street chic' and loves gold jewellery (left) and patterned leggings (right) Over the past eight weeks, the finalist has appeared on stage in shiny bodycon dresses, leather catsuits, eeny weeny shorts and mega heels - but says she's lapped up every minute of playing dress-up. Even Simon has got involved in the style stakes. 'For my Tina Turner performance two weeks ago I was originally  wearing a massive hat. But Simon took one look and said, ""Hmmm, I don’t like that hat"", so I lost it. 'One thing Simon always comments on is my hair. Whenever I wear it natural, he always says, ""I like your hair like that, you should always wear like that"".' But behind the scenes there's a man even more influential than Simon in Fleur's life - her French fashion designer boyfriend Marcel Robin, who has previously dressed the likes of Rita Ora and Chris Brown. 'He knows me best,' Fleur says. 'He knows what I’m comfortable with and gives me great advice. Sometimes he’ll send me an image of something he likes and I’ll try to put together something similar. 'He also helped me plan my audition outfit. He said, ""You need to stand out"" and found this colourful jacket for me online. And it worked. The judges first comments were, ""Wow - do you always dress like that?""' Fleur has turned heads in the style stakes, showing she can do casual (left) and super glamorous (right) So does she? 'No way! When I'm off stage, I’ll mix high fashion and normal high street for a ""street chic"" look.

"With its tax breaks for the super-wealthy, its Mediterranean climate and beautiful sea views, Monaco has long boasted the world’s most exclusive property market. But a new study has found the gap between house prices in prime London and Monaco is closing. For decades, Monte Carlo has attracted the world’s rich and famous including Sir Roger Moore, Dame Shirley Bassey and Sir Philip Green. Scroll down for video . England’s capital appears to be creeping up on the principality after house prices rocketed in the last three years: Knightsbridge (above) Yet, England’s capital appears to be creeping up on the principality after house prices rocketed in the last three years. A report by Pastor Real Estate found said ‘prime London residential property values will soon be on a par with Monaco’, as both cities compete to attract the world’s rich and famous. In Fontvieille, Monaco’s most expensive address, the average apartment is now £3.43million, while Knightsbridge is not far behind at £3.27million. In Fontvieille (above), Monaco’s most expensive address, the average apartment is now £3.43million . A Knightsbridge mews house, where property is already out-performing Monaco . 75 per cent of Knightsbridge (above), Belgravia and Mayfair is bought up by foreign buyers . And the lettings markets in West London’s Knightsbridge is already out-performing Monaco, costing £65 per square foot compared to £61 per square foot in Monaco, according to figures compiled by Dataloft. It was a very different picture three years ago, as Britain struggled to recover from the economic crisis. Between 2006 and 2011, the gap between the two markets widened as Monaco was cushioned from the worst effects of the global financial meltdown. By 2011, Monaco (above) was 64 per cent more expensive than prime central London, costing £2,392 per square foot compared to £1,463 per square foot. By 2011, Monaco was 64 per cent more expensive than prime central London, costing £2,392 per square foot compared to £1,463 per square foot. But between 2011 and 2013, the gap between the two property markets closed to 30 per cent. While prices in London’s exclusive boroughs shot up by 28 per cent in two years to £1,875 per square foot, prices in Monaco’s rose 1.6 per cent to £2,430 per square foot. Somerset Maugham called Monaco 'a sunny place for shady people' but it has already attracted the wealthy. Pictured is Old town with Prince's Palace and cathedral, Fontvieille marina . Experts now predict it will not be long before house prices are ‘neck and neck’. Susan Cohen, Director at Pastor Real Estate, which commissioned the research, said: ‘Both markets are characterised by global demand and constrained supply, both have economies based on finance, tourism and commerce, and both rival each other for the role of Europe’s most valuable and sought after luxury property destination.’ Both Prime Central London and Monaco have exceptionally high levels of overseas buyers – over 80 per cent for Monaco compared with 75 per cent for Knightsbridge, Belgravia and Mayfair, which drives up prices. Alex Lawrie, of property PR company Lawrie Cornish, said: ‘Since 2011 the London market has been resurgent with a huge influx of global investment into the capital over the last three years. ‘In contrast, Monaco has continued the pattern of stability and the gap overall has closed. In the ultra prime market London has drawn level with Monaco.’","In Fontvieille, Monaco’s most expensive address, the average apartment is now £3.43million .

"Sony Pictures' embarrassment over leaked details of its business deepened today as hackers released the aliases used by its stars to travel incognito. The latest cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services. Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Ice Cube and Jessica Alba will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so-called Guardians Of Peace hacker group. Scroll down for video . Contact details: The secret aliases and contact details of Hollywood stars - including, from left, Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman and Brad Pitt - are among the latest documents stolen by hackers from Sony Pictures . The new leaks also reportedly include contact details, including phone numbers, for the likes of Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks, as well as film budgets, scripts, details of legal claims and private employee information. The latest batch of leaked files includes a folder containing 'publicity bibles' for many recent Sony Pictures releases which include phone numbers and email addresses for cast and crew on film sets, Fusion reports. They reveal that Tom Hanks sometimes travels under the pseudonyms 'Harry Lauder' or 'Johnny Madrid'; Tobey Maguire goes as 'Neil Deep'; while Jessica Alba adopts the rapper-esque name 'Cash Money'. The St. Regis Bangkok is a glittery five-star luxury hotel in the Thai city's richest shopping district. Authorities say they have traced the attack to the hotel's internet network . The St. Regis has rooms that start at $250 a night and go up to $10,600 for the penthouse suite, which comes with its own butler . We have already given our clear demand to the management team of SONY, however, they have refused to accept. It seems that you think everything will be well, if you find out the attacker, while no reacting to our demand. We are sending you our warning again. Do carry out our demand if you want to escape us. And, Stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the War! You, SONY & FBI, cannot find us. We are perfect as much. The destiny of SONY is totally up to the wise reaction & measure of SONY. North Korean officials have denied accusations they are behind the hacking raid on Sony Pictures, despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to the attack. But they called it a 'righteous deed'. A theory has been that North Korean hackers targeted the film company out of anger at the release of The Interview, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen as TV reporters hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code-sharing site GitHub Gist demanded Sony 'stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war!' Bloomberg News reports that investigators have traced the attack last weekend back to the St. Regis Bangkok hotel, a five-star resort in Thailand's capital. Authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel, simply used the wifi in the lobby, or routed the traffic through the hotel. The luxury resort has rooms starting at $250 per night, going up to the penthouse suite, which features a private pool and a personal butler for $10,600 a night. The attack on Sony Pictures may have been the result of the studio producing 'The Interview,' which is a comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . North Korea has already reacted angrily to 'The Interview,' which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen . The St. Regis Bangkok is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, a Connecticut-based company that also owns Westin, Sheraton and the W hotel chains. The St. Regis, a glittering high-rise hotel, is located on Rajadmari Road in a section of Bangkok known for its high-end boutiques for the likes of Bulgari and Valentino. Sources tell Bloomberg that forensic evidence indicates that the Sony attack was carried out by the same hackers who pulled off the DarkSeoul cyber assault of South Korean banks and media companies in 2013. The DarkSeoul hackers were linked to North Korea, which employs at least 5,900 hackers - many of whom operate outside the country, where electricity is unreliable and internet access is scarce. According to details released by the FBI, key pieces of the malware used in the attack have the same names and construction as the malware used in the DarkSeoul attack. In both attacks, hackers also defaced websites with skeletons and political slogans.","Stars' aliases and contact details among most recently leaked documents .

"At around 100 calories a glass, champagne can be a fattening, as well as a rather expensive, habit. The issue wasn’t lost on BBC broadcaster Amanda Thomson. And she became so obsessed with creating a low sugar fizz that she gave up her job to pursue the dream. Four years on, she has launched Skinny Champagne – at 60 calories a glass. It was 2010 when Miss Thomson left her £50,000 a year job to move with her husband and two children to Paris to study wine making. Scroll down for video . At around 100 calories a glass, champagne can be a fattening, as well as a rather expensive, habit (file picture) She has spent the past 18 months developing her product and worked with champagne maker Alexandre Penet to create the Brut Nature Cuvée Grand Cru. Sugar is usually added to champagne at the end of the fermentation process to balance the taste. There is no added sugar in Skinny Champagne and the only sweetness comes from the residual fruit sugars of the grape. Low sugar champagne is not a new idea – but those that do exist often come with a sky-high price tag. Miss Thomson said: ‘No one was focusing on it, it needed some love. I made it my mission to find a perfect low sugar champagne.’ Skinny Champagne is now stocked at the exclusive Nobu restaurants in London and on her website Thomson and Scott for £249 for a case of six.","Amanda Thomson became obsessed with creating a low sugar fizz .

"Sir Michael Wilshaw railed against 'bad parents' who were not supporting their children and called for headteachers to be able to punish bad parents . Parents who do not read to their children should be fined, the chief inspector of schools suggested yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw also called for headteachers to have the power to punish parents who miss school events or allow their child’s homework to go undone. The head of Ofsted railed against ‘bad parents’ who were not supporting their children’s education. Sir Michael, 67, accused white working class families of no longer regarding doing well at school as the way to improve their family’s future. Instead, pupils from migrant families were outperforming white British counterparts in the classroom because many held a deep cultural belief in the value of education, he claimed. Talking about his own days running a school, Sir Michael told The Times: ‘I was absolutely clear with parents; if they weren’t doing a good job, I would tell them so. ‘It’s up to headteachers to say quite clearly, “You’re a poor parent”. ‘If parents didn’t come into school, didn’t come to parents’ evening, didn’t read with their children, didn’t ensure they did their homework, I would tell them they were bad parents. ‘Headteachers should have the power to fine them. It’s sending the message that you are responsible for your children no matter how poor you are.’ The lowest performing social group in England’s schools is the poor white working class, he said. Children from migrant families were doing ‘astonishingly well’ in contrast and were boosting Britain’s position in international league tables. Sir Michael claimed deprivation was too often used as an excuse for poor performance in the classroom. Last year, research by the Centre for Social Justice revealed only 26 per cent of poor white British boys attain five A* to C grades at GCSE including maths and English – compared with 40 per cent of black boys and 63 per cent of the country as a whole. Sir Michael claimed deprivation was too often used as an excuse for poor performance in the classroom . Sir Michael also accused some TV  programmes of ‘celebrating’ poor parenting – with Channel 4’s Shameless singled out. Of the comedy-drama about a family living on a grim  Manchester council estate, he said: ‘It’s almost glorifying fecklessness.’ The Ofsted head, who has clashed with the Education Secretary Michael Gove, did not explain exactly how a system of fines might work and ministers are unlikely to take up his suggestion. However, his comments come as Mr Gove draws up plans for tougher sanctions – including cutting child benefit – in cases where pupils do not turn up to school without good reason. Penalty notices of £60 can already be issued by headteachers and local authorities if parents do not ensure their children attend school up to the age of 16. More than 52,000 fixed- penalty notices were issued to parents last year – of which just over half were paid within 28 days.","Ofsted head said 'bad parents' are not supporting their children's education .

"The failure of teachers to control badly behaved children in lessons is dragging down standards, the chief inspector of schools will warn this week. Too many teachers have come to believe that poor discipline is an inevitable part of life in the classroom and heads need to crack down on the problem, Sir Michael Wilshaw will say. He will deliver his verdict after the publication of a major report by the schools inspectorate Ofsted, showing that a vast amount of teaching time is wasted because staff are struggling to control problem pupils. Scroll down for video . Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw, centre, said teachers need to crack down on poor classroom discipline . Teacher unions hit back last night, accusing Sir Michael of ‘talking nonsense’ by suggesting teachers accepted poor discipline, arguing instead that they were being let down by out-of-touch senior staff. The Oftsed report, based on specially commissioned surveys of teachers and parents and more than 3,000 school inspections, found that most teachers admit they are plagued by pupils making silly comments to get attention, swinging on chairs, passing notes around, humming or using mobile phones. Many teachers complained that heads were failing to back them and did not assert their authority when dealing with pupils flouting rules. The findings will bolster Sir Michael’s concerns that ‘a culture of casual acceptance’ of persistent disruption was preventing England’s school system from competing with high-performing Asian countries. This week he will also say that while serious breaches of discipline are less common today, the chances of pupils being in calm and well-ordered classrooms had become ‘something of a lottery’, damaging their future prospects. Ofsted’s annual report in December found that 700,000 pupils were attending schools where behaviour needed to improve. Chris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT said teachers are not failing to address disruptive pupils . And in a challenge to heads, he will argue that strong leadership is the key to cracking down on disruptive behaviour and creating good conditions for learning. Chris Keates, general secretary of union NASUWT, said her members acknowledged there was a widespread problem with low- level disruption in lessons. But she added: ‘The Chief Inspector is, as usual, talking nonsense to suggest that teachers accept this and are failing to address it. ‘What teachers do say is that… they are frequently unsupported by school leaders who too often do not teach and are divorced from the day to day realities of life in the classroom.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘Behaviour in the vast majority of schools is good and continually improving, according to Ofsted itself. ‘We agree that school leaders must support staff. ‘Good behaviour comes from the skills of teachers but also from a consistent policy across the institution.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw of Ofsted said schools had problems with discipline .

"Japanese nationalists have branded Angelina Jolie a 'demon' and called for her to be banned from travelling to the country over her so-called 'immoral' depiction of Japanese Second World War prison guards in her directorial debut 'Unbroken'. The Hollywood star's new movie, released on Boxing Day in the UK, is based on Laura Hillenbrand's book telling the heroic true life story of U.S. solider turned Olympian Louis Zamperini. The 2010 biography left Japanese patriots furious at depictions of American prisoners of war being 'beaten, burned, stabbed or clubbed to death, shot, beheaded, killed during medical experiments or eaten alive in ritual acts of cannibalism'. Now the same groups are turning their attention to protesting Jolie's big screen adaptation, branding it a work of 'pure fabrication', insisting it has 'no credibility', and accusing the star of racism. Scroll down for video . Father figure: Angelina Jolie's directorial debut is based on Laura Hillenbrand's book telling the heroic true life story of U.S. soldier turned Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini (pictured alongside the Hollywood star) Unbroken tells the life story of American Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini, who died in July aged 97. In May 1943 he was a member of the 11-man crew flying on U.S. warplane The Green Hornet when it crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a search and rescue mission south of Hawaii. Eight members of the crew were killed on impact and by the time soldiers on a Japanese warship spotted the debris floating off the coast of the Marshall Islands 47 days later, only Zamperini and pilot Russel Alllen Phillips were still alive. While a prisoner of war, Zamperini was regularly beaten and tortured by his captors - in particular by a harsh disciplinarian named Mutsuhiro Watanabe, who captives nicknamed 'The Bird'. In one account of his time at the camp - which lasted until  August 1945, when the Second World War effectively came to an end with VJ Day - Zamperini told how he was once forced to hold a plank above his head for a full 37 minutes under threat of violence. When the weak and severely malnourished Zamperini could no longer do so, Watanabe set about punching him repeatedly in the stomach. Debate: Angelina Jolie poses with Japanese singer Miyavi, who plays a sadistic WWII prison camp sergeant . Hard at work: Angelina Jolie is seen in the editing suite during the making of Unbroken . Japanese nationalists have now come forward to complain about the book in the hope it will discredit Jolie's soon to be released movie. 'It's pure fabrication,' Hiromichi Moteki, secretary general of the Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact, a nationalist pressure group, told The Telegraph. 'If there is no verification of the things he said, then anyone can make such claims. This movie has no credibility and is immoral,' he added. A number of social media campaigns have been launched ahead of the film's release, with Jolie accused of 'racial discrimination' against Japanese people, and of 'defaming Japan' as a nation. Others called for her to be barred from visiting the country at any point in the future. Attack: Japanese nationalists are turning their attention to protesting Jolie's big screen adaptation, branding it a work of 'pure fabrication', insisting it has 'no credibility', and accusing the star of racism . Horrific existence: A prisoner of war is photographed in Japan's Okinawa camp in June 1945 . Joy: Dozens of Allied prisoners celebrate being freed from a Japanese POW camp in August 1945 . A petition on the Change.org website went as far as to brand Jolie a 'demon' and attracted 8,000 signatures backing a halt distribution of the film on the grounds that is 'contradictory to the facts.' The reaction to Unbroken has sparked outrage, with activists furious that Japan appears unwilling to take responsible for acts that are backed by a great deal of eyewitness and forensic evidence. Mindy Kotler, director of Asia Policy Point, told the newspaper that there is 'plenty of eyewitness and forensic evidence of Japanese cannibalism of prisoners as well of fellow soldiers.' 'With the majority of war crimes trials and much of the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal focused on atrocities against POWs, discrediting POW testimony is an important step toward discrediting the war crimes trials,' she added.","Unbroken based on life of U.S. solider turned Olympian Louis Zamperini .

"Schools should take children from the age of two to stop the poorest pupils falling behind, the head of Ofsted will say today. Thousands of youngsters are being ‘let down’ by poor quality nurseries and childminders who fail to equip them with basic skills, according to Sir Michael Wilshaw. He will say school-based nurseries should begin to teach children as young as two to count, hold a pen and recognise words. Learning: Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted Chief Inspector, watches youngsters at play during his visit to the Windrush Nursery in Woolwich, London, on the eve of the publication of the Ofsted Early Years Annual Report . Many children - particularly those from low-income families - have an ‘unsure’ start to their education which leads to lower achievement as they progress through school, he will claim. Sir Michael will deliver the advice in Ofsted’s first major report on childcare and early education, which is being launched today. He will also call for parents to be given more help to find adequate childcare provision. The report will highlight an achievement gap between children from disadvantaged families and more affluent youngsters, which opens up during their earliest months and continues as they progress through school. Only a third of children from low-income homes have reached what is considered a ‘good’ level of development by the age of five. ‘Too many of our poorest children are getting an unsure start because the early years system is letting them down,’ Sir Michael will say. ‘What children facing serious disadvantage need is high quality early education from the age of two, delivered by skilled practitioners with degrees in a setting that parents can recognise and access easily. 'These already exist. They are called schools.’ The report will call for a radical shake-up of early years care in England which would entail schools ‘taking the lead’ in providing good quality early education, particularly among youngsters from the poorest backgrounds. 'Children need education from the age of two': Sir Michael will use the report to call for an expansion of nursery schooling to even younger children, in the hope that this will stop disadvantaged youngsters falling behind . Speaking yesterday at Windrush Primary School in Greenwich, East London, Sir Michael said: ‘The attainment gap between poor children and their more prosperous peers is large and if you are going to narrow it, it needs to start much earlier on. ‘It needs to start before school starts, so therefore the early years provision has to be good. ‘We are saying it isn’t good enough, and we see better provision for poor children, where those gaps emerge, in school-based settings, and we are urging Government to put more early years settings into schools.’ Sir Michael said Ofsted wanted a greater emphasis on teaching children core skills - ‘how to hold a pen, the ability to count, to recognise words, to communicate well with each other and their teachers’. Schools, nurseries and childminders will be expected to run regular assessments of children as young as two in literacy and numeracy. Many schools with nurseries currently only take children from the age of three. Fun times: The report will call for a radical shake-up of early years care in England which would entail schools 'taking the lead' in providing good quality early education, but critics warn of the 'schoolification' of childhood . Education Minister Liz Truss is already writing to councils to ask them to extend provision for two-year-olds and open school nurseries for longer to cover the working day. However the plans are proving controversial amid concerns over the ‘schoolification’ of early childhood. Davina Ludlow, director of daynurseries.co.uk, said: ‘Assessment at a young age would undermine natural development. ‘Rather than giving two-year-olds tests, we should be giving them the opportunity to learn through interaction and play. 'We need to change the notion that “starting sooner means improved results later”.’","Children of poor families suffer 'unsure start' to education, Sir Michael warns .

"Some of the World Cup’s leading stars will have to juggle their religious and footballing commitments with the holy month of Ramadan set to begin during the finals. It will be the first time since 1986 that the Islamic period of worship has fallen during the tournament.Muslims fast from dawn until dusk during Ramadan and are supposed to refrain from all food and drink - and that could affect scores of players on show in Brazil this summer. Ramadan begins on June 28 – the first day of Second Round matches - and runs until July 27. Were the likes of France and Ivory Coast to make the last 16 then several of their players would have to manage their religious duties. Brothers in arms: Ivory Coast duo Yaya (left) and Kolo Toure are followers of Islam . Faith: Real Madrid's Karim Benzema is one of France's high-profile Muslim stars . Belief: Switzerland forward Xherdan Shaqiri is another European star of Muslim faith . France stars including Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema, Mamadou Sakho of Liverpool, Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna and Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko are all practising Muslims. Meanwhile, Ivory Coast brothers Yaya and Kolo Toure – of Manchester City and Liverpool respectively – former Arsenal striker Gervinho and Newcastle midfielder Cheick Tiote are also Muslim. The majority of the Bosnia squad – including Manchester City frontman Edin Dzeko – are followers of Islam, as are Belgium’s Premier League duo Marouane Fellaini and Moussa Dembele, Switzerland’s key man Xherdan Shaqiri and Arsenal and Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil. One piece of good news for those players is that there are currently just 11 hours of daylight in Rio de Janeiro, compared to nearly 17 in the UK. Some Muslim players have sought permission to eat and drink during Ramadan but some, such as Kolo Toure, are intent on sticking to the practice of fasting. Top man: Germany's Mesut Ozil will be one of his country's key players . Faith: Edin Dzeko is one of many Bosnian squad members who are followers of Islam . Belief: Kolo Toure (centre) says Ramadan can actually make players stronger . Speaking last year, Toure explained: ‘You definitely need discipline. For me, the first five days are difficult but after that, the body just starts to [adapt] and you feel really happy. ‘You clean your body as well and you feel even stronger after Ramadan. I think it’s amazing how Ramadan can make you really strong. ‘I’ve been observing Ramadan during all the years I’ve been in football. It’s very important that you eat well. It’s important that you eat the right food because you can gain weight or you can have less food in your body. ‘That’s why you need to drink very well. You also need to be aware of what you are doing, because your body is missing things. With the doctor and all the people in the club, we try to work on that. They give me things that I can take to help me feel better.’ Why does Ramadan not always fall during the World Cup? Ramadan is a lunar month, it begins about 11 days earlier each year. During a Muslim's life, Ramadan will fall both during winter months, when the days are short, and summer months, when the days are long and the fast is more difficult. Why do Muslims fast during Ramadan? The practice is intended to help teach Muslims ‘self-discipline, self-restraint and generosity’. It is common to have one meal (known as the suhoor), just before sunrise and another (known as the iftar), directly after sunset. During the hours of daylight they are not allowed to consume any food or drink. Smoking and having sex are also forbidden. Who is exempt from fasting? Young children, the sick or those with mental illnesses, the elderly and women who are menstruating, pregnant, breast-feeding or have recently had a baby. Do employers make concessions during Ramadan? Some UK companies allow Muslims to begin their working day later so they can catch up on sleep after waking at 3am to eat. When does it end? Ramadan ends this year on the evening of July 27. Every Ramadan culminates with the festival of Eid ul-Fitr, which takes place either 29 or 30 days after the beginning of the month. Eid – as it is usually known – begins with morning prayers and is followed by feasting and celebration among family and friends.","Islamic holy month begins on June 28, the first day of Second Round matches .

Fans are being asked to cast their votes at Facebook.com/Monopoly by February 5. Within hours of polling beginning yesterday the website was full of . heated debate. One enthusiast said: ‘Players have their favourites and . each token means something to someone. Change for change sake is not . needed, it will not change the game or  make it any more fun than it . already is.’ Another said: ‘Don’t like this idea. Have played Monopoly . using the dog for nearly 20yrs wouldn’t be the same without it!!’ A Hasbro spokesman said: ‘When we decided to replace one of the tokens, . we knew we had to involve our fans in the process.’ Last night . bookmaker Paddy Power made the wheelbarrow the 4/5 favourite to be axed, . followed by the shoe at 2/1.

Vote now: Posters are being circulated encouraging players to vote for their favourite Monopoly pieces . The game of Monopoly was invented by Charles Darrow, whose young nieces suggested he use metal charms from charm bracelets as movers in the game. Parker Brothers liked the idea and decided to include die-cast tokens when they started manufacturing and selling the Monopoly game in 1935. The iron, race car, thimble, shoe, top hat and battleship were among the original set of movers introduced in 1935. The Scottie dog and wheelbarrow were added in the early 1950s. These eight make up the collection of tokens currently included in the classic Monopoly game. Later this year, the classic token with the fewest votes will be removed from the game and replaced with the new token that receives the most votes. Monopoly games with the new token will arrive on store shelves in mid to late 2013 so fans who would still like to play with the classic eight tokens have a limited time to pick up the existing version of the game.

"Retired teacher Roger Clark was insulted by his headmaster Mark Dunning in a school newsletter . As retirement announcements go, it seemed kind and innocuous enough. But a prep school headmaster's wordplay has cost him his job after his departing colleague detected a stronger sentiment between the lines. 'It is with mixed feelings that I announce the retirement of Mr Roger Clark at the end of this term,' wrote Mark Dunning, the head of the £13,000-a-year Orley Farm School in Harrow, north-west London. 'We all now know every really great teacher has to finish one day and Mr Clark will do so at the end of this term.' Mr Clark, 64, a teacher of English and . French, spotted that the first letter of the first six words of the . second sentence spelled out a rather uncomplimentary term. Now Mr Dunning, 50, has been replaced in the head's chair after governors were unimpressed by his efforts, which formed an acrostic, reports the Daily Telegraph. The . online edition of the newsletter was quickly updated with a reworded . version to say: 'Every really great teacher has to finish one day and Mr . Clark will do so at the end of this term.' But the original version of the October half term newsletter is still available on the school's website for all to see. Mr Clark's staff biographies remain on the school's site, where he is . described as an 'outstanding' teacher and 'inspirational Head of . Library, encouraging and promoting the enjoyment of literature across . the school.' Today, his wife Lucia Clark answered the door at their home in Harrow and said she and her husband did not wish to comment on the affair. At hometime today parents picking up their children at the school expressed surprise and disappointment at the message. None of those questioned had heard of tensions between Mr Dunning and Mr Clark, and none had noticed the hidden message until the rumours started in in the wake of the head's departure. One parent, who did not wish to give her name, said: 'It's very unprofessional. 'You expect better from someone running a school where we're paying a fortune for the children not to learn these words. Orley Farm School teacher Roger Clark spotted that the first letters of the first six words in the second sentence of his retirement announcement spelled out a rather choice insult . 'I would like to know the full story, but if he had to leave because of this then I think it's absolutely fair.' Another man waiting to pick up his child said: 'We got an email telling us about the resignation - we were just told he had resigned. We started getting texts from other parents talking about what was going on. 'A lot of us were angry and annoyed because Mr Dunning was well-liked, respected and well thought-of. This goes against that character if that is what happened. 'It's a fee-paying school, and this sort of thing isn't what you'd expect. 'If you have spent £12-13,000 a year to educate your kids then you want to have confidence in their school. 'Part of me feels sorry for Mr Dunning, but if you're the head of a private prep school you don't do that kind of thing - you can't excuse something like that.' The school's bursar, Tim Brand, told . MailOnline this morning: 'It's an internal matter for the school, being . dealt with by the governors,' but would not comment further. Mark Dunning has now left the £13,000-a-year Orley Farm School in Harrow, north-west London . The rude word spelled out by the acrostic was ranked as the fourth most offensive swearword in research by the Advertising Standards Agency in 2000. Its original meaning has changed over time and is mainly used as an impolite way of calling someone an 'idiot'. Mr Dunning, who stepped down last month after seven years in the top job, was previously in charge of the independent Bishopsgate School in Surrey and was deputy headteacher of Ranby House prep school in Nottinghamshire, according to his LinkedIn profile. Orley Farm's former pupils include television presenter Dale Winton and author Anthony Horowitz, who once told the Daily Mail that the school was 'a hellhole of the very first order' during his time there.","Mark Dunning announced Roger Clark's retirement in school newsletter .

"It seems most Aussies are a bit chicken when it comes to eating spicy foods. A new study has found that fewer than 10 per cent of Australians enjoy extra spicy flavours, despite 46 per cent of people describing themselves as having adventurous taste buds. The research by Portuguese restaurant Nando's, surveyed over 1000 Australians to gauge how often they eat fiery foods. Scroll down for video . The study found that fewer than 10 per cent of respondents enjoy spicy flavours, despite 46 per cent of them saying they have adventurous taste-buds . The 'heat' map of Australia, which shows where the most spicy food lovers live in each state . The research also explored how taste buds influence self-perception. According to the study, chilli lovers see themselves as smarter than those who opt for 'milder' flavours, with 60 per cent of chilli lovers describing themselves as intelligent, and only 40 per cent of mild flavour fans doing likewise . While 49% of those who opt for mild flavours classify themselves as confident, 60 per cent of hot heads saw themselves as self- assured. Chilli lovers were also more likely to participate in high adrenaline activities, with 10 per cent having sky dived against the three per cent of mild eaters. Nando's also examined data from thousands of their own customers, revealing that only 22 per cent of Australians seek out intense flavours. Jude Leon of Nando's said that 'despite considering ourselves a nation of adventurous...most Aussies tend to stick with mild, rather than wild, options when it comes to flavours.' So what actually happens to us when we eat fiery foods? Accredited  Dietician Geraldine Georgeou from Designer Diets Sydney explained that 'it can feel like our tummy and mouth is burning but actually it's not.' 'In chillies there is a substance called capsaicin, which activates and releases a compound called Substance P. This substance transmits the pain and burning sensation that we feel when we eat chilli.' Nandos, the restaurant which conducted the study, says that despite Australians considering adventurous when it comes for food, most Australians stick to 'mild' flavours . Dietician Geraldine Georgeou recommends building up your tolerance to spice by slowly introducing it into your diet . Ms Georgeou explained that the age people are introduced to chilli can affect how well they can handle it. 'The younger your exposure the higher your tolerance as nerve endings can be desensitized, due to the regular consumption of spicy foods.' She said that an immunity to spice can still be built up, though: 'your tolerance for spicy food can be built up by slowly introducing foods that are initially low to medium and finally to hot. Try adding extra black pepper on your food or you can spice your tomato sauce with Tabasco.' 'Once you have acclimatised you can increase the intensity by adding seeded chopped chillies to your favourite dish to increase your tolerance to the next level.' To encourage people to experiment with flavour, Nando’s is offering complimentary samples of hot PERi PERi chicken tenders to customers who come into select Nando’s on Friday 19th September between 12pm and 2pm and state the magic words: ‘Do me a flavour!’.

"EastEnders is 'twice as white' as the real East End according to the head of the BBC Trust, who has called for the corporation to do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain . Acting head of the BBC Trust Diane Coyle, said the popular BBC One soap is also too young and has too many people born in the UK to be an accurate reflection of an area such as Walthamstow, one of the boroughs on which the fictional Albert Square is based. In her first public speech since taking over as chair of the BBC’s governing body Miss Coyle - who is in the running to replace Lord Patten as head of the trust - said the programme did not provide an accurate picture of modern day Britain. EastEnders is 'twice as white' as the real East End according to the head of the BBC Trust, who has called for the corporation to do more to 'provide an authentic portrayal' of modern Britain . She said: 'The Audience Council figures suggested that there are almost twice as many white people living in fictional E20 as in real life E17, while the population of EastEnders tends to be younger than their real life counterparts and more likely to have been born in the UK.' Ms Coyle said the BBC's Audience Council for England 'compared the population of Walthamstow in East London with Walford - the fictional home of EastEnders' She said it would be 'daft' for the show to be a 'perfect replica' of the real world, but said it was 'important to ask whether the BBC can do more in its popular output to provide an authentic portrayal of life in modern Britain'. In her speech at the London School of Economics, which will be widely seen as an application to replace Lord Patten who stepped down in May, she said the BBC’s independence was 'not as secure as it might seem' and that it had 'become more and more entangled with parts of the machinery of government, Parliament and the State in all sorts of other, more or less obvious ways'. She said there needed to be 'clearer terms of engagement' over what parliament has scrutiny over, otherwise 'there is a real risk that the BBC could in the future end up looking over its shoulder trying to please politicians rather than focusing on licence fee payers'. Ms Coyle, an economist by profession whose husband is a BBC journalist, said there was 'every reason' to think the licence fee was 'sustainable' and called for a 'full, open public debate' about funding. Her . comments – made on the same day comedian Lenny Henry repeated his . criticism that there are too few people from ethnic minorities on . television – are based on research carried out by the Audience Council . for England. The BBC plans to spend £2.1million of . licence fee money on fast-tracking ethnic minority talent onto the . screen with a new ‘diversity’ committee. Director-general . Mr Hall said the corporation had ‘to do more’ to increase ethnic . minority representation both on and off camera. He . said the ‘diversity creative talent fund’ would help ‘fast-track’ certain shows onto the screen and create a series of development . programmes aimed at encouraging future commissioners and executives from . ethnic minority backgrounds. The director-general said he wanted to . see ethnic minorities account for 15 per cent of air talent in the next . three years and said he would also set ‘local off-air targets’ in London, . Birmingham, Manchester and Leicester to reflect the population of those . cities. Actor Lenny Henry, who has criticised the TV and film industry in the past for not providing a 'fair and honest reflection of our society', has signed up to the committee to help advise the corporation . He also said he wanted those from ethnic minority backgrounds to account for 15 per cent of senior staff by 2020.

"A married couple born 32 years apart have proved that age is irrelevant when it comes to love. Father of seven Thomas Bolton, 56, shocked his family by returning from a fishing holiday, with an unusual catch - a bride more than three decades his junior. Mr Bolton fell 'hook line and sinker' for Jainaba Sawo, 24, during the trip with his brothers in Gambia - with the pair tying the knot just three weeks later. Thomas and Jainaba on their wedding day  in Tallinding, Gambia (left and right). The couple born 32 years apart have proved that when it comes to love, age is just a number . Despite concerns from Mr Bolton's family that Jainaba was 'just after a visa', the husband and wife have been happily married for three years and now have a 17-month-old son, Malang. Jainaba and Thomas first met in December 2011 in Tallinding, Serrekunda in western Gambia, while Thomas was holidaying with his brothers. The joiner, from Accrington, Lancashire, said: 'I went to Gambia on a fishing trip with my brothers and came back with a wife. It was very unexpected, but I'm so happy. 'I had finished an afternoon of fishing and was walking along the Kotu beach when I spotted Jainaba sunbathing.' The couple started chatting and hit it off straight away, and four days later, Thomas had already met Jainaba's family, declaring his love for her and their intentions to marry. Left: Thomas with 17-month-old Malang at home in Accrington; Right: Malang playing in the couple's garden . Jainaba said: 'My family welcomed Thomas and thought of him as their son. My mum Binta, 47, was wary at first because he was a stranger, but she could see how much he cared for me. 'At first my family were worried that I was getting married too quickly, but they said it was my decision, and that they'd stand by me either way.' Less than three weeks later in January 2012, the pair married in Jainaba's hometown, Tallingding, in a small ceremony. Jainaba said: 'Thomas's friends and family didn't come to the wedding, which I think upset Thomas, but the wedding wasn't planned in advance so it was really difficult for them.' Thomas's friends did not make it to the wedding but the couple (pictured on their wedding day left and right, with a guest) have now been married for three years and proven skeptics wrong . Thomas with Jainaba's sister (centre) and cousin (right) on his wedding day in Gambia in January 2012 . The same day, Thomas converted to Islam to show his dedication to his new wife and now prays daily. The couple's whirlwind romance was cut short as Thomas' holiday came to an end and he was forced to return to the UK. Their relationship remained long distance until September 2012 when Jainaba finally finished the necessary paperwork and exam to be granted entry to the UK. Despite initial reservations from Thomas's family about Jainaba's intentions, their first child together, Malang, was born in June 2013. Jainaba said: 'I'm younger than most of Thomas's children, whose ages range from 22 to 39, so naturally they were suspicious at first but now they've accepted me. 'Some people didn't believe it would work because they thought I was just after a visa into the UK. Thomas and Jainaba (left and right, outside their home in Accrington). 'The most difficult thing about living in England has been living away from my friends and family, especially my mum,' says Jainabe . 'They said the age gap would give us problems, but no one knows where love comes from. I love how Thomas treats me - he's so romantic and often surprises me with flowers and perfume. He's my hero. 'The most difficult thing about living in England has actually been living away from my friends and family, especially my mum.' Thomas, whose ex-wife died four years ago after suffering from pancreatic cancer, said his friends are jealous of his marriage to a younger bride. He said: 'All my friends want a younger wife now. 'I don't believe there should be a stigma with age gap relationships as Jainaba and I have had no problems in our relationship. She's more mature than most people her age.' The loved-up couple are hoping to have a second baby in the future.","Thomas Bolton, 56, fell for Jainaba Sawo, 24, on a holiday to Gambia .

"A bodybuilder has won her first crown after successfully battling eating disorders for more than 15 years. Carly Tierney, from Woolley Grange, South Yorkshire, came first in the Miami Pro UK bodybuilding competition in St Albans, having overcome both bulimia and anorexia in a staggering 18-month transformation. The 31-year-old beat off stiff competition from 65 entrants to win the 'Miss Bikini Tall' category in October. Scroll down for video . Carly winning the 'Miss Bikini Tall' category at the Miami Pro UK bodybuilding competition . Carly now has a totally different body, working out every day and eating eight small healthy meals a day . After reading about bodybuilding, Carly was inspired by the fact the female athletes' bodies  are 'priceless' Miss Tierney, who is also a manager of an insurance company, has been battling with eating disorders from the age of 15 to just before her 30th birthday. 'As I child I was overweight and was bullied for this,' said Miss Tierney, who is originally from Southport, Merseyside. 'I decided to diet in order to look better but in fact I started to look horrible. People would say ""oh look at her, she looks good, she looks skinny"", when in actually fact I was going through hell.' Carly struggled with eating disorders from her teenage years up until her 30th birthday . Her battle with food intensified when she began university at 18, when she became anorexic. Miss Tierney would later recover before battling the same disorder once again at age 25, while also suffering bulimia into her late 20s. Both these psychological disorders wreak both emotional and physical havoc on sufferers. As well as intense mental anguish, those with anorexia or bulimia can suffer many health problems due to excessively restricting food, over-exercising, vomiting and abusing laxatives. Anorexia is one of the leading causes of mental health-related deaths, and recovery can be complex, usually requiring a combination of psychotherapy and nutritional education. For Carly, it was only when she approached the milestone of her 30th birthday that she decided to change her life. 'I was thinking about all the things I wanted to achieve in life,'  Miss Tierney said. 'Firstly, I'm single and I have not done everything I wanted to do because I have been so consumed by an eating disorder. This is when the cogs started to turn for me.' She began researching about her body and educated herself on nutrition, which eventually led her to the sport of bodybuilding. After reading about bodybuilding, she was inspired by the fact that the bodies these female athletes have are 'priceless'. Despite being a regular visitor to the gym throughout the years, Miss Tierney admits she purely worked on cardio and attended classes. Miss Tierney said: 'I was one of those people who go in and just get on a treadmill. I had really no idea what I was doing and just stayed in my comfort zone.' It was only after chance encounter with someone from BSN Nutrition, who she is now a sponsored athlete for, while at her local gym that she realised bodybuilding could be a realistic goal. Carly has now been asked to speak in schools and universities about her struggles with eating disorders . She now trains at the gym twice a day, five days a week, while following a bodybuilding diet, which includes 6-8 small meals per day to help her through training and keep her metabolism going. The whole process of the sport is judged on how your body looks, how athletic your muscle tone is and how you present yourself on stage. Miss Tierney has made a drastic transformation going from someone who was previously unhappy with their body, to confidently showcasing it on stage in front of a panel of judges. If you or anyone you know know is affected by an eating disorder you can find information on the NHS website or through the eating disorders charity BEAT. She said: 'I am still like any other girl, when it comes to worrying how I look. In fact, I almost pulled out of the competition after hearing I would go up against 65 entrants. 'I think differently about my body than I did before as this is a sport and means things always need improving. The judge commented that I needed work on my bum and my legs. If I had been told that before, I think I would have had a nervous breakdown.' Miss Tierney's remarkable journey will soon be told to the next generation after being asked to speak in schools and universities about her struggles with eating disorders and how she educated herself on healthy eating and keeping active. She added: 'Winning Miss Bikini Tall was huge deal to me. I was ecstatic to win and I hope this will inspire people to be more comfortable and happy in their bodies. 'It is really important to educate people on eating disorders, especially bulimia. People see these high achievers and think they are successful, skinny and fine but they don't know what goes on behind closed doors.' Miss Tierney also plans to enter more bodybuilding competitions throughout next year while continuing work as a personal trainer alongside her full-time occupation.","Carly Tierney struggled with anorexia and bulimia from  age of 15 .

"Southampton have completed the loan signing of Benfica midfielder Filip Djuricic for the rest of the season. It had previously been a quiet transfer window on the south coast with Eljero Elia the only arrival at the top-four contenders. The 23-year-old Serbian international Djuricic had been on loan at German side Mainz. Filip Djuricic has been announced as a Southampton player on loan until the end of the season . 'I know the player from Holland,' Ronald Koeman told the club's official YouTube channel. 'He played several seasons for Heerenveen and then he moved to Benfica. 'It's a young player, he's 23 years old, he's technical, fast and he can play in different positions in the midfield. He can play on the left side and the right side. 'It's part of the philosophy of the club; young players. He was in a difficult situation, he was on loan at Mainz and we will take him on loan for the rest of the season. 'It's a good possibility for him, and for us it's one more player who can play in different positions. It's always best for the coach to have more possibilities in players who can change positions. 'The last few weeks we have had problems to score goals, like Sunday. 'We created good opportunities and you have to score, always it's easy to have really good competition.' Djuricic in action for German club Mainz where he spent the first half of this season in loan . Having lost Jack Cork to Swansea during this transfer window, the Saints are eager to bolster their midfield options. His compatriot, Southampton winger Dusan Tadic said: 'Filip is a really good player and a really good guy - we play in national team together. 'He's having a difficult time in Mainz, but he's a good age and a good player with quality. I think he would be good here.' Djuricic (left) will join the Saints from Benfica on loan until the end of the season . Saints manager Koeman said he had been tracking Djuricic since his days at Dutch club Heerenveen. 'I know the player from Holland,' Koeman told Southampton's YouTube channel. 'He played several seasons for Heerenveen and then he moved to Benfica. 'He had some good games, there was a lot of interest in the player when he was at Heerenveen. He moved to Portugal and now it's a good chance for the player to develop himself.' He added: 'It's difficult for young players to make the step to teams like Benfica, it's physical football in Portugal and the player is more technical. 'I think it's better for him to play in a team like Southampton because our type of football is the best for Djuricic.'","23-year-old midfielder Filip Djuricic joins on loan for the season .

"With parents like his, there was never any doubt Prince George was going to be a bonny baby. But perhaps he has his mother to thank for one of his most charming features. For looking at a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge as a baby, it’s clear he has inherited his adorable chubby cheeks from her. Scroll down for video . Our family: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge showed off Prince George in the Mother's Day photograph . Just like mum: Looking at a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge as a baby in 1982 (right), it’s clear Prince George has inherited his adorable chubby cheeks from her. The Prince also shares his mother's snub nose . But George’s flick of fair hair on . show in the latest Cambridge family portrait is undeniably the mark of . his father, who was blond at a similar age. George is also said to have one bottom tooth popping through and has just learnt to crawl. When it comes to dress sense, however, his grandfather – rather than his fashionable mother – is leaving his mark. It emerged yesterday that George’s blue jumper which bears his name was a gift from Prince Charles. Similar to dad: Meanwhile, George's flick of fair hair in the latest family portrait is undeniably the mark of his father, who was blond at a similar age. Above, Prince William is pictured as a baby at Kensington Palace . It is believed he had it created for his grandson in machine-made cashmere, favoured by Johnstons of Elgin, a family-run wool mill that holds the Royal Warrant for Prince Charles. The . portrait, released yesterday to mark Mother’s Day, was taken through a . window of the Cambridges’ home, Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, by . renowned photographer Jason Bell. He was also commissioned to take the official photos of Prince George’s christening in October last year. As a baby: George, pictured with his parents outside St Mary's Hospital, is said to have just learnt to crawl . Just born: He is also said to have one bottom tooth popping through and seems besotted with family pet Lupo . In the latest photo eight-month-old George appears besotted with family pet Lupo, gazing affectionately at the spaniel. Kate takes the job of holding George, as was the case in the official christening portrait, while William ensures Lupo behaves himself as he did in another photo of the family taken by the duchess’s father Michael Middleton. But perhaps the most striking aspect of this latest picture is Prince George’s resemblance to his mother. Celebration: The Mother's Day portrait was taken by renowned photographer Jason Bell. He was also commissioned to take the official photos of Prince George's christening (pictured) in October last year . Leaving his mark: It has emerged that George's blue jumper bearing his name was a gift from Prince Charles . A photo of Kate taken in 1982, the year she was born, reveals she had equally round cheeks and a similar snub nose. Looking rather bemused, Kate was attending the first birthday party of Nicola Brown, her first best friend, with her mother Carole. The release of William and Kate’s portrait comes ahead of the couple’s three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia next week. All together: William, Kate, Prince George and Lupo are pictured in the garden of the Middleton family home . The duke and duchess are said to be looking forward to it immensely, particularly because they are taking Prince George with them. The couple have planned the trip so that they are able to return to George every night, apart from on two evenings. Their new Spanish Norland-trained nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo is also travelling with them to share childcare duties. Happy couple: The release of William and Kate's portrait comes ahead of the couple's three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia.

While the Queen was forced to leave her two young children – Charles and Anne – at home when she undertook a six-month Commonwealth tour in 1953, William has told friends that leaving George behind was ‘unthinkable’. William and Kate are said to delight in the daily changes they see in their son. ‘The only thing they are worried about is how he will cope with the long flight,’ a source said, before adding: ‘He is a really happy and chilled little boy but they have warned people he might be a little grumpy.’","Prince George has same chubby cheeks as Kate had in 1982 baby photo .

"With his mother's trademark pout on his face, Brooklyn Beckham makes his modelling debut aged 15. The teenager appears on the cover of Man About Town magazine and while he poses just like his mum Victoria - he looks the spitting image of his handsome soccer star dad David in the black and white photo shoot which evokes the old Hollywood images of a young James Dean. The pictures were taken by photographer Alasdair McLellan, who shot Victoria for UK Vogue and David for Fantastic Man, and is a 'friend of the family'. Dead ringer: Brooklyn Beckham is growing up look just like his dad, soccer star David Beckham . Cover boy: Schoolboy Brooklyn Beckham has never appeared in a fashion shoot before. A source said the entire family joined him to support him . Man About Town magazine, a biannual publication, says it is 'targeted at high-end business-engaged and culturally-orientated male urbanities... giving a guide to the seasonal men must haves.' Brooklyn follows in the footsteps of his younger brother Romeo, 11, who had a starring role in a Burberry campaign in December 2012. And just like his famous parents, it seems that Brooklyn's also a dedicated follower of fashion as he's pictured wearing labels including Ralph Lauren, Saint Laurent and Supreme. The dashing teen appears on the cover wearing a quiff and a navy blue bomber jacket and tie - while the word 'Quiche' is emblazoned on the front of the magazine, referring to the new term for 'hot' coined by Australian comic Chris Lilley in his hit HBO series, Ja'mie: Private School Girl. A source told MailOnline: 'David and Victoria are immensely proud of all their children, and they never push them into anything even though the boys get lots of offers. 'Brooklyn is focused on school and soccer, but of course he was so excited to get his first magazine cover shoot as he's interested in photography like his dad. 'The photo shoot was shot over a weekend and all the family went along to support Brooklyn.'

"A tattooed model who became an internet sensation after posting a video of herself jiggling her boobs to Mozart on the internet has released a festive version of her party trick - moving her breasts to the tune of Jingle Bells. The original clip, which showed Sara X Mills moving her boobs individually and simultaneously to the sound of Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik was viewed more than 26 million times in just one week. But Sara's popularity was a double-edged sword - although the short film gave her instant fame and helped to raise money for charity, it also brought death threats. Scroll down for video . Sara X first became an internet star by jiggling her breasts to Mozart. She has since filmed another clip just in time for Christmas where she moves her chest in time to Jingle Bells . Sara X, a former stripper and freelance writer, says that she was 'bored and uninspired' at the time she recorded the video. But the 27-year-old revealed that she received a barrage of abuse from internet trolls after the clip went global in October. She told Jezebel at the time: 'I know I've definitely been called a w**** and a s*** and an attention w**** far more times than I ever was when I was actually in an adult industry. 'Mostly the people who have negative things to say about my character, or my presumed profession, past profession, and life decisions don't get that the video is meant to be humorous, and operate under the assumption that I just wanted to show the world my boobs.' Sara said that she had found the attention her trick had brought disconcerting and that she wouldn't feel too sad when her time int he spotlight passed. However, she must have had a change of heart since making those statements as she uploaded the fresh clip to YouTubeyesterday. She first appears in the video dressed in a faux fut coat, but soon strips off the item of clothing to reveal a candy cane striped bikini top. Sara then twerks her breasts to the rhythm of Jingle Bells. Since uploading the clip yesterday, Sara's new video has already had more than one million views . Since uploading the clip yesterday, the video has already had more than one million views, but the response to her new effort has been mixed. One user called Not Too Shabby write: 'The moment you realize that you have less subscribers than a girl who jiggles her boobs to music..... awkward.' While another called Toxiccomando said: 'The thing I love most about this is while Sara is indeed very sexy the video itself isn't. 'The faces she makes, makes the video at least to me very funny.' Many used the comments section to voice their dislike of women with tattoos though, including Jeff Allen, who wrote: 'Not a fan of so many tattoos on women, especially on their breasts. Sorry... just how I feel.' There was also a second video uploaded called the B-Roll, where Sara jumps around jiggling her boobs and bottom. According to the model, she was asked by the producers to: 'Just... do some stuff to make the bells jingle. It will be fun.'","Tattooed model first became internet star by jiggling her breasts to Mozart .

"It's very unlikely that anyone on . Earth will ever enjoy a flight over the huge asteroid Vesta, the . second-biggest in the asteroid belt - but . Nasa's . satellite Dawn has created the next best thing. The Nasa video 'flyover' has revealed that Vesta is a 'building block' of a planet, with an iron core, like Earth, which formed in a similar way to our planet and our own moon. The video was created from Dawn's collection of images built up since it entered orbit in July 2011, including the first looks inside mysterious craters . first spotted by the Hubble space telescope. Scroll down for video . The video was created from Dawn's enormous collection of data on the rock collected as it has orbited since July 2011, including the first looks inside mysterious craters first spotted by the Hubble space telescope . One of the 'snowman' group of craters on Vesta: The 'flyover' has revealed that Vesta is a 'building block' of a planet, with an iron core, like Earth, which formed in a similar way to our planet and our own moon . Although Vesta and its family are located between Mars and Jupiter, smaller pieces of these asteroids can be found in meteorite collections on Earth, including most eucrite, howardite and diogenite meteorites . 'Dawn's visit to Vesta has confirmed our broad theories of this giant asteroid's history, while helping to fill in details it would have been impossible to know from afar,' said Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. 'Dawn's residence at Vesta of nearly a year has made the asteroid's planet-like qualities obvious and shown us our connection to that bright orb in our night sky.Scientists now see Vesta as a layered, planetary building block with an iron core – the only one known to survive the earliest days of the solar system. The asteroid's geologic complexity can be attributed to a process that separated the asteroid into a crust, mantle and iron core with a radius of approximately 68 miles about 4.56 billion years ago. The terrestrial planets and Earth's moon formed in a similar way. Dawn observed a pattern of minerals exposed by deep gashes created by space rock impacts, which may support the idea the asteroid once had a subsurface magma ocean. A magma ocean occurs when a body undergoes almost complete melting, leading to layered building blocks that can form planets. Other bodies with magma oceans ended up becoming parts of Earth and other planets. Scientists now see Vesta as a layered, planetary building block with an iron core - the only one known to survive the earliest days of the solar system . Although Vesta and its family are located between Mars and Jupiter, smaller pieces of these asteroids can be found in meteorite collections on Earth, including most eucrite, howardite and diogenite meteorites . Data also confirm a distinct group of meteorites found on Earth did, as theorized, originate from Vesta. The signatures of pyroxene, an iron- and magnesium-rich mineral, in those meteorites match those of rocks on Vesta's surface. These objects account for about 6 percent of all meteorites seen falling on Earth. This makes the asteroid one of the largest single sources for Earth's meteorites. The finding also marks the first time a spacecraft has been able to visit the source of samples after they were identified on Earth. Scientists now know Vesta's topography is quite steep and varied. Some craters on Vesta formed on very steep slopes and have nearly vertical sides, with landslides occurring more frequently than expected. Another unexpected finding was that the asteroid's central peak in the Rheasilvia basin in the southern hemisphere is much higher and wider, relative to its crater size, than the central peaks of craters on bodies like our moon. Vesta also bears similarities to other low-gravity worlds like Saturn's small icy moons, and its surface has light and dark markings that don't match the predictable patterns on Earth's moon.'We know a lot about the moon and we're only coming up to speed now on Vesta,' said Vishnu Reddy, a framing camera team member at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany and the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. 'Comparing the two gives us two storylines for how these fraternal twins evolved in the early solar system.'Dawn has revealed details of ongoing collisions that battered Vesta throughout its history. Dawn scientists now can date the two giant impacts that pounded Vesta's southern hemisphere and created the basin Veneneia approximately 2 billion years ago and the Rheasilvia basin about 1 billion years ago. Rheasilvia is the largest impact basin on Vesta.'The large impact basins on the moon are all quite old,' said David O'Brien, a Dawn participating scientist from the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson,  Arizona. 'The fact that the largest impact on Vesta is so young was surprising.'","Ancient asteroid has iron core, like Earth .

"Mysterious rumbles thought to be coming from strange activity deep beneath the ground in Italy have been traced to a rather more mundane source - machinery in cement factories. Scientists have been baffled by a series of tremors that were being detected by Italy's extensive network of seismic sensors in recent years. They had attributed the vibrations to movements of magma bubbling near the surface of the Earth's crust beneath the country, despite occurring in areas that were not volcanically active. Geologists detected 342 tremors with epicentres within 150 metres (492 feet) of a cement plant in Ghigiano, Umbria in northern Italy, a location that is not volcanically active yet was being hit with mysterious rumbles . But now geologists believe they have found a more concrete answer for the weird seismic activity - the country's extensive network of cement factories. Italy is one of the largest producers of cement in Europe and has at least 57 full cycle plants and dozens more processing plants. The researchers now believe that these enormous factories could be responsible for producing vibrations across almost half of the country. Mysterious floating orbs, which have been linked to UFOs by some, could provide an early warning to earthquakes according to scientists. They have found that these lights, which are seen just before or after an earthquake, tend to occur on or near a rift in the Earth's crust - elongated troughs that are bounded on both sides by normal faults. Electrical charges flow along stress lines the crust and when they reach the surface, ionise the air molecules to produce light. Looking back at 65 of the best recorded incidents of earthquake lights  in America and Europe since the 1600s, scientists found 85 percent appeared spatially on or near rifts while 97 per cent appeared adjacent to a type of fault known as a subvertical fault . Scientists believe it may be possible to detect the electrical charges that create the lights to help them detect earthquakes before they happen. They calculated that each factory can shake the surrounding countryside up to 18 miles away. Dr Diana Latorre and her colleagues at the National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcananology in  Italy said that thousands of tremors, or microearthquakes, are recorded very year in Italy. However, they said their findings suggest that many of these are not natural. Dr Latorre said: 'We have shown that these signals are not due to earthquakes, neither to quarry blasts since they have different spectral properties with clear harmonic signature and low-frequency content. 'Looking at the time distribution, it appears that low frequency event occurrence is often characterised by a regular behavior, suggesting a human control of these sources. 'In a single cement plant, there are several machines capable of inducing tremors to the ground. 'Each of these machineries involves strong vibrations - some of them are installed underground to minimize the outdoor effect, possibly increasing the coupling to the ground below. 'If we assume that every cement factory produces seismic vibrations detectable in an area of at least 1250 km, a radius of 20km, to 2800 km, radius 30km, we find that a very significant portion of Italy (23% to 51%) is affected by industrial noise as that analyzed in our study.' The National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanaology seismic sensors detected thousands of low frequency tremors between 2010 and 2012 (marked by red dots), so researchers focused on events in the black boxes and were able to trace them to cement factories (marked by green diamonds) in Varese (VR), Pordenone (PN), Padova (PD), Arezzo (AR), Gubbio (GB), Sesto Campano (SC), Potenza (PZ), Matera (MT), and Ragusa (RG) The vibrations appeared to follow regular patterns, often becoming less frequent in August and at night . Italy is one of the most seismically active regions in the Mediterranean as it sits on the boundary where the Eurasian continental plate meets the African continental plate. A small tectonic plate, known as Adriatic Plate formed around the boot of Italy between 140 and 70 million years ago and resulted in many of the active volcanoes that are dotted around the country. The National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanaology monitors these with a network of 350 seismometres that are capable of detecting tremors with a magnitude of just 0.5. For years scientists have been unable to explain thousands of low frequency tremors that were occuring in parts of the country where there should be little or no activity. In 2008, Geologists attempted to explain this as vibrations coming from magma filled cracks in the upper crust. Italy sits at the boundary between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates where the small Adriatic plate (marked by red dotted line) is being deformed, causing volcanos to appear in the south of the country . Italy has 57 full cycle cement factories and dozens of other processing plants invovled in the industry that could be responsible for thousands of mysterious tiny tremors that have been detected around the country . However, Dr Latorre and her team found the signals from these events seemed to centre around cement factories and seemed to match vibrations from industrial activity. The researchers analysed the patterns of hundreds of low-frequency rumbles detected by seismic sensors around the country over three years. In one example they discovered 342 events had their epicentre within 500 feet of a cement factory in Ghigiano, in Umbria. This factory, run by the firm Colacem, has the capacity to produce around 1.25 million tonnes of cement a year. At another site around Caravate, in Varese, northern Italy, seismic sensors more than 4 miles away from the Colacem cement factory detected up to 100 of low frequency rumbles a day. These tended to be limited to one to three months of the year, however. At other sites, the researchers detected up to 250 events a day. The researchers, who have published their findings in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, also found that fewer tremors occurred at night and at weekends. The scientists examined the location of seismic events (red dots) detected by sensors (yellow triangles) and analysed the pattern they produced on seismographs (middle). Green diamonds show the position of huge cement plants operating in the same areas, which appear to be the epicentres for the tremors . There were also periods when the tremors were more intense, usually at times when the factories are thought to be most active such as the winter and less activity during the summer months. Nationally Italy produces between 29 million and 48 million tons of cement a year with its factories using a range of heavy machinery to crush and grind the raw material into the final product. These include using enormous rotary kilns that are hundreds of metres long, mills that use conical rollers to crush the raw rock and cement mills that steel balls to turn the product into powder. However, details of when and how these are used is often limited as the companies do not publish their production schedules, according to the researchers. Dr Latorre said that although the tremors were generally less than Magnitude 1 on the Richter Scale, it was important to understand their source to help monitor seismic activity in Italy. She said: 'We still believe that in Italy geological processes might generate unconventional earthquakes and tremors due to fluid mobilization in the mantle and in the crust. 'However, in such a complex and noisy environment, ongoing investigations searching for natural tremors, should take into account and isolate all possible sources of man-made noise.'","Italy is Europe's largest producer of cement with nearly 60 factories .

Google has strapped its Trekker camera to a camel (pictured) so that you can look across a vast expanse of desert dunes from the comfort of your sofa . The rolling sandy hills were once home to early settlers in the Late Stone Age, making Liwa one of the historic sites in the United Arab Emirates, according to a blog post by Deanna Yick, a Street View Program Manager. Some of the richest history in this desert lies in the Liwa Oasis - the largest oasis in the Arabian Peninsula. Many people from across the United Arab Emirates can trace their origins back to the first tribes who settled there and first established the area as a centre for trade. Dates are grown in the oases, and their fruit is important to local cultures. Google gathered views of oasis plants and vast expanses of sand with beautiful patterns etched by the wind, by attaching one of its Trekkers to a camel, which gathered imagery as it walked. The tech giant said that the use of camels allowed it to collect authentic images as well as minimally impact the environment.

"The bright lights of the city often lure people in with promises of a better way of life. Today, around 3.9 billion people around the world live in towns and cities, with the global urban population growing by about one million people each week. But while urban dwellers may have better access to doctors and hospitals, there are growing concerns that city-living is severely damaging to health. Rat race: The Paris-based International Council for Science has launched a programme that aims to understand how a city environment can be changed to improve the health of its residents . Now, scientists at the International Council for Science have launched a global programme to find out exactly how factors such as pollution, overcrowding and crime are affecting overall wellbeing. The 'Urban Health and Wellbeing Programme' hopes to understand what makes a 'healthy urban environment', according to a report by Mark Kinver in the BBC. 'We are facing global epidemics of non-communicable diseases - heart disease, diabetes and so on - and mental health problems,' Professor Anthony Capon, director of the UN University's International Institute for Global Health, told the BBC. Packed: The programme claims that city-dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress and social isolation. Those living in cities also suffer worse from impacts from car pollution . 'We are also seeing the health impact of climate change, such as heat-stress in cities and changes in the distribution of infectious vector-borne diseases.' Women who live in urban areas are more likely to develop postnatal depression than those who live in the countryside, recent research has claimed. Women who live in large cities are three per cent more likely to develop the condition five to 14 months after giving birth. The researchers believe this could be because city living is more stressful and is associated with less supportive communities. Dr Simone Vigod, at Women's College Hospital, in Toronto, said: 'Living in an urban area is a marker of more stress, less support and a potentially higher risk of postpartum depression for women. 'Our study suggests we need to better target our supports and services towards women based on their geographic location to improve their outcomes and reduce their risk of postpartum depression.' For instance, the programme claims that city-dwellers have higher rates of mental illness due to stress and social isolation. It is also looking at how infectious diseases thrive when people are crowded together, or how they emerge when cities expand into surrounding areas. 'The demographic advantage of youth in such countries would be lost unless combined with healthy living' said Indira Nath, Chair of the Scientific Committee at the International Council for Science. 'Policy makers face the challenge of viewing healthy cities as 'systems' consisting of multiple subsystems along with the overarching super system of climate change.' But Professor Capon said that the programme could offer some hope, by combining expertise between scientists and urban planners on how to better develop cities. The programme will look at everything from the design of public spaces and transport to improvements in housing and free city services. Professor Capon says the key is understanding that cities are really about people. 'We are attracted to cities for economic, educational and social opportunities,' he said 'When we live in cities, they need to work for us. It is not just about the economic efficiencies.'","International Council for Science is looking at how cities affect health .

"A woman lost seven stone in just five months by ditching a sugar addiction that saw her consume up to two litres of Pepsi a day. Bozena Lisowicz, 28, who was 14st 9lb and wore size 18 clothes at her heaviest, became hooked on sugary treats and fatty, stodgy food as a mechanism to cope with anxiety. She said: 'I thought food would kill me. I wasn't hungry, but I couldn't stop buying and eating treats.' Bozena Lisowicz from Leeds used to eat two cheese sandwiches, a muffin, a can of cola and a large bowl of cereal for breakfast. After avoiding sugar, she went from 14st 9lb to 8st 6lbs in 23 weeks. Bozena continued: 'I didn't spend a second of my time looking at the labels to see how much sugar and fat there was.' The quality control technician from Leeds saw a rapid increase in her weight as she tried to improve a failing long-term relationship. She said: 'My focus was entirely on my partner, I just wanted him to be happy. 'But by doing so, I was making myself more and more anxious, and comfort eating even more. 'I loved cola, particularly Pepsi, and had a large bottle each day.' Bozena Lisowicz, 28, who was 14st 9lb and wore size 18 clothes at her heaviest, became hooked on sugary treats and fatty, stodgy food as a mechanism to cope with anxiety . After piling on the weight, Bozena began suffering excruciating pain in her knees. In March 2012, when she was at her heaviest, she had an operation on her knees to help her 5ft 4in frame carry the extra load. Shortly afterwards, her relationship came to an end. Devastated, she dramatically cut her calorie intake and began losing weight at an alarming rate. She said: 'I was extremely depressed. I starved myself because I had given up on life and didn't care whether I'd waste away or not. 'My behaviour wasn't healthy - starving yourself is no strategy for trying to lose weight.' In March 2012, when she was at her heaviest, Bozena had an operation on her knees to help her 5ft 4in frame carry the extra load . After two weeks of starvation, Bozena slowly increased her intake, bringing it up to healthier levels. As she emerged from depression, she also gave up smoking. Before beginning her weight loss, she typically ate two ham or cheese sandwiches, with a muffin and a can of fizzy drink, followed by a large bowl of cereal with full-fat milk for breakfast. For lunch, she would eat a large bowl of pasta with cake or chocolate for dessert. For evening meals, she usually ate a meat feast pizza, but she would also snack on chocolate and cola during the day. Having made the decision to live healthier, Bozena ate a small low-fat pot of cottage cheese with wholegrain crackerbreads and a low-fat yoghurt for breakfast, followed by a chicken salad for lunch. She occasionally goes out for treat meals with friends but tries not to eat after 5pm and  also avoids snacking. Bozena has now replaced her size 18 wardrobe with size eight clothes after only five months of dieting and now weighs 8st 6lbs .

This year, she has started studying psychology and counselling and is starting training with The Samaritans in January, so that she may be able to help others through their struggles. She said: 'Now my hunger is for knowledge - for finding new things, for looking at society. I really enjoy that. 'I would love to help people who are in the place I've been.

"Many of us spend our lives in black, brown, navy, white and grey, but by choosing safe shades instead of a brighter wardrobe, we could be missing out on the health benefits implicit in colour. Jules Standish, author of How Not To Wear Black, is a style and colour consultant for women afraid of standing out, and she believes that changing your shopping habits can boost your well-being and self-esteem. ‘Research shows that colours can have a psychological effect,’ she says. ‘When we look at certain colours it triggers neurological responses in the brain, and causes the hypothalamus gland to release hormones. ‘Looking at warm, bright colours, such as red or pink, releases dopamine — known as the “feel-good hormone” — which can improve our mood, heighten the attention span and even boost our sex drive. ‘Cool blues, on the other hand, have been linked to the release of oxytocin, making you feel of calm.’ Here, Jules gives her verdict on the clashing colours that couldn’t be more suited.

Colour block dress, £250, shoes, £275, lkbennett.com . Necklace, £18.50, topshop.com . Our brains associate colours with temperature, so scarlet is at the hottest end of the colour spectrum. Scarlet and burgundy are both universally flattering and suit almost every skin tone and hair colour. Bright red also triggers the pituitary and adrenal glands, which can lead to increased metabolism and weight loss, so it’s great for a dieter.

This combination is often thought garish, but here the cyan, or bright blue, helps to tone down the purple. Bright blue suits most skin tones and helps to brighten the complexion.

The video has amounted a massive 20,000 shares in the five days it has been on Facebook. However, some users have been left outraged at the appalling conditions in which the animals are kept. Many have pointed to the fact that the highly active animals are caged together and should have their own space.

"A Connecticut woman is celebrating a big milestone - her 110th birthday. There weren't quite that many candles on Emily Tremonti's cake Saturday at the elder residence where she lives in Fairfield but she was surrounded by many people who love her. Great-great-niece Mary-Kate Mele says her Aunt 'Em' didn't have children but has three nieces, six great-nephews and nieces, seven great-great-nieces and three great-great-great nephews and nieces. Celebration: In this December 6, 2014 photo provided by Mary-Kate Mele, Emily Tremonti sits in front of her cake on her 110th birthday in Fairfield, Connecticut . Tremonti grew up with four sisters in Mount Vernon, New York - one of whom lived to 100. Their parents were Italian immigrants and Tremonti cherishes her heritage. Mele says Tremonti later lived in Bronxville, New York, worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and married Joseph Tremonti, a Con Edison executive, in 1933. According to the Gerontology Research Group (GRG), the oldest super-centenarian - a person who is at least the age of 110 - whose age can be validated is 116-year-old Misao Okawa from Japan. Okawa's date of birth is March 5, 1898, and she also leads among women included in the GRG's list of validated super-centenarians, as of September 1, 2014. The oldest male super centenarian on the list  is 111-year-old Sakari Momoi, also from Japan. His date of birth is February 5, 1903, according to the group.","Emily Tremonti turned 110 on Saturday at the elder residence where she lives in Fairfield, Connecticut .

"It might be welcome news for your health this Christmas, but getting a good deal on your festive shopping has been made that little bit tougher. Further evidence emerged today that seasonal chocolate and biscuit boxes are falling in weight - as prices increase by up to 25 per cent. A study of nine Christmas treats - including Roses and Quality Street - found they all weighed less than this time last year. Compared: A box of  Roses is up 24p but has fallen in weight by almost 100g, while Quality Street has gone down 40g - but now costs 13p more . And the research for The Observer by price comparison website Mysupermarket.com revealed five of the items had gone up in price. A box of Quality Street chocolates has gone down from 1kg in 2011 to 820g in 2013 and 780g this year - but now costs 13p (8 per cent) more. Similarly, a box of Cadbury's Roses chocolates has risen 24p (13 per cent) in price, but fallen in weight by 70g compared to last year. Vince Mitchell, consumer marketing professor at Cass Business School, told The Observer: ‘What has changed is the sheer scale of this downsizing. Terry's Chocolate Orange Segsations are down 30g but up 33p, while Asda Chocolate Coins are down 15g but still £1 . ‘Shrinking products used to crop up occasionally, which is when they made the news. '[But] what this [latest] research shows is that now this appears to be being done on a massive scale.’ Other products examined in the study included Fabulously Fox’s Biscuit Selection, Cadbury Heroes and Asda Chocolate Coins. Along with Cadbury’s Dairy Milk Advent Calendar and Terry’s Chocolate Orange Segsations, they have all dropped in weight since 2013. The Heroes and Segsations have gone up in price, while the Coins are the same, and the Advent Calendar and Biscuit Selection have dropped. Industry experts say products have shrunk not because of government health pressure but to maintain price - often to keep within the £5 price tag. The prices of products were averaged across those at Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Ocado, Waitrose, Morrisons and Aldi - and include multibuy offers. Nestlé said it had dropped the price at which it sells Quality Street boxes to retailers by 5 per cent - but retailers had the choice to drop the sale price. And Cadbury owner Mondelez International said ‘a range of economic factors across the board’ resulted in it decreasing the size of some products. The research follows a report in the Sunday Mirror that cartons of festive treats had shrunk by up to 14.8 per cent in the last year. According to its study, the weight of a £4 box of family favourites Maynards Wine Gums and Bassetts Jelly Babies has plummeted from 540g to 460g. It also found the £5 Cadbury Biscuit Collection fell 45g - with manufacturers saying the same number of biscuits were topped with a different chocolate.","Study of nine seasonal treats such as Roses and Quality Street finds they all weigh less than this time last year .
