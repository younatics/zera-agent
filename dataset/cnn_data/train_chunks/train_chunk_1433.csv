"A seven-year-old girl was stripped naked and held down while the skin between her breasts was cut by a swami who licked the blood and had intercourse with her during an initiation ceremony at a NSW yoga ashram, an inquiry has heard. A woman has told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Sydney she moved into the ashram in the foothills of Mangrove Mountain on the NSW Central Coast with her mother and sister in the 1970s. At a public hearing on Thursday, she recalled the initiation in a hut across the river from the ashram. Scroll down for video . An enquiry into child sex abuse at Australia's oldest yoga ashram, Mangrove Yoga Ashram, has found children were subjected to sexual abuse, starvation and neglect. Pictured: Shishy (centre), the partner of leader Swami Akhandananda Saraswati, at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram, in the foothills of Mangrove mountain in New South Wales in the 1980s . The woman, given the pseudonym APR, said five or six male swamis were there. The man who raped her was the spiritual leader and founder of the Mangrove Satyananda ashram, Swami Akhandananda. Two women have now come forward to claim they were sexually abused by the man who founded the worldwide yoga movement . Akhandananda was jailed in 1989 for indecent dealings with four girls, but was released when the High Court overturned the conviction in 1991. He died six years later. APR told the commission of the fear and hardship she endured at the ashram where her mother was a devotee of Akhandananda. 'Her personality was so enmeshed with what was going on in Mangrove I felt I could not reach her,' she said. APR said she also had a memory of Satyananda, the founder of the worldwide yoga movement, lying on top of her. He visited Australia and she felt he chose her as his favourite and at times, he would say she was the only child allowed to touch him or sit with him on his special seat. APR is the second witness to recount sexual abuse by Satyananda, whose yoga movement had millions of followers and thousands of ashrams across the world. He was looked on as an enlightened god-like figure on his annual visits to Australia in the 1970s and 80s and preached abstinence from sex as a path to enlightenment. He died in 2009 at the age of 85. On Thursday, Bhakti Manning who lived at his ashram in India told the hearing she was just 17 when he had 'violent, aggressive sex' with her. Other women were in the room when this happened and she understood he had sex with them too. Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate during the opening address at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse public hearing  into the Satyananda Yoga Ashram at Mangrove Mountain . She has only spoken out this year because in ashram society, if she spoke out, she would be considered the criminal 'for being a bad disciple for not accepting that what the guru had chosen to do to me for my own good'. She tried to get the Satyananda movement to address the child abuse issue in the 90s. Witnesses have told of violent beatings inflicted on children by Akhandananda and his partner Shishy, who became their legal guardians when parents signed over rights. Tim Clark, who was a child at the ashram in the 80s, said he was violently beaten and sexually abused by some of the female swamis. Bhakati Manning, also told the royal commission that said she was abused by two senior swamis in ashrams in Australia and 'by the spiritual founder of Satyananda yoga'. Several witnesses have also told the enquiry, the swami forced them to have sex and Shishy (pictured centre) was often present . She said the abuse happened when she was 15 at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram on NSW's Central Coast. She was 17 when she travelled to the famous Munger ashram in India in 1976 to study with the respected yogi whom she had met in Australia. Ms Manning, now 55, said shortly after her arrival, he fondled her genitals and said something to the effect 'this is our relationship, don't tell anyone'. He also taught her how to tie her dhoti - a traditional garment - so that it tucked between her legs. One woman has described how she was stripped and sexually assaulted at the age of seven while a number of men watched on . He said something to the effect of 'you have to protect what is mine from being seen', she said in her statement. The world-renowned yoga master died in 2009. The commission has already heard that Satyananda's disciple Swami Akhandananda, who was sent to lead the Mangrove Mountain ashram, used underage girls for sexual gratification. It also heard celibacy was a requirement at the ashrams and Akhandananda would beat people who were found to be having sex. Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate (pictured left) and Commissioner Helen Milroy (pictured right) during the opening address at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse public hearing  into the Satyananda Yoga Ashram at Mangrove Mountain . Children were sent out on what one witness referred to as 'F*** patrols', to spy on couples and report back. Akhandananda was jailed for sex abuse in 1989, but the conviction was overturned on a technicality in 1991. He died in 1997. Witnesses whose parents brought them to the Mangrove ashram in search of a utopian life have told how they were subject to depraved sexual practices by Akhandananda, who often summoned them by loudspeaker or had his partner Shishy bring them to him. The commission has already heard that Satyananda's disciple Swami Akhandananda, who was sent to lead the Mangrove Mountain ashram, used underage girls for sexual gratification.It also heard celibacy was a requirement at the ashrams and Akhandananda would beat people who were found to be having sex . On Wednesday APL told the commission that facilities at the Mangrove ashram were basic, with children often going hungry. Their heads were shaved, they wore orange robes and were made to do hard labour. APL later discovered the Swami and Shishy had a hot tub, a television and drank alcohol.

APL's sister also gave evidence on Wednesday, labelling an email sent by the ashram claiming a healing ceremony for victims last Easter was successful as an insult. She said it was particularly insulting that in the email the ashram was spouting rubbish about 'ego and embracing the darkness', because it was what Swami Akhandananda said when he was 'f***ing little girls and stealing people's lives'. Solicitor for the Mangrove ashram Aaron Keraghan apologised at the commission hearing on behalf of his clients and told two abuse victims on Wednesday the ashram would like to financially compensate them.","An enquiry into child sex abuse at Australia's oldest yoga ashram has found children were subjected to sexual abuse, starvation and neglect .

"She has not performed for five years and after an absence from Britain's concert circuit for 12 an appearance by world leading violinist Kyung Wha Chung was hotly anticipated. But her eagerly awaited return appeared to be overshadowed after the Korean violinist, once a childhood star, lambasted the parents of a child who had coughed through part of her performance. After reaching the first break in her initial piece the violinist appeared to have become exasperated with a child among the many families at the Royal Festival Hall coughing, and told them 'maybe bring her back when she's older,' according to several members of the audience. Scroll down for video . Korean violinist Kyung Wha Chung appeared at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Tuesday - her first performance in the UK in 12 years - and told parents of a coughing child to bring her back when she's older. She is pictured practicing at the Royal Festival Hall before her first performance in 5 years after a finger injury . Representatives for the soloist said the audience had an 'unusually' high amount of families and the coughing had being going on for almost a minute after she briefly paused following the first of three movements as she performed Mozart's G Major Sonata. Her reaction was met with mixed responses. Violinist Thomas Gould said it was 'difficult to be charmed' by the violinist after she upbraided the parents in what he described as a 'curious outburst.' He wrote on Twitter: 'The raised temperatures added an extra belligerence to her taut Prokofiev.' Others feared the child may be discouraged from going to former concert performances following the very public put-down and branded Wha Chung as 'arrogant' and 'childish'. However some praised the violinist for speaking up about the difficulties performing to a noisy audience. Ciaobimba posted on Twitter: 'Another evening where London showed its bad Audience Etiquette. Respect @kyungwhachung for taking a stand. Phenomenal concert and encores.' Adam Kirklady wrote: 'Brava Madame for taking noisy audience to task between movements of Mozart! Classy #respect #thanks' Wha Chung, 66, had not performed for five years after she suffered a finger injury and her appearance at the Royal Festival Hall was widely anticipated by fans of her music who flocked to see her play Mozart . The talented violinist was a young star, getting her big breakthrough in 1970 and playing the violin from six . Ms Wha Chung performed at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday evening - returning to the very stage that signalled her breakthrough in 1970. Details of her appearance led to such excitement that posters advertised her performance with the slogan 'the legend returns.' The talented musician, who was not available for comment today as she was on her way back to Korea, had not appeared on the concert circuit for five years after she suffered a finger injury. She became recognised as a child prodigy, reportedly already playing violin with orchestras in Korea from the age of nine. Ms Wha Chung performed at the Royal Festival Hall . A representative for the violinist said she had been pleased to  see so many children and 'spent more than an hour greeting them and signing autographs' after the performance. She said the violinist had spent more than 10 years supporting children's music projects. The Southbank Centre, which runs the Royal Festival Hall, said it had not received any complaints after the performance. A spokeswoman said: 'At this time of the year in particular, coughing isn't uncommon at events at any venue. Southbank Centre welcomes people of all ages including families and children and we offer a range of events, including classical music, specially designed with children in mind. 'We don't discourage parents or carers who wish to bring young people to an evening event and we do where possible check that they are aware of the nature of the event. 'We are aware that Kyung Wha Chung is also a keen supporter of young people experiencing classical music.'","Violinist Kyung Wha Chung performed at Royal Festival Hall, London .

"Worried: British Business Secretary Vince Cable, has warned of the dire consequences should the Euro collapse . Europe could be plunged into war if the euro collapses, Vince Cable warned last night. The Business Secretary said the consequences would be 'incalculable' for Europe and 'awful' for the UK but cautioned that there was 'no automatic guarantee' that Europe would not disintegrate into conflict. Mr Cable spoke out just two days after the European Union was handed the Nobel Peace Prize, an award that provoked widespread ridicule at a time when tensions over the single currency have led to violence and civil unrest across Europe. Mr Cable told an audience at the Cheltenham Literary Festival: 'I think we need to take stock that if the eurozone were to unravel in a way that destroyed the European project - and there is a risk that could happen - the consequences would be absolutely incalculable. 'We tend to forget, until we were reminded last week of that Nobel Prize, the European project was constructed in order to rescue Europe from extreme nationalism and conflict. There is no automatic guarantee that won't return.' The Business Secretary described the euro as 'very valuable' and said the UK would 'be heard very loudly if it does unravel'. He added: 'My sense is that the Germans in particular realise how much is at stake. A series of sensible measures have been taken in recent months. 'I think deep down there is enough common sense and a sense of survival to prevent this getting out of control. If it does, I'm afraid the consequences for us will be awful.'

"Researchers saw that the more time people spend commuting to and from work the less likely they are to be satisfied with life (illustrated with stock image) Being crammed in a train carriage with other grumpy and sweaty workers or sitting in endless traffic jams to get to work is no one’s idea of fun. Now researchers saw that the more time people spend commuting to and from work the less likely they are to be satisfied with life. Long journey times were also unsurprisingly linked to an increased sense of time pressure, with less time spent on hobbies, including exercise. Margo Hilbrecht, a professor in Applied Health Sciences at the University of Waterloo in Canada, said: ‘We found that the longer it takes someone to get to work, the lower their satisfaction with life in general’. Professor Hilbrecht, who is also associate director of research for the Canadian Index of Wellbeing says that bad traffic and delays are not always to blame. The study, published in World Leisure Journal, analysed data from Statistics Canada to understand the links between commute time and well-being. The researchers found that on top of being linked to lower life satisfaction, long commute lengths are related to an increased sense of time pressure. ‘Some people may enjoy a commute, but overall, longer travel time is linked to feelings of time crunch, which can increase stress levels,’ Professor Hilbrecht said. Lengthy commutes have already been linked to poor mental and physical health, including hypertension, obesity, low-energy and illness-related work absences. Beyond bad traffic, the researchers found one other factor to be highly correlated with commuters’ life satisfaction - physical activity. Lengthy commutes (illustrated) have already been linked to poor mental and physical health, including hypertension, obesity, low-energy and illness-related work absences . An office filled with pot plants can boost workers' happiness and productivity by 15 per cent, according to a study released in September. Researchers studied the effects of greenery on staff's perceptions of air quality, concentration, and workplace satisfaction, and monitored productivity levels over subsequent months in two large commercial offices in the UK and The Netherlands. Lead researcher Marlon Nieuwenhuis, from the School of Psychology, said: 'Our research suggests that investing in landscaping the office with plants will pay off through an increase in office workers quality of life and productivity.' 'Simply enriching a previously Spartan space with plants served to increase productivity by 15 per cent - a figure that aligns closely with findings in previously conducted laboratory studies.' ‘We learned that commuters who had time for physical leisure had higher life satisfaction,’ she said. ‘Physical activity can mitigate commuting-related stress if workers can include it in their daily routines, but the obvious constraint is time scarcity. Longer commutes mean less time for other activities, which leads to lower life satisfaction.’ Other factors linked to higher life satisfaction among commuters include flexible work hours and a higher household income. According to the study, women reported higher levels of time pressure, as did those with a partner. Professor Hilbrecht hopes that the new findings will help contribute to the development of programmes and policies to support better health for workers. ‘The message to employers is that encouraging flexible work hours or providing time for physical leisure can pay dividends in their employees’ satisfaction with life,’ she said. ‘A long commute is detrimental to health. Maybe it’s better to take a job that pays a little less money but is closer to home. If you have a choice, it’s worth looking at the impact of the commute on well-being.’ Long journey times were also unsurprisingly found to be linked to an increased sense of time pressure, with less time spent on hobbies, including exercise. 'A long commute is detrimental to health,' the leader of the study said. A nightmare commute including a traffic jam is illustrated with a stock picture .","Researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada say long commute times are linked to an increased sense of time pressure .

"David Cameron was shoved in the street by a member of the public this morning in a 'very significant security breach' - sparking an immediate inquiry by Scotland Yard. The Prime Minister was in Leeds to promote the Government's proposed high speed railway line. But as he came out of the city's Civic Hall a passing jogger ran up to him at speed forcing Mr Cameron to move out of the way while his surrounding security team look on. Within hours the Metropolitan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe had ordered an investigation into how the man was allowed to get so close to the PM. It comes less than a week after a lone-wolf gunman killed a soldier before attacking the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa. This afternoon jogger Dean Balboa Farley revealed he was the man who managed to run into Mr Cameron without being stopped by his security squad. The 28-year-old complained this afternoon he merely 'brushed' the Prime Minister only to be 'assaulted by half a dozen coppers in suits'. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister was shoved by a member of the public who was later arrested but then released . Mr Cameron was in Leeds city centre today when the major lapse of security occurred . Mr Cameron can be clearly seen bracing as he spots the jogger running towards him, while security appear oblivious . The Prime Minister looked back as he strolled towards his car after being bumped into by the runner . Response: Runner Dean Balboa Farley said he brushed the PM before being assaulted by police . The Metropolitan Police Specialist Protection Command and West Yorkshire Police will conduct a review of the 'incident', Scotland Yard said. A spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service is aware of an incident in Leeds today, Monday, 27 October, involving a 28-year-old man and the Prime Minister as he left the Civic Hall. 'The man was arrested by local officers and was later de-arrested. The MPS Specialist Protection Command is responsible for the personal protection of the Prime Minister and will now conduct a review of the incident in consultation with West Yorkshire Police.' Mr Cameron spotted the man running up to him and took a step back and to the left before security noticed and bundled the protester to the floor. The PM did not fall over and calmly walked to his waiting car before being driven away from the scene uninjured. One witness said Mr Cameron 'sidestepped' the man in a 'lovely little move'. The jogger had crossed the pavement towards the Prime Minister, clutching a white towel. Police took the 28-year-old man away. He was arrested but later released. West Yorkshire Police said that no threat had been made, adding: 'Nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time.' But Conservative MP Mark Pritchard demanded a full investigation into how the Metropolitan Police security team allowed the man to get so close to the Prime Minister. Security wrestled the man to the ground before hauling him off into a police van . The 28-year-old was arrested but released saying it was 'nothing sinister, just a man in the wrong place at the wrong time' He was arrested after Prime Minister David Cameron left Leeds Civic Hall after a conference on the planned HS2 rail links . The man was arrested outside Leeds Civic Hall but was later 'de-arrested' by officers who said he had not threatened the PM . Mr Pritchard said: 'The Met Police have some of the best close protection officers in the world. However, this was a clear breach of security and could have been far more sinister in outcome. 'With the terror threat level increased, this cannot be allowed to happen again. The Met Commissioner should call an immediate and swift internal inquiry to discover why this happened and implement the necessary lessons learned as quickly as possible.' Former Royal protection officer Steve Park said Mr Cameron's security had taken their 'eye off the ball'. He said: 'They were concentrating on the Prime Minister rather than looking outwardly at the attackers. 'It's a serious security breach. The Prime Minister has then been allowed to stand alone and look at it for a momentary time. 'What should have happened is something called cover and protect. A protection officer puts his hand on the head of the Prime Minister and straight into the waiting car. 'It's a very significant security breach. For an attacker to be able to get to a Prime Minister. I don't remember that happening before.' But Mr Cameron later played down the incident, telling MPs: 'Could I put on the record for once the debt I owe to the close protection teams that look after me and the very good job that they do.' Making light of the incident, he added: 'John Prescott was in the room as I gave the speech so as I left the room, I thought the moment of maximum danger had probably passed. But clearly that wasn't the case.' In 2001 Labour former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott punched a protester who egged him. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said Mr Cameron expressed his 'gratitude and confidence' in the protection team. Downing Street will co-operate with the Met's review of the incident, the spokesman added. Witness Chris Wilson described the man as 'just a typical hippy type', adding: 'It looked like Cameron sidestepped him. It was a lovely little move' Mr Cameron was escorted into a waiting car after the incident in Leeds . Following the incident today, Chief Inspector Derek Hughes said: 'Around midday, a 28-year-old local man was briefly arrested after he came close to the prime minister's group who had just left the civic hall in Leeds. 'No threats were made, and after the man's details were checked, he was de-arrested and allowed on his way.' Witness Chris Wilson described the man as 'just a typical hippy type'. He said: 'It looked like Cameron sidestepped him. It was a lovely little move. He should be on the stage, really. 'And then he was tackled by the person behind. And then he (Cameron) was in the car and the car was gone. 'They were on him. They were like flies round poo. One minute he was down, then he was up again and moving. It was fast.' Mr Wilson said the man ran about 10 yards across the road towards the Prime Minister. He said he was white, with a beard and dreadlocks. Downing Street this afternoon refused to comment on the incident.","As the PM walked out of Leeds Civic Hall a protester ran up and shoved him .

"Police across America are killing more people than FBI statistics show, it has been revealed today. An official tally misses hundreds of fatal shootings by law-enforcement officers between 2007 and 2012 . More than 550 killings by police were not reported to the FBI over the five-year period, according to fresh analysis. Official FBI statistics miss out hundreds of fatal shootings by law-enforcement officers between 2007 and 2012 (file picture) It comes amid calls for greater transparency over such killings after Michael Brown was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, in August. The Wall Street Journal asked for the internal records on fatal shootings by police from America’s 110 biggest police departments and received figures from 105 of them. The newspaper says it counted up 1,800 such killings from the figures supplied between 2007 and 2012. But this was about 45 per cent more than the FBI’s figure for ‘justifiable homicides’ in those departments which was 1,242. The Journal says its findings show that ‘it is nearly impossible to determine how many people are killed by the police each year’. It quotes Alexia Cooper, who studies the FBI data in her position at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, as saying: 'Does the FBI know every agency in the U.S. that could report but has chosen not to? The answer is no. There have been  calls for more transparency over fatal shootings by police after the death in August of Michael Brown in Ferguson (file picture) 'What we know is that some places have chosen not to report these, for whatever reason.' Local law-enforcement agencies are not necessarily required to provide the FBI with records, including data showing which killings were carried out by police, cbsnews reports. The Journal quotes an FBI spokesman as saying that the agency uses 'established statistical methodologies and norms' when reviewing data sent to it by agencies. He said the FBI then checks the information it is given and asks each agency 'to correct or verify questionable data'. Cbsnews quotes Lori Lightfoot, a lawyer with experience of investigating police shootings for the Chicago police department, as saying: 'A police officer is not like a normal citizen who discharges their weapon. 'There is a presumption that somebody who is a peace officer, and is thereby authorized to use lethal force, used it correctly.'","More than 550 killings by police not included in FBI figures between 2007 and 2012 .

Travel searches are down by nearly half after the it was revealed Ray Cole had been imprisoned in the Moroccan city, according to travel website Trivago.co.uk. Travel interest to Morocco as a whole is said to have slumped by 31 per cent. Scroll down for video . Price comparison website Trivago say that hotel searches to Marrakesh have decreased by 46 per cent since it was revealed that British tourist Ray Cole had been imprisoned last month . Mr Cole, 69, from Kent, flew back into Gatwick Airport on Tuesday after spending 20 days in jail in the north African country, a move which prompted a huge backlash across the world. He was detained along with his friend Jamal Jam Wald Nass when police found 'homosexual images' on his phone. Foreign Office guidelines state that homosexuality is a crime in Morocco. He described the experience as a 'total nightmare' on his return to the UK. As the news of Mr Cole's arrest and imprisonment spread, campaigners took to Morocco's official tourism Facebook page to urge potential visitors to avoid the country . Mr Cole, 69, from Kent, spent 20 days in jail in the north African country after police found 'homosexual images' on his phone . Mr Cole was four weeks into a five-week holiday in Morocco when he was detained by police. He had gone to Marrakech to see 20-year-old Jamal Jam Wald Nass after developing a friendship on Facebook. The pair were stopped by police in Marrakesh as they were waiting at a bus stop. A campaign with the #freeraycole hashtag was set up on Twitter along side a Facebook page and online petition. As the news spread throughout the media, campaigners took to Morocco's official tourism Facebook page to urge potential visitors to avoid the country. Mr Cole said on his return: 'I've seen things I never knew existed. It's not a prison, it's a concentration camp.' Mr Cole, 69, from Kent, flew back into Gatwick Airport on Tuesday where he was reunited with his family . He said the attitudes to homosexuality in Morocco 'are about 100 years out of date'. 'They seemed to think that I was some kind of sex tourist, but I'm not and I wasn't.' When hotel searches made by UK travellers on Monday 6 and Tuesday 7 October were compared to searches made on the same days the previous week (September 29 and 30), Trivago found that interest to Marrakesh had dropped by 46 per cent. Although the largest decline in hotel searches occurred in Marrakech, travel interest to Morocco as a whole decreased by 31 per cent over the same period. With most stories reported in the media on Monday, October 6, this day saw the greatest decline in travel interest. Compared to Monday, September 29, hotel searches decreased by 52 per cent in Marrakech and 40 per cent to the country as a whole. Trivago is the world's largest hotel price comparison website, and the survey is based on website visits from 75 million global monthly users. Morocco has been a popular destination for British tourist who travel to the north African country for winter sun . Denise Bartlett, a spokesman for Trivago, said: 'With campaigners on Morocco's official tourism Facebook page deeming the country unsafe for British tourists, it seems their plan to boycott the country was initially successful. 'Forty six per cent is a significant decrease rarely seen in popular tourist destinations. For example, following the military coup in Thailand in May 2014, hotel searches decreased by just 26 per cent. 'Although the British tourist in question has now been released, it will be interesting to see if tourists continue to avoid the destination. 'Morocco is a year-round popular choice among UK holidaymakers, while Agadir is a popular winter sun destination. 'Morocco's tourism economy would no doubt suffer from a sharp decline in British tourists.'","Hotel searches in Marrakesh down by 46% following Ray Cole's arrest .

"Companies have been given the green light for testing driverless cars in the UK next year. The decision was announced by government quango Innovate UK, after George Osborne’s Autumn Statement. Bristol, Greenwich in south east London and Coventry and Milton Keynes will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting from January 2015. Scroll down for video . The future? Companies have been given the green light for testing driverless cars in the UK next year. Bristol, Greenwich in south east London and Coventry and Milton Keynes (illustrated) will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting from January 2015 . It is hoped that testing driverless cars in a real-world environment will help lead to greater levels of understanding of the vehicles and will allow the public to imagine how the cars could fit into everyday life. Milton Keynes and Coventry will share the UK Autodrive programme, which involves Ford, Jaguar Land Rover as well as a number of universities and engineering consultancies. They will test self-driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self-driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in Milton Keynes. Coventry and Milton Keynes: Engineers involved in the Autodrive Programme will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads. Driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of Milton Keynes. Greenwich: The Gateway project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking. Bristol: The insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the Venturer consortium. The programme will also look at how cars cope with the city's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public. One of the focuses of the trial will be developing infrastructure to best interact with the cars. Tim Armitage, of engineering consultancy, Arup, told the BBC: ‘Our plan with the practical demonstration phases is to start testing with single vehicles on closed roads, and to build up to a point where all road users, as well as legislators, the police and insurance companies, are confident about how driverless pods and fully and partially autonomous cars can operate safely on UK roads.’ In Greenwich, the Gateway project will test automated electric shuttles buses, plus robotic valet parking for driverless cars. The scheme involves General Motors, the AA and RAC. Finally, experts in Bristol will investigate the insurance implications of driverless vehicles and study the public’s response to the technology. The Venturer consortium programme ‘aims to deepen understanding of the impact on road users and wider society and open up new opportunities for our economy and society,’ Innovate UK said. The hilly city’s challenging terrain will also allow engineers to see how the cars cope with busy, winding roads. Milton Keynes and Coventry will share the UK Autodrive programme (pictured), which involves Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, universities and engineering consultancies. They will test self-driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self-driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in Milton Keynes . It’s hoped that the data collected will be used to successfully introduce driverless cars in cities and towns across the UK to reduce congestion, improve air quality and use roads more efficiently and safely. The chancellor announced an extra £9 million in funding for the new technology, adding to £10 million already promised in the summer. In Greenwich, the Gateway project will test automated electric shuttle vehicles (pictured), plus robotic valet parking for driverless cars. The scheme involves General Motors, the AA and RAC . Experts in Bristol (pictured) will investigate the insurance implications of driverless vehicles and study the public’s response to the technology. The hilly city’s challenging terrain will also allow engineers to see how the cars cope with busy, winding roads . The trials aim to reveal what the UK public thinks of autonomous technology. Meanwhile, a study by eBay Motors revealed that 84 per cent of Americans want to continue driving their own cars and not rely on autonomous technology. Almost four in 10 people think self-driving cars might save them money and three quarters of respondents think it is important that the technology could reduce the amount of greenhouse gases belched out by vehicles. Approximately 56 per cent of Americans think self-driving cars will result in fewer accidents, while 15 per cent predict they will cause more crashes. Being able to do other tasks while travelling in a car, not having to park and lower insurance rates are popular reasons to buy one, but the largest worry is liability in the event of a crash. The aim is to establish the UK as the global hub for the research, development and integration of driverless vehicles and associated technologies. ‘Cars that drive themselves would represent the most significant transformation in road travel since the introduction of the internal combustion engine and at Innovate UK, we want to help the UK to lead the world in making that happen,' said Nick Jones, lead technologist for the low carbon vehicle innovation platform at Innovate UK. ‘There are so many new and exciting technologies that can come together to make driverless cars a reality, but it’s vital that trials are carried out safely, that the public have confidence in that technology and we learn everything we can through the trials so that legal, regulation and protection issues don’t get in the way in the future.’ Paula Marie Brown from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: ‘Driverless vehicles have huge potential to transform the UK’s transport network. They could improve road safety, reduce congestion and lower emissions. Bristol, Greenwich in south east London and Coventry and Milton Keynes (all marked on) will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting from January 2015 . The trials will allow experts to tackle the question of driver responsibility. Ms Brown from the IET said: 'The trials will also need to address liability in the case of an accident. Today the car driver is liable, but in the future will it be the car manufacturer or owner – and how will insurance companies adapt to this? ‘But there are new levels of risks that need to be considered when there is a combination of driverless and driven vehicles on the roads. ‘To ensure a safe system of operation, the driverless car test trials require not only a good level of user skill and experience, but the user should also be able to demonstrate a good understanding of the systems in the car, the potential failure modes, how faults are indicated and most importantly how they will take swift and decisive control of the vehicle if they suspect there is a fault. ‘The trials will also need to address liability in the case of an accident. Today the car driver is liable, but in the future will it be the car manufacturer or owner – and how will insurance companies adapt to this? ‘As a minimum, when approving automated vehicle testing on public roads, manufacturers must accept that software in their vehicles attracts the same liability as the physical components of the vehicle. ‘Perhaps the biggest question mark will be around cyber security. The reliability and security of software used in driverless cars will be a major cause of concern for manufacturers and insurers. ‘If hackers found a way to target vehicles, this could present a whole new set of challenges that the industry is not currently equipped to tackle.’","Bristol, Greenwich, in south east London and Coventry and Milton Keynes will all host autonomous driving projects that will run from January 2015 .

"The family of a seven-month-old baby, who was tortured and killed by his mother's de facto husband, has called on Immigration Minister Scott Morrison to ensure the killer is deported when he is released next week. Ex-boxer Christopher Hoerler, 37, was sentenced to 14 years and four months - after prosecutors appealed the initial term of 11 years - for the manslaughter of Jordan Anderson-Smith in Wagga Wagga in 2000. At the time of Jordan's murder, Hoerler was living de facto with Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson and Jordan's two half-brothers, who were aged 2 and 4. Hoerler has been granted parole and is expected to be released next Thursday. Jordan would have turned 15 on July 24. A photo of baby Jordan Anderson, taken shortly before his death. Christopher Hoerler tortured the seven-month-old to death in Wagga Wagga on February 25, 2000.  The Crown prosecutor found that Jordan died from multiple injuries, including bruises and abrasions to his face, a torn lip, liver and bowel damage and crushed toes - which were inflicted when Hoerler put his then-girlfriend's son's toes in a clamp. Christopher Hoerler will be released from prison on August 14 for the brutal murder of baby Jordan. Jordan's family are petitioning, to ensure Hoerler will be deported upon his release. Baby Jordan died following a party at which his mother and her live-in boyfriend were drinking and smoking cannabis at their home in Wagga Wagga, NSW on February 25, 2000. Hoerler was tried for murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter 20 months after Jordan was killed. Jordan choked on his own vomit after being beaten and tortured by Hoerler, with injuries including a lacerated liver, a torn lip, facial abrasions and broken ribs. His toes had also been crushed by a clamp. The forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem found that the baby's 'palate injury was caused by a blow to the jaw, and the abdominal injury by a non-penetrating blow or blows of considerable force'. Jordan's injuries were so extensive that they took four days to document. Jordan's father, Cecil Smith, had contacted the Department of Community Services when he believed Hoerler was showering with Jordan. While Hoerler had his visa cancelled after he was convicted, and the parole board says he will be released into the custody of Immigration officials to be deported to Papua New Guinea, the family is not convinced and want assurances from the immigration minister. Louise Anderson (right) pictured leaving court in 2003 after giving evidence at her ex-boyfriend, Christopher Hoerler's trial. Hoerler was found guilty of torturing and Murdering Ms Anderson's seven-month-old son, Jordan. He will be released on August 14. The family has launched an online petition, calling on Mr Morrison to ensure Hoerler is deported when he is released on August 14. His sentence was due to expire in February 2016. 'The Smith family are extremely disappointed in the decision the parole board has made to release this convicted child killer back into the community' a statement on the petition website said. In a statement, the State Parole Authority says in granting parole, it considered Hoerler's good prison performance and completion of programs addressing his offending behaviour. Cecil Smith (left), the father of the late baby Jordan, pictured leaving court in 2003 with his brother, Darcy Smith (right), who is acting as the family's spokesman. Darcy Smith is appealing to the Minister for Immigration, Scott Morrison to ensure Jordan's murderer, Christopher Hoerler, is deported when he is released from prison next week on August 14, 2014. Jordan's mother, Louise Anderson, is pictured leaving her baby's murder trial in 2003. Christopher Hoerler was found guilty of brutally murdering seven-month-old, Jordan Anderson-Smith. Hoerler was Mrs Anderson's live-in boyfriend at the time of the murder. Jordan's uncle, Darcy Smith has become the family's spokesman and is appealing to the public to support the petition and for the minister to 'step up to the plate' and ensure Hoerler is ousted. Mr Smith believes Hoerler may appeal the deportation condition of his release because he had children in Australia and wanted to be a father to them, Fairfax newspapers say. 'He is trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat to stay in the country,' Mr Smith said. 'I hope the minister is smart enough to see through that.' Previously, Mr Smith has spoken of the family's intense and unrelenting grief. 'We are the ones living with the life sentence. We have to live without Jordan every day.' They explained that their mother, Jordan's paternal grandmother, visits Jordan's grave every Sunday. The Smith family have previously explained that Hoerler had moved into the home only three weeks before he murdered Jordan. Hoerler met Ms Anderson on New Year's Eve in 1999, but by less than two months later, on February 25, 2000, he killed her son. The baby's father had attended school with Hoeler and once considered him a friend. Two parole applications have been rejected since July 2012, when his 10 year 9 month non-parole period expired.","Christopher Hoerler was sentenced to 14 years & 4 months in jail in 2000 .

"Say goodbye to traipsing around the shops or spending hours online searching for the right Christmas present, as more people admit they are giving homemade gifts this year. Thanks to TV shows such as Kirstie Allsopp's Homemade Christmas, families are going back to basics to save cash and give presents with a personal touch. Almost a third of the nation (29 per cent) will receive a handcrafted present this Christmas, with cards, jam, chutney and knitwear among the most popular, according to a survey. Programmes such as Kirstie's Homemade Christmas have inspired Brits get inspired to craft their own gifts . More than one in four (26 per cent) are turning to 'upcycling' to create unique gifts. And one in six (17 per cent) will either host or attend a Christmas craft party this year, the study of more than 1,000 people revealed. However, the hard work isn't going to waste, as more than half (57 per cent) of people believe receiving a handcrafted present means more than something bought on the High Street or online. The most popular homemade gifts include hand-painted candle holders, gift baskets and homemade Christmas cards. As well as gifts, crafty Britons also plan on customising decorations for their home with 16 per cent planning to pick up a paint brush this year to embellish their own baubles, photo frames and nativity scenes.

Nearly two-thirds of the women polled (63 per cent) say that receiving a homemade present means more to them than a shop bought gift. And 30 per cent of men plan to give someone a handmade gift this year. Crafting your own presents is also cost effective too, with the research suggesting people who make Christmas gifts at home save an average £40.38 compared to High Street and online spenders. People believe the homemade trend has been sparked by design websites such as Pinterest with one in five (19 per cent) clicking for craft inspiration, while 25 per cent cited TV shows such as Kirstie Allsopp's Homemade Christmas as providing inspiration. Though the research suggests we are often inspired by our friends efforts, with 30 per cent admitting they had been spurred into getting crafty by gifts people had previously received. Other sources of inspiration included  fairs (26 per cent) and magazines (25 per cent). Johnny Corbett, senior marketing manager at Dulux, which carried out the survey, said that the sentimentality of a handmade Christmas has proved particularly appealing this year. 'The analogy of a letter meaning so much more than an email has spread into Christmas presents this year with people across the UK looking to give their loved ones a present from the heart, not just from a High Street store. 'The personal touch is priceless and giving a personalised present will last much longer in the memory than a gift voucher, or the Christmas classic, a pair of socks.'","Almost a third of us are likely to receive a handmade present this year .

"For commuters it is perhaps the most baffling annual excuse for delays and cancellations on the railways: Leaves on the line. But there may now be a solution to the problem and it involves zapping autumn litter into oblivion with lasers. Dutch rail company Nederlandse Spoorwegen has revealed it is working with the Delft University of Technology and a British inventor to fit powerful lasers under two of its trains to burn away leaves from the tracks. Scroll down for video . Falling leaves from trees beside railway tracks led to  4.5 million hours of passenger delays last year, so rail operators hope a new laser system will help them clear the dangerous leafy mulch that builds up on rails . The technology will use intense beams of infrared light to vaporise the build up of material on the rails before the wheels of the train passes over them. Fallen leaves cause delays on the rail network because they can cover and stick to the tracks when wet. This can make the tracks slippery in itself, but the problem becomes worse when heavy metal train wheels pass over the top, as the leaves get sucked under the wheels and crushed, compacting the material into a hard, shiny substance that has been compared to Teflon. When this layer becomes wet, the tracks become excessively slippery and braking distances can double. Once stationary, trains can also struggle to get going again as they are unable to get traction on the tracks. Leaf mulch can also insulate train wheels from the rails, meaning signallers get less information about the location of trains on the network, meaning trains need to run with bigger spaces between them. Yet despite this, leaves on the line remains the excuse most likely to infuriate train travellers each autumn as they struggle to understand why rail companies cannot be better prepared for this problem. The perennial excuse of fallen leaves  causing travel chaos has long been seen as a running joke, but according to Network Rail in the UK, leaves caused 4.5 million hours of passenger delays in 2013. The laser device sits just in front of the wheels while a specially designed suspension system helps to keep the high powered beam focused on the layer of mulch that builds up on rails as leaves get wet and break down . Methods including brushing and grinding the rails, washing with jets of water or ice have all been tried, but with limited success. Now researchers at Delft University of Technology have been developing a system with the Dutch rail engineering firm Strukton Rail, the national network ProRail and train operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen. ‘We are now investigating whether offers laser solution,’ Jurjen Hendriks, one of the researchers at Delft University of Technology told the website Kennislink. The Laser Railhead Cleaner (LRC) which has been installed by the researchers on a Nederlandse Spoorwegen DM-90 train, sits under the train just in front of the wheels. Most current methods for removing mulch from train tracks use high powered jets of water to wash the rails . The device uses a Nd:YAG laser to pulses of laser light with a wavelength of around 1,064 nanometres, which is infrared. According to experts the wavelength used is specifically absorbed by the leaves and other organic matter that can build up on the tracks, but not by metal. This means that the energy from the lasers is reflected off the rails without damaging them while the leaf material is vaporised, a process known as ablation. A spokesman for Strukton Rail said: ‘The LRC briefly heats the organic material on the rails and because the organic material expands more rapidly it separates from the rails. The Laser Railhead Cleaner system is being trialed underneath Nederlandse Spoorwegen DM-90 trains . Lasers can be used to detect when fruits like apples, bananas, pears and tomatoes reach their 'peak' for eating. Researchers from Saint Joseph University in Lebanon and the Université de Bretagne Occidentale de Brest in France have developed a technique that looks at the speckling of the skin of fruits. As climacteric fruits like apples and bananas mature and ripen on the tree, it is important to pick them at exactly the right moment. After this point the fruit becomes vulnerable to fungi or starts to rot. The researchers found they could analyse the speckle patterns on the skin of Golden apples as they ripened by looking at the way the laser light was scattered and reflected from apple skin. This changed as the fruit ripened. The researchers hope the technique can be used to help farmers pick their fruit at exactly the right time. ‘What’s more, rust bursts away as well. The rails are cleaned and dried as a result, preventing any other material from adhering to them for some time. ‘Tests have shown that because they are solid, rails and other infrastructural objects are not damaged by the ablation process.’ The Laser Railhead Cleaner technology was first invented by a former Royal Navy Officer called Malcolm Higgins, who has developed the technology under the company name LaserThor. Tests on his technology between 1999 and 2004 were conducted by RailTrack and its predecessor Network Rail but revealed that it struggled to focus the laser correctly on the track due to vibrations as the trains picked up speed. However, Mr Higgins proved that dirt and moisture were vaporised from the track at speeds just over 6mph. He later teamed up with the German Fraunhofer institute in Aachen and the Rofin Sinar laser firm in Hamburg to develop a more powerful laser. This used a two kilowatts of infrared laser light that produced 25,000 pulses per second. This heated the leafy mulch to temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees, causing it to vanish from the rails. Further tests with Network Rail showed it was successful at speaks of up to 40mph, but Network Rail said it chose not to take the tests further. Mr Higgins has now been working with Strukton Rail and Delft University as a consultant on the project. They have been able to improve the system so that it can clean 20mm of rail head on both sides of the track at speeds of up to 50mph. Their device also uses a suspension system to help protect the optics of the laser from vibrations while the laser also temporarily switches off if it misses its target. Instead of lasers, Network rail said it is now concentrating on using high pressure jet washing technology to bash away leaf mulch and laying down a composite of sand and aluminium onto the tracks to aid traction. The laser is focused onto the rail head so that pulses of intense light vaporise any organic material that has built up on the surface of the tracks . This year Network Rail has also begun using new technology called a tribometer, a handheld device that accurately measures how slippery the rails are, on its network in Merseyside. Data from this device is then used to assess the effectiveness of treatments and whether more are needed, according to the company. But lasers also have advantages as sand and water tanks need to be regularly refilled while water jets can damage the rails. They claim their laser is so precise it can etch a diagram into the head of a match without setting it alight. Professor Rolf Dollevoet, who is leading the new trials at Delft University of Technology, said: ‘The question is not so much whether the laser system works, but for how long the rails will remain clean. ‘We’ll measure the remaining friction over time during rain, drizzle, frost and snowfall. ‘From these measurements NS and Prorail can derive at what frequency the 6,000km  of track need to be lasered and how many trains have to be equipped with lasers to achieve that.’","Infrared laser vaporises slippery layer that forms on tracks from leaf mulch .

"Women who drink throughout pregnancy will not be criminalised after a landmark ruling today (posed by  model) Women who drink alcohol while pregnant will not be criminalised after a landmark ruling today. It comes after a test case held at the Court of Appeal ruled that a young child is not entitled to criminal injuries compensation after her mother drank half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of lager a day while she was pregnant with her. The girl, now six, was born with foetal alcohol syndrome and suffered growth retardation as a result of her mother's drinking. Lawyers for child 'CP', who cannot be named for legal reasons, had asked three judges to rule in a test case that the girl is entitled to compensation. But the appeal judges unanimously ruled: 'The central reason is that we have held that a mother who is pregnant and who drinks to excess despite knowledge of the potential harmful consequence to the child of doing so is not guilty of a criminal offence under our law if her child is subsequently born damaged as a result.' If the appeal had succeeded it could have paved the way for pregnant women's behaviour to be criminalised, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) and Birthrights. Lawyers for the child say that view was 'misplaced speculation'. Ann Furedi, chief executive of the Bpas, and Rebecca Schiller, co-chair of Birthrights, welcomed the court's unanimous decision, saying: 'This is an extremely important ruling for women everywhere. 'The UK's highest courts have recognised that women must be able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies.' The appeal judges heard that a large number of similar claims for compensation by children allegedly harmed by alcohol in the womb were awaiting the outcome of CP's appeal, with solicitors already instructed in around 80 cases. Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Treacy and Lady Justice King, considered the case recently at a one-day hearing. The judges were told that the mother was drinking 'an enormous amount' while pregnant with CP, including a half-bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day, and the child was born with an alcohol-related disease. It comes after a test case held at the Court of Appeal ruled that a young child is not entitled to criminal injuries compensation after her mother drank half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of lager a day while she was pregnant with her (posed by model) John Foy QC, appearing for CP, said that was the equivalent of 40-57 units of alcohol a day. Guidelines issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) were that 7.5 units might damage a foetus. Mr Foy was representing a council in the North West of England which now has responsibility for CP and was seeking an award on her behalf under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. He said the mother 'was aware of the dangers to her baby of her excessive consumption during pregnancy'. He added: 'She was reckless as to whether there would be harm to the foetus. She foresaw that harm might be caused but went on to take the risk.' CP was born in June 2007 with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), also referred to as foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). It can cause retarded growth, facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment. Her compensation claim was based on the assertion that her mother had committed an offence against her as defined under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 by drinking excessively during pregnancy. Ben Collins, appearing for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), asked the court to reject CP's legal challenge. He told the judges: 'There is a conflict of ideas about what is or is not dangerous, not only in terms of drink but also in terms of smoking and food.' If the appeal at the Court of Appeal had succeeded it could have paved the way for pregnant women's behaviour to be criminalised, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) and Birthrights . Mr Collins asked whether 'a pregnant mother who eats unpasteurised cheese or a soft boiled egg knowing there is a risk that it could give rise to a risk of harm to the foetus' might also find herself accused of a crime. FASD was diagnosed 252 times in England in 2012 to 2013. CP's compensation application was initially rejected by the CICA in November 2009 on the grounds that she had not sustained an injury 'directly attributable to a crime of violence', as required by the Offences Against the Person Act. A first-tier tribunal allowed her initial appeal but the Upper Tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber ruled last December that the law required a crime to be committed against an individual 'person' - and a child did not become a person until birth. The Upper Tribunal concluded: 'If (the girl) was not a person while her mother was engaging in the relevant actions then, as a matter of law, her mother could not have committed a criminal offence.' Asking the appeal judges to quash the Upper Tribunal decision, Mr Foy argued CP had been a person entitled to compensation while still a foetus and the crime committed against had similar ingredients to manslaughter. Alternatively, she became entitled to an award when she was born and was suffering the continuing consequences of her alcoholic mother's drinking. Mr Foy said CP was the young mother's second pregnancy and the woman was well aware of the risks. But she had recklessly 'administered a noxious thing - a destructive thing' to her unborn daughter and inflicted grievous bodily harm for which the child should be compensated. Dismissing CP's appeal, Lord Justice Treacy said an 'essential ingredient' for a crime to be committed 'is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - grievous bodily harm on a foetus will not suffice'. A mother who admitted drinking  two bottles of wine a day while pregnant has said she believes she has permanently damaged one of her two children. The woman - who spoke to Radio 5 Live named only as Kathryn - said she feels guilt over her excessive drinking, but said she was an alcoholic and lost 'the power of choice'. She told the interview that she came from a happy, stable family but started drinking every night after finishing university. Every night soon became every lunchtime too and she eventually lost her high-profile job. But she said when she discovered she was pregnant at the age of 30, she was delighted. 'I knew 100 per cent I would not drink if I was pregnant, because I couldn't do that to a child. 'But because I am an alcoholic I don't have that choice, I lost that power of choice, and after a month I relapsed and I started drinking.' Kathryn said she was drinking as much as two bottles of wine a day but played down just how much she was consuming throughout her first pregnancy. Despite this her first child was healthy and was monitored by doctors for two years after he was born, and did not appear to have suffered any long term damage. But during her second pregnancy, Kathryn said she relapsed after the first trimester and started to drink 'a hell of a lot' Now she fears her son, who is seven is siffering the long term effects. She said: 'It is behavioural, poor concentration, bad language, poor social behaviour, poor eye contact. 'I chose not to tell the doctors about my drinking because of the stugma of it, and he was diagnosed as being on autistic spectrum. 'I really struggled with it, and felt guilty, thinking it was me who had done it to him. But I was ill at the time, I lost that choice. All I can do now is be a sober mum to him.' Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder is an umbrella term describing disabilities and behavioural problems suffered by children as a result of their mother's drinking while pregnant. There are no reliable figures for how many children and adults in the UK have it. But some experts say one in every 250 babies is born with it – more than 3,000 in this country a year. Children tend to suffer behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, learning difficulties and epilepsy. They also often have distinct physical features including a flat face, snub nose and widely spaced eyes. The severity of the problem usually depends on how much their mother drank – but it will remain with them for the rest of their lives. The disorder is caused by alcohol flowing through the placenta into the foetus and damaging cells in the brain and spinal cord. Some studies have found that the alcohol causes most harm during the early stages of pregnancy when these organs are developing. The NHS advises women not to drink any alcohol during pregnancy but, if they must, to limit themselves to one to two units once or twice a week, and never get drunk. But figures show that only half of all pregnant women give up alcohol completely during pregnancy and most do not cause their babies any harm. Some experts say the condition is triggered by a complex range of factors including genes, a mother's age and her diet – as well as alcohol.","Woman, then 17, drank vodka and beer while pregnant with second child .

"The celebrated Class of ’92, some of whom are destined to take charge of leading football clubs, have rubber-stamped their first managerial sacking as co-owners of non-League Salford City. The Manchester United quintet of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville endorsed the Salford management’s decision to part company with assistant Stuart Rudd. Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville are co-owners of Salford City . Former United stars Butt, Scholes, Gary Neville and Giggs have ambitious plans for Salford City . Popular former Salford player Rudd had caused the club embarrassment by sending Northern Premier League side Trafford FC winger Shelton Payne a text inquiring about his availability and telling him Scholes rated him. Salford, very aware of the need to conduct all their business correctly because of the scrutiny the Class of ’92 attracts, saw that the Rudd text could be considered an illegal approach — especially as it was made public on Twitter. Added to that was the use of Scholes’s name when the former midfielder has never seen Payne play. Giggs, Scholes, Butt and and the Neville brothers were part of the Class of '92 at Manchester United . Rudd is understood to be upset at the way he was dismissed by chairwoman Karen Baird this week without being given a reason shortly after being asked to sign a confidentiality agreement. Salford have announced Rudd’s departure as part of a ‘reshuffle’. The reasons why 2014 FA Cup final referee Lee Probert (above) has not taken charge of a game since the Wembley showcase is another example of the chronic lack of transparency surrounding the Professional Game Match Officials Ltd. All they say is Probert is injured but will not reveal any more detail apart from him being due back on the elite referee match-list by the end of this month. The Lawn Tennis Association, whose ridiculous extravagance was highlighted by the £640,000 annual package paid to Roger Draper, don’t seem to have learned anything since low-key Canadian Michael Downey took the helm. New communications and marketing director Alex Mawer has decided he needs more help in promoting tennis so the LTA have promptly chucked another £200,000 a year at four more PR jobs described as ‘new unique roles’.

London Mayor Boris Johnson will no doubt revel in being the official NFL coin tosser on Sunday. The toss before a regular-season game has been done by the referee since 1921. But Boris is conducting the ceremony before the Jacksonville-Dallas game at Wembley. Blame the topsoil, Roy . The FA are blaming the poor state of their Wembley pitch on too much topsoil being applied in the summer — rather than the American football games which have upset England manager Roy Hodgson. It’s seen by the FA as a technical problem that can be resolved, with the surface back in pristine condition before two Rugby World Cup games and three NFL matches next autumn provide another big test. Jacksonville Jaguars take on Dallas Cowboys at Wembley just days before England's Euro 2016 qualifier . Meanwhile, it has caused considerable surprise within the NFL that Hodgson should be so negative about American football at Wembley when FA general secretary Alex Horne had so recently described bringing an NFL franchise to the national stadium as a priority. There can be no complaints for a change about England teams failing to utilise their £100million St George’s Park training facility during the upcoming international week. Seven England sides — seniors, Under 21, U20, U19, women, cerebral palsy and blind — will be in residence and all will be respecting the 11am two-minute Armistice Day silence on Tuesday.

"A skeleton excavated from a grave in Croatia has reignited the intense debate raging over whether the explorer Christopher Columbus and his crew introduced syphilis to Europe in the 15th century. A new study claims to have disproved the theory, instead suggesting the sexually transmitted disease, which can result in death, was present in Europe before the explorers returned from the Americas. The disease, which is caused by the bacteria, treponema pallidum, causes symptoms ranging from a sore throat and rash to problems with the heart, blood vessels and brain which can trigger stroke, heart disease, dementia, paralysis and even death. Ever since the first  case was recorded in Europe  in 1495 - three years after Columbus's first voyage to the New World - experts have argued over its origins. Three core theories exist attempting to explain where it first emerged, and its rapid spread through Europe at the end of the 15th century. Experts have long debated the origin of syphilis. A popular theory is that the disease originated in the New World, the Americas, and was transported to Europe by the explorer Christopher Columbus and his crew . The sexually transmitted disease causes symptoms ranging from a sore throat and rash to problems with the brain, heart and blood vessels that can trigger stroke, heart disease, paralysis and even death . Scientists at the University of Split in Croatia claim to have unearthed a skeleton of a man showing signs of syphilis dating from a Roman grave. They claim the bent thigh bone, pictured, is proof of the disease . The first, the Columbian theory, assumes syphilis was introduced to Europe in 1493 by a ship arriving from the Carribean islands. The second suggests the disease was first present in Africa, and was brought to Europe by slaves arriving in Spain and Portugal. And, the third theory assumes syphilis was present in both the old and new worlds, and that four different syndromes developed. Despite this abundance of theories, the definitive origin of the disease remains an enigma. A team of scientists from the University of Split in Croatia set out to test the three theories, examining the remains of people unearthed from the Dalmatian area of Croatia, ranging from different historical periods. They conclude 'the Columbian theory of syphilis origin is not sustainable', citing evidence of syphilis on the bones of a man, aged 20 to 29, who was excavated from a grave dating from the Roman era. But experts remain sceptical. Dr Rob Knell, a reader in evolutionary ecology at Queen Mary's University in London, said one skeleton 'showing apparent syphilitic changes does not constitute much in the way of a weight of evidence' to disprove the Columbian theory. He told MailOnline: 'Firstly, it is only a single skeleton - this means that it is very hard to draw much in the way of conclusions from it, because apparent syphilitic changes in a single skeleton could be the consequence of chance deformities that were not a consequence of the disease. 'With only a single skeleton it is very hard to conclude much about the potential causes of the changes observed. 'Secondly, we know that there were other treponenmal diseases in Europe or Africa before Columbus, such as Yaws, and these can cause skeletal changes as well. The disease can cause major changes to bones . 'Without a decent sized sample, my understanding is that it is hard to distinguish syphilitic changes in bones from changes caused by other treponema diseases.' He said this discovery is the latest in a series of pre-Columbian skeletons with 'apparent syphilitic changes', with a similar study emerging 'every few years'. 'These are always isolated skeletons with questionable pathology,' he told MailOnline. 'And they always seem to get forgotten about pretty quickly.' Dr Bruce Rothschild, a professor of medicine at the University of Kansas and expert in the origins of diseases like syphilis, echoed Dr Knell's doubts. Professor Rothschild told MailOnline while the subject is 'important and pertinent today, the article is not valid'. He said the bone abnormalities appear to be the result of abnormal growth rather than syphilis. He said the thinning of the cortex of the femur, seen on the X-ray, is 'the opposite of what one sees in syphillis', rather suggesting the man suffered fibrous dysplasia. He told MailOnline: 'Syphilis is clearly a New World 'product'. 'Despite many efforts to suggest otherwise, there is no Old World evidence of syphilis prior to 1492. 'The disease derives from Yaws in North America between 2000 and 1800 years ago, on the Colorado Plateau above the Mogollon Ridge. 'The suggestions of pre-Columbian syphilis in Europe are based on inadequate understanding of terminology.' The new study was published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine and involved Croatian scientists analysing a random sample of 403 skeletons, from a collection of 3,000. Of those, 135 came from five excavation sites archeologically dated to the Iron Age, the prehistory era. An antique sample of 134 skeletons were taken from more than 1,000 graves excavated from Solin-Smiljanovac or Salona, a Roman colony. The remaining 134 samples dated from the medieval and new age eras, and were taken from two excavation sites dating from 14th to 19th centuries. The oldest skeletons, from the prehistory and antique eras, were used as a control group. The scientists claim their finding disproves the theory that Columbus transported the disease to Europe aboard the Santa Maria and other ships . The disease is a bacterial infection, often caught by having sex with an infected person. The bacteria that cause syphilis are called treponema pallidum. They can enter the body through close contact with an infected sore, normally during vaginal, anal or oral sex. The disease can also be caught by sharing sex toys with someone who is infected. Pregnant women can pass the disease to their unborn child, which can cause stillbirth or death shortly after labour. Spyhilis is caused by bacteria called treponema pallidum, which can enter the body through close contact with an infected sore, normally during vaginal, anal and oral sex . In some cases the disease is passed through injecting drugs with infected needles. Symptoms of syphilis develop in three stages. It begins with a painless but highly infectious sore on the genitals, or around the mouth. If another person comes into contact with the sore, which lasts from two to six weeks, they can become infected. Secondary symptoms of the disease include a skin rash and sore throat, which typically last for a few weeks. Once they disappear a sufferer will experience a phase with no symptoms, which can last for years. The next stage, the most dangerous, follows. The symptoms of the final stage vary depending on which part of the body the infection spreads to. It can affect the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, bones, skin or blood vessels, causing a range of illnesses including stroke, dementia, paralysis, blindess, deafness, heart disease and death. Source: NHS Choices . Given the most accepted theory, the Columbian theory, supports the fact syphilitic changes will only be found on skeletons dating from the 15th century or later, this group were studied to assess if any signs of spyhilis could be found prior to Columbus' return to Europe. Prior to this study, only one case of venereal syphilis was found on a female skeleton from the 15th to 17th century. The team's findings revealed just one skeleton had anomalies that suggested infection with syphilis. It dated from the antique excavation site in Solin-Smiljanovac, and the scientists concluded it belonged to a man aged between 20 and 29 years old. Changes to the femur, or thigh bone, found suggest the man had fallen victim to the disease. The authors conclude: 'Because of everything stated, we believe that the Columbian theroy of syphilis origin is not sustainable. 'Syphilis was most likely to present in the old world, but not to the extent that is was in post-Columbian time. Dr Rob Knell, from Queen Mary's University in London said one skeleton is not enough to disprove the Columbian theory . 'It is interesting and indicative that no evidence of syphilis was found in graveyards from post-Columbian time in this research, and in the territory of present-day Croatia, only few cases of probable syphilis were published. 'All evidence supports the theory that syphilis is not a new illness, but its manifestations were randomly recorded or misclassified.' They said they believe 'more excavations with more skeletons examined will support the syphilis prior to 1492'. Dr Knell challenged those scientists who back the theory that syphilis pre-dates Columbus' return to Europe to produce a molecular family tree for the bacteria, which is better than those currently used to show syphilis is more closely related to Old World treponema, than New World. 'Or they should find a skeletal assemblage with a decent sample size of apparently syphilitic changes that would allow a better assessment of whether the changes observed were really caused by syphilis. 'Or they should sequence DNA from pre-Columbian bacteria and use the sequence to show that the bacteria in question were the causative agents of syphilis, and not a related treponema. 'They also need to come up with an explanation of why the disease changed in virulence and went from being unknown in 1490 to a dreadful and widely recognised scourge a few years later.' He told MailOnline: 'There is considerable evidence that venereal syphilis evolved in the New World and was then transported to Europe shortly after Columbus' discoveries in 1492. 'This evidence includes DNA sequencing studies that show that the bacterium which causes syphilis is most closely related to other, similar diseases in the New World, skeletal evidence showing syphilitic changes in large numbers of pre-Columbian skeletons in places like the Dominican Republic, and also the rather more circumstantial evidence regarding the changes in virulence caused by syphilis after it first appeared in Europe. 'For the moment the only good explanation for this change in virulence is that the disease was freshly introduced from a different population where it had been evolving to deal with defences possessed by the host population, which the European population did not have, allowing the disease to largely avoid any immune response for the European hosts and cause very severe disease.'","Scientists at the University of Split, Croatia, claim to have 'disproved' the theory syphilis was introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus .

"Arsenal goalkeeper Damian Martinez was ready to leave the club next summer - but now believes he can steal Wojciech Szczęsny's place as their No 1. The 22-year-old kept his third clean sheet in a row, after replacing the injured Szczesny, in their win against Southampton. But Martinez feared for his future after Arsene Wenger signed David Ospina in the summer and he was seemingly relegated to third choice. Damian Martinez is keen to stay and fight for his place after impressing as deputy for Wojciech Szczesny . Martinez kept his third clean sheet in a row since coming in as Arsenal beat Southampton 1-0 on Wednesday . Martinez said: 'I spoke to my agent and my family about it and they said ""let's wait one year to see if you get the opportunity, don't rush it"" 'I was still young - I was only 21, I just turned 22 - and I think I did good to stay here. I got the opportunity that my agent and family told me, so I am really pleased about that. 'Arsenal is one of the biggest clubs in the world so I am in no rush to leave. I love this club.' Szczesny has not played since injuring his hip against Manchester United and Ospina has been ruled out until 2015.

In their absence Martinez, who has had loan spells at Oxford and Sheffield Wednesday since he joined the club in 2011, impressed against Borussia Dortmund and West Bromwich Albion. Asked if he felt he could now become Wenger's first-choice goalkeeper, he replied: 'Yeah, Wojciech has got the spot when he is not injured and doing a good job as well. 'Hopefully if I get a chance against Stoke, I will keep a clean sheet and we can win the game.' I am not too sure if I play Under-21s anymore because I need to be fit to play first-team. 'I am just thinking about the next game and in the future we will see.' Damian Emiliano Martinez hails from Mar Del Plata in Argentina and joined Arsenal from Independiente as an 18-year-old in 2010. The 6ft 4in stopper, now 22, was moved into Arsenal's first-team squad in 2012 and made his debut in the 7-5 League Cup win at Reading on September 26. He spent much of the 2013-2014 campaign on loan at Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, where he made 15 appearances. Returning to the Emirates for the current season, he made his debut away to Anderlecht in the Champions League and has stayed in the side following injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina.

"Britain’s biggest provider of laser eye surgery has been accused of using ‘hard sell’ tactics on its customers. The instructions for securing new patients for corrective treatment were uncovered in a confidential training booklet for staff at Optical Express. The guidelines, which were marked as confidential, reportedly encourage front-of-house patient advisers to ‘take control’ of possible customers when they come in. Scroll down for video . The instructions for securing new patients for corrective treatment were uncovered in a confidential training booklet for staff at Optical Express (file picture - not an Optical Express patient) And it urges staff to ‘look for a nugget’ from potential clients – a personal detail that can be shared with them at a later date. ‘If you can find that personal connection, you can refer to it later and share it with your optometrist. A good nugget can be the difference between a booker and a thinker,’ the instructions say, according to The Observer, which has seen the leaked document. The guide suggests that if the potential customer is a ‘thinker’ they may need reassurance, the newspaper reports. ‘Face your patient, put the pen down, and look them in the eye,’ the instructions state, adding: ‘Use statements like: “What price can you put on your eyesight?”, “Remember you do this for the rest of your life”, ie Lifetime investment.’ Other instructions include briefing optometrists about the ‘type’ of patient they may end up operating on and to do so ‘out of sight and hearing of patient’. This briefing would include ‘things to avoid’ discussing with the patient, The Observer reports. It comes amid calls for tougher regulations of the industry including from the Labour MP John McDonnell. The guidelines, which were marked as confidential, encourage front-of-house patient advisers to ‘take control’ of possible laser eye surgery customers when they come in (file picture) The newspaper quotes Sasha Rodoy, a campaigner calling for tighter regulations, as saying: ‘These “hard sell” techniques may not be illegal, but they are totally inappropriate for a medical procedure and they should be illegal.’ According to nhs.uk, risks of laser eye surgery can include problems with dry eyes in the months after treatment while others can experience glare or halo effects when driving at night. But it adds that complications occur in less that five per cent of cases. On its website, Optical Express, founded in 1991, describes itself as ‘a world leader of selected healthcare services ranging from optical stores, laser clinics to a state-of-the-art medical hospital and cosmetic treatment centres.’ A spokesman said the manual was no longer in use and that patients seeking eye surgery must first attend a ‘highly detailed refractive consultation’ to determine if they are suitable candidates for treatment. She told The Observer: ‘Each member of staff involved in the consultation process undergoes extensive training and development to ensure we deliver an outstanding patient experience and clinical outcome. ‘Our patient advisers help to put patients at ease and address any non-clinical concerns they may have while our qualified and highly experienced optometrists focus on clinical matters.’ The spokesman added that more than 99 per cent of patients achieved 20/20 vision or better without spectacles or contact lenses after surgery. This figure, the company says, was taken from a study of more than 293,000 patients with the most common prescription ranges the company treats.","Optical Express accused of using 'hard sell' on potential laser eye surgery patients .

"Facebook employees past and present with a bone to pick against the company have aired their grievances in an online forum that makes the 'best place to work in tech' look like just another job. Employees bemoan the company’s lack of privacy, hate having to listen to people whine to them about Facebook, and wonder whether this website they spend so much time with is really worth the screen it’s displayed on. Though the Palo Alto, California company was given the designation of best overall tech company to work for by employment site Glassdoor.com, its employee complaints will sound familiar to anyone who’s ever held a job or simply logged onto the social media site. The grind: The reception at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Though the company was recently voted best tech company to work for, employees still complain . 'Forget the free food and drinks,' is among the complaints of one Quora user in answer to the question ‘What's the worst thing about working at Facebook?’ on the Q&A website. Free food, managers who encourage personal expression, and wide open offices are all part of what consistently earns Facebook 'best place to work' designations but those same qualities can wear on employees' nerves. 'The workplace is awful,' the employee continued. ‘Huge . rooms filled with rows and rows of picnic style tables with people . sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with six inches of separation and zero . privacy.' Privacy was a big issue among employees who contributed to the post, something that will come as no surprise to users who've complained for years of the company's privacy policies. 'Like cattle': Employees say the office's open floor plan offers little privacy at work, a complaint many office workers in any industry can relate to . Sound familiar? One employee said Facebook top brass Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg impose a 'holier than thou attitude on everyone and everything around them' Hearing the corporate office mentality reflects the way Facebook treats its users is hardly a revelation. Meanwhile, it is hard to feel completely bad for exposed Facebook employees, where even interns make $5,602 per month according to Business Insider. ‘That's how you keep cattle in the pen,’ continued the employee, ‘not high quality talent earning low to mid six figures.’ Also, social politics play too big a role for some employees’ tastes. Many complain about having to hear people’s opinions about Facebook all the time from users just because they work there. Not even their spouses are immune. ‘As a Facebook spouse,’ began an employee’s wife, ‘I was often asked for help on how to use the privacy settings solely on the basis that, being married to someone who works at Facebook, I must know.’ 'Overhyped': One employee bemoaned his time working for the company as wasted - with its 'dismal public offering' and 'realizing the company doesn't really have a future' Employees also said attitude issue extends to the top of the company, where ‘Zuck and Sheryl,’ wrote an employee,  impose a ‘holier than thou attitude on everyone and everything around them.’ Another employee wrote: ‘The tone of voice people used was belittling and self-righteous.' And finally, the much ballyhooed and, for a time, maligned initial public also offering figured into many complaints. Like users wondering if spending hour after hour on the social media site is a waste of time, so too do some employees fear they’re wasting their professional lives. ‘Knowing that you are part of an overhyped public company that was supposed to be valued over $200 billion by now,’ cites another anonymous Quora user in list of Facebook complaints, ‘but which had a dismal public offering that left many employees feeling totally helpless as they saw the value of their stock collapse.’ Despite the many issues employees who contributes to the Quora post took with Facebook, most reflected the Glassdoor.com’s positive take on the company, not least of all its free three meal-per-day perk. ‘It's a truly fantastic place to work,’ wrote one user. Another said his top complaint was ‘That I have but one stomach for all the food.’","Current and former employees posted their complaints to Q&A website Quora .

"When it comes to having a sense of adventure, there are few cats that can match Millie. Not even wild mountain cats. For Millie is a domestic feline who just loves scrambling up mountains and boulders in her native Utah with owner Craig Armstrong, who originally wrote about his relationship with Millie on backcountry.com. The adorable feline was abandoned by her owners when she was just a few days old – but luckily climbing-mad Mr Armstrong adopted her. Ain't no meow-tain high enough: Millie scaling Stansbury slabs with owner Craig Armstrong . Rock on: Millie fee soloing at Ferguson Canyon . Rock on: Millie fee soloing at Ferguson Canyon . Millie soon came to love accompanying him on his hilly adventures and he even bought her a miniature harness. Now they hit the trails at weekends and camp overnight together, while Mr Armstrong's other cat keeps his girlfriend company at home. Mr Armstrong, 37, said: ‘I just knew one day I would get a pet and when I did I would take it everywhere with me. To boulder-ly go: Millie takes a leap at Moes Valley . New beginning: The adorable feline was abandoned by her owners when she was just a few days old - but Craig Armstrong gave her a loving home . All-conquering: Millie and Mr Armstrong on the top of devils golf ball in Moab . ‘Millie is perfect - she's a natural in the mountains. I make sure she is kept on the best quality cat food. ‘Millie is an athlete, she trains hard, and diet is an important part of any athlete's complete routine.’ Millie was taken into a shelter as part of a litter without its mother in 2013 and was moments from being put down as the shelter didn't have the resources to bottle feed them. But emergency shelter Furburbia took her on and housed her at their ranch where Mr Armstrong went to find an animal companion. Paw-some: Millie in little wild horse slot, Utah . After just four seconds together he knew that Millie was the kitten he wanted to bring home when she climbed on him and curled up round his shoulders. As soon as she was grown Mr Armstrong took her out to Stansbury island - a vast expanse of hills with no vegetation so she could get over her fear of being in the open and learn to walk alongside him. Since she completed her training, Millie has been to some of the biggest climbing landmarks in Utah, including Joe's Valley, Moe's Valley and the Ferguson Canyon. Feeling peaky: Millie 1,000 feet up . In a day Millie and Mr Armstrong can do a six-mile round trip. They go on trips so often that Mr Armstrong adopted another cat, Evelyn, for his girlfriend Julianne to make up for his absence on the sofa. When they are roaming through valleys or across plains Millie wanders harness free.If they are heading for a steep peak the plucky cat gets her own harness and is attached to Craig with carabiners and ropes. Her highest summit so far has been the 'Thousands of Fun' climb - five stages of climbing totalling 1000 feet. While she normally follows Mr Armstrong wherever he goes without a problem, on the way down from the thousand foot climb, her tail got caught in some of Craig's abseiling equipment and she lost a tuft of hair trying to get out. And though Craig sometimes has to scramble into caves or onto ledges to bring her down when she gets stuck, Millie is still the best climbing partner Craig's ever had. Mr Armstrong added: ‘I just start hiking in the morning and she'll run and follow me now. ‘I do free climbing without ropes and then for the really high or steep ascents I harness her up. ‘Cats are idiots sometimes and they will wander away and get lost if you're not careful. ‘Sometimes she gets stuck on a ledge and I have to save her. ‘There have been times when she's fallen and I've had to catch her but now she just loves climbing so much I can't stop her. ‘She has all the qualities a good climbing partner should have. She never complains, no matter how bad it gets! ‘And she always wants to go higher, and she pushes herself hard. ‘But she also knows when to stop. When she's done, she's done. She'll find a cave or climb a tree and won't move until she's rested. ‘And she cuddles me at night inside my sleeping bag and keeps me warm.’","Millie is a domestic feline to loves scrambling up peaks in her native Utah .

"Video footage emerged today that allegedly shows the captain of the Costa Concordia calmly waiting to abandon ship while hundreds of his passengers were still trapped on board. In the clip, Francesco Schettino is apparently seen looking relaxed while standing near a lifeboat on the deck of the capsized cruise liner after it struck rocks in the 2012 disaster that killed 32 people. The footage, which is being used by prosecutors as evidence against him at his manslaughter trial, appears to contradict Schettino's claims that he fell into the raft amid chaotic scenes. The 54-year-old had previously told investigators he had 'tripped and stumbled into a lifeboat'. 'Relaxed': Video footage apparently shows Costa Concordia captain Francesco Schettino (circled) calmly waiting for a lifeboat while hundreds of his passengers were still trapped on board the capsized cruise liner . Evidence: The footage, which is being used by prosecutors as evidence against Schettino at his manslaughter trial, appears to contradict the captain's claims that he fell into the raft amid chaotic scenes . The video was leaked to Italian media as Schettino took the witness stand for a second day, however his appearance in the footage has not been independently verified. Prosecutors also claim that his account differs greatly from pictures taken by firefighters which show him in a suit and tie waiting near a lifeboat. They have also accused Schettino of fatally delaying and failing in his duty to properly co-ordinate the evacuation while fleeing to safety himself. However, in his second day of testimony at his trial, Schettino claimed that his decision to delay the evacuation may actually have saved lives. Schettino, 54, was quizzed by prosecutor Alessandro Leopizzi as to why he did not sound the alarm immediately after he hit rocks off the Italian island of Giglio, causing it to capsize. Schettino appeared to be smothering a smile as he faced court on his first day of testimony yesterday. In his second day on the stand, he claimed that decision to delayed the evacuation may actually have saved lives . The captain of the doomed Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is giving evidence for the first time about the 2012 shipwreck off an Italian island in which 32 passengers and crew were killed. The captain, who is also charged with causing a shipwreck and abandoning his ship, replied that such a move would have led to a dangerous panic among the 4,229 people on board. 'I wanted to get the ship as close to the island as possible. The way it was shaking, had I sounded the seven long whistles and one short one (nautical signal for abandon ship), people would have thrown themselves into the water,' Schettino said. Schettino also claimed that, as the captain, he was 'second only to God' on the cruise liner, it was reported by the International Business Times. The Concordia hit the rocks at 9.45pm and the order to abandon ship was not issued until over an hour later, at 10.54pm, by which time the boat had drifted back towards the island, where it eventually came to rest on the sea bed, half-submerged in about 20 metres (70 feet) of water. The prosecution team are seeking to portray Schettino as a man who was completely overwhelmed by events and dithered dangerously as the boat drifted. But the experienced merchant seaman insisted he was fully in control. He told the court he was sure the boat was not about to immediately sink and that he thought the prevailing wind would lead to it drifting from deep water to a shallower position nearer the island, where an evacuation, if required, would be easier and safer. 'I delayed sounding the alarm knowing exactly how much manoeuvre time the ship had. 'I knew the Concordia well, I wanted to get her closer to the island and then sound the alarm,' he said. 'By then the damage was done. (Through my actions) It was contained.' Disaster: The Concordia, a floating hotel as long as three football pitches laid end-to-end, capsized after hitting rocks near the Italian island of Giglio in 2012, killing 32 people on board . Schettino was then pressed to explain why he thought he could influence a drifting 115,000-tonne ship with all its engines out of action, and why a series of reassuring announcements were made to the terrified passengers. 'I did that to calm people down, I was afraid of panic,' he replied. He also denied that he had not radio-ed for tow boats to help stabilise the ship because of concern over the financial implications of seeking salvage. 'I did not put the boat before human lives,' he said. 'The cost I would have thought about afterwards.' Schettino began giving evidence on Monday in his first appearance in the dock since his trial opened in the Tuscan town of Grosseto in July 2013. On Monday he denied being responsible for steering the giant cruise ship recklessly close to the island, saying he believed it was set on a route that would take it near the rocky coastline but not so close as to run any risk. Schettino said he only resumed control of the boat's direction 15 minutes before it hit the rocks and has effectively blamed his subordinates on the bridge for plotting the course that led to disaster. Prosecutors revealed for the first time on Monday that they intend to seek a 20-year prison sentence for the career seaman who has been described as 'Captain Coward' because of his decision to leave the ship himself half an hour after the alarm was sounded and with hundreds of passengers and crew still on board. He has yet to be interrogated on that aspect of the fateful night's events. A key element of Schettino's defence will be his assertion that the main reason for the boat sinking, and therefore the deaths, was its total loss of power due to the failure of back-up generators, which he cannot be held responsible for.","Clip used by prosecutors as evidence against captain at manslaughter trial .

"The biggest ship to sail up the Thames has left the London Gateway port in Essex and is sailing for its next destination Singapore via the Suez Canal at a steady speed of 23 knots. The huge cargo ship docked at London Gateway before sunrise yesterday morning, guided in by three Port of London Authority tugs. Edith Maersk was serviced in number two berth by five of the port's cranes - the largest in the country. Scroll down for video . Edith Maersk, the second largest container ship in the world, leaves the Thames Estuary near Canvey Island, Essex. The ship, the largest ever to enter the River Thames, had previously docked at London Gateway after arriving from the Far East . Edith Maersk dwarfs London's biggest buildings, at almost 200ft longer than the Shard is tall. It is more than 400ft longer than the Titanic, and more than four times the length of the Cutty Sark . Thanks to London Gateway, gargantuan E-class ships can  be accommodated at three ports in England - Felixstowe and Southampton being the others. Edith Mærsk is 430yds (397m) long and can carry 13,500 20ft and 40ft containers. It is believed that it was carrying a cargo of clothes and electronic goods when it arrived in England. The vessel, the second largest container ship in the world, was launched in 2007 and can navigate the Thames following the opening of London Gateway port in the Thames Estuary. The Gateway cost £1.5bn to build and was opened last year.  It is located on the former 1,500-acre Shell Haven site, which closed in 1999. Edith Mærsk is more than 50 per cent longer than Titanic and four times the length of a football pitch.

"A freediver managed to catch a 12lb lobster that he reckons could be as old as 70. Forrest Galante, 26, a biologist, was diving near Anacapa Island off the Californian coast when he found the huge Pacific Spiny lobster lurking on the sea bed. A specimen of this size would have been common decades ago. But now, as a result of overfishing, the crustaceans rarely weigh in at more 3lbs. Scroll down for video . Meet Albert Girther: This is the 12lb lobster pulled from the sea bed off California by biologist Forrest Galante . My new pet: Mr Galante strokes his new friends carapace while sitting outside his home in Santa Barbara . Can we be friends? The dog comes over to get a sniff of Albert, but he seems not to have made his mind up . Mr Galante faced a dilemma over whether or not to eat the lobster, who he named Albert Girther because of his impressive size, but in the end he decided to let him live. Mr Galante caught the lobster on October 6. He said: 'I've been doing this for ten years and I've never seen a lobster as big as Albert Girther - which is his name. 'I mean any lobster that can bear hug a man must be pretty huge and he had no problem with that. 'Originally I thought he was the world's biggest lobster but I was just excited - I'm pretty sure he is the biggest lobster caught off the west coast this year though. 'They normally only manage to grow to around three pounds because of intensive fishing so it's really rare to find one this old and big. 'I won an award from my free diving club last year for bringing in a 9.4lb lobster, so Albert has definitely surpassed that.' Monster of the deep: Mr Galante holds up Albert just after catching him, and right, Albert holds Mr Galante . Deeeelicious: But Mr Galante resisted the urge to eat Albert and instead let him go in a marine reserve . Pacific spiny lobsters are nocturnal and Mr Galante was on a night dive when he found Albert. Pictures show the disconcertingly large crustacean gripping onto to Mr Galante with its long legs. Spiny lobsters are distinct from the more-recognisable clawed lobsters, not having the mammoth pincers on their front legs that make the latter so apparently fearsome. Because they lose all their hard parts each time they moult it is not possible to accurately age them, so biologists make guesses based on the lobsters' size and weight. Mr Galante took Albert home to his family in Santa Barbara, California, where he introduced his meaty new friend to the dog. 'I've got to say it was very tempting to take him home and eat him - he had pounds and pounds of delicious meat but he was clearly a good breeder, so my family and I decided that we had to put him back into the water so he could have more children,' Mr Galante said. 'We took him to the Ty Warner Sea Centre where he was put in a tank and gorged on food but we were not going to leave him in captivity. 'We put him back into the water in a marine reserve off the coast of California which does not allow fishing, so he can live out the rest of his days in peace.'","Forrest Galante, 26, caught the Pacific spiny lobster off the California coast .

"Doctors in India have removed a penknife from the stomach of a six-month-old boy who had been wearing it around his neck to ward off evil spirits. Dev Thakor, who comes from a village in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, Western India, swallowed the knife by accident while being breastfed by his mother Rekha Ben. He had been wearing it on a string around his neck, which is a local tradition. Dev Thakor had to have surgery to remove a penknife from his stomach after he swallowed it while being breastfed by his mother, Rekha Ben, pictured . The penknife which Dev wore around his neck to ward off evil spirits, can be seen, right, in the X-ray . Dev's father, Bharat Thakor, said his son 'suddenly started crying, screaming' before his family noticed the knife was missing. The child was then rushed to a private hospital where an X-ray confirmed he had swallowed the penknife. The two-inch foldable knife came off its string last Friday as Dev was being fed by his mother. He then swallowed it without her noticing. Mr Thakor, a tea stall owner, didn't have enough money for his son's surgery but his neighbours and customers came to his aid and 'saved my son's life'. Dr Shravan Bohra, chief gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals where Dev's operation was performed, said the child was lucky to have survived the ordeal without suffering serious injury. Dr Shravan Bohra, chief gastroenterologist at Apollo Hospitals where Dev's operation was performed, said the child was lucky to have survived the ordeal as the knife was lying open in the upper part of his stomach . Ms Ben and Dev are pictured along with his father Bharat Thakor, his sister, and his niece . He said: ‘It was a critical case as the knife was lying open in the upper part of Dev’s stomach and could have harmed the Mucosa - the inner part of his body - but fortunately he was remarkably not injured.' Sailash Patel, who sponsored Dev's surgery, said when he heard about the boy's condition his only wish was to save his life. The 50-year-old came to learn of the child's ordeal after asking why Mr Thakor's tea stall - which he stopped at almost daily - was closed. He said: 'I knew it would be hard for him to afford the operation so I offered to pay the fees. 'I am a father of two children myself and I couldn’t imagine what Bharat was going through.’ Dev was discharged from hospital on Sunday and is said to be recovering well at home.","Dev Thakor swallowed the penknife while being breastfed by his mother .

"China has said Britain . has no authority or moral responsibility for what happens in Hong Kong post-1997, in the latest shot fired in a diplomatic row between the nations that has escalated since the weekend. The war of words kicked off on Sunday when a group of British MPs, who were set to visit Hong Kong on a research mission regarding the progress towards democracy later this month, were refused entry. Prime Minister David Cameron sharply criticised that decision, saying it heightened concerns about the situation in the former British colony. Long fight: British MPs had applied for visas to Hong Kong to investigate regarding the progress towards democracy which has seen 'Occupy' protests in the city for two months . 'His view is that the decision with regard to the foreign affairs committee is a mistaken one,' David Cameron's spokesperson said. 'It's counter productive because it only serves to amplify concerns about the situation in Hong Kong, rather than diminishing concerns.' The British parliament held a three-hour emergency debate . over the ban on Tuesday, with members warning it would damage . relations between London and Beijing. Today, China responded to the critique from Cameron and Parliament, saying that Britain has no responsibility for Hong Kong after returning the city to Chinese rule. The 'one country, two systems' formula that was agreed in 1997, allowed Hong Kong to keep wide-ranging freedoms and autonomy. Marking territory: Beijing said today that Britain has 'no sovereignty, no authority and no right to oversight' in Hong Kong post-1997 . New move: A group of Occupy Central demonstrators hold signs outside the Central Police Station in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong on Wednesday . Giving in: Benny Tai Yiu-ting, Chan Kin-man and Reverend Chu yiu-ming, the three co-founders of Occupy Central movement, surrender themselves in to the police today . 'Britain has no sovereignty over a Hong Kong that has . returned to China, no authority and no right to oversight. There . is no such thing as a moral responsibility,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said today. 'The real aim of a small minority of British people trying . to use so-called moral responsibility to obscure the facts is to . interfere in China's internal affairs. 'Such an attempt cannot . succeed, and is something China certainly cannot accept.' Moves by Beijing to control nominations for a 2017 vote for . Hong Kong's leader have prompted the weeks of protests. Today, after two months of civil action in central Hong Kong, the three founders of the Occupy Central movement handed themselves over to police. Benny Tai, Chan Kin-man and Chu Yiu-ming surrendered this morning while dozens of supporters, many carrying the yellow umbrellas that have become a symbol of the movement, gathered outside the police station in central Hong Kong. However, despite admitting to the crime of 'participating in unauthorised assembly', the trio were not arrested and soon emerged from the police station to cheers from protesters. 'We have not been arrested so we are allowed to leave with no restriction on our liberty,' Benny Tai said. He added there were 'political considerations' behind their swift release to avoid crowds flocking to the protest zones, but said it was inevitable they would eventually be arrested. 'I don't think the matter will be resolved on this occasion, later we may be arrested, even prosecuted for more serious offences,' Tai added.","Row started over British MPs being refused entry to Hong Kong .

The 21-year-old has earned rave reviews from Gunners scouts and boss Arsene Wenger needs to bolster his defence next month after injuries left his squad exposed. Mings plays at left back but Arsenal see his future as a central defender. The stumbling block is Ipswich’s asking price of £10million but Arsenal hope to compromise. Crystal Palace and Chelsea are also interested. Tyrone Mings is being tracked by several big Premier League clubs, with Arsenal leading the chase . Mings plays as a left back for Ipswich but Arsene Wenger could switch him to a centre half . Meanwhile, Arsenal goalkeeper Damian Martinez believes he can challenge Wojciech Szczesny as the club’s No 1 — after revealing he was ready to leave the club. The 22-year-old kept his third clean sheet in a row in their win against Southampton. But Martinez feared for his future after Arsene Wenger signed David Ospina in the summer. Damian Martinez claims the ball as he kept another clean sheet against Southampton on Wednesday . Martinez said: ‘I spoke to my agent and family and they said “let’s wait to see if you get the opportunity”. I got the opportunity, so I am really pleased.’ Asked if he could be Wenger’s first-choice, he said: ‘Yeah, Wojciech has got the spot when he is not injured. ‘Hopefully if I get a chance against Stoke, I will keep a clean sheet and we win.’","Arsenal are watching Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings .

"Germany has blamed pro-Russian rebels for downing the Malaysia Airline MH17  plane with a rocket from a Buk missile defence system. The BND foreign intelligence agency says separatists fired the device from a Ukrainian base which exploded directly next to the passenger aircraft. It is the first time a European agency has openly pointed the finger at rebels, who have so far denied accusations. Scroll down for video . Debris from Malaysia Airline MH17 plane, which German  intelligence say was shot down by pro-Russian rebels . The BUK missile launcher suspected of bringing down the ill-fated airline is transported on the back of a lorry . The passenger jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, killing all 298 passengers and crew members. The crash has led to a further deterioration of ties between the West and Moscow, who are in dispute over Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis. Gerhard Schindler, president of the BND, reportedly told a secret . parliamentary committee on security affairs earlier this month that separatists had used a Russian Buk missile defence system. A German newspaper today quoted him admitting: 'It was pro-Russian separatists'. The BND, Germany's equivalent to Britian's MI5, concluded separatists were to blame after carrying out detailed analysis based on satellite images and other photos, Der Spiegel said. The intelligence service has not been available for comment. Candles and soft toys at the crash site near the village of Rassipnoe where the plane came down on July 17 . European governments have so far refrained from openly attributing blame, but shortly after the crash U.S. Secretary . of State John Kerry said there was strong evidence that . Moscow-backed separatists had downed the plane. The Dutch government, which has two investigations underway . into the downing of the airliner, has yet to say who was . responsible. Two thirds of the passengers were Dutch. A preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board last month . said the airliner crashed due to a 'large number of high-energy . objects' from outside the aircraft but drew no conclusions as to . where they came from. While Kiev blames the incident on rebels and has accused Moscow of arming them, Ukrainian security services claim to have intercepted phone conversations in which pro-Russian separatists appear to admit to shooting down Flight MH17. The Security Service of Ukraine, (SBU) reportedly released recordings of the conversations between Russian military intelligence officers and Russian-backed Cossack militants to the Kiev Post. In the calls, which were allegedly made minutes after the passenger plane crashed near the village of Chornukhine, a separatist can be heard saying: 'They shouldn’t be f*****g flying.

The system is the one being blamed by German foreign intelligence agency - BND . Ukrainian rescue servicemen look through the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 on July 20 . However Russia has denied any involvement and many believe the Boeing 777-200 was blasted out of the sky by Ukrainian military. Russian sources launched a scathing attack on the MH17 crash report published last month in a bid to undermine any future criticisms that it was responsible. Several senior figures were given license to question the motives of the 'careless' Dutch-led investigation into the doomed Malaysia Airlines aircraft. One suggested a Western plot to hide the real cause of the crash of the Malaysia Boeing 777-200, which among some figures in Moscow is blamed on the Ukrainian army. Pyotr Deinekin, a former Russian Air Force commander and the chairman of the public council of the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency (Rosaviatsia), declared:'I was totally shocked by the data published by the investigative commission. 'Did it take them so long to find out that the Boeing was in good repair? It was clear from the start there would be no claims against the airplane's serviceability.'

He said accusingly: 'The Netherlands is careless, it draws conclusions before examining the plane's debris and body fragments.' Meanwhile, rebel official in Donetsk, Miroslav Rudenko, told Interfax alleged that the downing the the plane was 'a provocation carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces in order to discredit Russia and the people's militia'. The Dutch agency investigating the crash came under fire last week when one of the prosecutors revealed that an Australian passenger had been wearing an oxygen mask when the flight crashed. The revelation suggested the man, whose name has not been released, had been conscious when the aircraft was struck. Mr De Bruin said Dutch forensic experts investigated the mask 'for fingerprints, saliva and DNA,' but it did not produce any results, Associated Press reported. It resulted in a flood of phone calls to investigators from the relatives of the 298 passengers and crew who perished, including 38 Australians, seeking more information about the passenger.","German foreign intelligence said separatists fired device from Ukrainian base .

"He is paid three times the average UK salary, has his own chauffeur and pockets tens of thousands in expenses every year. But according to Nigel Farage, he is the 'poorest man in politics'. Despite earning £79,000 a year as an MEP, the Ukip leader, complains of meagre finances on a spin-off show with Steph and Dom Parker, the 'posh couple' from Gogglebox. Nigel Farage appeared on Channel 4's Gogglebox programme where he is seen quaffing champagne, beer and wine with Dom and Steph Parker . Mr Farage, who admitted he hadn't seen the show before his appearance, enjoyed an evening at the Parkers' guest house in Sandwich, Kent, in which they are normally filmed watching the week's television highlights for Gogglebox .

Mr Farage admitted he drank two pints and about five or six glasses of wine and champagne while he was with the couple . According to The Times, Ukip pays him a £60,000-a-year chauffeur allowance. Among other expenses, he earns a 'daily subsistence allowance' of £250 every time he attends the European Parliament, has an monthly EU allowance of £3,580 to cover UK travel, office management and running costs, and has his first-class travel to the continent covered. The UKIP leader has even admitted paying his wife around £20,000 a year from taxpayers' funds to work as his assistant.

"Fenway Sports Group will underwrite the redevelopment of Anfield with an interest free £114million loan. Liverpool have confirmed that work will finally begin on Monday to increase the capacity of their stadium to 53,500, with the Main Stand being remodelled and an extra 8,500 seats being added. The project, which has been two years in the planning, will be completed for the start of 2016-17 season. Repayments to FSG – who took control of Liverpool in October 2010 after the doomed Tom Hicks-George Gillet reign – will be made from the extra £20m a year revenue the extra seating will bring, over a five-and-a-half year period. Liverpool Football Club will begin work on Monday on expanding the Main Stand at Anfield by adding 8,500 seats . From left to right, Ron Yeats, Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan, Phil Thompson, Phil Neal, Alan Kennedy, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Jordan Rossiter attend an announcement of Liverpool's stadium expansion at Anfield along with manager Brendan Rodgers and managing director Ian Ayre . The Main Stand will have two new tiers added to take the capacity to over 53,000 by the start of the 2016-17 season . 45,522 - Anfield's current capacity . 58,800 - Anfield's potential new capacity . 8,500 - Phase one to extend the Main Stand . 4,500 - Phase two to extend Anfield Road end . £75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season . £260m - cost of overall regeneration in Anfield . The estimated cost of the build is £75m with £39m going on costs. Steven Gerrard told Liverpool's official website: 'It's very exciting news that we have finally got around to extending Anfield. For me, it was all about staying at Anfield. As much as I like new stadiums, I'm more traditional and I like the old stadiums like the Camp Nou and places like this, where all the history and all the memories happen. 'There have been so many unbelievable nights and memories here, it would have been a shame to leave it all and for this to have become houses or apartments. 'Now that they are going to extend the stadium, it's going to become even bigger, better and noisier. Hopefully there are many more fantastic memories to come.' There are no plans to sell naming rights for Anfield but the new stand could be sponsored, with Liverpool having held initial talks with interested parties about a potential £10million agreement, which would work out roughly at £1million per season. The redevelopment of Anfield has been an enormous issue for Liverpool since the turn of this century, with Hicks and Gillett famously declaring when they bought the club from David Moores in February 2007 that they would 'have a spade in the ground' within 60 days. They had intended to build on a site on adjacent Stanley Park but their plans were doomed to failure, which is why this announcement is regarded by Chairman Tom Werner and Ian Ayre, the club’s managing director, as being a 'momentous day' in Liverpool’s history. Anfield is soon to be altered after Liverpool won permission from the city council in September . Liverpool's new Main Stand will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for Reds fans . 1. 75,731 - Old Trafford, Manchester United . 2. 60,362 - Emirates Stadium, Arsenal . 3. 52,405 - St James' Park, Newcastle United . 4. 48,707 - Stadium of Light, Sunderland . 5. 46,708 - Etihad Stadium, Manchester City . 6. 45,522 - Anfield, Liverpool . ‘It was just over two years ago that we said our preference was to stay at Anfield and here we are today announcing that the expansion is going ahead,’ said Werner. ‘We have made more progress in the last two years than in the last decade.’ FSG had considered building a complete new ground but, having explored a number of possibilities, they have favoured pursuing a project on the lines of how they redeveloped Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox baseball team. Werner added: ‘Having experience of expanding Fenway Park and being through a similar and very successful project of the Red Sox, everyone at FSG is extremely proud and excited to be part of the expanding of Anfield.’ Carillion are the construction company that has been entrusted with the task of building the Main Stand and Liverpool also have planning permission to redevelop the Anfield Road stand – which would add another 4,500 seats – in the future. But, as yet, there is no urgency to pursue that. Liverpool's current Anfield capacity is just over 45,000 seats - the sixth highest in the Premier League . The Main Stand (left) at Anfield will have an extra 8,500 seats added as well as corporate and hospitality facilities . The Kop end will be unaffected by the expansion, as will the Centenary Stand, which is opposite the Main Stand . ‘The football club for many years has been looking for a solution and although it has been a long time coming, under this ownership it has actually been a quick process,’ said Ayre. ‘We spent the first 18 months looking at a variety of solutions and decided staying at Anfield was the best. ‘It has taken two years to get where we are today where we have certainty. What we always said is we did not want to create any false dawns. Finding the right economic solution in the best interests of the club.’ A significant chunk of the new seats will go to corporate clients but, at a time when Liverpool supporters have been protesting about the cost of admission prices, Ayre has argued it is a necessity to supplement incomes if Liverpool are to keep pace with their Premier League rivals. ‘If you use the word “affordability” – I don’t think there’s a football club in the country who could afford to spend money on a new stand without the assistance of corporate hospitality,’ said Ayre. ‘It pays. It will probably pay two thirds or more of the payback of this facility and that is a fact of life. ‘You can’t find economic solutions that work in big new stadiums that don’t have corporate. We will still be some way behind the corporate hospitality numbers they have at old Trafford and probably around the same sort of level they do at Arsenal. It feels right for the model we have created.’ VIDEO Gerrard still influences games - Rodgers . When asked about his favourite Anfield memory, Gerrard said: 'I think personally, it would have to be the Olympiacos game or even the Chelsea victory with the so-called ""ghost goal"". 'From the outside, I think it would be difficult to pick one other memory because there's been so many from so many fantastic players and so many great sides. It's difficult to pick one. From my own point of view, it would probably be Olympiacos.' Steven Gerrard's famous goal against Olympiakos in December 2004, which took Liverpool through into the Champions League last 16 .

"It didn't take long. With the outbreak of a global health crisis on the scale of the current Ebola epidemic, there was bound to be a flurry of conspiracy theories. And the internet's finest have been hard at work. From the prospect of the Ebola-based zombie horror film 28 Days Later becoming reality to the US government deliberately releasing the virus, there's plenty out there for the tin foil hat brigade to sink their teeth into. Scroll down for video . Hoax: This picture, which went viral last week,; turned out to be nothing more than a screen grab from the zombie film World War Z, starring Brad Pitt . Last week a picture purporting to be that of the first Ebola 'Zombie' went viral over the internet with the title 'Ebola victim back from the dead'. A caption reads: 'For the first time in human history, confirmed footage is captured of a man who scientists watched die from Ebola then only several hours later, regain life and rise from the dead'. It then cites Bible passage Isaiah 26:19-20: 'Your dead shall live, their bodies shall rise.' The picture was later revealed to be nothing more than a screenshot of an actor in the movie World War Z starring Brad Pitt. The zombie hoax appears to have been inspired by several real-life reports of Ebola victims coming back from the dead. One story which appeared on the TheNewDawnLiberia.com website recently told of two Ebola patients who died of the virus in separate communities coming back to life two days later. One conspiracy theory, which claims the current Ebola strain is hybrid of Ebola and Rabies, has  drawn several comparisons with the 2002 Danny Boyle film 28 Days Later . Conspiracy? Many believe that the Ebola virus was created in a laboratory by unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies hoping to profit from the sale of vaccines . The website reported: 'The late Dorris Quoi of Hope Village Community and the second victim only identified as Ma Kebeh, said to be in her late 60s, were about to be taken for burial when they resurrected. 'Ma Kebeh had reportedly been in door for two nights without food and medication before her alleged death.' Another story from Liberia last week tells of a man thought to have died from Ebola in the middle of a street who started waving his arms when funeral workers arrived to pick up his body. That has led some to suggest that the virus is  man-made and has been designed either as a weapon or simply so  pharmaceutical companies can profit from selling vaccines and cures. Some users insist the current Ebola strain is hybrid of Ebola and Rabies, drawing comparisons with the film 28 Days Later and raising the unlikely prospect that the film's plot may become reality. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan claims Ebola is a 'race-targeting bioweapon created by white people' In the 2002 film directed by Danny Boyle, a highly contagious virus known as the Rage virus is released after animal liberation activists break into a laboratory where tests are being conducted on chimpanzees. Scientists in the movie were attempting to create an anger management drug and had decided to use the Ebola virus as a delivery system. But Ebola mutates the drug, causing it to have the oppposite effect and send people into fits of constant, uncontrollable rage with physical symptoms resembling rabies - leading them to attack other humans and pass on the virus at a rapidly increasing rate until only a small minority have escaped infection. Exponents of this theory point to research conducted in 2012 by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) which developed an Ebola vaccine based on the established rabies virus vaccine. The scientists first tested the vaccine on mice before moving on to monkeys and claim the research was extremely successful. Speculation has been further fuelled by a 2012 report of a rabies-like virus that has all the symptoms of and lethality of Ebola and which killed two teenagers in Congo in 2009. Believers of this theory warn people not to take the vaccine which will soon be rolled out. In the US, Firebrand Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan claims the Ebola virus is a 'race-targeting bioweapon created by white people'. He says the US government 'has a desire for world depopulation' and is intent on going about it by using bioweapons 'such as Ebola and AIDS, which are race targeting weapons.' He wrote: 'There is a weapon that can be put in a room where there are Black and White people, and it will kill only the Black and spare the White, because it is a genotype weapon that is designed for your genes, for your race, for your kind. 'This means that these wise scientists of death are making pathogens, which is something that can cause a disease. 'They are creating this as a means of depopulating our planet of undesirables, a process called culling the population. … So, if you are poor and ignorant; if you are Black or Brown, you are being selected for destruction.' History: The Ebola virus as discovered in 1976 following major outbreaks that year in the Sudan and Zaire . Health workers say the fight against the outbreak is being hindered by claims of miracle cures such as rubbing limes and onions over your body and by unscrupulous merchants selling bogus treatments. The World Health Organisation has issued several warnings over bogus cures and precautionary measures. A scene from Zombie horror film 28 Days Later . Twitter users have slammed Sky Movies, accusing the broadcaster of uploading the Ebola-related zombie film 28 Days Later to its on-demand movie service as concerns over the outbreak grow. Twitter user Mitchell wrote today: 'World's going Ebola mad and Sky decides to show World War Z and 28 days later and 28 weeks later in the last 2 days..bad timing or what...' And user 'luna' ‏wrote: 'sky movies have decided to upload 28 days later while the ebola virus is breaking out, thanks for terrifying me'. The film features in the 'recently added' section of the Sky Movies 'On Demand' service. The channel did not respond to requests for a comment. In Liberia healers have suggested rubbing the body with limes and onions can combat the virus while across the region merchants are profiting from the panic by selling fake Ebola vaccinations and cures. One rumour that has been widely circulated is that drinking saltwater can prevent or cure the disease, an entirely false claim that is believed to be responsible for the deaths of four people. A spokesman for WHO said: 'Another source of public misunderstanding, especially in affected areas, comes from rumours on social media claiming that certain products or practices can prevent or cure Ebola virus disease. 'Decades of scientific research have failed to find a curative or preventive agent of proven safety and effectiveness in humans, though a number of promising products are currently under development. 'All rumours of any other effective products or practices are false. Their use can be dangerous. In Nigeria, for example, at least two people have died after drinking salt water, rumoured to be protective.' Ebola was discovered in 1976 following major outbreaks that year in the Sudan and Zaire. In the 1990s, the disease saw a resurgence with an outbreak in Gabon in 1994, followed by another in Zaire in 1995. The current outbreak, the worst in recorded history, began last December and has killed more than 3,800 people mainly in West Africa and is threatening to spread across Europe and the Americas. Between 2000-2004, close to 500 people died from Ebola in Uganda, Gabon, the Republic of Congo and Sudan. The vast majority of those deaths have been in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In a similar way to how the HIV/Aids outbreak was often said to be man made, some believe Ebola has been deliberately created to decrease the world's and in particular Africa's rapidly expanding population. Others suggest it has been deliberately engineered to target black people. This is a variation of the man-made theory which suggests the current media attention surrounding the outbreak in Africa is nothing but government programming so that people are ready to line up to take the rabies-based vaccine they are preparing to roll out. Some believe Ebola was secretly created by the CIA as part of a foreign policy initiative to counter the threat of communism and black nationalism in central Africa . Some deeply religious Africans believe Ebola to be the wrath of god, a punishment for immoral acts. The Liberia Council of Churches (LCC) has issued a statement reading: ‘Liberians have to pray and seek God’s forgiveness over the corruption and immoral acts (such as homosexuality) that continue to penetrate our society. As Christians, we must repent and seek God’s forgiveness’ In parts of Nigeria a rumour has been spreading that Ebola can be cured or prevented by drinking hot salt water.

"A salesman who tortured and battered his partner’s two-year-old daughter to death has been murdered in prison. Subhan Anwar, 25, is believed to have been held hostage in a cell at high-security Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire before he was killed. Two inmates aged 47 and 45 have been arrested on suspicion of murder. Cruelty: Subhan Anwar, left, was jailed for 23 years for murdering partner Zahbeen Navsarka's, right, daughter . Horrific: Sanam Navsarka suffered 107 injuries during a month of 'unbelievable' cruelty before she died . West Mercia Police said Anwar’s body was found at 8pm on Thursday by . prison officers at the category A jail, which houses some of the . country’s most dangerous criminals. ‘West Mercia Police is working closely with the Ministry of Justice to . establish the exact circumstances surrounding this man’s death,’ said a . police spokesman. A Ministry of Justice spokesman  added: ‘Two prisoners are now in police . custody and the matter is being investigated by police.’ Anwar was jailed for life in 2009 after being convicted of murdering his partner’s toddler, Sanam Navsarka. Horror: Two 'tramline' bruises showed where Sanam had been hit with this metal pole . The youngster suffered 107 injuries during a month of ‘unbelievable’ cruelty in which she was battered with metal poles and had all four . limbs broken. The child, who was afraid of the dark, was ‘disciplined’ by being . repeatedly locked in an unlit cupboard, while Anwar also put her in a . tumble drier and dumped her in a bin for his amusement. Sanam suffered further agony when aftershave was splashed on her nappy . rash and open sores. She was not taken to a doctor, so her fractures . remained untreated. In her final days she was suffering so much from her injuries that she . could not walk and died when fat deposits from her broken bones entered . the bloodstream, Bradford Crown Court heard. A post-mortem examination revealed that along with her broken arms and . legs, there were 36 bruises to her head and neck, 26 to her arms and ten . to her abdomen. Her death came only three months after married mobile phone salesman . Anwar met the child’s mother Zahbeena Navsarka at the shop where he . worked in Huddersfield. Anwar had sex with Navsarka in the back of the shop on the day they met . and he swiftly left his pregnant wife to move in with his new lover. To . cover their tracks after the child died in 2008, they told detectives . she was left alone in the bath for ten minutes and was found dead. But Anwar, described as brutal and domineering, was convicted and jailed . for a minimum of 23 years. Navsarka was cleared of her daughter’s . murder but found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to nine years in . prison. Judge Peter Thornton QC said it was a ‘truly terrible case’ and told the . defendants: ‘It is almost unbelievable the pain and anguish she must . have suffered, not just once or twice, but repeatedly and persistently . over weeks at your cruel and selfish hands.’ He added: ‘Your deliberate cruelty is beyond belief. Humanity has let her down.’ In 2011, social worker Judyth Kenworthy was suspended for failing to . pass on vital information about Sanam’s abuse a week before she was . murdered. She was found guilty of misconduct by the General Social Care . Council. Shocking: A model, shown to the jury during the couple's trial, shows the extent of the toddler's injuries .

"Three Los Angeles cops who shot dead an unarmed man on live TV following a high-speed chase last year violated department rules pertaining to the use of deadly force, Police Chief Charles Beck has found. Brian Newt Breaird, a 51-year-old disabled National Guard veteran, was struck by 13 bullets in downtown Los Angeles on the night of December 13, 2013. Local news stations carried live the high-speed police pursuit, along with its bloody aftermath. One of the people who watched Beaird go down in a hail of bullets was his father. Scroll down for video . Excessive force: LAPD Police Chief Charles Beck has found that three police officers violated department rules when they shot dead unarmed veteran Brian Newt Beaird, pictured, on live TV in December 2013 . Chase: Police had chased his car for nearly an hour and claimed he had been driving erratically . Lawsuit: Bill Beaird, left, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles after he witnessed his unarmed veteran son, right, being fatally shot by LAPD officers last year . Police Chief Beck has concluded in a recently released report cited by Los Angeles Times that the officers' decision to use deadly force on an unarmed man was unjustified. The three cops, identified in a previous report as Michael Ayala, Armando Corral, and Leonardo Ortiz, have alleged that they opened fire on the veteran because they believed they lives were in danger, but Beck rejected their claims. 'The preponderance of the evidence does not independently support [the officers’] perceptions that a deadly threat was present,' Beck wrote in the report. Video footage of the conformation showed how the man had turned around and was moving away from the officers when they fired a volley at him. The year-long investigation into the shooting has found that the three bullets that most likely ended Beaird's life struck him from behind. The trio of officers, among them two rookies and a seven-year veteran of the department, have been on leave since the December 2013 incident. Crash: The chase only came to a stop when he hit another car, pictured left. The driver suffered injuries . Fearing for their lives: The officers told investigators they opened fire on Beaird, striking him 13 times - including in the back - because they believed he was armed . It is now up to Chief Beck to decide whether or not to punish the officers in question. They could face suspension or termination. Larry Hanna, an attorney hired to represent the officers, defended their actions saying they went out there that night trying to do the best job they could. Decider: It is now up to Chief Beck to decide how to punish the officers . The December 13 shooting followed a nearly hour-long nighttime pursuit for reckless driving that ended when Beaird's silver Corvette ran a string of red lights, hit a car in an intersection, seriously injuring the other driver, and then spun onto a downtown sidewalk. Beaird's father, Billy Beaird , watched in horror on live TV as his son staggered out of the Corvette, briefly raised his hands, was fatally shot multiple times in the front and back, and fell to the ground. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. A toxicology test determined Beaird had methamphetamine and traces of other drugs in his system. All three officers in the shooting told investigators they shot Beaird because they saw him reaching for his waistband and making erratic, jerking motions with his hands, which led them to believe he had a gun. One of the cops went so far as to say he believed Bearid was actually shooting at them. In May, the elder Mr Beaird filed a $20million wrongful death lawsuit against the city alleging that officers violated his son's state and federal civil rights. Four months later, the Los Angeles City Council voted to pay Beaird's family $5million to settle the lawsuit. Billy Beaird had told the Los Angeles Times that his son was discharged from the National Guard in 1988 after undergoing surgery for a brain tumor and needed regular medical care. The family's attorney, Dale K. Galipo, said Beaird was paranoid at the time of the chase. 'He couldn't understand why the police were chasing him, and he didn't know what to do,"" Galipo said. 'He called his family during the pursuit and asked what he should do. And they told him he should pull over ... and he said ""I'm afraid"" and kept going.'","Police Chief Charles Beck found the officers' decision to use deadly force on National Guard veteran Brian Beaird, 51, last December was unjustified .

"A billionaire who once dated Princess Diana has left his former girlfriend’s daughter a trust fund even though he is not the father of the child. Theodore ‘Teddy’ Forstmann changed his will to give the undisclosed sum to two-year-old Krishna Lakshmi before he died last November at the age of 71. The financier had dated her mother Padma Lakshmi, ex-wife of Salman Rushdie and host of popular U.S TV show Top Chef, for several years including during the birth. Together: Television personality Padma Lakshmi and billionaire Ted Forstmann attend the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra & New York Philharmonic Concert in Central Park in July 2010 in New York City . It later turned out the father was another man but Forstmann raised the baby as if he were his own. In Forstmann’s will filed at Manhattan Surrogate’s Court, he refers to her as his ‘friend’ and says that he forgives all loans he had given her. But the details of Krishna’s trust fund and the money he gave her mother have not been made public after a request from his lawyers. At the time of his death Forstmann was worth $1.8billion (£1.1billion) making him the 782nd richest man in the world. Sighting: Theodore Forstmann with Princess Diana at Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts in August 1994 . The trust fund could run into the millions and could be used to pay for education or to just make Krishna financially secure for the rest of her life. It had been reported that despite not being her father Forstman had been ‘carrying out the role of father since the moment Krishna was delivered into his arms.’ This led to speculation he was the dad but it later turned out the real father was Adam Dell, a U.S. venture capitalist and brother of Dell computer founder Michael Dell. Dell had dated Lakshmi for two years but when they broke up she told him that she was pregnant and that Forstmann was the father. Mother and daughter: Padma Lakshmi was seen at lunch with her little girl Krishna in New York in August 2010 . Lakshmi encouraged her daughter to call him ‘Papa’ and gave the infant the middle name Thea that seems to be a nod to his full name. She also publicly declared her love for Forstmann by saying: ‘I am lucky to have someone who unwaveringly gave me love and manly support — and is also the person that I love. So thank you, Teddy.’ Dell however claimed a paternity test proved it was his baby and sued for full custody. He also demanded his name was put on the birth certificate, as it had been left off. Fame: Padma Lakshmi, left, is seen with her ex-husband, author Salman Rushdie, in West Hollywood, California, in March 2006. Ted Forstmann is seen right with actress Liz Hurley in New York in December 1999 . The New York Daily News reported that the lawsuit has now been resolved . Arlee Harris, of New York law firm Kaye Scholer said that providing for children who are not your own has been done before in the U.S. But she said: ‘It may be just an education trust, but it sounds like he was closest to this woman. ‘There’s more to it here.’ At the time of Princess Diana’s death in 1997, Forstmann was supposedly one of the men she was considering as her second husband. High flying: Ted Forstmann stands in front of a business jet in April 1997 in Los Angeles, California . Despite being more than 20 years her senior he had a lifestyle she craved - fame, wealth and power. He was the chief executive of sports and entertainment marketing firm IMG which looked after models Gisele and Heidi Klum, golfer Tiger Woods and tennis star Roger Federer. He bought, sold and turned around dozens of companies including Gulfstream Aerospace and Dr Pepper. He was also a 1980s pioneer in the use of leveraged buyouts, or deals financed at least partly with debt. Although he never married Forstmann also dated Elizabeth Taylor and was seen with a string of beautiful women. Father: Venture capitalist Adam Dell is seen in Manhattan, New York, with daughter Krishna in October 2010 . His death was due to complications arising from brain cancer. He left two children, Everest and Siya, both orphans who were both adopted from South Africa and lived with him in New York. Lakshmi, 41, became famous from modelling and wrote a number of best-selling cookery books in the 1990s. She married Rushdie in 2004, but they divorced three years later.","Teddy Forstmann changed his .

"Tiger Woods has not played competitively in nearly four months, but the injury plagued former world No 1 has not altered his aim for this week's Hero World Challenge event - win. Winning is something Woods has not yet done this year, in a truncated season marked by back surgery in March and again in August after his attempted return was aborted after missing the cut at the PGA Championship. The 38-year-old proclaimed himself healthy and on the way back after working with a new swing consultant, if perhaps a bit rusty. But some of his big rivals this week admitted that Woods looked to be striking the ball in the manner he was once famous for. Tiger Woods poses on a motorcycle produced by the sponsors of his tournament in Florida . Woods swings his driver (left) and comes under the gaze of new coach, Chris Como (right) 'It felt good to be out there,' Woods told reporters after Wednesday's pro-am on the eve of the opening round of the elite 18-player event that benefits his foundation. 'Obviously, been playing at home with my boys for a little bit of cash, but still (that is) a little bit different. Every shot counts a little bit more. (But) Felt good.' It also felt comfortable for Woods, who is staging the event this year at Isleworth, the enclave he had called home for over a decade before moving to Jupiter Island. Asked if he had the usual designs on winning that carried him to a collection of 14 majors, second only to Jack Nicklaus's 18, Woods said: 'Obviously, or I wouldn't enter.' The 14-time major champion worked with Como into the dark on the practice ground after the pro-am . Woods will compete at the Hero World Challenge at Isleworth in Florida this week . Como gives some advice to Woods ahead of their first professional competition as a team . VIDEO Tiger aiming to ‘beat the golf course’ Some of the top-notch players invited to the event said the tournament host was looking like the Woods of old. 'What I saw from Tiger from the side in the 10, 20 balls that I watched him, it looked a lot freer,' Steve Stricker said after sharing the driving range. 'Didn't look like he was getting in his way. Looked like the club was going through a lot freer. Looked like it was on a better path.' Zach Johnson, the 2007 Masters champion, also had a favorable impression. 'It looked great. I mean, the compression looked there, the turn looked there. Woods's mother. Kultida, was also at Isleworth to watch her son in Windermere, Florida . 'Watched the first two, three, four balls and then it hit me - ""Oh, wait a minute, he hasn't played in a while"". It looked like he was just kind of riding a bike.' The balky back limited Woods to eight tournaments in a season in which he missed two cuts and withdrew from two events. Stricker warned not to count Woods out. 'I think if he starts swinging it better and starts feeling good about what he's doing again, it won't take long for him to be at the top of the game again,' he said.","Tiger Woods returns to competitive golf this week after four months out .

"Princes William and Harry paid tribute to a childhood friend', who died in a car crash 12 years ago, at a carol service. Both the princes joined forces to remember Henry van Straubenzee, a 'very special friend' of the brothers who was killed at the age of 18. They made a joint speech to the congregation of around 800 guests, which included Chelsy Davy and Tara Palmer Tomkinson. The service for Mr van Straubenzee, who was in the same class at school as Prince Harry, was held at St Luke's and Christ Church in Chelsea, London last night to raise money for a memorial fund set up in his name. Prince Harry (centre) and Prince William gave a joint tribute to their childhood friend Henry van Straubenzee at St Luke's and Christ Church in Chelsea on Tuesday evening, referring to him as a 'very special friend' Prince William (centre) delivered a speech at the memorial service for Mr van Straubenzee to 800 guests . Prince Harry entertained the congregation as he described sharing childhood escapades during his teenage years - many of which he jokingly confessed were 'not for public consumption.' The Prince described Mr van Straubenzee as a 'Polzeath surfing legend and ladies' man with whom we shared so many special memories.' Mr van Straubenzee, of Hertfordshire, became friends with the princes when they were all pupils at Ludgrove prep school in Berkshire. He was a classmate of Prince Harry's, while his older brother Thomas was a friend of the Duke of Cambridge. The foursome were said to be inseparable as they were growing up. In recognition of his close bond with Mr van Straubenzee and the rest of his family, Prince Harry also affectionately described an 'infectious van Straubenzee laugh could turn a very bad day into a good one.' His brother, the Duke of Cambridge, stood opposite Prince Harry at the Lectern and urged people to remember the teenager and his memorial fund. 'He was a friend to many people here and a very special friend to us, who we share so many happy childhood memories with,' he said. The Duke added that 'Henry would be amazed' at the success of his memorial fund, set up to help children in Uganda, in giving so many people a chance at life. His brother then urged the congregation 'please sing your hearts out as Henry will certainly be watching.' Mr van Straubenzee is pictured in 2001 before his death near his and Prince Harry's prep school a year later . Ellie Goulding, a favourite of the princes who sang at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding, is also understood to have performed at the service. It was organised by the Henry van Straubenzee memorial fund, which the princes became joint patrons of in 2009. Mr van Straubenzee was killed in a car crash in 2002 just outside his former prep school. He had been returning to the school, where he and the driver were both working as part of their gap year, when the car he was travelling in hit a tree. He was due to travel to Uganda later that year.

The Henry van Straubenzee memorial fund was set up by his family after his death to raise money to help people in Uganda by improving education through investing in buildings and resources. It is the only charity which the brothers are joint patrons of. When they became patrons in 2009 Prince Harry said: 'Henry was one of my greatest friends and his death was truly shocking to many people.

"A woman has raised hundreds of pounds for a cancer charity after growing a moustache for Movember. Linda Cook, who describes herself as 'quite a hairy girly', did not pluck, wax or remove any of her facial hair for the whole of last month. The 49-year-old wanted to raise money and awareness after her husband Robin, 54, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March.

'Robin wasn't keen to start with but he's got used to it, which is more than I have. It doesn't feel right to poke your tongue out of your mouth and touch fuzz. 'I have tried putting lipstick on too but I look like a bad transvestite.' Robin was diagnosed with cancer after he went for a routine prostate cancer check-up earlier this year.

I used to bleach it and now pluck it with tweezers. It just seems quite a simple thing to do.

'Normally I pluck every morning. It's like the routine - you cleanse, tone, moisturise, brush your teeth, pull the hairs out.' Linda has been wearing a T-shirt to explain why she has facial hair. She is having her 'fuzz' waxed off today at a local beauty salon. Off it comes: Linda is having the hair removed at a beauty salon today after raising hundreds of pounds . She added: 'It's so going to hurt - I'm like a wolf. My tweezers are coming back to being my best friend again, if they forgive me.

"The story of their romance is something like a fairytale – boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after. But forget the glass slippers and the midnight curfew, Steve, 34, and Kristy Davey, 34, met when they celebrated at Schoolies in 1998 and are now happily married with three kids - Joel, four, Joshua, three and Luke, 18 months. The Schoolies sweethearts came from different towns – Kristy from Lismore, northeastern New South Wales and Steve from Narrabeen in northern Sydney – and both stayed in neighbouring apartments at the Surfers Del Ray Hotel. Scroll down for video . Flashback: Steve and Kristy Davey met when they both celebrated at Schoolies at Surfers Paradise in 1998 . ‘When I first spotted Kristy arriving at the hotel, I thought “this could be a fun week”,’ Mr Davey told Daily Mail Australia. ‘All our friends got on really well and we had such a great time together.’ Mrs Davey told Daily Mail Australia: 'It sounds corny but could I say it was love at first sight?' 'I was taken back by his smile when I first saw him on the balcony - I still tell him now and I see that in my youngest son Luke.' The couple tied the knot in 2009 and decided to move to Brisbane to start their family . The couple tied the knot in 2009 near Sydney Harbour Bridge and later moved to Brisbane to start their family . But the week-long festivities didn’t end there. The pair continued their relationship for the next 12 months. ‘We exchanged numbers and decided to give the long distance a shot,’ Mr Davey said. ‘I went to Lismore and hung out with her family and friends and she would come see me in Sydney – I thought she had a really fun personality and a great sense of humour. ‘I also remember when my family organised a trip to the UK and my brother even insisted on paying for my flight but I told them that I was due to see my girlfriend. ‘One time we were sitting on the beach at Narrabeen and Kristy started crying because she knew she had to go back home. But I said: “Don’t worry, you should come and live with me”. Kristy moved to Sydney and lived with Steve and his parents for three years while she studied a degree in registered nursing. 'Steve's parents were gracious enough for me to come and stay - providing I had a part time job,’ Mrs Davey said. ‘We moved out once I finished my degree and had full time work while Steve continued to study and complete his combined law and science degree and worked part time.' In October this year, the family moved to the Gold Coast - where their fairytale story began . The pair both stayed in neighbouring apartments at the Surfers Del Ray Hotel when their romance began . The pair lived in Sydney for 10 years before they tied the knot in February 2009 and had their first son Joel in February 2010. ‘We had a big wedding and we could overlook the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We relocated to Brisbane in mid-2010 and remained there for four years and had another two beautiful boys – Joshua and Luke,’ Mr Davey said. ‘We decided to move there because it would be a cheaper lifestyle and we couldn’t afford to buy a house in Sydney – also Kristy’s family lives in Lismore so it was closer to them and they could see the kids.' But the family moved to the Gold Coast in October this year, which brought back the 'very fond memories' of their Schoolies experience. ‘We moved again to our favourite place and the place we met and now call home,’ Mrs Davey said. ‘On December 12th this year we will be celebrating 16 years together and I couldn't think of a better place to be than back living where it all began. Steve and Kristy Davey have three beautiful sons - Joel, four, Joshua, three and Luke, 18 months . Meet the couple who met at Schoolies 16 years ago and are now married with three kids . Despite Schoolies grabbing national headlines this year, the couple said they will not let their children miss the experience they once shared. 'We got to see them [school leavers] down here yahooing off the balcony and having a great time - I'm not going to take that experience away from my kids,' Mr Davey said. 'I had one of the best weeks of my life and they deserve to take over the town - I think the parties now are pretty much the same when we were there. Except we didn't have the digital cameras to document anyone passing out in the gutter and you could get away with it. 'Who knows? They could meet their soul mates there and an advice to Schoolies - Don't break all the girls' hearts because you'll just break your own heart in the process - it's corny but it's true. Mrs Davey added: 'We couldn't say no but I am nervous about sending the boys there when they finish high school. We were given the opportunity to go to Schoolies so we can't wrap them in cotton wool and stop them from going, could I?'","Steve and Kristy Davey met at Schoolies  in 1998 .

"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been given the go-ahead to start an overhaul of his squad next month. Five months into the new season, Pochettino remains unconvinced by a number of the players he inherited when he arrived from Southampton in the summer. Jay Rodriguez starred for Southampton under Mauricio Pochettino but hasn't played this season due to injury . Hector Moreno (left, challenging Cristiano Ronaldo) worked under Pochettino at Espanyol . Sportsmail understands the club are preparing for one of the busiest January transfer windows in their history with Pochettino and chairman Daniel Levy determined to take serious steps to revamp the squad next month. Spurs’ run of three wins in a row came to an end on Wednesday in a 3-0 defeat at Chelsea. Despite the result, Spurs are showing signs they are starting to come round to Pochettino’s high-pressing tactics — even though, Sportsmail understands, certain players have privately questioned his decision to axe Roberto Soldado for the Stamford Bridge encounter given that the striker’s re-introduction to the starting XI had coincided with three victories. Pochettino and his backroom team have been busy using their contacts in Spain to identify potential targets in January. Aaron Lennon and Emmanuel Adebayor (right) could be sold in the January transfer window . Paulinho, in action against Chelsea on Wednesday night, has fallen out of favour under Pochettino . Jan Vertonghen could also be sold in January as Pochettino considers a clearout of his Tottenham squad . Espanyol defender Hector Moreno, who the Argentine manager worked with before, is a player firmly on Pochettino’s radar even though he is recovering from a broken leg. Barcelona youngsters Sergi Samper and Adama Traore are also being watched. Tottenham will also bid to sign Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez. However, there will be players on their way out too with the club willing to listen to offers for Paulinho, Vlad Chiriches, Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend next month.

"A Republican congressman has sparked outrage by claiming Eric Garner would not have died after an NYPD cop put him in a chokehold if he hadn't been in poor health. Peter King said on Wednesday that Mr Garner's asthma, heart condition and obesity were the reasons he died on Staten Island on July 17. The New York representative's inflammatory remarks came as New York City erupted in protests on Wednesday after a grand jury decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, who grabbed Mr Garner and put him in a chokehold. Scroll down for video . Peter King said on Wednesday that Mr Garner's asthma, heart condition and 350lb weight contributed to his death on Staten Island on July 17 . The Republican congressman made his remarks during an interview with Wolf Blitzer (left) on CNN on Wednesday following the news that there would be no indictment of police officers in the death of Eric Garner . King told CNN on Wednesday: 'If he [Garner] had not had asthma, and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died from this.' The politician said the cops had 'no reason' to know that Mr Garner, 43, was in danger - despite the fact the father-of-six can be heard repeatedly saying he can't breathe on the videotaped attack. King added: 'The fact is if you can't breathe, you can't talk. If you've ever seen anyone resisting arrest, I've seen it, and it's been white guys, and they're always saying, ''You're breaking my arm, you're choking me, you're doing this'' -  police hear this all the time.' The politician also told CNN that the attack was not racially-motivated and a 350lb white guy 'would have been treated the same'. King tweeted his support for the grand jury decision over the death for Mr Garner on Wednesday and offered condolences to the late father-of-six . Throughout his physical distress Eric Garner was kept in handcuffs seen in this screen grab (left) from cellphone video shot at the scene on July 17 . The representative also tweeted his support for the decision on Wednesday, posting: 'Thanks to SI grand jury for doing justice & not yielding to outside pressure. Decision must be respected. Compassion for the Garner family.' Responses to Mr King's remarks showed the depth of public anger over the grand jury decision. @pridgen responded: 'If you only had a brain Peter King. You are a disgrace to your public office.' Congressman King said Mr Garner would not have died if it wasn't for his size and health concerns . Tucker Scott Atkins posted in response: 'You're a complete joke.' sharonM tweeted: '@RepPeteKing Seriously? Not even a Misdemeanor Charge of Strangulation? What a travesty.' However commenters on a popular police blog joined King on Thursday by supporting the grand jury decision and attacked outraged protesters, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and the media. One post from VON1, on the Policeone website, read: 'Have you heard the mayor of NY press release. Wow! 35,000 cops just got b****slapped.' Esu5 wrote: 'Every now and then we win one. Horrible situation, man lost his life, but like in the Ferguson case he controlled his own destiny.' office1149 posted: 'If you can shout ''I can't breath'' [sic] you can probably breath [sic]!' The New York City ruled Mr Garner's death a homicide in August because of the compression to his neck and chest and the way he was held on the ground. The examiner also said that Mr Garner's health problems contributed to his death. The grand jury decision on Eric Garner's death came nine days after the Ferguson grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The decision by the New York grand jury panel on Wednesday means that a majority of them did not think there was probable cause a crime was committed by Pantaleo, who was the only NYPD officer facing indictment. Two other officers at the scene were offered immunity if they testified before the grand jury. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled his first scheduled appearance as mayor at the Rockefeller Center tree lighting on Wednesday and addressed the city instead. His office issued a statement calling Garner's death a 'tragedy' and a 'deeply emotional day – for the Garner Family, and all New Yorkers'. Fearing a repeat of the riots witnessed in Ferguson, de Blasio repeated the city's commitment to non-violent protests. 'Today's outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Yet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through non-violent protest,' the mayor said. Cellphone footage from Garner's arrest, for allegedly selling untaxed, loose cigarettes, showed Pantaleo grappling with the larger man, ultimately placing his arms around his neck in a banned chokehold manoeuvre. On the ground, Garner was clearly heard pleading, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' as officers handcuffed him. He lost consciousness at the scene and was pronounced dead later that day at hospital.

"Up to 40 per cent of road deaths around the world are thought to be caused by alcohol. But one day, cars could detect whether a driver’s voice sounds drunk, to stop them from driving and prevent accidents. Researchers in Germany have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness by listening for vocal cues. Scroll down for video . Researchers in Germany have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness in cars (Illustrated with a stock image) Called the Alcohol Language Corpus, the database was made between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink, before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car, where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat. There are currently conversations from 162 German men and women in the publicly-available audio database. Experts at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine in the city collected the data, FastCompany reported. From this, an algorithm that is capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns, has been created by computer scientists at Queens College and Columbia University. Scientists have used the library to create an algorithm that can predict if a driver is drunk. The hope is that it could be built into cars to stop people putting their key in the ignition and driving off. The technology would act as a preventative measure, unlike breathalysers (pictured) that are used by the police to prove an offence . Just three hours behind the wheel at night can make motorists drive as badly as if they were drunk, scientists claim. Driver tiredness after a few hours has the same effect as being over the drink-driving limit, a 2011 study revealed. Even two hours of motorway driving in the dark can affect performance so severely it is the same as having a couple of drinks. It's estimated that one-fifth of all traffic accidents are due to sleepiness behind the wheel and one in three people admit to nodding off while driving at night. They found that they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent. Drunken speech hallmarks include stammering and stuttering. Voices also tend to rise in pitch and words begin to slur, they said. It is hoped that the software could be used alongside devices such as locks and immobilisers to make it impossible for people to drive when drunk – perhaps by asking them a few questions while analysing the driver’s voice. ‘The cars themselves could listen to the driver, detect that the potential driver is intoxicated, and prevent the car from starting,’ the researchers explained. However, the safety system may be a few years away, because the algorithm to detect drunkenness is typically only right around three quarters of the time. ‘That means, you want to go and drive your car, one in three times we're going to say you're drunk. That's bad for a product,’ Professor Andrew Rosenberg, of Queens College New York (CUNY) said. The next step is to add more languages to the library so that more experts can use the public library for their own research.","German researchers have created the first library of drunk speech patterns .

"Around 12,800 years ago Earth was plunged into a ‘Big Freeze’, resulting in the extinction of many species. What caused this event, however, is not known. One theory is that Earth was struck by a comet or asteroid at the time and now new research supporting the theory has been released. By studying nanodiamonds scattered across Europe, North America and South America, the researchers say the impact theory is right. A study by the University of Chicago says a cosmic impact (illustrated) is the best explanation for the 'Big Freeze' 12,800 years ago. They say evidence for this comes from nanodiamonds scattered across 11 countries that could only have come from space . In the University of Chicago study, scientists claim the Younger Dryas (YD) period - the name given to the cooling episode about 12,800 years ago - was the result of a cosmic impact. This drastic climate change coincided with the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna, such as the saber-tooth cats and the mastodon, and resulted in major declines in prehistoric human populations, including the end of the prehistoric Paleo-Indian Clovis culture. The result of the impact, they say, was a YD Boundary (YDB) layer of nanodiamonds scattered over 19 million square miles (50 million square km). Nanodiamonds are types of diamond that result from detonations or explosions. The Younger Dryas period is also known as the Big Freeze. It was a period of cold climatic conditions and drought that took place between 12,800 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists believe this change in climate was caused by a meteor impact, but another theory is that it was because of the collapse of the North American ice sheets. During the period, forests in Scandinavia were replaced with a glacial tundra. There was more dust in the atmosphere that originated from deserts in Asia. The drier conditions caused drought in the Levant, known as the region of Syria or the Eastern Mediterranean, which led inhabitants to agriculture. The change in climate is especially linked to the development of cereal cultivation. ‘In [11] countries of the Northern Hemisphere, the YDB layer contains a clearly defined abundance peak in nanodiamonds, a major cosmic-impact proxy,’ Professor James Kennett and his colleagues wrote. Microscopic nanodiamonds, melt-glass, carbon spherules, and other high-temperature materials are found in abundance throughout the YDB field, in a thin layer located only metres from the Earth's surface. Because these materials formed at temperatures in excess of 2,200°C (4,000°F), the fact they are present together so near to the surface suggests they were likely created by a major extraterrestrial impact event, such as an asteroid. In addition to providing support for the cosmic impact hypothesis, the study also offers evidence to reject alternate hypotheses for the formation of the YDB nanodiamonds, such as wildfires and increased volcanic activity. With limited evidence, several rival theories have been proposed about the event that sparked this period, such as a collapse of the North American ice sheets, a major volcanic eruption, or a solar flare. According to the study the result of the impact was a YD Boundary (YDB) layer scattered over 19 million square miles (50 million square kilometres). Through the regions shown in this map material is found in a thin layer just a few metres below the surface across the globe . Based on multiple analytical procedures, the researchers determined that the majority of the materials in the YDB samples are nanodiamonds and not some other kinds of minerals. The analysis showed that the nanodiamonds consistently occur in the YDB layer over broad areas. To date, scientists know of only two layers on Earth in which nanodiamonds have been found in various locations, indicating an impact event. These are the YDB layer in this study and the well-known Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary 65 million years ago, which is marked by the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. 'The evidence we present settles the debate about the existence of abundant YDB nanodiamonds,' Kennett said. The study, ‘Nanodiamond-rich layer across three continents consistent with major cosmic impact,’ was published in the Journal of Geology. Material from the YDB layer, carbon spherules shown here, formed at temperatures in excess of 2,200°C (4,000°F). This suggests they were likely created by a major impact event. Several other theories have been suggested for this Younger Dryas period nearly 13,000 years ago, including wildfires and a solar flare .","A study by the University of Chicago says a cosmic impact is the best explanation for the 'Big Freeze' 12,800 years ago .

"When the privacy storm erupted around Facebook and other sites, one thing became readily apparent: most users were simply not aware of what they had signed up for. So, in a move to allay complaints, Facebook has created a new section that makes it easier for the average user to understand the site's terms and conditions. Called Privacy Basics, the social network now breaks down all aspects of the site's terms of use for users in simple infographics - and also shows people how to change their privacy settings. Scroll down for video . California-based Facebook has unveiled simplified privacy information on their site (screenshot shown), which uses infographics to explain how data is used by the social network. It also has step by step instructions for users to alter their settings . The site details what other Facebook users see about you when they use the site, as well as how they interact with you. It also includes guides on how to change various settings, and control how you share content on Facebook, including how to change privacy settings. The move has been welcomed by privacy campaigners, but they warn this should be the first step of many taken to improve the transparency of social networks. - Location data for posts and photos that are shared on the site. - The type of content you look at on Facebook, as well as the frequency and duration spent looking at it. - Information and content about you from other users; including when they share a photo with you or send you a message. - The location of the device, and the type of device you connect to Facebook from. Emma Carr, director of privacy rights group Big Brother Watch said: 'It is certainly positive that steps are being taken to simplify privacy settings and to help educate users to have more control over their privacy. 'However, there is always more that could and should be done. 'With many internet companies' privacy policies and terms and conditions being longer than Shakespearean plays and requiring multiple law degrees to understand, users are undoubtedly still in the dark about how their information is accessed and manipulated. 'Until companies stop bamboozling their users with complicated and lengthy jargon, they simply cannot claim to be transparent or take the privacy of their users seriously.'

The new site (screenshot shown) is designed to make it easier for people to understand what they are signing up for. But one expert warns this should be just the first step of many . Facebook appear to be trying to do just that, with the California-based firm also confirming that a new version of their terms of service will come into effect on 1 January, with notifications being sent to Facebook users alerting them to the change and encouraging them to read the new agreement - which is accepted through continued use of the site and its official apps. The new agreement has been made shorter, with parts relating to developers and advertisers both significantly cut down or moved to new pages in a move that Facebook hopes will make the agreements easier to digest. In the blog post that announced the new Privacy Basics set-up, Facebook's chief privacy officer Erin Egan said that the aim was to better educate users on how they could take control of their data. 'Privacy Basics offers interactive guides to answer the most commonly asked questions about how you can control your information on Facebook,' she said. 'For example, you can learn about untagging, unfriending, and blocking, and how to choose an audience for your posts.'

"Tax shelter: Take That's Gary Barlow with his wife, Dawn . Serial tax avoiders face huge fines and could even be named and shamed. The Chancellor launched a crackdown yesterday that could raise £2.8billion a year from those who take part in schemes designed to cut their tax bills. He outlawed a number of tax ruses commonly used by the well-off and the self-employed to disguise their true earnings. And the small print in Treasury documents revealed that the Government is to review whether the names of serial tax avoiders should be published as a way of shaming them and deterring others. In the past 18 months, a number of celebrities, including comedian Jimmy Carr and Take That star Gary Barlow, have come under fire for using tax avoidance schemes. The threat to name and shame serial avoiders comes at a time when HM Revenue and Customs is being handed more powers to tackle those it believes owe the State. It already publishes a ‘most wanted’ list with the names and photographs of cheats involved in VAT and tax credit fraud. It has always been a principle of the tax system that a person’s affairs are kept private and publicly naming and shaming those who had not been convicted of a crime has been seen as a breach of this. However, experts said revealing the names of high-profile figures could help put off others from taking part in tax avoidance schemes. Ashley Hollinshead, tax partner at the accountancy firm Deloitte, said: ‘People like their tax affairs to remain private, so the threat to have your details made public if you use certain schemes is a major disincentive. ‘Some of the schemes targeted are quite mainstream, but others are more specifically about tax avoidance. ‘What this Government is saying is that if you’re doing something and they think it is deliberately to pay less tax, then they want to stop that.’ Schemes being outlawed by the Chancellor include those where business owners sell their company to another one they own as a ruse to pay less tax. He is also cracking down on hedge fund managers who hide their income from fees on some types of shares issued as a way of cutting tax, and on schemes where avoiders take loans as a way of hiding their true income. Fines are also being increased for people who do not declare avoidance schemes, and there will be a clampdown on those promoting them. Non-domiciled residents, or non-doms, will have to pay £60,000 a year if they have been in the UK for 12 of the past 14 years, and £90,000 if they have been here for 17 of the past 20 years. This new rule is to combat foreign nationals living in the UK who have found a way round existing guidelines. Earlier this year, a court ruled that Barlow, 43, fellow Take That members Howard Donald, 46, and Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild had attempted to shelter £66million in a tax avoidance scheme. They could now face paying back £20million to HMRC. Barlow has apologised to those ‘offended by the tax stories’. Banks we bailed out will face £4bn bill to help the recovery . Osborne said if the regime was allowed to continue some banks would not be paying tax for  20 years . Britain's scandal-hit banks are facing a shock £4billion tax bill, forcing them to ‘pay their fair share’ for triggering the financial crisis. The Chancellor announced a tough new rules on their ability to use losses from previous years to cut tax bills on current profits. George . Osborne said if the regime was allowed to continue some banks would not be paying tax for 15 to 20 years. Describing this as ‘totally unacceptable’, he added: ‘The banks got public support in the crisis and they should now support the public in the recovery.’ As part of the single biggest revenue-raising measure in the Autumn Statement, banks will only be able to offset half their profits against past losses. Currently, they can use previous losses to wipe out their profit and avoid paying corporation tax. The Treasury forecasts that the reform will raise £3.5billion over five years and said restrictions on tax relief for losses on bad loans will raise a further £350million over the same period. Mr Osborne said the move will ensure ‘our banks pay their fair share’ and pointed out that corporation tax receipts from the banking sector has plunged from £7.3billion in 2006/7 to just £1.6billion in 2013/14. Ashley Hollinshead, tax partner at accountant Deloitte, said: ‘This will hit the banks hard as the wall of losses they stored up in the financial crisis will no longer mean the banks won’t be paying tax to fund the economic recovery.’ It is thought that bailed-out lenders Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland, in which taxpayers still have a considerable stake, will be hardest hit. They have racked up billions of pounds in losses, which they have used to cut the amount they pay to the Exchequer. Lloyds has £5billion of so-called deferred tax assets at its disposal. RBS and NatWest have a total of £2.4billion, while Barclays has £500million. The tougher rules will not apply to new banks that incur losses in their first few years, because the Government does not want to restrict challenger banks set up to take on the High Street giants. The Treasury admitted that uncertainty over the amount of tax the change will raise from the banks is ‘very high’, because it is difficult to predict how much profit they will make.","Osborne outlawed a number of tax ruses commonly used by the well-off and the self-employed to disguise their true earnings .

"The widow of Eric Garner has said that prosecutors never had any intention of indicting the police officer who held her husband in the chokehold that killed him. Esaw Snipes-Garner, 46, appeared on the Today show on Thursday morning, just hours after prosecutors in Staten Island, New York announced that Daniel Pantaleo would not be charged. In an incident caught on camera in July, Pantaleo was seen placing Garner in a chokehold in the street and ignoring his cries that he could not breathe. Garner later died in hospital. On Wednesday, authorities announced that the officer would not be indicted - which Mrs Garner said came as no surprise. Scroll down for video . Anger: Esaw Snipes-Garner appeared on the Today show on Thursday and said she rejects the apology from the officer who killed her husband with a chokehold. The officer will not be indicted . Let down: Joined by Al Sharpton, she told Savannah Guthrie that she never felt any sincerity from authorities as they investigated her husband's death at the hands of the officer . 'Honestly, I think from the beginning I had no faith in Staten Island prosecuting anybody from Staten Island,' she said. 'I felt no remorse, I felt no compassion, no anything from Staten Island - besides the people on Staten Island. As far as the police and the DA - there was no sincerity in his eyes form day one.' The officer issued an apology to the family on Wednesday but Mrs Garner said she refused to accept it. 'The time to apologize or have any remorse would have been when my husband was screaming and he couldn't breathe,' she said. She also described the moment that she heard that 29-year-old Pantaleo, who is still working for the force but has been put on desk duty, would not face any charges. Cuffed: A video shows the aftermath of the chokehold where Garner lies on the floor in cuffs. He had told police 11 times that he could not breathe after they jumped on him when he was found selling untaxed cigarettes . 'No Christmas': Garner, a father of six, won't be around to play Santa for his children this year, his wife sai . 'I just dropped my phone and just started bawling and started crying because it's not fair,' she said. 'What do they not see? How could they possibly not indict? I felt hopeless. I felt like there was not another corner to turn. Like there was nothing left for me to fight for.' She appeared with the Reverend Al Sharpton on the show and said that working with him now gives her hope because she feels like they will seek justice. On CBS This Morning on Thursday, she added: 'We need justice. Somebody needs to pay. I'm just trying to, you know, make sure his death is not in vain.' Her appearance on the show came after an angry outburst during a press conference on Wednesday night, in which she lashed out at the officer. 'He’s still working, he’s still collecting a paycheck, feeding his kids,' Garner said of Pantaleo. 'My husband is now six feet under and I'm looking for a way to feed my kids.' At the press conference, Sharpton called for peaceful protests. For more videos, please go to Vine . Lashing out: She also appeared at a press conference on Wednesday and said she does not accept officer Daniel Pantaleo's apology for killing her husband with a chokehold over the summer . Outrage: Garner's mother Gwen Carr  expressed her shock over the decision, saying: 'I don’t know what video they were looking at. It wasn't the same one the rest of the world was looking at' Speaking out: Following the decision, protests were held across the city throughout the night . Mrs Garnder added: 'This fight ain't over, it's just begun. He should be here celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas with his children... He’s not here because a cop did wrong. 'As long as I have a breath in my body, I will fight.' Pantaleo had been stripped of his gun and badge and will remain on desk duty pending an internal police investigation that could result in administrative charges. In his statement on Wednesday, he said: 'It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner...I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss.'

"Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez are inspiring awe with freakish regularity. For the Argentine, it is rocket shots from all angles. For the Chilean, it is his uncanny knack of scoring at just the right time. On Wednesday night, each delivered again. Aguero took his Premier League tally to 14 goals with a double of sheer beauty at Sunderland; Sanchez reached nine with a late finish to claim victory over stubborn Southampton. Both have South American flair in spades, but it is each player’s steely resolve to win games for their team which is most impressive. Both Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez (right) have been key for their teams this season . Aguero has scored 45 per cent of Manchester City’s goals in the Premier League this season. Sanchez’s strikes account for 41 per cent of Arsenal’s total. Each forward has directly won nine points through their contributions so far (goals and assists) – and are single-handedly raising their clubs up the division, as these tables show. City slump six places to eighth with Aguero out of the equation. Erase him from Manuel Pellegrini’s selections and there would be no four-goal demolition of Tottenham translating a defeat to victory, no winner against Manchester United, no rescue mission at Queens Park Rangers. Arsenal plummet even further minus Sanchez – eight places to 14th. As much as his tenacity and technique are a joy to behold, his empirical importance is what Arsene Wenger will value. He has salvaged draws from defeats against Leicester, Manchester City, and Hull – won the game at Sunderland and set his side on the path to late victory over Burnley. Sergio Aguero scored twice for Manchester City against Sunderland on Wednesday night . Aguero’s qualities are well-established – it is more than two years since Aguerooooo won the title for City – but his level right now, at 26, is approaching the heights climbed only by the best this country has seen. For impact and ingenuity, he is matching the likes of Luis Suarez, Thierry Henry and Cristiano Ronaldo. Sanchez has taken to English football with an ease that is not necessarily guaranteed by a large transfer cheque. Aged 25, he is still on an upward curve, making his £30million fee last summer appear ever more a bargain as each defining goal hits the back of the net. Even after only 14 Premier League games, it is clear the final finishing positions of City and Arsenal will be determined by the form and fitness of two men measuring 5ft 8in and 5ft 7in. Size doesn’t matter, goals do. Sanchez scores Arsenal's winner against Southampton at the end to secure all three points . Sanchez celebrates as he netted his ninth goal of the season . Diego Costa has scored 11 goals for Chelsea since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer . P.S. Diego Costa, on 11 goals, separates Aguero and Sanchez in second at the top of the scoring charts. He has stormed into this league but is not as individually important as the other two. Without his goals and assists Chelsea would still be first, such is their supremacy and spread of contributors. Five points fewer, but still No 1.","Sergio Aguero has scored 14 goals for Manchester City this season .

"When looking for the perfect hotel, its Wi-Fi service is the most important factor, according to new research. A survey on important factors when searching for accommodation revealed that 67 per cent of travellers are most concerned with Wi-Fi, above any other factor. The internet connection ranked higher than the hotel's location, a good night's sleep and friendly staff. A new study  found that fast, free Wi-Fi to be most important factor when booking a hotel stay . According to the study, carried out by London's Amba Hotel, 67 per cent of those questioned said that free Wi-Fi would make them more likely to choose accommodation, beating 65 per cent, who would judge a hotel on location. When rating a hotel that they'd already stayed in, 60 per cent of travellers believed unlimited Wi-Fi was the important factor. Just 58 per cent cared most about a good night's sleep and only 40 per cent was bothered about hotel staff that were friendly and knowledgeable. The new four-star Amba Hotel Charing Cross is now open - and offering unlimited Wi-Fi to all guests . 1. Free WiFi - 67% . 2. Location - 65% . 3. Fast WiFi with unlimited downloads - 34% . 4. Close to travel hubs - 34% . 5. Good bars/restaurants in hotel - 26% . 1. Checking social media - 58% . 2. Checking directions - 54% . 3. Sending/receiving work emails - 49% . 4. Local travel tips - 43% . 5. Skype calls - 31% . More than 1,000 UK travellers were questioned in what they look for in a hotel, as well as those little irritants that ruin their relaxing trip or business stay. More than a quarter of travellers have complained about slow or hard to use WiFi and a whopping 84 per cent of us have suffered as a result of slow WiFi. Thirty three per cent were not able to send or receive important work emails, while 27 per cent hadn't been able to contact home and eight per cent of respondents have even lost a client or business opportunity after being let down by slow internet access. Interestingly, those from from Brighton, Belfast and Southampton were considerably more likely to have complained about slow Wi-Fi, while people from Glasgow, Nottingham and Norwich were the most laid back about staying connected. Forget about friendly hotel service! Only 40 per cent of respondents were concerned with knowledgeable staff . Business travellers are especially annoyed if Wi-Fi lets them down - 8% have lost a client due to slow internet . And it’s no surprise that people rate Wi-Fi so highly and get so annoyed when it lets them down; we rely on it heavily when travelling - especially when it comes to checking social media, scouting out travel tips, and even accessing dating sites. Belinda Atkins, CEO of the new Amba Hotels said; 'Fast, free, unlimited Wi-Fi is as important to our guests as any other facilities provided by the hotel – it’s actually as important as a good night’s sleep. 'Our Wi-Fi has no caveats, no loyalty schemes no limit on up or down loading. 'It’s is the fastest, free, unlimited W-iFi of any Meeting & Events hotel.'","67% of travellers are most concerned with free Wi-Fi when booking hotels .
In comparison, 65% ranked location as their top consideration .

"She's the creative mind behind the elegant and original handmade garments worn by the likes of Angelina Jolie and Beyoncé. But the story of Ralph & Russo's co-founder and creative director, Tamara Ralph, begins in Sydney's beach town of Cronulla, where she grew up sketching and sewing clothes for her friends and family. The 31-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that her childhood memories consist of sitting in the small sewing room alongside her mother and grandmother, surrounded by archives of sewing patterns, watching them at work. Scroll down for video . Tamara Ralph, from Cronulla in Sydney, and Michael Russo, from Carseldine in Queensland, started their brand in a small office with one furnishing, one mannequin and one computer. Now the duo's international business is designing the clothes of A-list stars like Beyoncé and Angelina Jolie . 'A lot of my family were in the fashion industry; my mother worked as a stylist and is now an interior designer, my grandmother and great grandmother were both couturiers, so it was always something I had an interest in from a young age,' Ms Ralph said. 'I used to watch them create beautiful dresses in our sewing room and when I got older, at about 10, they started teaching me draping and hand sewing and I was so interested in it that I would spend all my time sewing and sketching – I was just obsessed with creating. 'When I was really young, even two or three, my mother says I would refuse to sketch anything but dresses. If I got asked to draw a house at school, I said ""no, I'm drawing a dress"". 'It started as a passion, and when I was very young I would just start making dresses for myself and obviously when my girlfriends saw what I was wearing they'd want one as well.' Ralph's interest in fashion grew at her Cronulla home, where she would watch her mother and grandmother for hours in their sewing room. By 10-years-old, she was learning how to hand sew on her own and would eventually make clothes for her self and her friends . Now, she and her fiancé Michael Russo are the brains behind the hundred-million dollar exclusive brand Ralph & Russo, whose fashion expertise is in such high-demand that they've joined the ranks of Chanel, Christian Dior and Valentino and have been invited to the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris – something no Australian has ever achieved before; the highest accolade in in Haute Couture. Their recently launched accessories range – made-up of sheik handmade bags and shoes – has already sold out. But their unique business was born from just a chance encounter. After studying at the White House Institute of design in Sydney, Ralph set out to London for a holiday, where she hoped to make a break in the world of fashion. Instead, she ran into Russo, a banker from Carseldine in Queensland, who was sent to London for work. This year, Ralph & Russo were the master minds behind the smooth white silk and crepe tailored pencil dress that Angelina Jolie donned at the premiere of Unbroken (right) as well as Beyoncé  shimmering costumes during her Mrs Carter World Tour . Jolie's dove grey couture suit, that she dressed in when presented with her Damehood by the Queen, was also a Ralph & Russo design . 'Within four hours of arriving in the country, Michael and I accidentally ran into each other and started talking for some reason and we just kept talking for an hour and a half – it was a fate encounter,' Ralph said. With both of them looking for something different, they noticed a gap in the London market for Haute Couture and decided to take a leap of faith and combine their skills, while taking advantage of the international clientele constantly coming through London. 'We started in a very humble office – one furnishing, one mannequin, one computer – and grew to offices, and then floors, and then buildings,' Russo told Daily Mail Australia. Fast forward ten years later and the couple are expanding rapidly internationally – with boutiques and show rooms opening in Paris, New York and Hong Kong. Not to mention the constant travelling they do, to meet personally with their international clients in their very homes. Their company is in such high demand high-demand that they've joined the ranks of Chanel, Christian Dior and Valentino and have been invited to the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in Paris – something no Australian has ever achieved before; the highest accolade in in Haute Couture . The duo said that they began as a word-of-mouth business, 'we'd do one dress at an event and the next day we'd have five ladies calling and asking for something – it just spiralled'. But this year, they were the master minds behind the smooth white silk and crepe tailored pencil dress that Angelina Jolie donned at the premiere of Unbroken, as well as the dove grey couture suit she dressed in when she was presented with her Damehood from the Queen. Beyoncé is another known fan of the couple's creative designs, who Ralph & Russo said they worked with right from the begging of their business. The American singer chose their shimmering costumes for her Mrs Carter World Tour, including the iconic white crystal and pearl bodysuit, worn at her opening performance. Their unique business was born from a chance encounter. Ralph literally stumbled into Russo during a holiday in London 10 years ago, and the pair struck up a conversation . 'It's a lot of fun,' Ralph said of working with Beyoncé, refusing to give too much away. 'We prefer to work closely with a small selection of people so that we can work together and collaborate and create the perfect garment. They get really involved and there's a lot of collaboration.' Russo added, of Beyoncé and Jolie: 'They're just really lovely to work with. It's all about the event and finding what's perfect for that event and how they want to be perceived so that we can design something for them especially. Ralph only shared minimal details about one of the couple's most anticipated fashion events – their wedding - admitting that she would design four dresses and choose what she'd wear on the day, to surprise her fiancée . 'We have private collections for a lot of our clients so that's why we prefer to keep it very exclusive and personal.' The couple are very serious about their privacy. Alongside their refusal to comment on rumours that they're in talks with royal Kate Middleton, Ralph only shared minimal details about one of the couple's most anticipated fashion events – their wedding. 'It's something that's still in the works – it's a big secret,' Ralph said of her wedding dress. 'There will be a number of designs - I thought I should design about four and then I can choose what I'm going to wear on the day, so that he [Michael] doesn't know which one it will be.'","Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo, launched their London based fashion brand after a chance encounter .

'It was a warm day, and she was wearing a low-cut tank top, and as she leaned over, her breasts were very exposed,' the security source said of the mysterious mistress. 'They appeared to be very perky and very new and full... There was no doubt in my mind they were enhanced.'

Former President Clinton famously had an affair with . White House intern Monica Lewinsky in 1995, which later led to a televised apology to the American public in 1998. Lewsinky, speaking to Time magazine in 1999, called the relationship with the president 'definitely inappropriate.' 'It was definitely inappropriate,' she said. 'And the way he was flirting with me was inappropriate. So I think was the eye contact. And the way he looks at women he’s attracted to. 'He undresses you with his eyes. And it is slow, from the bottom of your toes to the top of your head back down to your toes again. And it’s an intense look. He loses his smile. His sexual energy kind of comes over his eyes, and it’s very animalistic. And if you’re someone who is comfortable with your sensuality, you’re in touch with that, you’re receptive to it if you find that person attractive.' Clinton also has admitted to having extramarital sex with Gennifer Flowers. Dolly Kyle Browning also said in a 1998 declaration that she had multiple sexual encounters with Clinton from the 1970s through 1992. 'The . frequency of our contact with each other, and the frequency of our . sexual encounters, varied over that time period, but we did have sexual . relations many times during that time period,' she said. Browning claimed Clinton ended the affair and said 'If you cooperate with the media we will destroy you.' Clinton also allegedly had a one-night stand with former Miss America Elizbeth Ward Gracen. Kessler's book will be published August 5 and will included 'stories that will makes headlines about our nation's leaders and the agency sworn to protect them,' a publicity synopsis claims.","A new book by Ronald Kessler claims Bill Clinton's mistress has been nicknamed 'Energizer' by his security staff .

"New job: Monica Lewinsky is a new Vanity Fair columnist, according to a blog posted on the magazine's website on Thursday. The blog comes a month after she published a tell-all about her Clinton affair for the magazine . One month after writing a tell-all about her affair with Bill Clinton for Vanity Fair, Monica Lewinsky has been made a contributor at the magazine. The magazine published her first Thursday afternoon, in which the 41-year-old talks about binge-watching Orange is the New Black. While Lewinsky writes that she finds the show 'riveting', she admits she didn't find a joke about herself very funny. In the the eleventh episode of the first season, one character is explaining to another how to perform a sex act and tells her she needs to 'Lewinsky that sh**' After more than a decade, Lewinsky is still sensitive to the jokes. 'I did what I usually do in these situations where the culture throws me a shard of my former self. After the cringing embarrassment, the whiff of shame, and the sense that I am no longer an agent running my own life, I shuddered, I got up off the sofa, and I turned it off,' Lewinsky wrote. Lewinsky went on to write about how people at the center of scandals today have more control over the public conversation thanks to social media - a tool she didn't have in the 90s when news of the Clinton affair broke. Lewinsky writes that people today who lose control of their 'public narratives' can go on social media and 'take control of their rightful place in their community.' 'They refuse to have their identities swindled or misshapen. Instead they take charge. They turn the attack on its head and use it as an opportunity for self-definition, instead of just taking blood as they go down,' Lewinsky writes, hinting that the column may be her own way of reclaiming her reputation. MailOnline has reached out to the magazine for comment about whether Lewinsky's column will be regular, but has not yet received a response.

"Passengers who scored Singapore Airlines business class seats at economy prices thanks to a computer error are being forced to re-book or cough up the difference in airfare. For some, that means they will have to spend an additional £2,700 to keep their seats in the roomier cabin.

"The star quarterback of Florida State football team has said 'the only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape'. Jameis Winston, who plays for the Florida State Seminoles, was giving evidence to a Florida Supreme Court hearing in to an alleged sexual assault following a campus party. Mr Winston is accused of sexually assaulting a former Florida State University student in his off-campus apartment in December 2012. Jameis Winston, who plays for the Florida State Seminoles, gave his evidence to a Florida Supreme Court yesterday amid the glare of the media - he vehemently denied the allegations made against him . Mr Winston in reflective mood during the case where he is accused of raping a Florida State University student . In his statement that was read out in court yesterday, Mr Winston vehemently denied the allegations put against him. He said: 'I did not rape or sexually assault (name redacted). I did not create a hostile, intimidating or offensive environment in the short period of time that we were together. '(Name redacted) had the capacity to consent to having sex with me and she repeatedly did so by her conduct and her verbal expressions. I never used physical violence, threats, or other coercive means towards (name redacted). 'Finally, I never endangered (name redacted) health, safety, or well-being.' In his statement read out on the last day of the hearing, Winston said he met the woman on December 6 2012 at Potbelly's, a popular bar for students near the FSU campus. He said that after dancing for about 10 minutes, he got her telephone number and then contacted her at the end of the night. He claimed she voluntarily joined him and his friends in their taxi, which was a five minute ride away. Once back at his apartment, Mr Winston said she willingly performed oral sex on him and then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse. 'Almost immediately upon our arrival, (name redacted) and I went into my bedroom. We were standing facing each other, kissing and touching each other's bodies. I eventually asked (name redacted) if she would perform oral sex on me. 'She said that she would. The lights in my bedroom were on and (name redacted) willingly performed oral sex on me. While (name redacted) was performing oral sex, I was close enough to my dresser to reach over to it, open a drawer, and retrieve a condom.' Winston added that he and the woman 'also engaged in intense foreplay and heavy petting during the same period that she was performing oral sex. I was with her on the bed during foreplay and I may have ejaculated a small amount of semen onto her clothing.' The star college quarterback claims that the two were all over each other and that when he grabbed the condom, she helped to put it on - a sure sign he says the sex was consensual. He said they also had sex a second time in his bathroom as his friends kept pushing open his bedroom door as a 'prank'. After they had sex, Mr Winston said he gave the woman a lift back to her dormitory on his scooter. Mr Winston, flanked by his lawyer David Cornwell, who said: 'We are confident that Justice Harding, when he hears her multiple lies and Jameis’ truth, will find as every other entity has to this point, that she is lying' Mr Winston told the court  that he engaged in consensual sexual intercourse with the alleged victim . He told Florida Supreme Court yesterday: 'During our consensual sexual interactions, (name redacted) engaged in sexual talk and took other actions that made it clear that the sex was consensual and that she was enjoying having sex with me. 'If (name redacted) did not want to have oral sex or intercourse with me, she was fully capable of expressing it to me, the taxicab drivers, the numerous students outside of Potbelly's, my flat mates Chris, and/or Ron. Had she done so, I would have stopped immediately.' He added: 'Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape. (Name redacted) and her lawyers have falsely accused me, threatened to sue me, demanded $7,000,000 from me, engaged in a destructive media campaign against me, and manipulated this process to the point that my rights have and will continue to be severely compromised. '(Name redacted) and her lawyers' public campaign to vilify me guarantees that her false allegations will follow me for the rest of my life. 'At some point they will be held accountable, so I have determined that it is in my best interests to exercise my right pursuant to Rule 6C2R-3.004 (6)(d)of the Florida State University Student Code of Conduct and answer questions when experienced lawyers and other experts can assist me in confronting (name redacted) false accusation and when (name redacted) is subject to the penalty of perjury and other claims for (name redacted) falsely accusing me of rape.' He said: 'Rape is a vicious crime. The only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape' Over two days and approximately 12 hours, former Florida Supreme Court justice Major Harding heard testimony from witnesses presented by the university, Mr Winston and the woman. Justice Harding must now decide if Mr Winston is responsible for any of four violations of the code of conduct, including sexual activity without consent and creating a hostile environment. FSU has up to 10 class days  to give notification of the decision. Seven class days remain until the end of the fall semester on December 12. Spring semester starts on January 7. John Clune, a Title IX attorney representing the woman, said he expects a decision from Harding within two to three weeks. 'We want (Winston) to be found responsible and we want him expelled from the school,' Mr Clune said after the hearing yesterday. 'I think knowing the facts of the case and what has been presented, I think there's a very, very good chance of that happening.' The lawyer for Mr Winston, sports attorney David Cornwell likened the proceedings to a 'honey trap'. He said: 'This process was about making a record to do as I have always said, take this matter to civil court. 'We will do our best to shut it down with our briefs and have Justice Harding conclude that Jameis didn't do anything wrong. There certainly was no evidence in two days that suggested otherwise. 'I'm not quite sure that given the objectives of (the woman) and her attorneys that there's anyway to remove the taint in this process. It was clear what this was about, absolutely clear what this is about. It is a shakedown.' FSU has up to 10 class days to give notification of the decision. Seven class days remain until the end of the fall semester on December 12. Spring semester starts on January 7 . The hearing is the latest development in a controversial case that polarised public opinion in Tallahassee and prompted claims of favouritism by police towards star athletes. Mr Winston, the Heisman Trophy winner who is currently trying to lead the unbeaten FSU Seminoles to back-to-back national titles, was interviewed but never arrested after the woman claimed he assaulted her. In announcing his decision a year ago not to charge Winston on the grounds of insufficient evidence, state attorney Willie Meggs was critical of detectives who withheld details of the case from prosecutors for 11 months. Meanwhile, the alleged victim, who has since left the university, said that during the investigation police advised her 'to think long and hard before proceeding against him' in what was 'a big football town'. She said detectives warned her lawyer to drop the case or have her life 'made miserable and raked over the coals'. The apparent inaction by the university has also prompted a separate investigation by the US Department of Education into a possible breach of Title IX obligations, which require a school to conduct a prompt hearing into a sexual assault allegation against any of its students.","Jameis Winston is accused of sexually assaulting a former FSU student .

"Alastair Cook has been banned for the fourth one-day international against Sri Lanka due to England's slow over-rate in Wednesday's five-wicket win. Eoin Morgan will take over as England captain for their next match, on Sunday in Colombo. International Cricket Council match referee David Boon decided that Cook will miss Sunday's match, because of England's poor over-rate in the Hambantota success. England captain Alastair Cook will miss the fourth ODI due to a slow over-rate in the third game . An overdue success for Cook - just England's second in nine ODIs and one which reduces their deficit in this seven-match series to 2-1 - was bitter-sweet for the skipper when it became obvious he would be suspended. Cook was also in charge in similar circumstances against India at Cardiff last summer, and two such offences in any 12-month period bring a mandatory one-match ban. The slate, however, will then be clean again for Cook - heading towards the World Cup early next year. Peter Moores confirmed Morgan will deputise for Cook at the weekend. The coach is confident too that the Irishman's poor recent form will not prove too vexing an issue in the long term. 'Eoin Morgan will captain the next game,' he said. 'He's a good player, crikey. Eoin Morgan will come in and captain the side in Cook's absence . 'He'll have been through periods when he's not quite hitting it (as he'd like). But he's the sort of player we're very excited about. 'The key is to believe in yourself, and go out and play - and Eoin will do that, I'm sure.' Cook, who figured in an opening stand of 84 with Moeen Ali as England chased a Duckworth-Lewis target of 236 at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium, will be reduced to an observer's role as his team try to level the series. 'It's a shame for Alastair,' Moores added. 'I thought he played beautifully last night... he timed the ball really well. 'But one thing is that it cleans the slate for him, before we go to a World Cup - because he had that ban hanging over him, if he had one more time slow on our over-rate.' Despite Cook's unscheduled absence, England can at last celebrate a much-needed victory. 'It's great to wake up when you've had a win,' Moores said. 'Sometimes, the morning after is the time you really feel wins and losses. So it's great to know we're back in the series, at 2-1.' VIDEO England beat Sri Lanka in Hambantota - Cook and Buttler .

"A school has banned energy drinks such as Red Bull after children as young as 11 were found to be drinking up to three cans a day. Peter Slough, headteacher at Small Heath School, Birmingham, has banned the highly caffeinated drinks after pupils were struggling to concentrate in the classroom. Mr Slough said some pupils were consuming the drinks -  which can contain more than 13 teaspoons of sugar - instead of a proper breakfast. Banned: The headteacher of Small Heath School in Birmingham (pictured) has banned energy drinks after children as young as 11 were found to be drinking 3 cans a day - sometimes instead of a good breakfast . Pupils now face detention if they are caught with an energy drink. Mr Slough’s campaign has come two months after Government adviser John Vincent called for them to be banned from schools - saying energy drinks were 'effectively another form of drugs.' Speaking today, Mr Slough said: 'These caffeine drinks, combined with a poor diet, are responsible for the children who find it difficult to sit and concentrate in class. 'We thought we would raise our battle flags. I started to research the issue, initially in the sixth form and then extended it to our Year 11 and Year 10 students. 'It became obvious that a lot of our children were drinking several cans a day - drinking them on the way to school and leaving home without breakfast. 'They were then having another at lunchtime and drinking them at home. We know that even the little ones, in Year 7, drink them.They become used to it - it becomes a habit and a worry.' The head said after consuming energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster, pictured, the pupils struggled to concentrate and were difficult to control in class . The school, which caters for 1,300 pupils aged between 11 and 18, was rated 'Outstanding' in all areas by an Ofsted inspection in May last year. Mr Slough began his campaign after noticing increasing numbers of discarded energy drink cans in and around the school. As the school is split campus, many pupils buy the drinks when moving between sites. Government adviser and restaurateur John Vincent recently called for the drinks to be banned in schools - saying the beverages were as harmful as drugs. He . said drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless - many of which . combine up to 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine  (about four . times the amount as a can of coke) - make children difficult to control. Mr . Vincent said: 'Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs. The . amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view effectively . allowing drugs into schools.‘We . don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school . life. It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, . how they feel and it is having health effects . Currently, manufacturers . and retailers have a voluntary ban on the sale of the drinks to . under-16s, but there is no law to stop children buying them. The . Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of . drinks that are high in caffeine - saying the drinks ‘could potentially . lead to short-term effects such as increased excitability, irritability, . nervousness or anxiety’. Brands including Red Bull, Monster Energy and Relentless can be bought within 300 metres of the school,, the head said. Mr . Slough added: 'They are energy drinks, they give you a boost. But if . you combine them with the sweets children eat, we have a recipe for . disaster.' The head said any . pupil seen with an energy drink will have it confiscated and children . found flouting the ban twice faced an after-school detention. Mr . Slough’s campaign echoes the views of restaurateur and government . adviser John Vincent, who has compiled a school food plan for education . secretary Michael Gove. Speaking in January, he said children could become unteachable after drinking several cans of energy drinks. He warned: ‘Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs.’ Mr Vincent, who co-founded the Leon restaurant group, added: ‘The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks is in our view effectively allowing drugs into schools. 'We don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school life. 'It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, how they feel and it is having health effects.’ The British Soft Drinks Association, which counts Red Bull and other energy drink companies as members, has spoken in favour of Mr Slough’s campaign. The BSDA’s director general Gavin Partington said: 'We are clear that energy drinks are not recommended for children and we want to get that message across to young people and their parents. 'Our code of practice says that high caffeine content soft drinks are not recommended for children and specifies that this information should be clearly stated on the label of such drinks. 'Another form of drugs': John Vincent, left, called for energy drinks to be banned from schools . 'It also states that high caffeine soft drinks should not be promoted or marketed to those under 16.' The British Soft Drinks Association code of conduct states that energy drinks should not be sold in schools. However, . a Freedom of Information request last year found some academies – which . have the right to opt out of national standards on school food and . nutrition – were selling the drinks. The Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of drinks that are high in caffeine. A spokesman added that consuming the drinks ‘could potentially lead to short-term effects such as increased excitability, irritability, nervousness or anxiety’. Red Bull has been contacted by MailOnline for comment. For comparison, a 150ml can of Coca-Cola contains 8mg caffeine and 15.0g of sugar. According to NewHealthGuide.org, a teaspoon is roughly 4 grams of white granulated sugar. RED BULL ENERGY DRINK (250ml) CAFFEINE: 80mg .

The stand-in vet, right to be careful as sharks are born with a full set of teeth, rolls the pup over before grabbing it by the tail and tossing it into the sea.

"Among a pile of everyday rocks and rubble, a gardener has uncovered an exquisitely carved Anglo-Saxon stone. John Wyatt, 32, from Chester paid just £50 for the pile of natural stones, but the carving could fetch as much as £10,000 ($15,680) at auction. The front panel of the stone is carved with the Celtic cross, while a bird is carved along the top. Among a pile of rocks and rubble, a gardener has uncovered a carved Anglo-Saxon stone (pictured). John Wyatt, 32 paid just £50 for the pile of natural stones, but the carving could fetch as much as £10,000 ($15,680) at auction. The front panel is carved with the Celtic cross, while a bird is carved along the top (inset) Mr Wyatt had the 21-inch long and 15-inch wide piece examined by an expert at Duke’s auctioneers in Dorchester. It is believed to have once formed part of a cross-slab from an early Christian monument, and it is possible it was smashed by Viking invaders as an act of defiance against the Christian population of Britain in the ninth century. Alternatively, it may have been a grave marker, or part of a decoration around an internal doorway or window. The expert also suggested the carving of the bird may be older than the carving of the cross. Mr Wyatt said: ‘I was doing a bit of work in my own garden and saw an advert for some natural stone. I phoned the people up and went to collect it. ‘The stones were covered in mud and moss, and when I got home I saw what I thought was the tail of the dragon on one of them. The stone was discovered by Mr Wyatt in a pile of natural rocks he bought in Chester (marked). It is believed to have once formed part of a cross-slab from an early Christian monument, and it is possible it was smashed by Viking invaders as an act of defiance against the Christian population of Britain in the 9th century . ‘I cleaned it off and realised it was carved so I contacted a museum and the archaeologists got very excited. ‘No one could really say exactly what it was but they knew it was important.’ Duke’s is auctioning off the find tomorrow, with a pre-sale estimate of £10,000 ($15,680) and Mr Wyatt said he hopes to pay off some of his mortgage with the money it makes. Experts claim the bird (pictured) carved onto the stone resembles an eagle - a symbol used for St John the evangelist . Discussing the symbolism of the piece Dr Rory Naismith from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic told MailOnline: ‘The cross was a completely ubiquitous religious symbol in Anglo-Saxon England: much like today, it was visual shorthand for the Christian faith. ‘It can be found in manuscripts, jewellery, on coins and also sculpture. 'People would see it every day, often in their purses or on their clothes as well as in and around their churches.’ He added there is  a famous poem in Old English, called The Dream of the Rood, in which the poet experiences a vision of the cross explaining its role in the crucifixion to him. ‘The [animal] is a little harder to place,’ continued Dr Naismith. ‘A common form of ornamentation found on lots of stone sculpture was foliage inhabited by creatures including birds, and that could be what's going on here. 'But the bird on this stone looks quite aquiline, so it may well be an eagle: a symbol used for St John the evangelist.’ This view was shared by Levi Roach, a lecturer in Medieval History at the University of Exeter. He told MailOnline: ‘Given that [the bird] is found in close proximity to the cross, it is conceivable that it is meant to be an eagle, and thesymbol of John the Evangelist. ‘This interpretation would certainly sit well with the bird’s pronounced beak.’ Guy Schwinge, valuer at Duke’s added: ‘The Anglo Saxon stone is an important find and the stylistic vocabulary on the cross is indicative of an Anglo Saxon origin. It probably dates from the 9th or 10th century.’ Also going under the hammer at the same sale is a Roman sarcophagus that for years acted as a plant pot in an Oxfordshire garden. The estimate is £25,000 ($39,200). St. John (illustrated left) was said to be one of the original twelve apostles and is traditionally taken to be the author of the fourth gospel, John. When pictured among the evangelists and other apostles, St John is often depicted as an eagle. The cover of a gospel book is pictured right . St. John was said to be one of the original twelve apostles and is traditionally taken to be the author of the fourth gospel, John. When pictured among the evangelists and other apostles, St John is often depicted as an eagle, and at times, as a human with the head of an eagle. Eagles are used as symbols throughout Christianity, because they soar upwards, making them symbolic of Christ’s resurrection or ascension. In Ezekiel 1:10, the gospels are described as each having 'the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. An eagle with a halo, specifically, is said to represent St John because of his ‘lofty and soaring’ gospel. His gospel is said to more theological than the other three, for example. This symbolism is reported to have originated in Jerome’s Commentary on Matthew, which said: ‘John the Evangelist who, having taken up eagle’s wings and hastening toward higher matters, discusses the Word of God.’ Eagles are used as symbols throughout Christianity, because they soar upwards, making them symbolic of Christ’s resurrection or ascension. In Ezekiel, the gospels are described as each having the face of a man, lion, ox and eagle. St John is depicted on the 9th century Brandon Plaque (pictured) The sarcophagus dates from the 2nd or 3rd century AD and, although damaged, remains a rare and important find. Made from white marble, it depicts two river gods holding cornucopiae while reclining on the back of dolphins while flanked by palm trees. In the centre is Cupid embracing a mourning figure, who in turn is holding a quiver of arrows. ‘We can only speculate on how this important Roman artefact ended up in an Oxfordshire garden, but in all probability it was brought back in the 18th century by a gentleman on the Grand Tour,’ continued Mr Schwinge. ‘It had been used for bedding plants to bring a bit of colour to the garden. ‘Both these lots show just what value can be found in gardens across the country.

Carlos Vela punches  the air after scoring Sociedad's opening goal in their 3-0 win against Elche . Moyes said: 'I know about the B team. I know some of the players. They have been training with me uno, dos, tres, cuatro times, but I have not seem them play.' Despite the language barrier, Moyes has made a bright start to his time in Spain with a win and a draw in his first two games. The 51-year-old didn't quite go as far as Steve McClaren's Dutch efforts in 2008 which saw the former FC Twente boss speak with a bizarre Dutch accent. QPR midfielder Joey Barton has also been guilty of falling into the foreign language trap, by feigning a French accent while on loan at Ligue 1 side Marseille.","David Moyes attempts to speak Spanish during Real Sociedad press conference .

"Sophie Tweed-Simmons is back with her second clothing collection for Sophie x The Style Club in as many months - this time with jazzy dresses and jumpsuits for New Year's Eve. The famously outspoken daughter of Kiss legend Gene Simmons, who is a passionate advocate for healthy body image, has created the line to compliment 'all women' in sizes 00 to 18; priced between $49 and $180. But be careful what you call it. 'I hate the term 'plus-size,' Sophie, 22, tells MailOnline. 'Can we all just be women please? Why label it? Why ruin a good thing?' Scroll down for video . Designer: Sophie Simmons, 22, (pictured) has launched a new collection of New Year's Eve dresses and jumpsuits in partnership with The Style Club to flatter women of every size. Pictured, the Monroe Mini ($49) The 15-piece collection features rompers, jumpsuits and dresses from mini to maxi-length, adorned with French lace, vegan leather, crushed velvet and sequin embellishments. Along with her partner, The Style Club founder Hilary Novelle, Sophie worked with a set of upcoming trends and then found a way to make them look good on her body. Her first collection with The Style Club, which launched in fall and sold out in a mere 72 hours, was built in much the same way. 'All the waistbands are elastic, which I prefer,' she told MailOnline in October. 'Essentially, the collection is based around my butt.' Sophie, whose mother Shannon Tweed is a former Playboy Bunny, stands at 5'8"" and is a U.S. size 8-10. 'I have never been a ""skinny"" girl, I've always been athletic and curvy and strong,' she remarks, adding that her weight has fluctuated over the years. Rock star bloodline: The 15-piece collection is priced between $49 and $180 and comes in sizes 00 to 18.

"Matin Kimber, former Rotherham council chief, has been handed £26,666 after agreeing to quit his job two months before his notice period ends . There was outrage tonight over the payment of £26,000 to the council chief executive at the centre of the Rotherham abuse scandal to leave his job early. Martin Kimber issue a ‘sincere apology to those who were let down’ when he resigned from Rotherham Council and promised he would not receive any ‘compensation’ for his decision to quit his £160,000 a year post. Mr Kimber was originally intending to work his three months notice until the end of the year, but left his post on 31 October instead, to allow the new chief executive to get on with the job. As a result the local authority paid him £26,666 - the salary he would have received had he worked the final two months. But the move has angered abuse victims. One 29-year-old Rotherham abuse victim said: ‘I used to think that nothing else can shock me but I’ve given up saying that because each day something comes out that shocks me even further. ‘It is disgusting that this man gets a payout of more than most people’s annual salary. It is appalling that these people are getting big lump sums when they should have been sacked on the spot. ‘It’s like rewarding good behaviour. If they were really sorry they would donate the money to charity.’ John O’Connell, Director of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will question why they are handing over hard-earned money for an official to spend two months relaxing at home. 'If the Council feels he is surplus to requirements, taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay his salary. 'This £26,000 could pay for a social worker, and it’s quite clear Rotherham needs to be doing more to look after vulnerable residents not keep former Chief Executives in the style to which they’re accustomed.’ When giving evidence to MPs in September, Mr Kimber was asked if he would be taking compensation after handing in his notice. He said: ‘There is no compensation. I have had no such discussion and neither would I, just for the record.’ Between 1997 and 2013 more than 1,400 girls were sexually abused by gangs of men, largely from the Asian and Pakistani community, while authorities refused to investigate (file image) The chief executive was one of a number of senior local authority executives to quit after a report published in August revealed 1,400 children had been abused in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. Rotherham Council insisted Mr Kimber had ‘received no pay-off’ but was paid in lieu of notice. Mr Kimber had been asked by new council leader Paul Lakin to carry out a ‘thorough internal investigation’ into the alleged theft of files from a locked council office in 2002, as well as the disappearance of four years of meeting minutes about child abuse issues. A former  Rotherham mayor has been charged with sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl in the 1980s. Councillor Barry Dodson (right) was charged with indecent assault by police today. It is alleged Dodson, 67, of Rotherham, South Yorkshire, committed the offence in 1987. He has been released on bail and will appear at Sheffield Magistrates Court on December 18. Councillor Dodson stood down as mayor in June, three weeks after taking office. He resigned from the Labour party and now stands as an independent. This work had not been completed by the time he left. A Rotherham Council spokesman said: ‘It was agreed in September between the authority and Mr Kimber that he would leave at the end of December - serving the usual three month notice period. 'However, he decided to leave his position two months early, with effect from October 31, to enable the new chief executive to start. 'The authority continues to look into the matters raised in the Jay Report.’ Even the UKIP opposition leader councillor Cavan Vines backed the decision. He said: ‘For the council to move on we felt it appropriate for him to leave early so there would be a clean road ahead. It is a way of moving the council forward.’ The report by Professor Alexis Jay revealed how hundreds of vulnerable girls had been sexually exploited by gangs of predominantly Asian men in the town and that police and council officials had betrayed the victims by not tackling the problem. Senior council officials feared being labelled ‘racist’ for speaking about the pattern of offenders being of Pakistani origin. Mr Kimber, who had been chief executive since 2009, initially stayed in his job when the scandal broke. When he quit in September he said the report did ‘not make comfortable reading in its account of the horrific experiences of some young people in the past.’ He said it was ‘right to leave’ his job and hoped new leadership would ‘enable the town to recover more quickly.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Martin Kimber quit job at council and was expected to leave at end of year .

"Arrested: Andrew Kurt Summers, pictured in his mug shot, allegedly made the death threats online . A man has been charged after threatening to shoot Mama June and her daughter Lauryn 'Pumpkin'. Andrew Kurt Summers made the threats on June's Facebook page and has now been charged with making terroristic threats, police in McIntyre, Georgia told TMZ. Summer turned himself in on Monday and has been released on a $15,000 bail. Honey Boo Boo and her family this week appeared to be putting their recent struggles behind them as they reunited to decorate the family home for the upcoming holiday. With Sugar Bear newly returned to the family home, he and Mama June organized the over-the-top preparations for what will surely be an awkward Christmas. Despite the seasonal display, it's hardly been a year to celebrate for Honey Boo Boo and her family. First the child star saw her parents split up, then her mother reportedly reunited with a sex offender former lover - leading to the cancellation of the family's main bread winner - their reality show. As they decorated their home, June appeared to be putting on a brave face as she faces the risk of losing custody of her children pending an investigation by child protective services. Victim: Mama June, pictured, and one of her daughters were targeted by the death threats on Facebook . In October it emerged that she was dating convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. Her ex-boyfriend served 10 years in prison for molesting an eight-year-old girl. June's oldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, now aged 20, has said she was the victim. Anna was nowhere to be seen during the Christmas event. Instead she is reportedly busy seeking solicitations for herself - selling a potion that she claims can prevent Ebola. Chickadee is shilling Ebola-blocking potions in her new role with the company Young Living Essential Oils. Target: Lauryn 'Pumpkin', pictured at the family home in Georgia, was also allegedly threatened by Summers . In custody: Andrew Kurt Summers, pictured in an older mug shot, turned himself into cops this week . The company's website described the curious claim of the tonic: 'The Ebola virus cannot survive in the presence of a therapeutic grade Cinnamon Bark and Oregano essential oil.' Over the weekend the mother of two-year-old daughter Kaitlyn created a storm of comment on Facebook from fans of the series after she set up a GoFundMe page asking for $20,000. Left red-faced, she responded to the backlash [SIC]: 'I'm deleting my fund me cause everyone thinks I'm money hungry.' Adding: 'And I have been think about everyone's opinions and I got alot of chooses and I have done there idea and I get the s*** end of the stick.' She recently admitted that after her run on TLC's show, which began in 2012 and ended this year, she was left with only $17.90 in her trust fund account. Mama June found herself in hot water and her reality TV show canceled earlier this year when photos emerged showing her daughter, Honey Boo Boo, with a convicted child molester, Mark McDaniel, pictured . In November, the 20-year-old told E! News that she believed her 'selfish' mother squandered her earnings from show and accused the matriarch of purchasing a car for McDaniel, the man she accused of molesting her as a child. 'I have a feeling Mama used that money to buy a car or buy him what he wanted,' she told E! News. June responded to the claims, saying, 'Not true. I have never brought a car for him and all her money is there, beside the money I have given her to live on—$400 every month and pay her $475 each month for cell phone bills for the last two years. 'That's the only money I have taken out of there.'","Andrew Kurt Summers allegedly threatened to shoot Mama June .

"An Esa experiment carried out by astronauts on the ISS has found the cosmos is less hostile to space travellers than expected. It had been thought that cosmic radiation may severely limit the time an astronaut can spend in space without seriously risking their life. Using a 'phantom' human covered in thousands of detectors, the research showed that levels of radiation had been significantly overestimated - and deep space travel could be fairly safe. An experiment run by Esa on the ISS using a 'dummy' human (shown) has found radiation levels for astronauts in space are less than thought. The findings suggest deep space travel for humans could be safe. Here the dummy is shown being put in a casing to simulate the spacesuit of an astronaut . The experiment involved placing a mannequin in direct exposure to cosmic radiation, twice inside the ISS and once outside in space. Known as Matroshka, the legless torso consists of 33  slices of 'human matter' each one inch (2.5cm) in thickness. This includes real human bones to simulated the shape and density of soft tissues and lungs in the human body. Inside the slices was measuring equipment to measure the amount of incoming radiation. The overall conclusion was that dosimeters worn by crew on the ISS, which measure radiation exposure, had overestimated that actual radiation does they received by 15 per cent. Back in October a study claimed sending people to Mars may be impossible due to an increased radiation risk from cosmic rays when the sun is less active during the solar minimum. It's thought that a predicted decrease in solar activity, which occurs every 11 years, will raise the levels of radiation astronauts are subjected to from cosmic rays on a deep space mission. This will increase the risk of suffering sickness, cancer and more on lengthy trips to the red planet lasting about a year to levels beyond what is considered safe. The research, published in the journal Space Weather and led by Dr Nathan Schwadron of the University of New Hampshire, found that a 30-year-old astronaut can spend about one year in space before cosmic rays raises the radiation-risk beyond safe exposure limits. However, this new research by Esa could suggest the levels are safer than expected. Amazingly, outside the ISS in open space this overestimation exceeded 200 per cent. From the results of the Matroshka experiment the scientists concluded that travel of astronauts to the Moon or to Mars may be somewhat safer in terms of their radiation hazard than expected. Nevertheless, the doses the space travellers are likely to receive, even though being lower than thought earlier, would still remain dangerously high. But while Mars might previously have been limited to a year or so, now the time taken to explore Mars could potentially be extended. 'One may say that we found open space to be a bit less hostile to humans than expected,' said Dr Paweł Bilski, an Associate Professor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) in Kraków, Poland. 'The effective doses, related to the health risk of the astronauts and calculated from measurements with our detectors, were lower than those indicated by dosimeters worn by the astronauts.' However, he added further information from beyond low Earth orbit would be needed to verify the findings. 'We must remember that measurements within the Matroshka experiment were performed at low Earth orbit where the Earth's magnetosphere significantly reduces the number of charged particles from cosmic radiation,' he said. 'In interplanetary space there is no such shielding.' This is the interior structure of the phantom used in the experiment Matroshka, which contains slices of human bones. The white tubes contain sets of thermoluminescent detectors. Half of these detectors was manufactured by the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Kraków, Poland . The Matroshka phantom is seen here with astronauts Siergiej Krikaliew and John Philips on board of the International Space Station. Radiation levels were measured both inside the station and outside in open space using the human-like dummy . A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth. Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider. They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area. Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovas, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. The main hazard to the astronaut's health due to exposure to cosmic radiation is the increased probability of developing cancer in his or her body. This probability however is quite dependent on the type of radiation the astronaut is exposed to. Most of the natural sources of ionising radiation on Earth produce electromagnetic radiation of high energy - gamma rays. On the other hand, in cosmic rays, energetic protons or heavier ions dominate, which are much more effective in creating cancer cells. The mannequin on board of the International Space Station (ISS), with thermoluminescent and plastic detectors inside its 'body', was also dressed in a 'poncho' with additional detectors, simulating the personal dosimeters worn by astronauts. Thus, doses recorded by individual dosimeters of the ISS crew could be compared with those actually absorbed inside their bodies. Over the years 2004 to 2009 the Matroshka mannequin underwent three exposures to cosmic radiation, each lasting a year of more. Two of these exposures occurred inside the Russian modules of the space station and for one exposure the phantom, in a container imitating the shielding properties of a spacesuit, was placed in open space outside the ISS. Such measurements have never been done before. The detectors were then returned to Earth to be analysed to make the findings, which could make the possibility of a manned mission to Mars more likely.","Experiment run by Esa on the ISS has found radiation levels for humans in space are less than thought .

Vivica, here with Donald Trump, joins Ian Ziering, Brandi Glanville, Geraldo Rivera, Kate Gosselin and Kenya Moore on the new season of Celebrity Apprentice . 'Oddly enough, despite the fact that she was playing his mother they had this magnetic chemistry,' a production insider tells MailOnline 'It was something about the way he looked at her that started people on the set chatting about something going on.' When Ri'chard, who previously starred in TV series like One On One and Tyler Perry's Meet The Browns, was not shooting movie scenes or doing push-ups to keep his abs tight, he was sneaking off to Fox's trailer. 'He always wanted to be around her. He kept finding ways to creep off to her trailer and they were always having to send a production assistant to go get him to come back and shoot scenes,' the insider added. Ri'chard wasn't shy around his co-stars when talking about Fox. When fellow actors like Tyson Beckford and Darrin Henson asked about their age difference, Ri'chard was clear: 'Age is nothing but a number,' he told them. Since the film has wrapped production, the couple has continued to date. The pair regularly have dinner together in Los Angeles and have quiet nights watching movies. In early 2003, Fox, then 37, started dating 24-year-old Washington Redskins player Darnerien McCants but the romance fizzled out after six months . Later in 2003, she dated rapper 50 Cent. She was 38 at the time and he was 27 . 'Vivica originally resisted dating someone as young as him. But he was so persistent that she gave in. She figured, if men his age are still interested in her, why shouldn't she date them,' said the insider. Fox, who ended her four-year marriage to aspiring musician Christopher 'Sixx-Nine' Harvest in 2002, has previously dated younger men.

"Paul Walker's longtime friend and manager was robbed of priceless memories of the 'Fast and Furious' star when thieves burgled his office on the one-year anniversary of the actor's death. CCTV captures the moment when brazen robbers broke into Matt Luber's Hollywood management offices and stole years of cherished videos, voice mails and photographs of the late actor along with $300,000 worth of items. Security footage shows two females thieves breaking into his offices on Sunday at 6am, shortly after the security guards left after working their overnight shift. The office doors were apparently left unlocked when the employees left for the Thanksgiving holiday, so the robbers did not have to worry about struggling to force their way into the building. Scroll down for video... Thief: Paul Walker's manager has been robbed on the anniversary of his death. Two women broke into Matt Luber's office on November 30, 2014, and stole every computer, hard drive and printer in the building. Matt Luber (left) said he lost years of cherished videos, voice mails and photographs of Paul Walker after his office was targeted by thieves . Calm: The second of the thieves calmly walked to the elevator. The devices they stole held videos, voice mails, and photographs of Paul. Footage from security cameras caught the women going to and from the building . The thieves stole 12 Apple Mac computers as well as a hard drive that contained photos and voicemails of Luber's children and friends, including Walker. Mr Luber, who had known the actor for 20 years, said CCTV footage shows one of the women waiting at the elevator before going up the stairs. 'She comes back down with one computer and then they disappear for about an hour, possibly waiting to see if an alarm goes off,' he said. They then returned with a huge suitcase, changed their outfits upstairs, and then come back down with more devices. Quite the haul:  Once they were inside, they proceeded to steal 18 Mac computers and multiple printers – adding up to an estimated value of more than $20,000 . Easy find: The office doors were actually left unlocked when the employees left for the Thanksgiving holiday, so the robbers did not have to worry about struggling to force their way into the building . Caught on camera: The thieves actions were recorded by security cameras located in the stairwell and the elevator . Who knew? Some have suggested the robbery may have been an inside job . The actor's daughter Meadow Instagramed a flashback picture with her father, writing simply 'I love you' The talent manager believes the suspects cased his office, because they knew the entrance code, and knew exactly what to look for. He is now pleading with the thieves to return the stolen mementos which were found to be missing at 9.30am on Monday. 'Give me back my hard drive. Give me back my pictures. Put it in the mail anonymously. Drop if off with the security guards,' he said. The Fast and Furious star lost his life on November 30 last year when the Porsche Carrera GT his business partner  Roger Rodas was driving crashed into a tree in Santa Clarita, California. Investigators determined the car was traveling between 80 and 93 miles an hour when it crashed, killing both men. Luber described Walker's death as the worst thing that has ever happened to him. Fans, friends, family and co-stars mourned the 40-year-old actor's death on the anniversary of the collision. His 16-year-old daughter Meadow posted a previously unseen picture of the actor cradling her as a toddler, writing simply 'I love you'. Fast and Furious co-star Michelle Rodriguez joined Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris, who were among the first of the late actor's former co-stars to reflect on their memories of the star. 'I love you Paul. Your living in the hearts of all who love you for sure. Sending mad love out to Heaven @SupportROWW' she wrote on Twitter. Devastating: Luber 'was Paul's manager and close friend for decades. Not only did the computers have Paul Walker's his entire life on there but, more importantly, all of the files on Walker's life and death,' said a friend . The 'Fast and Furious' star died on November 30 last year while riding as a passenger in a friend's car . Friends and fans left flowers and candles at the scene on the one-year anniversary of his death . Tyrese Gibson, one of Paul's co-stars who was also a good friend off-screen, shared a touching tribute to his 'brother' on his Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The 35-year-old, who made his first appearance in 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious, said: 'In this life one would hope to be this 'effective' 1 year ago today. God called an angel home early.... I miss my brother I miss my friend and I miss OUR STAR!!!!!' He added: 'Physically gone but forever alive in our minds, hearts and spirit.... What was once tears of pain and shock are now tears of JOY celebrating all that you stood for... 'Everyone worldwide please take 5 mins out of your day to send live, prayers and energy to Paul's family his daughter Meadow and immediate circle today will be a tough day for us....

"Annie star Quvenzhané Wallis yawned her way through an interview with the New York Times Style magazine, telling the publication's writer that she found the process 'a little boring'. According to journalist Nicholas Haramis the 11-year-old, who features on the front cover of this weekend's edition of the magazine, the youngster struggled to feign interest in the interview, and perhaps unsurprisingly given her age, couldn't wait to put an end to his questions so she could return to her video games. 'I try to get a few more details about what it’s like to balance homework and Hollywood fame' he writes. '“How about three more questions?” she says. “Make them big so I can answer them big.” 'Sometimes it gets a little boring': The 11-year-old Oscar nominee was more than happy to admit she doesn't find interviews all that entertaining . 'I rack my brain for another, but I’m too slow. “We’re done now,” she says.' Even discussions about her Annie co-stars Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz - both of whom have waxed lyrical about her abilities as an actress - failed to raise much interest from the precocious youngster. 'Inquiries into inspiration and motivation elicit eye rolls,' Haramis says. 'At one point, while discussing the director and co-stars of her new film, Annie — Will Gluck is a “really nice man,” Jamie Foxx is “a really nice guy” and Cameron Diaz is “really nice” — she lets out an exasperated yawn.' The Oscar-nominated star, who is the youngest person to receive a nod for Best Actress, having been nominated for her role in Beasts of the Southern Wild when she was only six, makes no attempt to hide her boredom throughout the interview, even explaining to Haramis that she finds the process 'a little boring'. 'I'm not gonna name names,' she says. 'But sometimes when reporters are talking it gets a little boring because I don't have any jokes to tell because the questions are so serious.' Clearly intent on making the New York Times interview a little bit more entertaining, Quvenzhané then proceeds challenge Haramis to try his hand at her favorite basketball-focused arcade game Hoop Fever, demanding that he pay up $1 when he loses. A friend - and a movie star: Quvenzhané Wallis reveals to the New York Times Style that her schoolfriends at home don't view her any differently, despite her successful movie career . 'Wallis’s precocious, at times petulant charm — littered with as much toilet humor as schoolyard sagacity — is her secret weapon,' Haramis later says of the young star. 'And it’s what makes her stand out from all the pretween beauty queens who’ve been trained to follow a script.' But while her interview manner might not be up to scratch, her career has continued to go from strength to strength. In addition to her role in big-screen blockbuster Annie, which is due out on December 19, Quvenzhané is also set to star in two more feature films next year - and earlier this year was revealed as the first ever celebrity face of Armani Junior. She insists, however, that life at home has not changed all that much since Hollywood first came knocking five years ago. Now and then: The youngster will soon be seen starring in a remake of hit musical Annie (L), having made her big screen debut in Beasts of the Southern Wild, which earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (R) 'Of course, when strangers see me they're star-struck because of who I am, but my friends take me as a friend because I'm their friend — not because I'm a movie star,' the precocious young star explains. But for those who don't know the youngster on a personal level, her life appears to be very different from that of a normal 11-year-old. Quvenzhané has spent the last few weeks on a whirlwind promotional tour for the upcoming remake of hit musical Annie, in which she stars in the title role, alongside Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz - both of whom admit to being bowled over by her talent. 'I was so impressed with her,' 46-year-old Jamie said, while Cameron said of the pressure Quvenzhané faced taking on such an iconic role: 'I'm not certain that a girl that age has that kind of awareness. I don't think Q did, anyhow.'","The Annie actress challenged the publication's Nicholas Haramis to a game of Hoop Fever, before yawning at his questions about her co-stars .

"Police officers in West Virginia brutally arrested a 39-year-old father of two who they say appeared intoxicated and was handling his kids roughly while walking them to the park. But his outraged family denies that 39-year-old Jeffrey Bane was under the influence on Sept. 6, when he was left choking in his own blood and pleading for help while he was pinned to the ground by four Granville PD cops during the Sept. 6 arrest in Morgantown. The whole arrest takes some 10 minutes and was recorded in a shocking video uploaded to YouTube.

Josh Bane says his cousins were left 'unattended' during the 10-minute arrest while his uncle 'pleads and cries out in pain for the lack of breath and agony being applied to him.'

"As the king who thought nothing of killing off an inconvenient wife or rival, his place on the history curriculum is assured. But few would single out Henry VIII as a role model. Which is why Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was facing ridicule last night after a bizarre interview in which she singled him out when asked to name her favourite monarch. Nicky Morgan said the controversial king was her favourite monarch in the interview with politics website ConservativeHome, but opted for Elisabeth I on advice from aides after her first choice prompted surprise . The reign of Henry VIII, pictured,  was dominated by his break from the papacy, and he is said to have carried out large numbers of political executions – 330 in the years 1532-40 alone, with some estimates up to 72,000 . ‘Well I love the Tudor period. I think Henry VIII,’ she said. The minister quickly withdrew her choice when aides and her interviewer on the politics website, ConservativeHome, expressed their surprise. She said: ‘Shall I change that to Elizabeth I? A strong female monarch at a time when there weren’t many examples.’ Henry’s reign was dominated by his break from the papacy and the establishment of a reformed, national church. But he carried out large numbers of political executions – 330 in the years 1532-40 alone. A contemporary chronicle says he had 72,000 people killed, although the true figure is likely to be much lower and in line with other monarchs in troubled political and religious times. Henry’s most famous victim was the second of his six wives, Anne Boleyn, who he had accused of adultery. He also had his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, beheaded for being ‘unchaste’. A Conservative campaign for new grammar schools came under fire yesterday – from the Tory Education Secretary. Nicky Morgan said she ‘was not sure that separating people at the age of 11’ would improve social mobility or transform education. She insisted instead that she wanted all the country’s state schools to do well. Her comments come after senior party figures called for an expansion of grammar schools to be included in next year’s general election manifesto. Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon have backed plans for new ‘satellite’ grammar school campuses in their constituencies. Kent county council has asked Miss Morgan to approve its plans for an extra grammar school to meet demand in Sevenoaks, Mr Fallon’s constituency. Earlier proposals were rejected by Mrs Morgan’s predecessor Michael Gove. Mrs Morgan told the ConservativeHome website it was wrong to think that the only way to get access to good state education was to reintroduce grammar schools: ‘I would push back on that and just say actually we want all of our state schools to be good and outstanding.’ His inner circle were never safe and Thomas More and Thomas Cromwell were among many courtiers and nobles put to death in a reign that ran from 1509 to 1547. Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said Mrs Morgan’s choice showed appalling ignorance of British history. ‘Henry VIII is a figure more akin to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader,’ he said. ‘He was a tyrant. He was responsible for the executions of thousands of people. ‘He used to burn Protestants and Catholics in the same place, on the same day, alongside each other. ‘What a fool Mrs Morgan is. It’s laughable. She has to be kidding. It’s someone who doesn’t know her history.’ Asked in the interview to name her political heroes, Mrs Morgan chose Margaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev and FW de Klerk, the last apartheid ruler of South Africa. The two men were ‘prepared to take on the system, having been elected or appointed in that system’, she said. Mrs Morgan was also asked if this country was in need of glasnost – the policy for openness in government institutions in the Soviet Union. She replied: ‘The Westminster system, there’s no doubt about it, people want to know honestly from their politicians about what can change and what can’t change and why we’re doing things. They want to know what motivates us to be making change.’","Nicky Morgan singled him out when asked to name her favourite monarch .

"Under fire: King Abdullah has been widely criticised for his country's intollerance of religious minorities . Islamist police in Saudi Arabia have stormed a Christian prayer meeting and arrested its entire congregation, including women and children, and confiscated their bibles, it has been reported. The raid was the latest incident of a swingeing crackdown on religious minorities in Saudi Arabia by the country's hard-line Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. The 28 Christians were said to be worshipping at the home of an Indian national in the eastern city of Khafji, when the police entered the building and took them into custody. They have not been seen or heard from since, raising concerns among human rights groups as to their whereabouts. Nina Shea, director of the Washington-based Hudson Institute's Center for Religious Freedom, told FoxNews.com: 'Saudi Arabia is continuing the religious cleansing that has always been its official policy. 'It is the only nation state in the world with the official policy of banning all churches. 'This is enforced even though there are over two million Christian foreign workers in that country. Those victimized are typically poor, from Asian and African countries with weak governments.' Activists are now calling on the U.S. to use its considerable influence in the region to help secure the release of the incarcerated Christians. A spokesperson for the Saudi government claimed to have no knowledge of the arrests, according to Fox News. But the English-language newspaper, The Saudi Gazette, as well as several Saudi Arabic-language news outlets, have reported on the arrests. Arabic-language news channel, Akhbar 24, said the arrests came after the Kingdom's religious police got a tip about a home-based church. The report also reported that 'distorted writings of the Bible were found and musical instruments, noting their referral to the jurisdictional institutions.' At least 3.5 million Christians live in the Gulf Arab region, mostly Catholic workers from India and the Philippines. In Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, it is against the law for Muslims to abandon their faith, a practice known as apostasy. Proselytising for other religions or practising them openly is also illegal. Judges have considerable leeway in how to interpret the kingdom's Sharia code of Islamic law and are not bound by sentencing guidelines or a system of precedent. Both capital and corporal punishment are legal. Last year King Abdullah, who has promoted limited reforms since coming to the throne in 2005, opened a centre for religious dialogue in Vienna that drew criticism because of Saudi Arabia's own lack of religious freedom. In 2008 he sponsored an inter-faith conference in Spain.","28 people were arrested at home of Indian man in the eastern city of Khafji .

"Michelle Knight, one of three women held captive by Ariel Castro for a decade, made an appearance Wednesday at a rally for a missing Ohio man urging his parents not to lose hope. Aaron Zimmerman, a mentally handicapped man from Lorain, vanished without a trace on the morning of November 14, a day before his 26th birthday. His parents, friends and volunteers have spent the past three weeks scouring the streets of Lorain and the nearby woods in search of Aaron, who is said to suffer from schizophrenia and Asperger’s syndrome. Scroll down for video . Inspiring figure: Kidnapping victim Michelle Knight attended a rally at the Church on the North Coast on Leavitt Road in Lorain, Ohio, for missing man Aaron Zimmerman . Gone: Zimmerman, 26, went missing from his home on Camden Avenue November 14 . Zimmerman was last seen walking down Tacoma Avenue at around 8am November 14 after leaving his parents’ home on Camden Avenue without telling anyone, reported 19 Action News. With snowy conditions and temperatures in the single digits, his parents, Rhonda and Dale Zimmerman, are concerned that he may have frozen to death. They are also worried that Aaron does not have his medications with him. The Zimmermans say it is not like their son to take off without warning or stay out at night. He did disappear once before, but he was only 16 years old at the time. On Wednesday evening, Michelle Knight appeared before a crowd of supporters at the Church on the North Coast on Leavitt Road in Lorain, encouraging them to continue searching for Aaron and pray for his return. 'My plan to come here was just to give them a glimmer of hope and just see them smile... [it] means the world to me,' an emotional Miss Knight said. Knight handed Aaron's mother a blue 'energy' ring telling her that she needs it during this difficult time. Addressing Michelle Knight, Dale Zimmerman called the brave kidnapping survivor his 'blessing.' 'I asked for angels to come and here you are,' he said. Knight was kidnapped in August 2002 when she was 21 and spent the next 10 years in captivity inside Ariel Castro's Cleveland home.

"From American Eagle to Apple Stores, beacons are popping up everywhere. Are they a shopper's best friend or another pesky Big Brother monitoring our every move? The square or rectangular devices, smaller than a smartphone, can hang on a wall or be placed on a machine and communicate with your phone via Bluetooth signals. Accessed through apps you download to your smartphone, beacon technology can do everything from guide you to the correct airport terminal to turn on your coffee maker as you sleepily enter the kitchen. In retail, beacons aim to entice you to spend money. As you enter a store, your smartphone might light up with a sale alert. Stand in the dress section for a while and a coupon may pop up for something on a nearby hanger. We're watching you:  Accessed through apps you download to your smartphone, beacon technology can do everything from guide you to the correct airport terminal to turn on your coffee maker . 'The most important thing a shopper might need to get access to when they go into a store are ratings and reviews, coupons and promotions,' said Erik McMillan, CEO of Shelfbucks, which is working with video game retailer GameStop and others on its beacon marketing. Beacons give customers that research right there in the store — when they have their wallets and are looking to buy. Macy's Inc. has installed beacons in all of its 840 department stores; other chains such as Kohl's are testing them in some locations. McMillan likens beacons to the early days of retail websites in the 1990s when 'all of a sudden it got to the point that 'you can't not have a website'.' He predicts the technology will skyrocket from the 50,000 beacons in use now to between 5 million and 10 million next year. The vast majority of shopping is still done in stores. E-commerce is fast-growing but accounts for only about 9 percent of total retail sales, according to Forrester Research. Beacons merge in-store shopping with mobile access to information — and data shows they work. Broadcasting: Beacons are relatively low tech devices installed in retail locations. They emit low-energy Bluetooth signals to detect an app user’s location and proximity in real time. The simplicity and functionality of beacons have the potential to be the most effective location-aware technology for in-store marketing . Between July and September, 30 percent of shoppers who received a 'push-ad' from an in-store beacon used that offer to buy something, according to a survey by Swirl, a marketing technology company that has worked with retailers such as Lord & Taylor, Hudson's Bay, Alex and Ani, Kenneth Cole and Timberland to deploy beacons. Sixty percent of shoppers opened beacon-sent messages, and over half of those surveyed said they would do more holiday shopping at the stores as a result of their beacon experience. Graham Uffelman, a 45-year-old New Yorker, said he bought Bluetooth headphones at Best Buy because of a deal he got via the Shopkick beacon marketing app. 'The app knew I was in the store and actually suggested a product I wanted,' he said. 'The experience was great but also a little unnerving in the sense that the store knew who I was and that I was present in their location. It felt a little Big Brother-like.' And that's the challenge. Not everyone is thrilled that a beacon app is monitoring them when they walk around with their cellphone. Outdoor advertising firm Titan drew such outcry last month when it installed beacons in phone booths in New York the city had to take them out. Mine of information: Using beacons can provide value to your shoppers (special offers, product information, ratings and reviews, etc.), but the most valuable information is the data the app collects as users engage with it . Eamon Bauman, 24, an IT systems administrator in Wisconsin, said he wouldn't let a store's app have access to his location even if it meant coupons or deals. 'It's providing retailers too much information about ourselves,' he said. 'If a retailer really wants to draw me into their store, showing me deals before I get to the mall is a better way.' Chloe Joslin, 22, a student in Jonesboro, Arkansas, was taken aback when she drove by a Walgreens and a notification on her phone from the Walgreens app popped up. 'The app never asked for permission to use location services and to my knowledge I had disabled them from almost every app to avoid such a situation,' she said. Because location settings can be different for individual apps, though, it can sometimes be difficult to disable all services. The pop-up likely resulted from the phone's location setting for nearby store notifications, said Walgreen Co. spokesman Phil Caruso in an email. He said customers can turn off notifications if they prefer not to receive them. Currently, the drugstore retailer is using beacon technology on a pilot basis in only a very small number of its Duane Reade stores. Transparency is key, says Rob Murphy, Swirl's vice president of marketing. 'Now it's pretty standard if anybody is doing this type of marketing to specifically ask for permission,' he said. 'You have to request an opt-in for location services and in-store push notifications.' 'You can't be interruptive or intrusive, you have to be positive and helpful,' said Alexis Rask, chief revenue officer of Shopkick, whose app is also used by teen retailer American Eagle to provide welcome messages, merchandise tips and styling guidance throughout its nearly 1,000 U.S. stores. That appeals to Dan Reich, 26, who works in health care in Washington, D.C. 'I wouldn't mind letting a retailer know my location if it meant I'd receive coupons or benefits when I'm in the store,' he said. 'This type of data is collected when we sign into Facebook or Twitter or any other social media application. I'm essentially already providing that information, so I might as well get something out of it in the process.'","Stores are using beacons to appeal to customers with relevant and customized deals and experiences .

"A grandmother, who has been left devastated by the discovery of two abandoned babies in one week, has set up a 'safe haven' on her own doorstep. Catherine Lucre from Camden, south west of Sydney, has also set up a Facebook page in which she offers to pick up any unwanted children from mothers who prefer to remain anonymous. 'I just want to offer another alternative to mothers than leaving their babies in a drain or burying it at the beach,' Mrs Lucre told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Pictured with her granddaughter, Catherine Lucre is offering to do anything it takes to prevent another child being abandoned in unsafe circumstances . The mother-of-four started the Facebook page, Operation Safe Haven, following the discovery of a baby's body at Maroubra Beach . The 54-year-old mother-of-four, who works as a midwife, has shared her mobile phone number on the Facebook group, titled Operation Safe Haven, and encourages anyone in need to contact her. 'If you're in distress or don't know what to do or you're scared or alone or worried for whatever reason – if you just have no other means of caring for your infant - contact me,' she said. 'That's just one way that I'm prepared to help people in this situation. If someone said that they lived in Wollongong, I'd be prepared to go down there and meet them somewhere or they can leave the baby somewhere and I'll get it if they want to remain anonymous. 'They can also leave their baby out the front and ring the doorbell and I'll leave it for ten seconds before I answer if they don't want to have a face to face meeting.' The 54-year-old mother-of-four, who works as a midwife, has also set up a bassinet at her front door . 'I'll leave it for ten seconds before I answer [the door] if they don't want to have a face to face meeting,' she told Daily Mail Australia . Her offer comes following the discovery of a baby's body buried in the sand at Maroubra Beach and a newborn boy who was, only a week earlier, found abandoned in drain at Quakers Hill. Mrs Lucre, who called police in 2009 to offer to pay for the funeral of a baby whose body had been found at a rubbish tip, said she has received an enormous amount of positive support for her offer, but is yet to be contacted by any mothers. When that day comes, she said she would immediately take the infant to a hospital and contact the Department of Community Services and police, but promised to maintain the mother's privacy. The registered nurse said that she would like to see the introduction of baby hatches, adding that she had met many mothers during her career as a midwife who were not aware of the services available to them. 'If you're in distress or don't know what to do or you're scared or alone or worried for whatever reason – if you just have no other means of caring for your infant - contact me,' Mrs Lucre said after sharing her mobile phone number on her Facebook page . She has received an enormous amount of positive support for her offer, but is yet to be contacted by any mothers. When that day comes, she said she would immediately take the infant to a hospital and contact the Department of Community Services and police, but promised to maintain the mother's privacy . 'I understand there are reasons women are pushed to conceal their pregnancies, and there are a lot of women who suffer from depression,' Mrs Lucre said. 'They fear what you are going to do about it.

"A stunning racehorse has become the most expensive filly in British auction history after being sold for a staggering £4.7million. Just The Judge won the Irish 1,000 Guineas in 2013 and the Grade 1 EP Taylor Stakes in October. She was the first Classic-winning filly to be offered at a Tattersalls bloodstock auction in 20 years and bidding started at 500,000 guineas (£525,000). There was a fierce bidding war for the four-year-old, with Sheikh Fahad al-Thani eventually paying 4.5m guineas (£4.72m) for the filly which he will own in partnership with The China Horse Club. Sheikh Fahad al-Thani (pictured) eventually payed 4.5m guineas (£4.72m) for the horse which he he will own in partnership with The China Horse Club . Just The Judge is now the most expensive filly in British auction history after it was sold for the staggering sum . Just The Judge, who has won five of her 14 races, is pictured being ridden by Jamie Spencer during the 'Breakfast with the Stars' morning at Epsom racecourse on May 29, 2014 in Epsom . The £4.72 million smashes the previous record of £3.57 million paid for a horse in training in 2007. Sheikh Fahad had joined the Sangster Family as a part-owner of Just The Judge towards the end of her juvenile season. She went onto prove a clever purchase, winning the Rockfel Stakes at the end of her two-year-old campaign and clinching Classic glory as a three-year-old with a her victory in the Irish 1,000 Guineas. Fahad has now bought out the Sangster Family, but has gained a new partner in The China Horse Club. Just The Judge is the first Classic-winning filly to be offered at a Tattersalls bloodstock auction (pictured) in 20 years and bidding started at 500,000 guineas (£525,000) There was a fierce bidding war for the four-year-old filly which resulted in £4.72 million final bid, smashing the previous record of £3.57 million paid for a horse in training in 2007 . Born in 2010, Just The Judge was bought as a yearling in Ireland for 50,000 euros. In her 14 races, she has picked up 5 wins and a further six places. The Charlie Hills-trained filly's finest moment came at the Curragh last year where she produced a devastating turn of foot to win last year's Irish 1,000 Guineas. Sheikh Fahad owns the most expensive filly in Britihs auction history . Sheikh Fahad bin Abdullah Al Thani is first cousin to the Emir of the state of Qatar, while his father Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani was prime minister  between 1996 and 2007. He is a director of Qatar Investments & Projects Development Holding ( QIPCO), one of the world’s leading private investment companies. Sheikh Fahad is also a major player in Qatar horse racing. Having only watched his first horse race on TV in 2008, and  first live race in the beginning of 2010, he had started buying horses in April of that year. In his first year of racing, his horses won an impressive 26 per cent of the races he entered. Sheikh Fahad now oversees the running of Qatar Racing and Qatar Bloodstock, both subsidiaries of QIPCO Holding, along with Pearl Bloodstock, which is solely his. Combined, they have over 200 horses in training in seven different countries. Sheikh Fahad's brothers also share his passion for racing. His brother Joann has  enjoyed widespread success as an owner over the past 18 months with victories  including Olympic Glory in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot as well as Toronado in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. David Redvers, from Tweenhill Farm and Studs, in Gloucestershire, entered Just The Judge on behalf of its owners. He said: 'If anyone wanted a template for a racehorse, they just need to look at her - she is athletic and beautiful and has a fantastic temperament. 'This is a new, one-off tie-up with The China Horse Club. This has allowed us to race another year with her and keep her - as she was our first Classic winner, we were not going to give her up easily. This fits the Club's aims too. 'She will come back to Tweenhills for holiday and then go back to trainer Charlie Hills. She is healthy and well and running as well as ever - she won the EP Taylor only a month ago. 'We will campaign in the best races, get the best possible opportunities, and then she will retire to Tweenhills and visit the best stallions in the world.' Born in 2010, Just The Judge was bought as a yearling in Ireland for around £40,000 .

"With his regiment weak with hunger and short of ammunition, William Davies knew there was only one way to save himself and his fellow soldiers. In an extraordinary act of bravery, the bombardier crawled across No Man’s Land and into the German trenches in the dead of night to steal rations for his World War I comrades. A few weeks later, he lost an arm and a leg in a German attack, but despite his injuries, miraculously survived for four days in the freezing mud, before being rescued by American medics from the Allied Army. Hero: William Davies who crawled into a German trench to steal food for his friends in World War One. A few weeks later, he lost an arm and a leg in a German attack. He is pictured with his wife Mary . The act epitomised the courage of Mr Davies, his granddaughter Cathy Alderson said, who never once complained about his war time experience or injuries. Although he received three war medals, Mr Davies’ bravery was never formally recognised and she has decided to tell his story for the first time ahead of the 65th anniversary of his death next week. ‘He was an extraordinary man,’ Mrs Alderson said. ‘A real character, but very self-effacing. ‘His comrades used to come to see him after the war and talk about what he did, but he was always of the attitude that he had been left with no choice, someone had to get a grip of the situation. ‘There’s been a lot this year about the 100th anniversary of the Great War and honouring those who died, everyone is touched by their stories. Stoic: Cathy Alderson from Stoneycroft, Liverpool, says he never once complained about his war time experience or injuries. Although he received three war medals, Mr Davies’ bravery was never formally recognised and she has decided to tell his story for the first time ahead of the 65th anniversary of his death . ‘But it also struck me that there were a lot of men who came back that suffered terribly and had to scrape together a living. My grandfather was one of those and I wanted to tell his story to coincide with the anniversary of his death next week.’ Born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1881, Mr Davies was 34, married and a father to seven children by the time he was called up with the Royal Field Artillery, in 1915. His fellow soldiers quickly nicknamed him ‘Bunloaf’, after the traditional fruit cake he was sent from home by his ‘nanny’ that he generously shared out in the trenches. But by February 1918, as the war neared its end, food on the frontline were scarce and Mr Davies’ regiment were starved of rations. Despite his injuries, Mr Davies quickly re-adjusted to civilian life and started selling the Liverpool Echo from a pitch outside the Adelphi hotel for 20 years . ‘His regiment were stuck for food and ammunition,’ Mrs Alderson said. ‘He crawled all the way over to the German trenches to steal what they needed, and then crawled back. ‘He did it under the cover of darkness, he had to crawl quietly on his stomach, elbows and knees under lines and lines of barbed wire. He said he could hear the Germans talking but took what he could, stuffed it under his battle dress and crawled back. It must have taken a great deal of courage.’ A few weeks later, the regiment was situated close to the infamous Somme, which claimed so many British lives, when the Battle of St Quentin began. More than a million shells rained down on the Allied positions, in some of the heaviest German bombing of the war. Describing the moment which would change her grandfather’s life forever, Mrs Alderson said: ‘He was holding two horses and a copy of Tit-Bit magazine. ‘The magazine had fallen to the floor, and he bent down to pick it up. As he did so a shell crashed down which blew up his horses and the two officers stood up right next to him - taking his left arm and lower leg with them.’ As he lay motionless amid the destruction, a German soldier tried to ‘finish him off’ by stabbing a bayonet in Mr Davies’ neck, she added. Mrs Davies was sent a telegram to say her husband was presumed dead, but incredibly he survived. ‘Four days later some young American medical volunteers were sent in to pick up the corpses,’ Mrs Alderson, a retired Macmillan nurse, said. ‘Miraculously, when they picked William up, they saw his eyes flickering. He must have been hypothermic, as the body can sometimes last much longer when it’ s freezing cold.’ He was initially taken to an American field hospital because he was wearing an American uniform, having discarded his own after a mustard gas attack. What remained of his leg was amputated at the mid-thigh, and he was sent home to be rehabilitated at Alder Hey Hospital, Liverpool. Despite his injuries, Mr Davies quickly re-adjusted to civilian life and started selling the local newspaper, the Liverpool Echo, from a pitch outside the famous Adelphi hotel for 20 years. Mr Davies and his wife also had four more children, including Mrs Alderson’s mother, Veronica, and her twin in 1919. Mr Davies wartime experience, however, never left him and he died aged 68 on December 9 1949 of lung problems caused by exposure to mustard gas.","William Davies bravely snuck into German trench in the dead of night .
His comrades were starving, so he undertook the daring mission .
Weeks later, a German attack robbed him of his arm and a leg .

"Free-to-air channels on Foxtel crashed on Wednesday afternoon, an outage which came in the middle of cricketer Phillip Hughes' funeral. The outage caused all free to air channels to stop broadcasting, but the blackout was particularly bad for viewers watching the Hughes funeral on Channel Nine. It cut out when Hughes' cousin Nino Ramunno was speaking and resumed broadcast around 20 minutes later. A Foxtel spokesperson said they're yet to identify the reach of the outage but admitted it had a 'reasonably large impact'. Scroll down for video . Foxtel users have expressed their outrage as the service went down in the middle of Phillip Hughes' funeral . 'Some customers have been impacted by some severe storm activity at the satellite site', the spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. They added a failure of their back-up systems and the outage has not 'has not affected Foxtel Go and Foxtel Play.' Many angry customers took to social media to express their outrage at the unfortunate timing of the error. Foxtel had an error message up on their website confirming there is a signal outage, but asked people to wait until it is resolved rather than contacting them. The outage was due to bad weather at their satellite station and Foxtel is yet to determine the reach of it . About an hour after the initial outage Foxtel tweeted that it was due to storm activity and a cable failure . 'Please be advised that this is an issue at the signal source which has been escalated to our engineers and will be resolved as soon as possible. 'This issue may impact some or all of your channels and will be resolved without you needing to speak to a technical agent or do anything,' a post from a community manager on the help page reads. The same manager has also advised which other channels  viewers could watch Phillip Hughes' funeral on.

But this did little to calm those on social media upset by the outage. Many took to social media to slam Foxtel over the inconvenient timing . 'Well done Foxtel at stuffing up the Hughes funeral for alot (sic) of people. No signal the entire time,' one user wrote. Another posted a photo showing the error message on their TV screen, calling Foxtel a 'disgrace'. After the channels had been down for around an hour Foxtel tweeted their apologies that some customers' services were down due to 'storm activity and cable failure'.

"The brother of Shrien Dewani launched an extraordinary attack on South African citizens, describing them as 'not normal' and warning: 'These are black people'. Preyen Dewani made the inflammatory comments in a crisis meeting with the parents of murdered bride Anni in which the brothers battled to convince them that Dewani had no part in her death. A translated record of the meeting - published today by MailOnline - was secretly taped by Anni Dewani's cousin on November 22, 2010, just days after the Swedish engineer was buried. The meeting, which was conducted in Gujarati and lasted well over two hours, reveals Preyen's fear that the South African authorities will attempt to frame his brother for murder in order to protect the country's tourist industry. Scroll down for full transcript of the meeting . 'These are black people': Shrien Dewani's brother Preyen (left) launched an inflammatory attack on the South African justice system in a secretly taped recording with the family of honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani (seen, right, with her husband on their wedding day) over fears the businessman would be framed . Calling on the families to unite to defend his brother against unscrupulous forces, he warns: 'We are not dealing with anything normal here. We are dealing with South Africa. 'This is not Sweden or the UK where you have a robust police and court system. These are black people. He was responding to the grieving family's deep mistrust of the British businessman, who is currently on trial accused of her murder. The transcript was accepted as an accurate record of the conversation by both the prosecution and the defence when it was submitted to the court, but it was not submitted as evidence during the trial. The 50-page record also lays bare a number of striking discrepancies between the story the 34-year-old gave to his in-laws in November 2010 and the account he offered to a South African court eight weeks ago as he went on trial for Mrs Dewani's honeymoon murder. Despite glaring variations in his version of events leading up to, and after, his wife's fatal shooting two weeks after their wedding, Dewani is next week widely expected to be cleared of having any hand in it. It comes as the Anni's brother, Anish Hindocha, today made an emotional appeal for Dewani to be forced to explain how she died. The meeting exposes the deep mistrust that Anni Dewani's parents, Vinod and Nilam Hindocha (above), held towards the British businessman just days after the Swedish engineer was buried . Mr Hindocha said Dewani, accused of plotting his sister's kidnap and murder, should not be allowed to leave South Africa without revealing in his own words how she met her death. He said: 'It would be a terrible development to what has been a four-year wait, if we and the people of South Africa are not afforded the full story.' Judge Jeanette Traverso will rule on an application by the businessman's legal team to acquit him on five charges, following a threadbare prosecution case against him, which was undermined by a number of legal rulings to exclude testimony. Sneha Mashru, 28-year-old Anni's first cousin and confidante, hid a tape recorder in her jacket during the lengthy talks which were organised and chaired by Dewani's brother, Preyan, at his family's central London flat, in an effort to smooth growing tensions. Mrs Mashru told Dewani's trial at the Western Cape High Court that his heartless behaviour and unconvincing story in the wake of her cousin's murder had aroused her family's suspicions. Mrs Dewani, an engineer, was shot dead when the taxi carrying her and Dewani through a township on the edge of Cape Town was ambushed by gunmen. The driver, Zola Tongo, and Dewani were freed unharmed, while the dead body of the bride was found in the abandoned vehicle the following morning. Tongo confessed to organising the murder, but claimed it was masterminded by Dewani. Covert: Anni Dewani's cousin, Sneha Mashru, hid a tape recorder in her jacket during the meeting . Prosecutors believe the new groom's secret gay life motivated him to want his wife dead. In the transcript of the meeting, the Hindocha family's misgivings about the state of the newlyweds' relationship are obvious, prompting Preyen – an Oxford law graduate – to invite his brother to allay their suspicions. '.. let's ask Shrien a direct question. Was there any involvement?' Preyen asks his brother . Dewani replies: 'No I had nothing to do with it whatsoever. Even if we had argued, how would I benefit by killing her?' As his father-in-law, Vinod Hindocha, continues to quiz him about the hours and minutes before his daughter's death, with Mrs Mashru's face apparently betraying her doubts, Preyen challenges them to find any motive for his brother to want to kill his new wife. 'Why would you do such a big wedding, with everything that happened, why would, why would you, there is no life policy. You tell me – what is the benefit for Shrien there?' Preyen demands. This prompts Dewani to add: 'Why would I spend £10,000 for First Class tickets to the best hotel in the whole of South Africa?' As Dewani is encouraged to re-tell his dramatic account of the honeymooners' late-night ambush by gunmen on a corner in Gugulethu which saw him and Tongo freed unscathed, but Anni driven off into the dark, the in-laws interrupt with questions. Mrs Dewani's mother, Nilam Hindocha, who does not apparently speak until 45 minutes into the crunch talks, appears puzzled by her son-in-law's claim that he had been pushed, head first, out of a rear window of the moving car and 'rolled out like a roly poly onto the road.' 'Did you not get hurt then?' the 62-year-old grieving mother demands to know. Confirming that he was indeed left bruised after landing on his head and shoulder, Dewani plays down his injuries. 'I did not hurt myself that much. It was all on sand,' he says, adding that his suit and a white shirt that she had bought for him 'was all – you know – dirty'. Clearly still unconvinced that two assassins – one of them at the wheel of a moving car in a pair of yellow washing-up gloves and the other brandishing a gun – had somehow managed to wrestle her athletic son-in-law out of a car window, against his will, Mrs Hindocha seeks further confirmation that this is what really happened. She also wants to know what her daughter was doing while he was being ejected, eventually demanding: 'How you could just leave her with two black men?' To which, Dewani replies: 'I did not have a choice.' In the meeting, which was designed to give Anni's father the full story from Dewani, the accused made no mention at all about a helicopter trip he claims he was planning. During his trial it has been claimed that he had R10,000 in Anni's handbag to pay for a surprise helicopter trip for his bride and was to ask taxi driver Zola Tongo to arrange it for him. The helicopter ride was not mentioned to police, his public relations guru, the jailed sex pest Max Clifford, or a journalist who interviewed him on tape. The claim emerged a few years after the murder. Preyen also informs the meeting that he has secured the services of the now-disgraced PR guru Max Clifford to limit the damage to the reputation of Dewani and the successful family business the two brothers still run with their father, Prakash. There had been newspaper reports alleging their lucrative string of care homes was in financial straits and the family could gain from an insurance policy on Anni's life. 'We are not in any financial difficulty whatsoever. .. if you want 5 million in cash, I can write you a cheque now. 'There is no problem with our company - the way we set and structure our company is very clever - because it is there to make sure we...,' Preyen reassures Mr Hindocha, 65, whose mobile phone interrupts his flow. The meeting also reveals bitter disagreements over arrangements for the funeral during which the Hindocha family obviously felt sidelined. Ami Denborg, the dead engineer's sister, was denied time alone with her sister's body, Mr Hindocha suggests. At one point, the grieving father-in-law tells Dewani, 'The look you gave me at the funeral was really scary.' He later asks, directing his question apparently at no-one in particular, 'Why her ? I should rather have died.' Dewani denies murder and kidnapping. See below for full version of the transcript .

"A prominent young activist has been charged with assaulting a guard during a Ferguson-related protest just days after meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House. Rasheen Aldridge, 20, the youngest member of the newly-established Ferguson Commission, was part of a group that rushed the doors at St. Louis City Hall, Missouri, police said. Video footage posted online show the group shouting, 'We shut s*** down', while storming towards marshals who were blocking the entrance. Scroll down for video .

Wearing a grey hat, Aldridge is seen in at the front of the group and at one point he appears to shove a marshal. The 20-year-old was charged with assault along with two other demonstrators, Zachary Chasnoff from St Louis and Chelsea Carswell from Austin, Texas. Hundreds took to the streets Hall last week as part of a protest over a St. Louis County grand jury's decision to not indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in Michael Brown's shooting death. A police spokesman said: 'Several individuals rushed the doors at City Hall, attempting to gain entry. The 20-year-old was charged with third degree assault along with two other demonstrators . 'The individuals broke the door and C.U, a City Marshall, stood at the door, blocking the individuals from entering City Hall. The defendant was among the individuals attempting to gain entry to City Hall. 'While C.U. was blocking entry, Defendant and the other individuals were chanting and shouting at C.U. and others posted at the door. Defendant and the other individuals continued to attempt to gain entry to City Hall and Defendant pushed C.U.' On Monday, Aldridge and fellow commission member Brittany Packnett were in Washington to visit Mr Obama. 'One of the most powerful things that happened today was I had the opportunity to meet with some young people, including a couple of young outstanding leaders from the Ferguson community, Brittany Packnett and Rasheen Aldridge,' said the US president. 'And what made me concerned was the degree to which they feel as if they are not heard or that the reality of what they experienced has been denied. The member of Young Activists United admitted he was hesitant to accept an appointment to the commission . 'What made me greatly encouraged was how clear their voices were when they were heard, and how constructive they are in wanting to solve these problems. And I think anybody who had the chance to listen to them here today felt the same way.' Aldridge said he was 'disappointed' with the president after their meeting because he didn't commit to action in Ferguson. The member of Young Activists United admitted he was hesitant to accept an appointment to the commission. 'That was the most difficult part, to make sure I'm not turning my back on my people or betraying them or doing any backdoor deals because like I said at the end of the day, I stand with them,' he said. The 16-person panel of the Ferguson Commission has been appointed to study and make specific recommendations for how to make progress on the issues raised by events in Ferguson. In a written statement, Ferguson Commission co-chairs Rich McClure and Rev Starsky Wilson said: 'We do not have a lot of information on the situation with Rasheen Aldridge Junior and the misdemeanor charge stemming from an incident at city hall last week. We hope to have a chance to talk to him to understand the facts. Rasheen is a valued member of the Ferguson commission.'","Rasheen Aldridge, 20, was arrested after a Ferguson-related protest .

"Watching David Silva's mesmerising display last weekend got me thinking: where does the Manchester City winger stand among the great foreign players who have graced our game? We have been blessed since the inception of the Barclays Premier League to see a number of players arrive here and produce performances that have ensured their names will stand the test of time, but could you make a team out of them? So, as it is international week, I've decided to do something different and name what I consider to be the best foreign XI of the modern era. It hasn't been easy and some big reputations have had to miss the cut. See whether you agree with this... Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher (left) came up against many of the Premier League's best foreign players, including Chelsea's Didier Drogba (pictured wrestling for possession at Anfield in November 2010) Goalkeeper: Peter Schmeichel . When people talk about players who made United so successful, he would be competing for one of the top slots. His influence in those initial title triumphs was just as big as Eric Cantona's. Even towards the end of his career, when he was playing for Manchester City, he was making extraordinary saves and one performance at Anfield in May 2003 lives in my memory. Former Denmark international Peter Schmeichel, pictured making a save for Manchester United against Tottenham, enjoyed a successful eight-year spell with Manchester United . Schmeichel also went on to play for Premier League sides Aston Villa and Manchester City . Right-back: Pablo Zabaleta . Admired throughout the League, he is a top player and what I like most about him is that he just gets on with his job without any fuss, putting the team first. Covers miles going up and down the pitch and has the honours his quality deserves. He only cost £6million and could end up being regarded as one of City's greatest signings. Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta (left), pictured sliding to block a shot from Aston Villa's Kieran Richardson, has been instrumental in Manchester City's rise to the top from the right-hand side of the back four . Zabaleta, who cost a bargain £6million from Espanyol in 2008, could become one of City's greatest players . Centre-half: Vincent Kompany . The biggest compliment I can pay the Belgian is that if he maintains his standards for the next four or five years — and City are successful at home and abroad — he could outstrip John Terry as the Premier League's greatest defender. He has the elegance of Rio Ferdinand and the steel of Nemanja Vidic. Speaking of him… . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany lifts the 2013-14 Premier League trophy after another fine season . Kompany could be regarded as the Premier League's best-ever defender if he continues his form for City . Centre-half: Nemanja Vidic . My type of defender. Liverpool tried to buy him in January 2006 but our loss was United's gain. I'd have loved to have played alongside him and I'm sure we could have formed a solid partnership. He loves defending and putting his head in where it hurts. His arrival took Ferdinand's performances up another level. They became the best defensive pairing in Europe. Nemanja Vidic waves goodbye to the Old Trafford faithful after calling time on his Manchester United career . Carragher admits he would have loved to have played alongside Vidic in the centre of defence . Left-back: Patrice Evra . When he was at his peak, all you could do was toss a coin to decide whether it was him or Ashley Cole who you selected for the PFA team of the year. A tough, tenacious defender who also scored a number of vital goals. He wasn't the tallest but always provided a threat at set pieces. Patrice Evra, pictured celebrating a goal against Newcastle in 2012, was a big presence at Manchester United . The Frenchman ended his time at Old Trafford with a summer move to Italian giants Juventus . Right-midfield: Cristiano Ronaldo . What more can you say about the man who is currently the best player in the world? You could see he was going to reach that level with his pace and power. For some reason, he never excelled against Liverpool — he only scored two goals — but he was the reason Manchester United wrestled the initiative back off Chelsea and became England's dominant team. Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo, pictured shooting against Manchester City in 2009, was sold to Real Madrid for £80million after becoming one of the world's best players during his time in the Premier League . Ronaldo helped United overcome Chelsea's dominance under Jose Mourinho and get back to the top . Centre-midfield: Patrick Vieira . A monster, his partnership with Emmanuel Petit was as good as anything we have seen. His performance against Liverpool in the 2001 FA Cup final stands out. He was magnificent and didn't deserve to be on the losing side. In the dressing room afterwards, everyone kept saying: 'how good was Vieira?' Steven Gerrard still talks about that game as Vieira made him realise he had to climb a few more levels to reach the top. It says everything that clubs, when they sign young midfielders, hope they turn into 'the next Vieira'. Frenchman Patrick Vieira (centre), pictured in action against Liverpool's Emile Heskey (left) and El-Hadji Diouf at Highbury in 2004, was the driving force in Arsenal's midfield for a number of years . Vieira inspired Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard to raise his game after his display in the 2001 FA Cup final . Centre-midfield: Yaya Toure . His stamp is all over Manchester City's recent trophy-winning exploits and he has always come up with a goal when it matters, be it in a decisive Premier League match, the FA Cup final or the League Cup final. A powerhouse but blessed with great skill. Impossible to contain when he builds up a head of steam. Manchester City's Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure, pictured in action against Aston Villa in the Midlands last weekend, has helped his club to two Premier League titles in the last three seasons . Toure has proved a huge success at the Etihad since his £25million move from Barcelona in 2010 . Left-midfield: David Silva . I have to include him, as he is a joy to watch. His form has been so good that City fans are debating whether he can become the club's greatest-ever player. Marc Overmars, David Ginola, Robert Pires or even Eden Hazard could have filled this role but Silva is so easy on the eye. Could score more goals but makes up for that with his assists and the way he controls a game. Spaniard David Silva shone as champions Manchester City beat Aston Villa 2-0 away from home last Saturday . Silva is the main creative force in City's midfield, often laying on chances for Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko . Striker: Thierry Henry . I've used this analogy before and I make no apology for using it again. When he hit top gear and ran past you, it was like trying to chase after someone on a motorbike. When Arsenal were 'The Invincibles' in the period between 2003-2004, Henry rivalled Ronaldinho as the best in the world. A great goal-scorer, not to mention a scorer of great goals, he is the finest player I have seen in the Premier League. His game didn't have a weakness. Now for the hard bit... Arsenal legend Thierry Henry celebrates a vital equaliser against rivals Tottenham at Highbury in April 2006 . Arsene Wenger helped transform Henry from a wide player to one of the deadliest strikers in the world . Striker: Didier Drogba . There were no shortage of contenders for this role, ranging from Eric Cantona, Gianfranco Zola and Dennis Bergkamp to Luis Suarez and Sergio Aguero. But even though they were all better players, I kept going back to Drogba because he did what all strikers should do and that is score in the biggest games. He scored three winners in the FA Cup final, got the crucial goals in two League Cup finals and who could forget what he did in Munich in the Champions League final? At his best, he was unplayable. So there you have it! Chelsea's Didier Drogba (left), pictured scoring against Manchester United away at Old Trafford in 2010, had a tendency to find the back of the net in the biggest games for various managers at Stamford Bridge .

"The owners of a Christmas attraction were left scratching their heads after one of their reindeers shed her antlers hours before  visitors were due to arrive. Blitzen the reindeer was settled into her new temporary Christmas quarters on Sunday night ahead of the grand opening of a seasonal festival. But  as she was about to welcome families the following morning, her owner  opened the doors to her closure and found the animal was missing her trademark antlers. Blitzen the reindeer shocked owners of Old Holly Farm in Garstang, Lancashire by shedding her antlers the day before visitors were due to arrive . The animals shed their antlers annually, usually in the spring, and owners of the farm did not expect the phenomenon to happen before Christmas . Ian Pye, who works at Old Holly Farm in Garstang, Lancashire, said: 'We've had so many visitors since we opened on Monday and people are really shocked to see a reindeer without antlers. 'I think a lot of people don't realise that reindeers shed their antlers so they all seem amazed. 'We've assured the children that it won't stop her flying on Christmas Eve so they don't seem to mind. 'Normally, reindeers shed their antlers in early spring so it's really unusual to see it this early. I wonder whether it's because the weather has been really mild and she's got a bit confused.' The antlers have now been attached to the fencing posts outside the deers' enclosure, alongside a note explaining how reindeer regrow their antlers each year. But keeper Ian Pye say that Blitzen - even without her trademark antlers - is still popular with visitors .","Reindeer was due to be centrepiece of festive farm attraction .

"As Sunni extremists claimed the lives of more than a dozen policemen near Iraq's border with Syria and airstrikes struck targets near Aleppo, dozens of locals lined up to compete in what must be the most dangerous running race in the world. The men yesterday raced through the war-torn streets in Aleppo's rebel-controlled Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood. Little is known about the race, which was eventually won by Ahmed Sobhe. He later posed for photographs while holding a trophy aloft. Scroll down for video . Dozens of men took to the war-torn streets of Aleppo yesterday and competed in a running race . The race came as an attack on a police checkpoint near the Syrian border town of al-Walid claimed the lives of 15 Iraqi policemen in an assault that underscored the depth of the country's turmoil . The race came as an attack on a police checkpoint  near the Syrian border town of al-Walid claimed the lives of 15 Iraqi policemen in an assault that underscored the depth of the country's turmoil. It also followed an announcement on Monday from Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, that he had retired 24 officials from the interior Ministry. The move is part of efforts to restructure the country's security apparatus and remove those who failed to confront the crisis caused by the Islamic State group's onslaught, he said. In Syria, the U.S. Central Command said a U.S. airstrike struck a target associated with the so-called Khorasan group, which it says is a special cell within the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front that is plotting attacks against Western interests. The attack took place near Aleppo, and was among 27 airstrikes since Friday that mainly targeted Islamic State group militants in Kobani and Raqqa in northern Syria. Eventual winner Ahmad Sobhe looks to have a commanding lead as he passes piles of rubble . Sobhe holds up a trophy as he celebrates winning the race through the Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood . The strike on the Khorasan group marked the fifth time the U.S. has targeted Nusra, al-Qaida's Syria branch, as part of its broader campaign against the ISIS group in Syria and Iraq. The June fall of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, was a turning point in the war against the jihadi group that calls itself the Islamic State. The U.S.-trained Iraqi military, harassed for months by small-scale attacks, buckled almost instantly when militants advanced on the city. Commanders disappeared, pleas for more ammunition went unanswered and in some cases, soldiers stripped off their uniforms and ran from the fight. Since then, U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have served to reinforce Iraqi and Kurdish security forces as they battle the Sunni militants, but major victories have been sparse. At least five other officers were injured during the checkpoint attack on Monday. Also Monday, the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq said that 1,232 Iraqis were killed and 2,434 were wounded in violence and terror attacks in November. Of those killed, at least 296 were members of Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as militias who fight alongside the troops.","The race was held in the rebel-controlled Bustan al-Qasr neighbourhood .

"Stereosonic music festival is one of the largest and most popular in the Australia, and last weekend the festival hit Sydney. It's clear that people are still intent on parting hard. But in a video posted to social media, one man looks as though he was having a little too much fun. Sitting in the stands at one of the many stages spread around Sydney Showgrounds,  the reveler is dressed in a rainbow coloured singlet, denim shorts and slip-on shoes. One man at Stereosonic festival in Sydney at the weekend was so inebriated he tried to take photos with his credit card thinking it was his phone . Lost in his own world, the partygoer throws his arms around while still seated, thrashing his head in an attempt to keep up to the beat of the music. As the music pumps around him he stands up and moves to the fence in front of him to look down on the stage and dancers below. Then, deciding this would be an appropriate moment to try and capture a photograph, the confused festival goer pulls his wallet out his pocket. While sitting down the partygoer pulls out his wallet, before reaching for his credit card . Still dancing, he holds his wallet out in front of him, he fumbles and looks to be trying to swipe his wallet as if it's an iPhone. The man then pulls out a credit card, thinking it is a camera, and clutches it like a phone. He seems to try and take photographs while holding out the card, staring at it as if it has a screen. Standing looking down on the crowd below, the man attempts to take photos with his credit card . Then, realising that he has been unsuccessful in capturing a 'photo' - or maybe thinking he had captured some great shots - the man puts his card back into his wallet. The clip has had hundreds of thousands of views on Facebook, and has been shared thousands of times by people who can't believe what they're seeing. Many social media users have expressed how hilarious they find the footage, while others have expressed their concern for the man, who is clearly very inebriated.

"Britain still has a chronic shortage of doctors – and experts warn that the situation is putting patients’ lives at risk. Despite recruitment drives, the UK has one of the lowest numbers of practising medics per head in the EU. Only Ireland, Slovenia, Romania and Poland have fewer physicians, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. Shortage: Britain has one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the EU, says a new report (file photo) Britain has 2.8 doctors per thousand people – less than the EU average of 3.4 and below other major economies including Germany, Italy and France. Even former Communist states such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic have a greater proportion and Greece has more than twice as many doctors per head than the UK. Experts say the shortage in the NHS is most acute among GPs and A&E doctors. Last night Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned the shortage was risking patients. ‘When you have shortages of doctors in some areas it means longer waits,’ he said. ‘In A&E that’s not really an option, so it means doctors work harder and harder; it means there is a greater chance of mistakes, and ultimately it means risks to lives. ‘This has been going on the last three or four years – we cannot carry on like this.’ Long wait: A&E departments are under strain . The report found that the number of doctors in the UK has increased more rapidly than in any other EU country since 2000, rising by over 50 per cent between 2000 and 2012. The rise was set in train by the Labour government, but has continued under the Tories even since the economic crash. ‘As a result, the United Kingdom had 2.8 practising physicians per 1000 population in 2012, up from 2.0 in 2000,’ the OECD report said. ‘This nonetheless remains below the EU average of 3.4 doctors per 1000 population. ‘While most of the increase in the number of doctors in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s came from the entry of foreign-trained doctors, the situation changed just before the economic crisis with most of the increase now driven by a strong rise in the number of graduates from domestic medical education programmes. ‘This reflects a deliberate policy in the United Kingdom to reduce its reliance on foreign-trained doctors to meet its own needs.’ Britain’s proportion of doctors – 2.8 per 1,000 head of population in 2012 – is much lower, however, than Greece on 6.2, Austria on 4.9 and Lithuania on 4.4. Among our major European partners, Germany’s rate is 4.0, Italy is on 3.9, Spain is 3.8 and France is on 3.3. The EU average is 3.4 per 1,000 population. Only four countries are below us – with the lowest being Poland on just 2.2. The OECD said Britain’s rapid rise over the past decade had led to fears that doctors were being trained in the wrong specialisms – meaning they may have to be lain off in future years. ‘A growing number of doctors will improve access to health care, but will also put pressure on future health care budgets as more graduates enter the medical workforce,’ the report said. ‘There are now concerns that there might be surpluses of certain categories of doctors in the years ahead. This has led to recommendations to reduce slightly student intakes in medical schools or post-graduate training for certain specialties.’ Dr Mann, from the College of Emergency Medicine, added: ‘We have been warning for some years that we have got fewer doctors than most parts of the developed world. ‘When there aren’t enough doctors to go round, they can pick and choose speciality and because of the levels of burnout in A&E, that means many are walking away, creating even greater shortages. ‘We have now got 500 A&E doctors trained in this country working in Australia – that’s the equivalent of two full years of trained doctors. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said: ‘The NHS is under incredible pressure from rising patient demand and flat-lining funding. ‘The government’s announcement of additional resources in the autumn statement for the NHS is a step in the right direction, but it will not solve the long term under-doctoring of many parts of the NHS that is hindering patient care. ‘Key specialities such as emergency care and GP services are facing particularly acute shortages.’ 1 Greece 6.2 . 2 Austria 4.9 . 3 Lithuania 4.4 . 4 Portugal 4.1 . 5 Germany 4.0 . 6 Sweden 3.9 . 7 Italy 3.9 . 8 Spain 3.8 . 9 Bulgaria 3.7 . 10 Czech Republic 3.7 . 11 Malta 3.5 . 12 Denmark 3.5 .

"Brian Bubear, 70, was beaten by a recovering alcoholic. He escaped by hiding in a toilet while it took three security staff to restrain his attacker . Crisis-hit Colchester Hospital has issued a grovelling apology after a terminally ill pensioner was beaten with his walking stick by a fellow patient. Brian Bubear, 70, was sleeping in a private room off the main ward when another patient, an alcoholic who had been brought in to 'detoxify', crept in and attacked him . Mr Bubear only escaped by locking himself in a small toilet attached to the room, while it took three security staff to restrain the attacker. Worse still, Mr Bubear's 75-year-old wife, Elizabeth, said staff did not tell about the incident for four days afterwards. Last month Colchester Hospital was put into special measures by the Care Quality Commission after staff were bullied into changing cancer patients' records to hide missed targets. Mr Bubear was attacked in the early hours of November 23, just a week after inspectors visited the hospital, as he slept in his room. His attacker, who has not been named, crept into his room as he slept, took his walking stick from the windowsill where it was resting, and began attacking Mr Bubear with it. After the attack Mr Bubear, who was suffering from a bad infection at the time, was moved on to a general ward. His wife said: 'My husband is terminally ill and he is all I have left and to have this happen to him when his is in hospital is completely disgraceful. 'He was in hospital because he needed to be cared for and looked after. Patients should feel safe in a hospital. 'I know he is terminally ill but he will not be going back to that hospital. Never.' Mrs Bubear, who is recovering from a broken hip which is unconnected to the attack, says she has now taken her husband home, where he is recovering with her. The attack happened at Colchester Hospital just a week after it was put into special measures after a surprise inspection. The hospital today issued a grovelling apology to Mr Bubear and his wife, Elizabeth . She added: 'I am ashamed of the hospital. It is getting a bad enough name but now I don't even think it is safe. 'I'm not telling the story for me or my husband. I want the public to know what can go on there. 'My husband is so frail and he could even have been killed.' A state of emergency was declared at Colchester Hospital on November 15 after a surprise visit by health inspectors. They found patients were inappropriately restrained, sedated without consent, and do not resuscitate signs were being ignored. The A&E unit was found to be struggling with demand, while it was claimed that staff had tampered with cancer patients' records in order to meet waiting targets. A spokesman for the hospital said: 'We apologise unreservedly to Mr Bubear and his wife for what happened to him while he was in our care on Langham ward, which is totally unacceptable. 'Unfortunately, this incident could not have been foreseen. 'The patient who hit him was not known to have any mental health issues and had been admitted to the ward shortly before the incident because he was a detoxifying alcoholic with medical needs and did not have any record of carrying out violent acts. 'We have occasionally experienced patients who are detoxifying alcoholics committing criminal damage on the ward, such as smashing a window or pulling equipment off a wall but not attacking other patients. 'As soon as this incident occurred, the Trust's own security staff were called and a member of the security team remained with the patient who hit Mr Bubear until the ward sister carried out an assessment and decided that one-on-one security was no longer necessary. 'Again, we apologise unreservedly to Mr and Mrs Bubear for this appalling experience.'","Brian Bubear, 70, was recovering from infection at Colchester Hospital .

"Two days of rain has soothed the parched landscape of California, though relief has also brought flooded roadways and traffic jams in some areas. Reservoirs swelled and waterfalls sprung back to life on Wednesday, as officials monitored for  flooding and mudslides that were possible after one of California's worst years of drought on record. A sinkhole in San Francisco was being blamed on the heavy storm, which also dumped snow over mountains and brought water back to the waterfalls of Yosemite National Park. Scroll down for video . The flood: An officer directed cars through a flooded section of road in Mill Valley on Wednesday after heavy rain soaked a previously drought-stricken terrain . Inundated: An empty car is submerged on a flooded section road in Mill Valley on Wednesday after heavy rain soaked a previously drought-stricken terrain . Backup: A miles-long traffic jam on the southbound section of Highway 101 slowed cars to a crawl ahead of a flooded portion of roadway in Mill Valley on Wednesday . Forecast: A satellite image shows the clouds spread across the western United States that were dumping rain across California and causing isolated flooding . The park's 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls, which had nearly dried up by mid-July, came roaring back to life. 'With the precipitation, they are looking good. They are flowing nicely,' park spokeswoman Ashley Mayer said. One area, Yucaipa Ridge up in the San Bernardino Mountains, had received 8.38 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. CBS reports that slick roads and flooding on highways led to an uptick in accident reports across the state. On Wednesday, the agency reported that local California Highway Patrol dispatchers had logged 101 crash reports between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m. There were 328 throughout the day on Tuesday, according to the agency, compared to 50 to 75 crashes on a normal non-rainy day. Officials said that, in spite of this week's rainfall, much more would be needed to reverse three years of drought conditions in the state. The Association of California Water Services notes that the 2014 water year, which ended September 30, was the fourth driest in California's history. Traffic jam: One onlooker tweeted the sight of cars backed up in Sacramento along a highway at dusk . Plowing through: A car pushed through deep water on a flooded section of road in Mill Valley on Wednesday after heavy rain soaked a previously drought-stricken terrain .

Warning signs: Signs in Tiburon warn drivers off the badly flooded sections of roadway on Wednesday after the region was hit with heavy rain, lightning and hail . The drought made terrain in some areas susceptible to mudslides from flash floods on Tuesday. Residents in Camarillo Springs were forced to evacuate around 75 homes as rushing water brought mud flowing through the foothills 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Homeowners were urged to remain outside the area even after the evacuation order was lifted, though no damage was reported. Silverado Canyon also had a voluntary evacuation notice in place for around 60 homes in an area that had experienced large fires and mudslides previously.

"Nick Clegg today rejected claims he 'snubbed' the Autumn Statement after failing to turn up in the Commons for George Osborne's Autumn Statement today.

He said: 'We are often told politicians should spend more time outside of Westminster talking to people and that is exactly what Nick is doing. This is not a snub.' He added: 'I've spent four years dutifully sitting there on the green benches and this year I thought it would be a nice change to get out of the Westminster bubble and say what this Autumn Statement means to people, their families and businesses.' The Deputy PM decided to stay away from the Commons even though the Autumn Statement's main announcement - overhauling stamp duty - has been Lib Dem policy since 2007. From midnight tonight, stamp duty will no longer leap at each threshold but will rise gradually, with multi-million pound sales costing much more.

Former owner Alejandro Amor, 56, was criminally indicted in October and faces pending charges of conspiracy and theft of government money . From 2009 to its closing in June 2012, FastTrain received some $35 million in federal funds, including Pell Grants, providing federal aid to the neediest families. The U.S. government is now claiming damages of more than $6 million. 'To generate as much revenue as possible, FastTrain would fill its classes with ineligible students,' the complaint said. Students who never graduated from high school received fake diplomas, the complaint charged, or were coached to lie about their status on financial aid applications. To access taxpayer money, the school needed first-time students to attend class for at least 30 days. If they didn't, FastTrain falsified attendance records or backdated the enrollment so they could collect the money quicker, the lawsuit says. The growth of for-profit colleges, which are governed by private organisations or corporations, has been explosive in Florida and across the country. As the schools have grown, numerous whistle-blower lawsuits have been filed against them by ex-employees. Some former FastTrain students say they are still struggling with student loan debts.

"The elephants of my childhood, Vladimir and Evgeny, have probably been killed by now. I was very lucky that I ever got to see them with my own eyes, but such are the perks for a little boy whose grandfather was the Soviet Union’s top biologist. They were fictitious in the beginning, invented by my grandfather Vladimir Sokolov, as he tucked me in to bed at night. I would hear how Vladimir and Evgeny would get stuck in mud holes and roam the African forests getting into adventures, and how Vladimir would save little Evgeny from the clutches of lions and leopards. In the flickering electricity of the lamps in our Soviet flat, it was my first introduction to the wonder of wildlife. Scroll down for video . The author Evgeny Lebedev pictured with a group of armed wildlife rangers in Kenya . A few years later, accompanying my grandfather on a government trip to Kenya, a battered Jeep took us to a ridge a couple of hours’ drive south of Nairobi and, as we crested the top, the view opened to reveal a herd of elephants around a waterhole. I stared at the joy of it: the plodding feet, the curling trunks moving across the wide escarpment, the young ones nuzzling at the grown-ups’ tree-trunk legs. Almost all the adults were female, my grandfather explained, except for two young males, old enough now to soon start out of their own, their life’s adventures unfolding in front of them like the African savannah. The larger one, he nicknamed Vladimir; the smaller one, Evgeny. It was an image of calm perfection — a scene which, even to my then 14-year-old self, was clearly how nature at its purest should be. Vladimir and Evgeny were young enough, then, to still be alive now, and they may well be, but the numbers suggest otherwise. They may still be trumpeting around the African bush. But it’s more likely that what remains of them is an ivory dragon somewhere on a Chinese mantelpiece. When I saw that herd there were around 1.2 million elephants on the continent. Three-quarters of those, including most likely many of the elephants I saw that day, have since been hunted for their tusks — and the numbers being lost are growing. The reality is that there is a war going on in Africa and it is war between wildlife rangers and poachers to ensure the survival of some of the world’s most iconic species. It is also a war that the conservationists are losing. Elephants have been poached in such numbers that unless urgent action is taken the reality we face is that they risk extinction in the wild within the next decade. This is not only the case in Kenya but across Africa. This year alone some 36,000 elephants will be killed across the continent — an average of one every 20 minutes. An African elephant pictured as it charges towards the photographer. This year alone some 36,000 elephants will be killed across the African continent - an average of one every 20 minutes . In Chad, which once had 15,000 elephants, there are now just 400. In Sierra Leone, the last elephant disappeared three years ago. The reason is greed — and specifically the vast profits that can be made from ivory due to the seemingly insatiable demand of Asia’s rapidly growing middle-classes. Many there still see ivory as an aspirational product and, as people’s bank balances swell, the law of supply and demand has resulted in prices rocketing. A kilogram of ivory is now worth £1,225 on the black market, three times what it was four years ago. The tragedy is that many do not appreciate the consequence of their purchase as, incredibly, it is not universally known in Asia that elephants are killed to extract their ivory. In China, some 70 per cent of people were found in a survey to believe tusks grew back like fingernails. That ignorance is resulting in bloodied carcasses across the savannahs. I recently returned from Africa, where I have been working closely with the Kenya-based elephant protection charity Space for Giants to do what we can to help save those elephants that remain. Together we have helped finance anti-poaching patrols in Laikipia, one of the last great enclaves for elephants in East Africa, and helped facilitate the purchase of a new conservancy, Loisaba, to act as a vast — and heavily protected — sanctuary. Rangers look over the carcass of an elephant found shot dead by poachers in Cameroon . Training programmes have been introduced for local wildlife rangers and the judiciary, and plans are in place to extend our work into Tanzania and Gabon. The trip rammed home the scale of the threat — and the urgency of the action required to combat it. Those seeking to kill elephants are no longer local farmers armed with a bow and arrow or an old rifle, seeking some extra bucks. Increasingly, it is heavily armed professional gangs financed by the same money-men who make their wealth from the smuggling of drugs and people being sold into prostitution. Organisations that rank among the most loathsome in the world are culpable. Al-Shabaab, the Somalian extremists who carried out the slaughter in Nairobi’s Westgate mall; Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army, which routinely kidnaps and drugs children to turn them into child soldiers; and Janjaweed, the roving gunmen who carried out the genocide in Darfur, all resort to ivory poaching to finance their nefarious activities. Against them is a thin green line of wildlife rangers. In the face of such a sustained onslaught, they have had to militarise or risk being overrun. Pictured is the decomposed carcasses of two elephants found in Waza National Park, Cameroon . In Laikipia, I have been on night patrols with units of these brave men. And be in no doubt that the dangers they face are no less than those confronting combatants in a real war. Space for Giants’ rangers are dressed in combat fatigues. Their weapons are Heckler & Koch G3s, the German-made automatic rifle that is one of the most efficient and modern in the world. Their webbing is filled with military supplies, including night-vision goggles and closed-frequency radios. The medic, taking up the rear, normally has the latest combat kit, including bandages dripped in quick-clot — only just developed by U.S. forces — to stop the bleeding from a gunshot wound. Before we set out one evening, the unit’s commander, Jackson Kamunya, left me in no doubt as to why such equipment is needed. ‘A report came in on the radio that the poachers were active and we mobilised the helicopter to get to them before they could reach the animals,’ he said of a recent patrol. ‘It meant we got there ahead of them so we could set our ambush. We could see them, all armed with AK-47s. Then everyone started shooting.’ Dozens of elephant tusks are laid out on display in a sombre reminder of the illegal ivory trade . Twelve people have been killed in the poaching war being waged in just a small area of Kenya. To the north, in West Pokot County, five poachers were shot dead and two rangers wounded in a further fire-fight. The same story is being repeated across the continent. South Africa’s Kruger Park saw a police constable and a ranger killed as they tried to track poachers seeking rhino horn. In Uganda, there have been reports of poachers using attack helicopters to mow down elephants. Some 1,000 wildlife rangers — a third more than the entire losses of the British military in Iraq and Afghanistan — have been killed in the past decade. Space for Giants’ founder, Dr Max Graham, is certain that only ‘boots on the ground’, like those I patrolled with, can blunt the poaching threat until demand in Asia is eased through education programmes. Changing such beliefs, however, is a process that will likely take decades. ‘The illegal trade has already effectively wiped out rhinos from the wild, forcing them to become a highly managed population in a small number of sanctuaries,’ he explained. ‘That’s what will happen to elephants if the present rate of slaughter continues. That is the reality of the situation. It’s a war, a war for wildlife, being waged right here, right now.” My grandfather is no longer with us, although his work is still studied in universities across the former Soviet Union. He died in 1998 of a rare form of bone cancer, most likely caused as a result of the work he was required to conduct in Chernobyl in the immediate aftermath of the reactor meltdown. The demand for ivory has increased in recent years and is largely fuelled by Asia's burgeoning middle classes . He always wanted me to be a zoologist. I let him down in not achieving that but I still gained from him a love of nature and a life-long commitment to conversation and wildlife protection. It is what makes what is now unfolding to the animals he first introduced me to in those make-believe stories so unbearable to watch. I know he would be proud of what — with Space for Giants and all the Independent and Evening Standard readers who have supported this cause — we have achieved so far. In the area of Laikipia that is implementing our programmes, poaching rates are already down 60 per cent. And the area we protect will spread. I am committed to that. Part of our work involves tracking elephants’ migratory patterns so the alert can be raised if one approaches known poaching hot spots. To do this the animals are darted and a GPS collar is fitted. Each is then given a name so it can be identified as its progress is charted. Late last year we darted a young male, which we nicknamed Evgeny. Recently, I fitted another collar, this time to a fully-grown bull elephant. We called him Vladimir. It means I can now track them both through the elephant-monitoring system fitted to Space for Giants computers, and watch this new Vladimir and Evgeny as they really do roam the plains of Africa as elephants have since before the dawn of man. Long may they do so. And long may all their kind continue to do so, despite the war waged against them so that their tusks can be turned into trinkets. This is a fight for their survival that cannot be lost. My grandfather would have told me that. It is what he taught me all those years ago at my bedside.","This year alone 36,000 elephants will be killed across the African continent .

"The mansion of music industry guru Graham Hutchinson, has been sold for $8.2 million to a Chinese buyer years after it was first listed. The two acre Maryland avenue property at Carrara, on the Gold Coast in Queensland is a spectacular waterfront property, equip with seven bedrooms and six bathrooms. Offered as two lots, listed to buy both or one, the property includes a pool, pontoon, helipad and tennis court. 30-32 Maryland avenue, Carrara, owned by music industry guru Graham Hutchinson, sold for $8.2 million to a Chinese buyer . The prestigious property has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms and absolute water views . The ex national music promoter used the property primarily to house famous celebrities while they were touring Australia and were in Queensland including Elton John and Fleetwood Mac . Critton Astras at Realty Special Projects confirmed it was sold to Prosper Holdings Pty Ltd, which is associated with Stanley Chan and while quoted as been sold for $7.16, he said it actually went for $8.2 million. He says the ex national music promoter used the property primarily to house famous celebrities while they were touring Australia and were in Queensland. 'For the last 20 years, he's had Russian acts like the Russian ballet stay there, had celebrities like Fleetwood Mac, Elton John,' he said. 'It was known as the celebrity estate.' Mr Critton says the property, which was listed with a number of real estate agencies, has been on the market for around three years and has been kept in immaculate condition. The views are stunning at the Carrara property on the Gold Coast, and the property includes a pontoon, pool and even a helipad . Critton Astras at Realty Special Projects confirmed it was sold to Prosper Holdings Pty Ltd, which is associated with Stanley Chan . 'He kept it in show style and as the market picked up in the last 18 months, Graham was looking for the right buyer for his property which he believed was very unique,' he said. 'He was a very educated owner, he has a lot more knowledge than a lot of real estate agents in Queensland.' He believes the sale of property could be the second highest for 2014 behind 60 Admiralty Drive, Paradise Waters, which sold for $8.7 million, reported by the Gold Coast Bulletin. Mr Critton says about eight years ago, Graham purchased the run down property and in the last couple of years spent over $1 million redeveloping it. 'Graham moved to the Sunshine coast, he has two boys, family, grandchildren and he wanted to spend time with them,' he said. The Carrara property owned by music industry guru Graham Hutchinson had absolute water views . The ex national music promoter used the property primarily to house famous celebrities while they were touring Australia and were in Queensland including Elton John and Fleetwood Mac . The two acre property had a whopping seven bedrooms and six bathrooms as well as a pool, tennis court and pontoon out the back . 'Chinese buyers have been looking at properties in this area because it's close to amenities, safe, central, on the water and is large parcels of land.' 'The Chinese have a good eye and look at the value of the property and compare, they definitely know their markets in Sydney and Melbourne and also Brisbane.' It's believed there has suddenly been some movement in prestige properties in the area after several years of the market staying stagnant. The real estate agent says another Chinese buyer has just signed a contract for a $4.5 million property on similar acreage but on a smaller block in the area, but the house will most likely be knocked down and redeveloped. The Carrara property sold for $8.2 million to a Chinese investor has seven bedrooms . Critton Astras at Realty Special Projects says the Chinese have a good eye and look at the value of the property . Mr Critton says in the last two weeks he has also been contracted to sell a variety of villas, studios and eco cabins at the popular Couran Cove resort, on Stradbroke Island. The development by an American billionaire, which cost $150 million went into receivership two years ago and Brisbane businessman, Craig Dowling picked up the resort for a steal of less than $10 million. The last couple of years have been spent redeveloping the resort and a number of residences are now up for sale. 'Villas are from $200,000,' said Mr Critton, 'on the water, overlooking the marina.' 'You can only get there by boat but I've been contracted to market and sell them, which for that price you wouldn't be able to get land almost anywhere.'","Mansion of music industry guru Graham Hutchinson has sold for $8.2 million to a Chinese buyer .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday that he and President Barack Obama had 'no major differences' and there was no single reason for his resignation. Hagel said he simply came to the conclusion that it was the right time for him to step aside, and he leaves believing that he accomplished a great deal. The outgoing Pentagon chief's comments marked the first time he has responded to questions about his resignation since he submitted it Nov. 24. They come on the eve of Obama's plans to announce Hagel's successor and a day after a senior U.S. Army officer told MailOnline Hagel was 'relieved' to not have to shill for Obama anymore. Scroll down for video . Watch your back: Outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel wouldn't give a specific reason for his resignation today, again saying that it was a 'mutual decision' between he and President Barack Obama and they had 'no major differences' Asked directly whether he felt he was pressured to resign today, Hagel was not specific. He called it a 'mutual decision' with Obama based on one-on-one talks at the White House. Hagel said he and Obama had discussed the coming two years, the last of Obama's term, and saw what Hagel called 'another zone' of challenges ahead for the country. 'Leaders have to be wise enough to know that,' he said. 'We both came to the conclusion,' he said, referring to his private consultations with Obama, 'that I think the country was best served with new leadership. He thought it was (also), over at this institution after we had talked through it.' The Department of Defense insider who spoke with MailOnline on Wednesday said Hagel 'jumped at the chance to get out, and couldn't wait to announce it so things didn't go more to hell in Iraq and he’d get blamed for it.’ ‘No one wants to be disloyal,' he said. 'But also nobody wants to be on watch while the Defense Department weakens to the point of disintegrating, and America gets pushed around the [global] schoolyard. It’s embarrassing.’ Another Hagel confidante told CNN on Wednesday that the Pentagon head 'wanted to move quickly' toward the exit. Juxtaposed with the international turmoil that's arisen since he vacated his Senate seat to join the Obama administration less than two years ago, CNN's source said Hagel want to 'at least control his departure.' Arizona Sen. John McCain said in a radio interview last month that Hagel was 'very, very frustrated' by the time he put in his notice. In this February 2013 photo, then-Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is pictured testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey. Obama is expected to nominate Carter tomorrow to serve as the next secretary of defense . When Obama announced that Hagel was leaving, he called the former Republican senator from Nebraska an 'exemplary' Pentagon chief and indicated that resigning was Hagel's decision. He said Hagel approached him and 'determined that ... it was an appropriate time for him to complete his service.' 'Let me just say that Chuck is and has been a great friend of mine. I've known him, admired him and trusted him for nearly a decade since I was a green-behind-the- ears freshman senator and we were both on the Senate Foreign Relations committee,' Obama told reporters gathered in the White House State Dining Room. It was at a press briefing later that day that the White House said Hagel's departure came after he and Hagel came to the decision jointly. 'The two of them arrived together at the determination that new leadership should take over at the Pentagon,' Earnest told reporters. Rumors immediately began swirling that Hagel was asked to leave, however. A senior Pentagon official told NBC News that Hagel 'wasn’t up to the job.' While denying that Hagel was forced out, the White House acknowledged last month that the issues plaguing the Pentagon require a different type of leadership skills than the ones Hagel was brought on to handle. 'When Secretary Hagel was first nominated for this job.....the threat that was posed by ISIL was not nearly as significant as it is now,' Earnest told reporters. The White House says it will announce Hagel's replacement on Friday. Obama is widely to expected to name former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as Hagel's successor. The White House wouldn't confirm to reporters this week that Carter was Obama's pick, but Earnest lavished praised on him when probed by reporters for his thoughts of the former DOD official. Earnest said Carter 'certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government,' but insisted, 'I don't have any additional insight to share with you.' Carter left the Obama administration in 2013. Unlike Hagel, he has never served in the active military, but he is respected by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. He served as the No. 2 official at the Pentagon from October 2011 to December 2013. He also used to be the Pentagon's chief arms buyer. He has been mum since rumors began swirling that he would be the next Defense Secretary.","Hagel hasn't spoken out since he submitted his resignation on Nov. 24 .

"A cyclist who wanted to travel the world on a shoestring has returned home from a four-year adventure which saw him pedal 43,000 miles across 61 countries - the equivalent of twice around the planet. Charlie Walker, 27, spent 1,606 days cycling through three continents on his second-hand bike 'Old Geoff' - despite 'not really being a cyclist'. The young travel writer headed north to the Arctic Circle, down to the southern tip of Africa, to the far east of Asia and into the jungles of Vietnam. Scroll down for video . Charlie Walker, 27, spent 1,606 days cycling through three continents on his second-hand bike 'Old Geoff' - despite 'not really being a cyclist'. Pictured: Mr Walker outside a village shop in Hubei Province, China . The young travel writer was away for four years and cycled through 60 countries, including Turkey (pictured on the road to Noah's Arc) Mr Walker cycled north to the Arctic Circle, down to the southern tip of Africa, to the far east of Asia and into the jungles of Vietnam. Pictured: The cyclist looks over the Fish River Canyon, Namibia . The 27-year-old (pictured) started his journey in July 2010 because he wanted to see the world in a 'cheap and slow' way . During his trip, Mr Walker found himself chased by elephants, arrested in China and even had to run the gauntlet of a war zone in northern Mozambique. Now, after four years on the road, Charlie has finally crossed the finish line in his home village of Bowerchalke, Wiltshire. Mr Walker said: 'I hadn't sat on a bike for a couple of months prior to starting so I had to get used to it again. 'I'm not really a cyclist, the bicycle was a conveniently cheap and deliberately slow means to an end. 'The end being to see the world, meet interesting people and to challenge myself both physically and mentally. Hopefully, I've learnt a thing or two along the way too. 'I cycled out of my village, took a ferry across the channel then didn't stop. I flew a few times over war spots for safety, but other than that, I rode most places.' This map shows the 43,600 mile route that Mr Walker carried out solo on his second-hand bike. He covered Europe, Africa and Asia . Mr Walker is watched by young locals as he fixes his bike in Uttar Pradesh, India (left) after having reached Norpkapp, Norway (right) The young adventurer also reached Cape Agulhas, the southern-most tip of Africa, West Cape Province during his travels . During his trip, Mr Walker cycled through difficult and varied terrain, including through the Kurish mountains (pictured) Mr Walker, a Newcastle University graduate, had the idea to take on the challenge while trekking through the Himalayas in 2008. He originally decided to cycle from the Dead Sea to Mount Everest. But the route quickly snowballed and soon Mr Walker had quadrupled the length of his route. Before setting off in July 2010, the travel writer finally decided on three main points to cross off his list - Nordkaap in Norway; Singapore via the bridge from mainland Malaysia, and Cape Town in South Africa. He left the route to 'chance', covering the incredible 43,630 miles depending on where the road took him. He did little planning and relied on the kindness of strangers. The cyclist left the route to 'chance', covering the incredible 43,630miles depending on where the road took him. Pictured: Mr Walker cycles through north west Tanzania as a storm approaches . But Mr Walker also had his fair share of trouble, including being arrested in China (where he is pictured, in Henan Province) Mr Walker takes a breather in front of a spectacular sunset on the empty road to Karima, northern Sudan, during the latter part of his journey . The cyclist was faced with clogged brakes and wheels after travelling through a forest track in the Republic of Congo (pictured) But Mr Walker also had his fair share of trouble. In Iran he was held on suspicion of being a spy, while he was mistaken for Jesus while in Africa. In China, he was arrested twice after breaking into a Tibetan military base. And in Botswana, he was chased down 'elephant highway' by a group of elephants who were not used to seeing two-wheeled vehicles. Mr Walker also battled searing heat, freezing cold, endless miles of pedalling, an attempt to steal his beloved second-hand bike, called 'Old Geoff', and mended more than 250 punctures. He said: 'I have a lot of stand out memories but one has to be how nice and hospitable people are. The young man even got to have a brew with Father Christmas when he visited Finnish Lapland .

'There were of course the dangerous times, and the times you don't think you're going to make it. 'I was detained at the boarder between Afghanistan and Iran because they thought, after looking at me, my passport and some of the pictures I had taken I might be a spy. 'They put two and two together and made 12, but they released me soon after. In Botswana I was chased by elephants on a road aptly named ""elephant highway"". 'The elephants just graze by the side of the road and they are used to vehicles driving past them, but they don't see so many bicycles. 'It's an animal shape moving at speed on wheels, they were bound to get a bit jumpy. 'I had a large bull elephant stand there and face up to me flapping his ears before he began chasing towards me. 'I had a heavily laden bicycle that probably weighed about as much as me. 'It was a little bit frantic, there were a good few miles I didn't look behind me and just keep pedalling.' As his epic journey grew bigger Charlie's regular blogs, updating his friends and family of his adventures, gathered a devoted following. Mr Walker camped under the stars on several nights, including here at Dune 45 camp in Namibia . The cyclist gets off his bike as he passes as ovoo - a Shamanistic cairn - in the Gobi north of Zamyn-Uud, Mongolia . He took some time out of his cycling schedule to enjoy the calm of Lake Pokhara, Nepal (pictured) Through his updates he persuaded people to donate to two charities to support his adventure. He chose Future Hope, which supports street children in Kolkatta, India, and the RNLI. Mr Walker said his biggest battle during his four year challenge, was the mental battle he faced. He said: 'I had been travelling for a bit for a few years before and my trips got slowly more intrepid. I wanted to develop myself as a travel writer, so when I finished university and got a job I saved up enough to go. 'Thelast few years have certainly been tough, and often lonely but, on balance, an incredible and positive experience.'

"Some 100 brains specimens which went missing from The University of Texas nearly 30 years ago have been found. The samples -  about half of the university's collection which were preserved in jars of formaldehyde - disappeared from a facility in Austin in the 1990s. They were discovered this week at a university building in San Antonio. The University of Texas at Austin has found its 100 missing brain samples at another facility in San Antonio (stock image) Timothy Schallert, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at UT in Austin, told the Los Angeles Times: 'They have the brains. They read a media report of the missing brains and they called to say: ''We got those brains!''' The professor said he believed that the brains had been well cared for. His colleague, Professor Lawrence Cormack, had earlier said that students could have stolen the brains as a prank. One of the missing brains belonged to clock tower sniper Charles Whitman (pictured) The brains were provided from patients at the state mental hospital for research on diseases including Alzheimer's. The Austin State Hospital had transferred the brains to the university about 28 years ago under a 'temporary possession' agreement. The psychology lab only had room for 100 brains, so the rest were moved to the basement of the university's Animal Resources Center. The story came to light this week after a book was published called 'Malformed: Forgotten Brains of the Texas State Mental Hospital' by Adam Voorhes and Alex Hannaford. One of the missing brains reportedly belonged to Austin University clock tower sniper Charles Whitman. Whitman's 1966 rampage at the University of Texas killed 16 people, including his mother and wife, and wounded 32 others . The 100 remaining brains at the Austin school have been moved to the Norman Hackerman Building, where they are being scanned with high-resolution resonance imaging equipment. Mr Cormack said: 'These MRI images will be both useful teaching and research tools. It keeps the brains intact.'

"North Korea's public officials are the most corrupt in the world with bribery, counterfeit medicine and backdoor payments just some of the consequences of its crooked institutions, according to a new study. Experts have assessed the public sectors of countries across the globe and placed the authoritarian state dead last, tied with Somalia, when compared to the rest of the world. The two countries both received their ranking of 174th - with eight points out of a possible 100 - after  factors of corruption within all countries were indexed. In first place with the world's most honest officials was Denmark, on a score of 92, followed by New Zealand, which scored 91. Click on the map to see your country's score . North Korea (pictured) is the worst in the world for public official corruption, which includes bribery, backdoor payments and a lack of public accountability . Somalia was tied in last place with North Korea in the rankings. Pictured is Mogadishu, the country's capital . Because bribery and backdoor payments are by nature conducted in a clandestine manner, it remains impossible to accurately assess a country's level of corruption. Instead, Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index assesses perceptions of corruption  across every country. This includes public officials' accountability to the public, their likelihood to accept bribes or exploit their position for personal gain, and to what extent rogue officials are prosecuted by their country's justice system. Britain was ranked 14th in the study, behind Europe's Scandinavian countries, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany. Its total points tally was 78, showing an improvement of four points since 2012. Across the Atlantic, the U.S. was ranked 17th on 74 points, trailing Canada by seven places but showing a vastly better score than every other country on its continent. Many of the Central and South American states fared poorly, with Venezuela, Honduras and Haiti among the worst. Denmark (pictured) topped the list with the world's most honest officials. The country came first with a score of 92 points out of a possible 100 . Jose Ugaz, the chair of Transparency International, said leading institutions in the U.S. and Europe needed to work with fast growing economies to hold the corrupt to account. He said: 'Corrupt officials smuggle ill-gotten assets into safe havens through offshore companies with absolute impunity. 'Countries at the bottom need to adopt radical anti-corruption measures in favour of their people. 'Countries at the top of the index should make sure they don’t export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries.' In second place, one point behind Denmark, was New Zealand. Pictured is the view of Dunedin in the South Island . 1. Denmark, 92 points . 2. New Zealand, 91 points . 3. Finland, 89 points . 4. Sweden, 87 points . 5. Norway, 86 points . 5.

Somalia, 8 points . Mr Ugaz warned of the dire consequences of corruption, which he said included the denial of basic human rights and prevention of economic development. 'Grand corruption in big economies not only blocks basic human rights for the poorest but also creates governance problems and instability. 'Fast-growing economies whose governments refuse to be transparent and tolerate corruption, create a culture of impunity in which corruption thrives.'","North Korea and Somalia have the world's most corrupt public officials .

"Dubai International announced it is set to clock up more than 71 million passengers by the end of the year and could overtake the current busiest airport in the world - Heathrow. Passenger traffic at Dubai International rose 5.7 per cent in October putting the airport on track to eclipse the 71 million passenger mark according to the latest traffic report issued by operator Dubai Airports. Passenger traffic in October totalled 5,989,007 compared to 5,667,698 recorded in the corresponding month last year, an increase of 5.7 per cent. Year to date traffic rose 6.1 per cent to 58,411,554 compared to 55,046,863 recorded during the same period in 2013. Passenger traffic at Dubai International rose by 5.7 per cent in October compared to the same month in 2013 . Passenger numbers for Dubai International Airport are projected to reach 78.4 million in 2015 . 'We are on track to exceed 71 million passengers by year-end which is a remarkable number when you consider we lost the services of one or our runways for almost three months,' said Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports. 'We are neck-and-neck with London Heathrow in our race for the number one position coming down the home stretch. It is sure to be a photo finish.' Dubai Airports estimate passenger numbers are projected to reach 78.4 million in 2015 and 103.5 million by 2020. The Indian subcontinent was the top market in terms of growth in overall passenger numbers (+121,669 passengers) closely followed by Western Europe (113,032 passengers), Asia (+73,675) and Africa (31,405). Dubai International estimate that they will eclipse 71 million passengers by the end of 2014 . In terms of percentage growth Eastern Europe (+22 per cent) was the strongest market followed by Asia (15.4 per cent) while declines were recorded in Russia & CIS (-8.2 per cent), AGGC (-3.7 per cent) and Middle East (-3.2 per cent). Around 72.3 million passengers travelled through Heathrow last year, with 191,200 passengers arriving or departing every single day. A recent study has shown that aviation will account for more than a third of Dubai's economy by 2020, as the Gulf emirate has become a major international travel hub. Oil-poor Dubai has spent years trying to diversify its economy with core sectors now including trade, transport and tourism. Aviation contributed 27 percent - or $26.7 billion (21.4 billion euros) - to Dubai's gross domestic product in 2013, Oxford Economics said in a report for Emirates Airline and Dubai Airports. Number of terminals - 5 . Number of runways - 2 . Total passenger destinations served by Dubai International - 180 . Number of airlines - 82 . Number of passengers arriving and departing in 2013 - 72.3 million . Cargo tonnage in 2013: 1.42 million metric tonnes . Number of terminals - 3 . Number of runways - 2 . Total passenger destinations served by Dubai International - 239 . Number of airlines - 105 . Number of passengers arriving and departing in 2013 - 66.4 million . Cargo tonnage in 2013: 2.44 million metric tonnes . Heathrow Airport remains the world's busiest, but is Dubai International set to take the crown? The report said the sector would grow to contribute £33.9 billion ($53.1 billion) -- equivalent to 37.5 per cent of GDP -- by 2020. 'Between now and 2020 the contribution of the aviation sector to Dubai's economy is expected to grow at a faster rate than the economy as a whole,' the global research firm said. An increase in passenger numbers and expansion of Dubai's existing airport capacity will help to drive this growth, the report said. Dubai International Airport is the busiest airport in the Middle East. It served 66.4 million passengers in 2013, and is expected to host more than 100 million in 2020. Also ranked among the world's busiest airports, Dubai International has established itself as a major hub linking the West with Asia and Australasia. The emirate opened its second passenger airport in October 2013. When complete, Al-Maktoum International will handle 120 million passengers annually. Government-owned Emirates Airline, which is based at Dubai International, carried 44.5 million passengers in 2013, compared with 39.4 million the previous year. The airline operates the world's largest fleets of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s, and flies to 146 destinations in 83 countries.","Dubai Airports reveals 6.1% year-on-year increase in passengers .

"Sir Bradley Wiggins cycling success is believed to be behind the increase in middle-age men buying bicycles . You can perhaps blame cycling knight Bradley Wiggins for them clogging up the country roads every weekend. Now MAMILs – or middle-aged men in Lycra, to give them their full name - have pedalled into the latest edition of the online Oxford Dictionary too. It defines as a MAMIL as 'a middle-aged man who is a very keen road cyclist, typically one who rides an expensive bike and wears the type of clothing associated with professional cyclists'. The word is among 1,000 new entries added today(thurs) to the free online dictionary OxfordDictionaries.com, which is updated quarterly and prides itself on tracking new and emerging word trends. MAMIL has been in use since at least 2010 after research by retail analyst Mintel suggested there had been a surge in men of a certain age taking up cycling when they might once have invested in a motorcycle or sports car. The phenomenon of middle aged men buying an expensive bicycle then intensified after Sir Bradley's success in the Tour de France and Olympics in 2012. Celebrity fans of slipping on the Lycra and saddling up include actor and Spandau Ballet guitarist Gary Kemp, 55, who once said: 'I'm obsessed, I've done all the major routes of the Tour de France, including the hill climbs.' But while there is an amusing side to words such as MAMIL and other new entries like 'al desko', an adjective referring to eating while working at one's desk in an office, or 'fresh-air fiend', meaning a person who is very keen on outdoor activities, some other new entries have been criticised because they risk encouraging children to spell common words incorrectly. The Plain English Campaign said the inclusion of 'fone' (meaning phone), 'hawt' (a chiefly US spelling of hot), 'mahoosive' (meaning exceptionally big) and 'tomoz' (an informal version of tomorrow) could cause problems if youngsters see them and think those are the correct spellings. Another new entry is 'duck face', defined as 'an exaggerated pouting expression in which the lips are thrust outwards, typically made by a person posing for a photograph'. Yesterday(wed) Judy Pearsall, editorial director for Oxford Dictionaries, said: 'One of the benefits of our unique language monitoring programme is that it enables us to track in detail how English language evolves over relatively short periods of time. For instance, in this age of the selfie perhaps it's no surprise that average monthly usage of the term duck face is 35 per cent higher in 2014 than it was last year.' Now MAMILs – or middle-aged men in Lycra, has been added as a new word in the Oxford English Dictionary. Pictured Sir Bradley Wiggins . Finance and business remains a major influence on English, with many terms from there included in the online dictionary today for the first time too.

"A schoolboy died from major internal injuries after falling off a bike while speeding down a hill as he played with friends after school, an inquest heard today. Peter Mills-Coles, eight, was sent flying when he lent over to steer around a corner and his right pedal hit the ground on a residential street in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Both he and the bike were sent flying into the air, colliding either before or after Peter hit the ground, causing him severe internal injuries. Accident: Peter Mills-Coles, eight, (pictured left, and right) died from major internal injuries after falling off a bike while speeding down a hill  as he played with friends after school . Peter was rushed to hospital in Barnet but doctors were unable to save him and he died after the accident on May 19. He had been playing with a group of friends after school when the freak accident occurred, the inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard. The boy was taking a turn on a friend’s bike and had gone off for a ride around the block, as his friends had before him, but had not returned. One man living nearby had been in his garden when he heard a 'loud thump'  and went out to the road to investigate. 'He saw Peter lying on the grass verge on his side,' said coroner Edward Thomas. 'The bike was on its side next to a tree by next door’s garden.' Fast: Peter had been coming down this hill when he fell off his bike after trying to go around the bend . Play: Peter and his friends had taken it in turns to ride around the block, and he was taking this right-hand bend when he crashed . Police constable Robert Wagstaff, a collision investigator, told the hearing that while the bike was a 'bit scruffy', the brakes, steering and wheels were all in good working order. There were no potholes or any problems with the road surface where Peter fell off the bike and no other vehicles were involved. Pc Wagstaff said: 'Where he fell there was a decline and there’s a right-hand bend that he tried to negotiate. 'The right pedal is down, that’s made contact with the ground and the bike and rider were launched.' The speed Peter was riding at meant he would have had to lean quite far over to get around the bend, PC Wagstaff added. Results from a post-mortem examination showed Peter had suffered massive internal bleeding from a liver laceration. Neighbours had looked after Peter until ambulance staff arrived at around 5.30pm to take him to hospital. Mr Thomas said he was really impressed with the responses from passers-by. 'I think the feeling of a lot of people was that they wished they could have done more,' he said. 'I really want to reassure them that they did everything right - there was nothing more they could have done.' Peter was a year three pupil at Summerswood Primary School in Borehamwood. His school released a tribute, saying: 'Peter is much loved and will always be remembered by all his friends and everyone at Summerswood. 'He was a popular member of his class and was always recognisable by his cheeky smile. His parents Christopher and Angela were not at today's hearing. Mr Thomas added: 'I just felt so very sad for Peter. 'I think all of us remember as children riding our bikes. I remember falling off my bike. 'They were just having such a nice time, just having a little spin around and just a slight misjudgement down quite a steep hill with the pedal, and that’s the jolt. 'No other vehicles had any bearing on this at all. 'I’m going to record that Peter died an accidental death and that concludes the investigation into this awful tragedy.' Speaking to the family liaison officer representing Peter’s family, Mr Thomas said: 'Can you please pass on how sorry we all were? 'What a nice young boy he was. Poor Peter.'","Peter Mills-Coles was playing on his friend's bike in Borehamwood .

"There is a speech which George Osborne hoped to deliver today which will have to remain in the Treasury drawer for a few years yet. It is the one where the Chancellor declares that the deficit has been eliminated and the government is raising more in tax than it spends. In 2010 Mr Osborne confidently declared that he would balance the books by 2014-15, but today he was forced admit that borrowing remains stubbornly high and balancing the books is still a long way off. In June 2010, the Office for Budget for Responsibility predicted that in 2014-15 borrowing would fall to just £37billion, but it has remained high at around £100billion and is not expected to return a surplus until 2018-19 . In 2010 George Osborne remained confident that borrowing would fall sharply, but in 2011 and 2012 a deterioration in the economic picture meant the prospect of balancing the books slipped further into the future . In 2010, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that borrowing would be just £37billion in 2014-15. Instead it will be £91.3billion, which is still £5billion higher than the OBR predicted in March this year. While there are record numbers of people in work, many are in low paid jobs. These workers have benefitted most from the coalition policy of not paying income on the first £10,000 of earnings. But it means the Treasury is raising less than expected from taxes to offset spending. Four years ago in June 2010 Mr Osborne boasted that he would have 'eliminated' the deficit by 2014-15. 'We have set the course for a balanced budget and falling national debt by the end of this Parliament,' he predicted in the Coalition's emergency budget. Instead borrowing has remained stubbornly high, and barely changed in the last 12 months. Revealing that the deficit has been halved over this Parliament, Mr Osborne said the OBR now forecasts the deficit will fall slightly from £97.5 billion last year to £91.3 billion this year - rather than the £86.4billion previously expected. Mr Osborne will boast that the economy is now growing strongly, and faster than most other countries. But its has failed to keep pace with the predictions made in 2010 . National debt as a proportion of the economy (GDP) was supposed to start falling in 2013-14, but has instead been rising and is not expected to peak until next year . Borrowing for 2015-16 is expected to fall to £75.9 billion, worse than the £68.3 billion previously expected. But the outlook for 2016-17 of a £40.9 billion shortfall is better than the £41.5billion previously set out. For 2017-18 expected borrowing is likely to be £14.5billion, an improvement on the previously pencilled-in £15.8 billion. Mr Osborne told MPs that by 2019-20 the UK will be spending £23billion less than it raises in tax. 'Out of the red and into the black for the first time in a generation - a country that inspires confidence around the world because it seeks to live within its means,' he added. It still means that the country will not be in a position where it is spending less than it raises in tax, until 2018-19 - a decade after the financial crash. The OBR said: 'Despite stronger growth, we have revised up our estimate of the budget deficit this year. 'In headline terms, the UK economy has outperformed our March forecast. 'But wage and productivity growth have once again disappointed, while national income and spending have outperformed most in those areas that yield least tax revenue.' Several times Mr Osborne claimed that he had brought the British economy back from the brink over the last four years. The Chancellor used his Autumn Statement to plead for time to 'finish the job', warning a change of course now would 'squander' prosperity. Four years ago the OBR hoped for strong growth in pay, but low wages have persisted and have only just started to outstrip inflation . He revealed growth in this year is now expected to hit 3 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent forecast in March this year. And he told MPs that under the coalition, Britain has created 1,000 jobs every day since 2010. But in future years, growth is forecast to be lower than previously thought. The OBR now it forecasts growth of 2.4 per cent in 2015, 2.2 per cent in 2016, then 2.4 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent in subsequent years. Unemployment has also fallen sharply, dropping to just 6 per cent for the first time since autumn 2008. Pay is also rising faster than the cost of living for the first time in five years. Average earnings are 1.3 per cent higher than a year ago, compared to inflation running at 1.2 per cent, with workers in the private sector enjoying even higher pay rises. The OBR predicts wages will rise by 1.8 per cent this year, 2 per cent next year and 3.1 per cent in 2016. Employment has surged above expectations, breaking through 30million a year earlier than expected. Latest figures show there are 30.8million in work, a figure which was not expected to be reached until 2016. With total debt still rising to the vicinity of £1.4 trillion, Mr Osborne is set to have borrowed more in five years at the Treasury than Labour chancellors did in 13. Time and again the Chancellor has seen the economic forecasts shift, with hopes of balancing the books drifting further into the future. Britain will still not be back in the black, spending less than it raises in tax, until 2018-19, a decade after the financial crash. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: 'It's all here in black and white, hard evidence from the Budget for Responsibility that the Chancellor's borrowing targets are all in tatters. 'We all know he's changed the way he styles his hair but he can't brush away the facts. People are worse off and he's failed to balance the books in this Parliament. 'I've got to say, for all his strutting, for all his preening, for all his claims to have fixed the economy, he promised to make people better off, working people are worse off. 'He promised we were all in this together and he cut taxes for millionaires. He promised to balance the books in this Parliament and that commitment is now in tatters. Every target missed, every test failed, every promise broken.'","In 2010, Osborne boasted he would have 'eliminated' the deficit by 2014-15 .
But new figures show Britain will borrow around £91billion this year .
Treasury is raising less in income tax than thought earlier this year .

"Earlier this year globally acclaimed artist Guo Jian was exiled from China. His arrest came after police forced the 42-year-old to destroy his most iconic work, an apocalyptic diorama of Tiananmen Square which he slathered with ground pork meat. Jian, Chinese born but a naturalised Australian, returned to Sydney in June after being detained for two weeks in Beijing, and he is now working on his first post-exile exhibition in New York. Guo Jian's artwork 'The Square' is a huge diorama of the Beijing landmark Tiananmen Square which he slathered with ground pork meat . Jian, (L) , walks to a police car in his from his studio in Beijing after he collecting his personal belongings. 20 police arrived to his studio in the middle of the night and forced him to smash the controversial artwork . The remains of the artwork, which police forced the 42-year-old to destroy with a hammer . Recalling the night of his arrest, the artist said he feared for his life when a mob of 20 police arrived at his studio in eastern Beijing to question him over the artwork. 'I was terrified. It was the middle of the night and nobody else was there; I thought they were going to make me disappear,' he said. 'They forced me to smash the sculpture with a hammer and filmed me doing it. There was at least 20 of them, so I could hardly say no.' Jian says 'The Square' represents the rapid urbanisation of China, a process which frequently sees cultural landmarks demolished. 'I wanted to show that nothing was safe if we continue down this road, not even the strongest symbols of Chinese culture. The meat was a  sign that  everything will go rotten' he said. But he says the Chinese government did not take kindly to his interpretation of the Beijing landmark. Chinese-born Australian artist Guo Jian is greeted by friends as he arrives at Sydney Airport in June, after being exiled for five years from China . Jian is adamant that it was the international coverage of 'The Square' that sparked his exile from China, while the Chinese government claims it was due to 'visa irregularities' Tiananmen Square was the site of a notorious massacre Jian himself witnessed in 1989, which saw the Chinese military open fire on thousands of pro-democracy protesters, killing an undisclosed number. Jian's arrest came days before the 25th anniversary of the event, a time when the Chinese government was arresting scores of activists and artists in what could be viewed as a crackdown on dissent. A spokeswoman for the Department of Foreign Affairs told The Australian Jian had been deported, 'reportedly due to visa irregularities'. But Jian is adamant his visa was legitimate, and instead insisted that it was the international coverage of the artwork by news services such as the New York Times and the BBC that sparked the ordeal. 'I think 'The Square' was the last straw. Even though it never left my studio, the Government had been watching me for a long time, even in Australia,' he said. 'When the artwork gained exposure they decided to draw the line.' Jian says he has no regrets about the artwork, despite being separated from his family over the ordeal . Jian says he has been blacklisted by the government and would be harshly monitored by government officials if he ever returns . When he arrived at prison, Jian says he was interrogated for five hours before being taken into a squalid cell. 'There was one toilet between fifteen men, and the bedding they gave me probably hadn't been washed in years,' he said. But he says the worst of the experience was psychological. 'The worst of it was the mind games. They threaten you and film you all the time to make you paranoid. They never beat me, but they did (beat) some inmates.' Jian spent his two weeks in jail speaking to other prisoners and learning their stories. When the short sentence was up, he was whisked to the airport and told he could not  return for at least five years. 'At first I was annoyed  because they lied until the last minute. I have been dislodged from my family. But when I look at what is going on with the Chinese government cracking down on artists and activists, I feel like it would be too dangerous for me to return now.' Jian says he has been blacklisted and would be harshly monitored by government officials if he ever returned. However he told ABC he has no regrets about making 'The Square.' 'This make me feel more strong and it gives me the strength to do my art, and also I feel that I should keep going, to make people to know I'm still standing, even after these things happen to me, nothing can really knock me down.' Jian says the experience gave him the strength to continue his art and show people 'nothing can knock me down' Jian (second from left) filming a documentary for his newest exhibition #SURRENDER, which he describes as 'a grassroots cry for non-violence' Instead, Jian is now working on his first post exile exhibition, a multidimensional project titled #SURRENDER. Jian says the message is 'a grassroots cry for non-violence. We are living in an era of immense violence,' he said. 'Between ISIS, Ukraine and Gaza, there is a real militarism resurgence. I feel we need an anti-militant resistance.' The multimedia exhibition features a war memorial and a documentary about its creation. The exhibition is set to open in early February 2015, and continue through  March.

"A New Jersey man was convicted of murder on Thursday for bludgeoning his wife with a frying pan then strangling her, apparently after they argued over the dire state of their finances. Former securities salesman Patrick Allen had been trying to hide the family's financial difficulties from his wife, Kimberly, before the argument that led to her death in 2011, prosecutors said. Allen, 47, of Middletown, had been concealing the fact that they were about to lose their home to foreclosure, prosecutors said. Convicted: Patrick Allen sits in Judge John T. Mullaney's courtroom where he was found guilty on Thursday of murdering his wife with a frying pan in 2011 . He also had more than $600,000 in debt, between two mortgages on the family's house and $25,000 in credit card debt, they said. Prosecutors claimed an argument ensued when his wife learned of the situation and Allen killed her while the couple's two children were at school. Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Maria Franceschini said she was pleased with the verdict. 'It's been a long trial,' she said. In her closing statement Wednesday, she picked up the frying pan wrapped in plastic and swung it to show jurors how Allen struck his wife over the head. She then showed jurors autopsy photos showing the result of Kimberly Allen being struck by the frying pan. Allen's attorney argued his client was about to come into some money that would have held off the foreclosure. He also claimed a mistrial should have been declared in the case because prosecutors on the eve of trial said they would not use interview footage of Allen, but changed their minds mid-trial and showed the footage to jurors. The lawyer said he would consult with his client about a possible appeal. The victim's sister, Barbara Stauff, held back tears as she thanked jurors and prosecutors for 'countless hours over the past three years' analyzing the evidence, The Asbury Park Press  reported. Allen was convicted of first-degree murder and other counts. He is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 29.

"Australians are set to spend big on this year's Christmas groceries, with the average expenditure figure doubling since 2012. An estimated $1.3 billion is expected to be spent on festive produce with a family bill of about $341.90, according to a survey by supermarket chain Aldi. While popular products for modern Aussie families still remain to be prawns and a leg of ham, it is believed food options have become more lavish in recent years. Australians are set to spend big on this year's Christmas groceries, with the average expenditure figure doubling since 2012 . While popular products for modern Aussie families still remain to be prawns and a leg of ham, it is believed food options have become more luxurious in recent years . A smorgasbord if more modern delicacies such as lobster tails and luxury salads are becoming customary staples on the Christmas table. Almost half of the 1,000 surveyed mums - 43 per cent - say food options have become more up market compared since 10 years ago. The survey also reveals social and food occasions are becoming more popular while the significance of gifts is on the decline. As a result, Aussie are spending more during the Christmas season as they're celebrating over a longer period of time compared to a decade ago. They include picnics at carol singing events, family gatherings at the beach and decorating the house or tree. Back in 2012, Christmas celebrations were shorter and families spent an average of $170. Most mothers said they try to save money by keeping an eye out for special deals and stocking up during the weeks before Christmas . But there are distinct trends for being thrifty, as most mothers say they save money by keeping an eye out for special deals, stocking up during the weeks before Christmas or by doing the Christmas shop gradually. This comes after a global Christmas survey of over 12,000 people by Groupon showed that 35 per cent of Australians admitted they buy gifts out of pure obligation. The average Australian will not only purchase at least three obli-gifts this Christmas season, but they'll spend about $150 doing so, amounting to $855 million worth of obli-gifts being received across the country. At least 57 per cent of Australians, most of them no doubt on the receiving end of an obli-gift, admitted to re-gifting an unwanted present. Meanwhile, about 55 per cent of respondents who forgot someone on their present list, confess that they prefer to lie, with the most popular excuse being that the receivers non-existent present had been bought online, with the post office copping the blame.","In 2012 the average Australian family spent about $170 .

"Bryan Kryscio who is accused of stealing an ambulance from a hospital and then telling police he took it to drive to a strip club . A man who is accused of stealing an ambulance from a hospital in Michigan told police when he was arrested that he took the vehicle so he could drive to a strip club. Bryan Kryscio was arrested on Sunday after he was found behind the wheel of the emergency vehicle when police pulled him over. But when they asked him why he took the ambulance he told them he was on his way to a pole dancing club. Earlier in the evening, officers had been called to McLaren Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, after reports that an ambulance was taken after it was left outside unlocked with the engine running. According to foxdc.com, emergency workers were returning a stretcher to the ambulance when they saw it being driven off. One of the ambulance workers had left their cell phone inside and officers were able to use it to trace the vehicle to Sterling Heights, 14 miles away. Krysico, who is homeless and said to have mental health issues, was then found behind the wheel and immediately arrested. When officers then asked him why he took the ambulance, he told them he was on his way to the 'Booby Trap', a topless bar in Detroit to see pole dancing, even though the club has been closed for years. Police confirmed that even though the ambulance had been taken there wasn't any damage and it was returned to the emergency services. Undersheriff Mike McCabe of Oakland County Police told the Detroit Free Press: 'The caller advised that the ambulance was not locked and that a cellular phone had been left inside. 'The medication box, EMS radio and EKG monitor were all intact.' Officers had been called to McLaren Oakland Hospital in Pontiac, Michigan, pictured, earlier in the evening after staff reported the theft of an ambulance . Police also added that he has convictions for robbery in Florida, as well as breaking and entering, trespassing and possession of marijuana convictions in Michigan. Kryscio, 50, was arraigned yesterday on a charge of unlawfully driving away an automobile and is currently being held at Oakland County Jail. He is scheduled to appear at Pontiac District Court later this month.","Police were called after an ambulance was stolen from a Michigan hospital .

"The transgender son who sparked a social media storm after his parents placed an amended birth notice in the newspaper says the moment he told his mother he was a boy was nothing special. Kai Bogert, 19, said his mother accepted it with little fanfare and he described the event as 'extremely boring' and 'dull'. 'She said ""Oh you're trans"" and I said ""Yeah"" and she went ""Oh cool"", got up, gave me a hug and again went back to playing World of Warcraft,' Kai told The Today Show. Scroll down for video .

Kai's mother Yolanda Bogert, who put the notice in the December 2 edition of The Courier Mail to correct their 'mistake' at announcing the birth of their daughter, agreed. 'It wasn't a big deal it wasn't anything,' Ms Bogert said. 'The social media hype's gone crazy but the moment itself wasn't very big.' Ms Bogert said she placed the ad because she wanted to celebrate Kai's revelation. 'Somehow it just seemed like this big moment for him needed something to market, something he could keep,' she said. The 19-year-old, from Brisbane, born Elizabeth Anne now identifies as a man and goes by the name of Kai Bogert. 'In 1995 we announced the arrival of our sprogget, Elizabeth Anne, as a daughter,' the loving message read. 'He informs us that we were mistaken. Oops! Our bad.

Kepler, 54, was formally charged on August 18 by Tulsa prosecutors with the August 5 killing of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake, who was dating his daughter Lisa. He was also charged with one count of shooting with intent to kill because prosecutors said he shot at his daughter during an alleged confrontation. Kepler pleaded not guilty and was released from jail on a $825,000 bond. He was suspended without pay at the time of the shooting - but is now eligible to collect both the lump sum, and begin drawing his monthly pension. His retirement officially began on November 1. Kepler chose to participate in the state's deferred option pension plan in 2010. This allowed him to collect approximately four years' worth of monthly pension payments, plus interest, in a lump sum on retirement, the Tulsa World reports. Records show his monthly pension is $2,947, and the plan has a minimum interest rate of 7.5 per cent, bringing the lump sum total to approximately $162,000. A 2011 state law was introduced to close a loophole that allowed some government employees to collect pensions even if they were convicted of felonies. Jeremey Lake, 19, was allegedly shot dead by the father of his girlfriend, Lisa Kepler, 18, on August 5 . The law bars police officers and other municipal workers from collecting retirement pay if they plead guilty, no contest, or are convicted of a felony for bribery, corruption, forgery, perjury or 'any other crime related to their office or employment'. Steven Snyder, executive director of the Police Pension and Retirement board, told Tulsa World that Kepler would forfeit his monthly pension if convicted of a felony not resulting in a deferred sentence, but gets to keep his lump sum payment. Kepler's attorney, Richard O'Carroll, argues that he believes the law allows Kepler to keep his monthly payments as well. Kepler's wife, Gina Kepler, 48, also a Tulsa police officer, surrendered to authorities with him the morning after the shooting. She was arrested along with her husband on a complaint of being an accessory after the fact of murder, but was not charged because prosecutors said there wasn't evidence to support it. Kepler's wife, Gina, 48, also a police officer, was not charged as an accessory after the fact of murder . She too is on leave from the police, but with pay according to a spokesperson for the department. The Keplers 'are solid folks' who 'did everything they knew to protect their daughter,' O'Carroll said. The daughter, Lisa Kepler, was among three sisters whom the Keplers adopted from a troubled home. Lisa Kepler, 18, has said that her parents had kicked her out of their home in late July. She met Lake while he was volunteering at the shelter where she was staying. He offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, Kepler said. The young couple were walking to Lake's aunt's house on August 5 when her father turned up in his car. She said that he asked what she was doing in the neighborhood. When she walked away, Lake tried to introduce himself. The police officer then shot Lake two or three times, fled in his vehicle and later turned himself in, court records show. Lisa started to run and was shot at — but the bullet missed her, authorities said. The police officer fled in his vehicle, but later turned himself in. In an interview, Lisa Kepler told NBC that Lake was her 'everything'. She told Tulsa World: 'I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time.'

"The British businessman on trial for murdering his fiancee at a five-star hotel in Paris, had allegedly crashed his Mercedes into her house, and beat her up, just one month earlier, a court heard today. Ian Griffin, 45, drove his car into the £3million home of Kinga Legg, 36, in Oxshott, Surrey, just weeks before she was found dead in a hotel room in the French capital in 2009. Mr Griffin has been protesting his innocence in court, claiming Polish-born Ms Legg died by accident after she tried to  jump on him and ended up injuring her head when he kicked her off. On trial: British businessman Ian Griffin, 45, leaves the Criminal Court in Paris during a break in his trial for the 2009 murder of his fiancee Kinga Wolf, 36 . But Jane Carrigan, a friend of Ms Legg’s, told Paris Assizes: ‘On one occasion Kinga phoned me to say she has been badly beaten by Ian, and was in the bath trying to recover.’ ‘She told me that he had driven his Mercedes through the front door of the house, then he beat her and left. This was approximately one month prior to her death. ‘I was so worried about her, I asked her to contact the police and an ambulance to see what state she was in, because the next time she may be dead. She said no. The next thing I heard, she was dead.’ Griffin had caused £30,000-worth of damage to Ms Legg’s  house in Oxshott but he eventually moved in with her . Ms Legg’s lifeless body was covered in almost 100 bruises, and she had a fatal head injury, when it was found in the bath of the £1000 room in the Bristol Hotel in May 2009. Accused of murder: Ian Griffin is pictured with current fiancee Tracey Baker, who appeared on Dragon's Den . When Griffin found Ms Legg's body, he said he didn't realise she was dead at first, and put her in a bath to warm up while he placed a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door and cleaned the room . Mr Griffin, 45, drove his car into the front door of Ms Legg's £3million home  in Oxshott, Surrey, just weeks before she was found dead in a hotel room in the French capital in 2009 . Ms Carrigan, who was with Ms Legg when she first met Griffin in a Cheshire wine bar in the 1990s, said her friend was unlikely to have attacked anyone. ‘Kinga was not aggressive. In all the years I’ve known her, I’ve never seen her hurt anyone. She was one of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met.’ Ms Carrigan said Griffin was drinking up to three bottles of wine a day and she had seen Legg give him £20,000 to spend, and a credit card. Guillaume Trayard, the barrister representing Ms Legg’s Polish family, said: ‘Did this love she had for Griffin place her under his power and grip?’, and Ms Carrigan replied: ‘Yes’. In turn, Griffin told the court he was sleeping with other women, and Ms Legg became abusive on drink and medication. ‘Kinga would drink at nine o’clock in the morning,’ said Griffin. ‘In our lives, Kinga would open a bottle of champagne at any time of the morning.’ Asked why he hadn’t left Ms Legg following earlier fights, Griffin said: ‘When you love somebody, and get on really well, and some of it was my fault, you don’t.’ Referring back to his regularly physical arguments with Ms Legg, Griffin said: ‘Kinga would throw herself on top of me, and I would kick back with my feet. ‘If Kinga jumped on me, I kicked out and she would land on her back, that would always happen. ‘It would always start when she ran at me, and I would kick her off. I’m only going on history, I don’t know what happened on the night. Historically, she would fall back on the table or on to a TV.’ Griffin says he argued with Ms Legg in the bedroom of the five-star Bristol Hotel, Paris (pictured), but blacked out. When he woke he claims he found blood on the sheets, but had no memory of attacking Ms Legg . The prosecutor, Philippe Courroye, interjected at this point and, holding up a picture of Kinga’s dead body lying in the smashed up hotel room, said: ‘This isn’t history, she died from trauma to the head.’ Mr Courroye also asked Griffin to explain how Ms Legg ended up with so many defensive wounds, and Griffin said: ‘I can’t tell you. I don’t know if they were her jumping on me, or me jumping on her. I can’t remember’. Griffin, a former rugby player, is 6ft1in, and weighs more than 14 stone. He said Ms Legg was 5ft8ins, and weighed eight, but said she was ‘incredibly strong, she had a six pack because she took slimming tablets and was very sporty’. Asked why he had begun cleaning up the room when he woke up, rather than attending to Ms Legg’s dead body, Griffin said: ‘It’s hard to people to understand. It sounds stupid but all I focused on was the cleaning of the room. ‘I thought “Oh My God, there’s blood on the floor” but that was why I was so desperate. I didn’t know what to do.’ Ms Legg was later found floating in the bathtub of the couple's £1,000-a-night room with almost 100 bruises covering her body (file picture) Griffin said Ms Legg was used to attacking lovers, explaining: ‘Kinga did it to her last boyfriend. I’m not the only one. I realise things went too far, for too long. I’m terribly sorry, but it wasn’t me. Kinga was angry because I was leaving her.’ The prosecutor, Mr Courroye, again held up pictures of the Bristol room, saying: ‘She did this alone?’ Griffin replied; ‘No, but we were getting married. She was the most important person to me. I wouldn’t have done this.’ Ms Legg wrote an email in April 2009, a month before her death, accusing Griffin of being the violent one, saying: ‘I never had anyone who beat me, who threw me down on the ground, I’m afraid.’ Griffin insists his memory had blacked out when the couple return to their room at the Bristol following an argument in a restaurant about his poor sex drive, and he only recovered it after her death. He said he first met Ms Legg in a Cheshire wine bar ‘around 20 years ago’, and then the couple renewed their relationship in Sandbanks, Bournemouth, in 2008. At the time of the death, they had been dating for 12 months, and lived together in Ms Legg’s mansion. Griffin said: ‘We were like twins, we worked together, we had a fantastic time 95 per cent of the time. ‘She was somebody I just wanted to be with. When you meet someone who is special and makes you feel alive, you just want to be with her, but there were problems.’ Griffin’s trial is expected to end on Friday.

"The cost to Arizona taxpayers for Jodi Arias' defense now tops $2.7 million, and the figure will keep rising as her penalty phase retrial continues in a Phoenix courtroom. Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick released Thursday the amount billed so far by Arias' two court-appointed attorneys after the former waitress was unable to pay for her own defense. The figure is up more than $200,000 from the one released in late September. Scroll down for video . On trial this week: The cost to Arizona taxpayers for Jodi Arias' defense now tops $2.7 million, and the figure will keep rising as her penalty phase retrial continues in a Phoenix courtroom . Prosecutors have declined to provide their costs to try the case. Arias was convicted last year for brutally murdering her ex-boyfrined, Travis Alexander, in 2008 but jurors deadlocked on her punishment. During the murder, Alexander suffered nearly 30 knife wounds to his body, was shot in the head and had his throat slit so deeply he was almost decapitated. Arias initially denied any involvement - even calling Alexander in the days after the killing and leaving friendly messages on his voicemail. Under supervision: Arias stands next to her attorney, Jennifer Willmott,  during the sentencing phase at her trial at Maricopa County Superior Court in Phoenix on Thursday, December 4 . Ongoing case: Arias was convicted of murder last year in the 2008 killing of ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander but jurors were unable to agree on a sentence . But two years after her arrest, she eventually admitted to killing him - but said it was in self-defense. She said she recalled Alexander attacking her in fury for dropping his camera after a day of sex at his home. A new jury is now deciding her whether to sentence her to life in prison or death for the killing of Alexander. An appeals court decision last week overturned a ruling that closed the courtroom as Arias' first witness testified. Her lawyers previously said the witness would testify only in a closed courtroom. Some of the testimony in question was conducted in private. The Arizona Republic and three Phoenix TV stations - KPNX, KPHO and KTVK - protested the closure and ultimately succeeded in getting the ruling by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens thrown out. Flashback: Two years after her arrest, Aris (right) eventually admitted to killing her ex-boyfriend Alexander (left) - but said it was in self-defense . The Arizona Court of Appeals suggested in its ruling last week that the previously unidentified witness might have been Arias herself, though it remains unclear. The news organizations are now urging Stephens to release a transcript of the Oct. 30 testimony. The Arias case has been marked by secrecy since the conclusion of the first trial, where salacious and violent details about Arias and Alexander were broadcast live around the world. Since then, the judge has held one secret hearing after another and barred the broadcast of footage from the sentencing retrial until after a verdict is reached. Arias' lawyers had argued that daily broadcasts of the trial would lead to defense witnesses backing out for fear of being harassed or threatened.","A Maricopa County spokeswoman released Thursday the amount billed so far by Arias' two court-appointed attorneys .

"It must have seemed like such a good idea at the time to the European team’s brains trust, pairing the plucky local hero with the seasoned campaigner who can transform himself into Superman once every two years. Unfortunately, nine holes later, Stephen Gallacher and Ian Poulter seemed to be going through some sort of conscious uncoupling, as they fell four behind the youngest ever partnership to take to the course for an American Ryder Cup team. It was an example of Anglo-Scottish collaboration that would have appealed more to Alex Salmond than the Better Together campaign, and by the 14th green they were shaking hands with young tyros Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed. Europe's Ian Poulter assesses his options during the first day of the 2014 Ryder Cup on Friday . Ian Poulter comes out of a bunker on the third on Friday but could ultimately do little to help Europe . AFTERNOON FOURSOMES SCORES . 1315: Jamie Donaldson and Lee Westwood vs Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar - Europe 2UP after 18 . 1330: Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson vs Hunter Mahan and Zach Johnson - Europe win 2&1 . 1421: Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia vs Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler - A/S after 18 . 1436: Victor Dubuisson and Graeme McDowell vs Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley - Europe win 3&2 .

This looked like an example of modern sport’s tendency towards paralysis by analysis. Paul McGinley and his five vice-captains must have looked at this from a hundred different angles, and still managed to come up with a combination that simply did not work. Factors such as Gallacher feeling the pressure in this elevated company before a crowd that yearned for him to succeed, and of Poulter arriving here with desperately little form appeared to weigh heavily. As Spieth ventured afterwards, it was a major morale booster for the Americans to take down the local specialist and the man who has caused them so much misery in recent editions. Poulter even offered an unlikely note of introspection afterwards as he explained that the plan was always for him to sit out the afternoon foursomes instead of trying to play five matches. ‘Not many people have been able to play five and the reason is it’s very tiring,’ he said. ‘I’m 38, we’ve got some younger pups on the team that might be able to do it better than I can.’ Poulter should not be written off as three times before he has lost his first match before coming back to wreak damage. But he has never lost one as heavily as this, unable to contribute so much as a birdie in the course of a 5&4 defeat. By the time the Euro pair slightly revived after the turn, the huge galleries recognised the match as a lost cause and could not muster much in the way of support. Ian Poulter was unable to salvage anything for Europe on Friday morning, losing a tough 5&4 against USA . 7.35am: Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson v Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar . 7.50am: Jamie Donaldson and Lee Westwood v Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan . 8.05am: Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer v Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth . 8.20am: Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter v Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler . Many duos would have struggled against the Americans who, despite being the first US partnership both aged 25 or below, went round the first 11 holes in six under par, playing with the absence of fear that youth can bring. ‘When you’re playing against guys who are rolling putts in then they are going to be very hard to beat,’ said Poulter, who pointed out how they dovetailed. ‘They ham-and-egged very well. Obviously my record has been pretty good and has taken a dent. But this is a team game, not just about singling one or two guys out.’ You would need a heart of stone not to feel for Gallacher, who was followed round by his Ryder Cup legend uncle Bernard, lending his vast experience to his radio commentary duties. His nephew admitted afterwards: ‘Your first Ryder Cup there’s a bit of excitement and you don’t know what to expect. It took me maybe about five or six holes to get into it. I was a bit out of rhythm. It was a special reception on the first tee, something that I will definitely remember for the rest of my life.’ That was short-lived as he pushed his tee shot wide towards the huge corporate construct and then watched as Poulter missed an easy two-footer on the first green. No amount of adrenaline could get either player going after that, and it may have been that Poulter was so pre-occupied with discovering any kind of form for himself that he was unable to give his rookie partner the benefit of his experience.

"Plans to make one of Heathrow Airport's runways more than four miles long in a move campaigners say will cut night-time noise over London have gone on show to the public. The so-called 'Heathrow Hub' plans will see the northern runway at the west London terminal doubled in size and divided into two - with a 650-metre 'safety zone' in the middle - allowing planes to use either end at the same time. The proposal - which would see the M25 diverted into a tunnel beneath the super-sized landing strip - is an alternative to plans to build entirely new runways either at Heathrow or Gatwick Airports. Organisers of the third option - which  say it could be finished by 2023 - have shown  off their plans in an advert taken out in national newspapers over the past week. Scroll down for video . An aerial view of how Heathrow's new 6,800-metre runway - which would be divided into two separate landing/take-off strips -  would look . The idea has been put forward as an alternative to building entirely new runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick to boost airport capacity . The artists' impressions of the plan show the runway extending way out to the west of the airport, north of a proposed terminal six, which would be built next to the current terminal five. Those behind the campaign say it would cut the noise of flights over London by shifting early morning flights to the new section of tarmac, meaning planes land and take off two and half miles further away from the capital. They claim the scheme would bring in the economic benefits of further airport expansion at a lower cost, requiring less land and with reduced disruption. Former Concorde pilot Jock Lowe, the leader of the Heathrow Hub concept, said: 'Our proposal would cost billions of pounds less than Heathrow Airport's plan to build a third runway and the latest Airports Commission report said it expects our expansion plan to boost the UK economy by up to £214bn and to create as many as 163,000 new jobs nationwide – double the benefits offered by expanding Gatwick.' As well as the huge runway, the scheme  also includes plans for better rail access to the site. Campaigners behind the plan say early morning flights could be shifted two miles west, meaning planes fly 800ft higher, thus reducing noise for west London residents living underneath the flight-path . Noise maps  show how extended runways would mean the sound of planes would be less disruptive in built-up areas to the east of the airport . The plans were unveiled to the public after the Government's airports 'tsar' Sir Howard Davies, whose commission is evaluating the three schemes, warned all of them would cost more than they claim. His commission calculated that an entirely new runway to the north-west of Heathrow would cost around £18.6billion as opposed to Heathrow Airport Ltd's estimate of £14.8billion. A new runway at Gatwick, estimated by Gatwick Airport Ltd to cost £7.4billion, would cost an estimated £9.3billion. The third shortlisted option - an extension of the existing northern runway at Heathrow - would cost £13.5billion - higher than the £10.1billion estimated by Heathrow Hub. Davies will deliver his final report on which scheme should go ahead in summer 2015. Organisers say early-morning flights will be told to land on the western end of the new runway, cutting noise to nearby homes in west London . As well as plans for extending the runway, the 'Heathrow Hub' campaign wants to connect the airport to HS2 rail link planned for the UK . The plan is being put forward by a consortium including former Concorde pilot Jock Lowe, who says it would be cheaper than other plans .","Three competing schemes to boost airport capacity in Britain being looked at by a Government Commission .

"A council which has been forced to slash millions from its budget spent £17,000 on an extravagant ceremony to switch on its Christmas lights. Crawley Borough Council has been forced to make savings of £7.3million from its budget during the last five years - cutting services for residents. But the council decided to spare no expense when it hired barriers, bouncers and put up a stage, as well as organised a fireworks display and street entertainment for the switch-on event, which cost £16,882. Crawley Council spent £17,000 on an extravagant Christmas lights switch on event, which residents branded a shambles and criticised as the council has slashed millions off its budget in the last five years . It also drafted in Stephen Mulhern, the presenter, for the event - but residents complained it was a waste of money, with bad decorations and a poor fireworks display. Steve Burbidge was at the event with his daughter and said: 'All I can say is it was unbelievable. 'My daughter asked me when they were putting the lights on - but they already had.' Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was a joke - we couldn't see the fireworks and the decorations themselves are dreadful. 'It was a shambles and an embarrassment. Spending £100 on the event would have been too much, let alone £17,000.' Last year Crawley Borough Council announced it would close 22 playgrounds which were under used and cost too much to maintain. This was reduced to four after a backlash. Stephen Mulhern (holding microphone) was drafted in to turn on Crawley's Christmas lights, while the council also spent thousands on a stage, bouncers, barriers and decorations - which residents said were rubbish . People said they were unable to see the town's expensive fireworks display because of the barriers they used . The council merged community wardens and civil enforcement officers, which it claimed saved £50,000. The TaxPayers' Alliance also criticised the council for trying to create festive cheer by spending money. Andy Silvester said: 'It's easy to sound like the grinch but at a time when we're struggling to pay for social care and children's services, every penny of unnecessary spending has to be questioned. 'It's a small figure in the grand scheme of things, but this money could have been spent better. 'Festive cheer isn't created by Councils, no matter how hard they try.' A council spokesman described the switch-on as 'a great event' which attracted 2,500 people into the town centre, and added: 'The economic benefit to the town was almost certainly higher and feedback from local organisations, was extremely positive.'","Crawley Borough Council spent £17,000 on lavish Christmas lights event .

"A harbourmaster says Britain's ports are being littered with sunken boats which are being bought online by drunk amateur sailors. Captain Paul Thomas has spent the past year clearing out all abandoned vessels from Fowey harbour in Cornwall at a cost of thousands of pounds. He believes that would-be sailors are getting carried away after a few drinks and impulse buying second-hand fishing vessels through online auction site eBay. Captain Paul Thomas pictured, believes that too many amateur sailors are buying boats online using services like eBay without actually realising the additional costs associated with keeping a vessel seaworthy . Many boats, such as this one in Fowey harbour in Cornwall are being left to rot by their owners . Fowey is an incredibly popular destination for boaters with a sheltered harbour and excellent mooring . The hidden costs incurred with a boat such as mooring rates, maintenance and insurance, then scare the new owners who abandon their boats to rot in the harbour. In the past week the authorities have rounded up a catamaran, a fishing boat, a yacht and other miscellaneous vessels that had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair. When an abandoned vessel is identified a notice is issued to the owner, informing them they are required to either repair or remove the vessels. If this is not done, the authorities assess the vessel, before selling it off if it is still sea-worthy, or scrapping it if it is too damaged. Captain Thomas said: 'It's one of the plagues of harbour masters. 'People can be seduced into buying a boat really easily, often late at night and maybe after a few drinks, but buying it is the easy part - then there is mooring it, maintaining it and insuring it. 'They don't realise how expensive it is, can't afford it, and then we get left with the boats and the costs. 'It is time-consuming, and we have better things to do. Leaving a boat to rot is simply marine fly-tipping and we're not having it. 'People have a responsibility to the community, the environment and the harbour users. 'Fowey is a beautiful place and we want it to remain that way. 'We don't want derelicts making it look untidy and causing a possible environmental hazard.' Captain Thomas said people were making 'impulse buys' on eBay without knowing the true cost of ownership .","Captain Paul Thomas said people do not realise the cost of owning a boat .

"The brother of honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani today made an emotional appeal for her husband to be forced to 'tell the world' how she died. With his sister's photograph pinned to his jacket, Anish Hindocha, 25, said Shrien Dewani should not be allowed to 'walk away' without revealing in his own words how she met her death. Dewani, who has been on trial since early October accused of his wife's murder, has lodged a bid to be freed next week claiming there is insufficient evidence against him for the trial to continue and the charges should be thrown out. Judge Jeanette Traverso will deliver her decision on Monday on whether she agrees that Dewani has no case to answer or whether there is enough evidence for the case to continue. Despite glaring variations in his version of events leading up to, and after, his wife's fatal shooting two weeks after their wedding, Dewani is next week widely expected to be cleared of having any hand in it. But Anish, who has been supporting his parents in Cape Town since the first day of the trial, said: 'It would be a terrible development to what has been a four-year wait, if we and the people of South Africa are not afforded the full story.' Scroll down for exclusive video . 'Give us the full story': Shrien Dewani's brother Anish Hindocha (pictured, left, with his sister Ami Denborg, centre, and parents Vinod and Nilam Hindocha, behind, at a court hearing last year) made an emotional appeal for her husband to be forced to explain how she died . He said Dewani's counsel Francois Van Zyl had told the court repeatedly that the accused would explain to the court his version of events. Anish said: 'The phrase ""my client will tell the court"" has become like a mantra to the judge, media and members of the public who have attended the Western Cape Court. 'Shrien Dewani has insisted all along that he would clear his name and his legal team have promised the court since the trial began dozens of times that he would help the court with his own version of events. 'Well, let's have him ""tell the court"" then. That has been his pledge throughout the trial. 'It would be wrong for him to walk away from South Africa without explaining himself what happened on the night of Anni's murder in this country.' Intention: The parents of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani, Vinod and Nilam Hindocha, say they will sue their accused son-in-law Shrien Dewani for not disclosing his bisexuality before marrying their daughter . Accused: Shrien Dewani (left) is charged with five counts relating to the kidnapping and murder of his wife of two weeks, Anni, (right) in a carjacking during their honeymoon to Cape Town in November 2010 . He said Anni's family had been overwhelmed with support from well wishers who clearly wanted a full trial to be conducted. 'The people here have been, overall, fantastic in their support of us as Anni's family. 'We cannot thank them enough for the warmth they have shown us and we really appreciate it. Thousands of messages arrive through social media and other means and they mean a lot. 'But they also show that South Africa, after spending a vast amount of money, time and expertise on bringing Shrien Dewani to trial, is demanding the full story. Unaware: Nilam Hindocha, who is recovering from stomach cancer, said: 'If I knew Shrien was gay or bisexual I would never have allowed Anni to get married' Back in court: Speaking for the first time since the trial began, Vinod  Hindocha (pictured) said he intends to pursue the civil action against Dewani in London, but stressed it was not financially motivated . Version: Anni's parents said they will struggle to find closure if they do not hear Shien Dewani (pictured earlier in the trial) giving evidence in court . 'If the full facts are not given and by that I mean Shrien Dewani telling the court his version, than Anni's death will remain on the conscience of South Africa forever. 'It will also mean a lifetime of further torture for me and my family, particularly my parents.' Anni's parents revealed to MailOnline earlier this week that they were unaware of their son-in-law's secret trysts with male prostitutes, including one called Leopold Leisser, which he confessed to on the first day of the trial while also admitting he was bisexual. They declared they would not have agreed to the marriage and Anni herself would have walked away if the facts of his sexuality and meetings with male prostitutes had been revealed. They are also set to examine taking legal action against him once the criminal case has been completed. Anish added: 'There have been reports that we as a family are planning to take legal action of our own and sue Shrien Dewani after this murder trial is over. 'This is not the right time to discuss this. However, our motivation is not, and never has been financial. We just demand the truth. 'And we do that with heavy hearts after such a long time.' Anni, who had been married less than a fortnight after their £200,000 wedding, died from a single gunshot to the neck as she was driven through Khayelitsha, part of a run-down suburb, with her husband in a taxi in November 2010. Dewani was released unharmed, claiming he was pushed through the passenger rear window, but his wife was found dead the next day. Support: Ani's sister Ami Denborg (right) also said she wants the South African trial judge to ensure that Shrien Dewani explains his side of the story on how his wife Anni (left) was killed in November 2010 . Trouble: Shrien Dewani (right) told Anni (left) he had fertility problems. The Cape Town murder trial has since heard how he went to Thailand for kick-boxing to help boost his testosterone levels . Three men were later jailed for the car jacking, but the trio said the murder was planned and two told the trial they were hired by Dewani, a wealthy businessman from Bristol. The third has died from a brain tumour while serving his life sentence. Taxi driver Zola Tongo said Dewani had offered him £1,400 to help organise the hit and enlist gangsters to carry out a staged hit on Anni. Dewani, 34, was arrested soon after an extradition order was granted to take him back to South Africa to face trial. But he fought against his removal from Britain through the courts and was assessed as suffering from post traumatic shock and other mental health issues for three-and-a-half years. In the dark: Mr and Mrs Hindocha (pictured in Cape Town last week) revealed they were totally unaware that Dewani was bisexual and slept with gay prostitutes until details of his secret sex life were emerged in court . Claims: Police say Dewani (striped shirt) masterminded the murder of Anni (right), but he denies the charge accusing the three killers of concocting a yarn to reduce their own prison terms of at least 25 years . Shrien Dewani told the Cape Town court that he had hired a London prostitute, who went under the name The German Master (pictured), for sexual liaisons . He was returned in April by a private charter plane and is being detained in a secure hospital wing. He denies any involvement in the murder and insists he has been set up by the killers and was deeply in love with his wife. Mr Leisser and a senior Scotland Yard officer were banned by the judge from revealing details of Dewani's homosexual activities as they were about to give the evidence from the witness box. Anish added: 'I fully expect the South African trail against Shrien Dewani to continue and for his application to end the case to be rejected. 'We have been made aware that there has been a petition against the judge in the this case and we would like to point out that it has nothing to do with our own case for justice and the full story we want.' He made a direct plea to the court to hear the full evidence available and for the defence to put is case. He added: 'Please allow us the opportunity to demand justice for my sister. Please allow us the full story. 'We don't want to return to our homes in the UK and Sweden carrying any doubts at all about whether Anni's murder received a fair and proper hearing in South Africa. 'We have been promised it for four painful years which have devastated our lives. I worry about my parents health and they need this closure. 'My message is simple. Don't let Shrien Dewani walk away without giving us, South Africa and people all over the world the full story. 'Let the law take its full and proper course.' Millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani (pictured arriving at court earlier in the trial) is said to have already packed his bags in the expectation that a judge will find in his favour over his claim that he should walk free because of a lack of evidence without being forced into the witness box and cross-examination .","Anish Hindocha makes emotional appeal for businessman to testify at trial .

No DVDs have been officially released yet and the show is available on iTunes in the U.S. but not Australia. 'He gets really ill at times and spends time in hospital he loves the show and he watched a trailer on YouTube,' Lee wrote. 'We are waiting for a double lung transplant which will make his life a lot better.

Ben Park, 29, said he received the letter last month but decided to post it online on Thursday . 'More and more as I read through it, it seems like a desperate plea from a father trying to bring some amount of joy into his son's life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I felt what he felt because I just had my first child - a boy - in the summer and I just wanted to do whatever I could do to help this father. 'He's in pain seeing his child go through this, especially through the Christmas holiday.' Mr Park added that he was able to contact the owner of Titmouse Animation, which does the cartoons for the show, but said he had not heard back from the show's producers. 'He said that he would forward it on to the showrunners of ""Kirby Buckets"",' Mr Park said. 'Showrunners can be extremely busy so I don't know if this letter will actually reach them or not.' Mr Park clarified that: 'This isn't a marketing scheme or a grab for karma.' People who suffer from cystic fibrosis develop an abnormal amount of excessively thick and sticky mucus within the lungs, airways and the digestive system, according to Cystic Fibrosis Australia. 'The mucus causes impairment of the digestive functions of the pancreas and traps bacteria in the lungs resulting in recurrent infections which lead to irreversible damage,' the organisation's website states.

"Found: A body thought to belong to Ypsilanti resident Brian Martin, was found Monday in Putnam County . Police have found a body believed to be  a man who was likely bludgeoned to death by his lover and her husband in June. A body thought to belong to Brian Martin from Ypsilanti, Michigan, was found Monday in Putnam County, Ohio, according to the report by WXYZ. Police believe couple Robert and Desirae Strauss, bludgeoned the 54-year-old to death in their Toledo home. Martin is thought to have had an affair with Desirae Strauss, 36, and may have believed he was the father of her children. Robert and Desirae have five children, ages 11, 10, eight and twins born in April. Martin, a father-of-two, went missing after coaching a softball game in Holland, Ohio. A friend of the couple handed evidence to police that she said showed that Desirae had been having an affair with Martin for the past few years. Trisha Curtis said after she heard of their arrest she remembered Desirae had hidden letters from Martin in her van because she didn't want her husband to find them. 'I went searching for it because I remembered she stuck something in there,' she told 13ABC. Accused: Robert (left) and Desirae Strauss, 36, were indicted by a Lucas County grand jury in July on charges of aggravated murder, murder, tampering with evidence and grand theft of a motor vehicle . Affair: Martin may have believed he was the father of her children. Desirae gave birth to twins (pictured)  born in April . 'I sat there and cried over it. I didn't know what I should do. 'Me and my husband talked about it and we decided that was the best thing to do.' 'It's tearing me up. I've been crying almost every day about it. I've been worried about the kids.'

'I think that was a lot of our feelings recently. We just really want to bring him home and give him a proper burial, because he didn't deserve to have any of this happen to him and he didn't deserve to you know, be put somewhere,' said daughter Rachel Martin. 'I think when I saw the call come up on my phone I knew that it was probably the news that they found my dad. I think it's mixed emotions. It's still something that I can't really organize in my head right now.' The Strausses were indicted by a Lucas County grand jury in July on charges of aggravated murder, murder, tampering with evidence and grand theft of a motor vehicle.

"A former University of Wisconsin football player and his twin brother are charged in federal court with one in a string of November robberies at five businesses. Jack Ikegwuonu and his brother, William, were charged Tuesday in U.S. District Court with armed robbery and gun possession. They're also charged in Dane County court with several counts of retail theft for allegedly stealing merchandise from Wal-Mart stores in Madison and Sun Prairie throughout September and October. The brothers were arrested last week after an armed robbery at a dry cleaning business in Middleton. They told police they committed all five armed robberies to help support their heroin use, according to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint in federal court. Brothers: Jack Ikegwuonu, left, played for the Badgers and was drafted by the Eagles, though he was only active for one regular-season NFL game. Brother William, right,  played for Northern Illinois University . The brothers' arrests took place after police observed an SUV's movements following the armed robbery with a GPS device, Madison police said in a release. The device was earlier placed on the vehicle via a warrant. '[The SUV] had been initially identified through surveillance images as the probable getaway vehicle in recent armed robberies, including two that took place on State [Street],' the release said. A gun, along with money 'and other evidence' was recovered from the vehicle, Madison police said. Jack and William Ikegwuonu are suspected in four other armed robberies in the area between November 13 and 21, and U.S. Attorney John Vaudreuil said they could face more charges when the case is taken to a grand jury. Madison police said in the release 'The investigation indicates much of the money taken during the commission of these crimes was being used to purchase heroin.' The retail theft charges in Dane County Circuit Court include a felony and misdemeanors. A judge entered not guilty pleas to the misdemeanor charges on the brothers' behalf as they stood mute in court Tuesday. Appearance: Jack Ikegwuonu was active for one regular-season NFL game during the 2009 season with the Phildadelphia Eagles. He is seen here at training camp in August 2009 . Lisa Goldman, the attorney representing the Ikegwuonus, declined to comment to the Associated Press. Jack Ikegwuonu played for the Badgers as a cornerback from 2005 to 2007.

"Consultant cardiologist Dr Kevin Beatt (pictured) was sacked after he blew the whistle on hospital conditions following a patient's death . A renowned heart specialist who raised the alarm over a hospital's failings was unfairly dismissed in a calculated attempt to damage his reputation, a tribunal has ruled. Consultant cardiologist Dr Kevin Beatt has won a two-year legal battle with Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, which sacked him in September 2012 after he raised the alarm about staffing shortages, 'appalling' equipment and workplace bullying. He voiced his concerns following the death of heart patient Gerald Storey, 63, at Croydon University Hospital in June 2011. It was a routine angioplasty, an inquest heard in 2013, but a senior nurse had been suspended hours earlier - without Dr Beatt's knowledge - and her absence contributed to the patient's death. Dr Beatt, a renowned specialist who led the hospital's well-regarded department for interventional heart procedures from 2007, should have been afforded protected whistleblower status but instead lost his job in a case he claimed provided a damning demonstration of the trust's attempts to cover up failings. The trust argued it dismissed him 'for making unsubstantiated and unproven allegations of an unsafe service', but the employment tribunal ruled there was 'no consistent evidence' of gross misconduct and chief executive John Goulston, whose evidence it criticised as inconsistent, had 'failed to carry out a fair process'. Between 2008 and his dismissal, Dr Beatt raised a catalogue of concerns about inadequate equipment, bullying and harassment of junior employees, removal of key staff, a lack of competent nurses and the failure to properly investigate serious incidents. In January 2010 he voiced serious fears to medical director Tony Newman-Sanders that the cardiology unit's radiation equipment, then the oldest in use in the country, was putting patients and staff at risk. He was accused of fabricating his concerns so he could treat patients elsewhere, but six months later the machinery was condemned and replaced after breaking down during an operation. Dr Beatt voiced his concerns following the death of a heart patient  at Croydon University Hospital (pictured) The friction came to a head in July the next year, when a 63-year-old patient died during a routine procedure after a senior nurse was suspended without Dr Beatt's knowledge. Dr Beatt, who was left for 20 minutes without a nurse with even basic familiarity with the operation, described the suspension as 'the most overtly reckless act' he had witnessed in his career. The trust claimed Dr Beatt's criticisms were 'vexatious' and calculated to ensure Sister Jones's restoration, and in September 2011 began disciplinary proceedings that culminated in his sacking. The tribunal found there was 'no evidence' Dr Beatt had an ulterior motive and that 'extremely damaging' and 'entirely false' allegations were levelled at him during an investigation into  Mr Storey's death. Those included claims by Dr Asif Qasim, the hospital's clinical lead for medical specialities that Mr Beatt was mentally unstable. Employment judge Gill Sage, who chaired the tribunal, added she believed a 'misleading' press statement about Mr Beatt's dismissal, issued following the inquest 10 months later, had been 'calculated and was likely to cause damage to his reputation'. Speaking after the tribunal's ruling, Dr Beatt said: 'Essentially they ignored some of the statements made to the serious untoward incident report and submitted their own version. 'There's no doubt in my mind that, if things have gone badly wrong, instead of saying things have gone badly wrong, they try to cover it up. 'At the end of the day it is in order to misrepresent events to the patient and their relatives.' He added the legal battle and the trust's decision to refer him to the General Medical Council had taken 'a very considerable toll' on him and left him unable to find work within the NHS. He said: 'That's why they do it. They do it because it will prevent me from getting a job and that will prevent me from pursuing them in court because I won't be able to afford the costs.' Dr Beatt said he believed the trust had spent 'more than £100,000' fighting his case, which he was only able to pursue because his lawyers Linklaters agreed to work pro bono. A spokesman for Croydon Health Services NHS Trust said it would appeal the ruling. He added: 'We are clearly very disappointed with the tribunal's decision. 'We take all concerns about patient safety extremely seriously, as well as allegations of bullying against any of our employees. 'It is everyone's responsibility at CHS to uphold great care for patients, and for our staff to know that they will be listened to and supported.' Gerald Storey, 63, was having a cardiac operation to widen obstructed arteries at Croydon University Hospital  on June 9, 2011 when it was discovered the specialist nurse would not be coming. An inquest held last year found complications developed as the operation proceeded, and Mr Storey then suffered cardiac arrest and died. Senior nurse Lucy Jones had been suspended moments earlier over claims she had harassed and bullied staff and failed to respond to written management requests. Dr Beatt told the inquest if he had known he would not have done the operation and he believed her suspension and management's failure to tell him directly contributed to Mr Storey's death. He also said the theatre 'descended into chaos' as complications emerged. Coroner Dr Roy Palmer ruled Sister Lucy Jones's absence had contributed to Gerald Storey's death.","Consultant cardiologist Dr Kevin Beatt has won a two-year legal battle .

"A lesbian couple claim they were told to stop kissing one another in a fashionable London eatery by the manager because it is a 'family restaurant'.

Scroll down for video . Lydia Cawson, 29, left, said she and partner Rubyyy Jones, 30, right, were ordered to stop kissing during a meal at the Royal Festival Hall . Ms Cawson, a costume designer, said in an interview with London Live: 'We were really shocked by this challenge because we did not feel we were being overly affectionate. 'Yes, it was an intimate moment but again, [I was] consoling her and it was just a simple, sort of loving reaction basically. 'The second comment, that it was ""a family restaurant"" made me feel well, why does that matter? 'Is it because children were present? Not that there were any children present at that time. 'And why should it matter if it is a family restaurant?' Ms Cawson explained the couple had experienced a stressful week, including moving house and Ms Jones, a performer, was upset. Lydia Cawson (pictured) says she and her partner were out for dinner when they were told to stop kissing by a member of staff because it is a 'family restaurant' She said: 'Rubyyy was upset so I moved on to the same bench as her, we had previously been sitting opposite one another. I consoled her, kissed her on the cheek and gave her a light peck on the lips as well and just had my arm around her. 'I did not notice any adverse reaction in the restaurant. Then a lady came over to us, we don't know for sure but we are pretty sure it was a manager, and that's when she said it. 'She did not apologise. Rubbyy challenged her and said ""is it a family restaurant or a homophobic restaurant?""' The staff member said no but gestured for the pair to sit apart from one another, Ms Cawson said. She added they paid their bill but left feeling 'incredibly angry' and that Canteen has since apologised for the incident. Dominic Lake, co-founder of Canteen, said: 'Everyone is welcome at Canteen, whether gay, straight, old or young regardless of sexuality. 'We are horrified at the thought of being labelled anti-gay - half of our team are gay. 'We take any such claims incredibly seriously and we have investigated this incident in depth. The Canteen restaurant at the Royal Festival Hall where the women were allegedly told to stop kissing .

"Britain is to lead Europe's ambitious mission to try to find life on Mars, it emerged today. The European Space Agency's (ESA's) ruling council has put UK experts in charge of sending a rover vehicle to the red plant. Through the UK Space Agency, the Government is devoting £47.7 million to ExoMars, almost as much as its £49.2 million contribution to the International Space Station. Britain has been chosen to lead Europe's mission to search for life on Mars which will be lead by the ExoMars rover, featured here in an artist's impression . Chancellor George Osborne made the surprise announcement in the Commons that Britain had been awarded the 'lead role' in the 2018 ExoMars mission. Central to the mission will be a hi-tech British-built rover that will navigate itself across the Martian deserts. The rover, being tested in a sandy 'Mars yard' at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, will use a two metre (6.5 foot) long drill to extract samples from deep below the surface of the Red Planet and analyse them for signs of life. Airbus Defence and Space spokesman Jeremy Close said: 'From our point of view, the decision is fantastic news. This is a flagship project not just for the UK but for Europe. It will be Europe's first interplanetary rover.' The European Space Agency's (ESA's) ruling council has put UK experts in charge of sending a rover vehicle to the red plant . He said the 150-strong Stevenage team had come on 'leaps and bounds' developing the rover's cutting edge technology. A key feature of the ExoMars rover will be its autonomous navigation system, giving it an ability to think for itself as it travels from one exploration site to another. Mr Close added: 'The thing it's going to do which the American rovers are not doing is look for life. It will actually have life-detecting technology. If it's in the right place and life is there, the rover will find it.' Scientists believe that while the exposed surface of Mars is irradiated and dead, primitive life could survive in deeper layers underground. The ESA decision means that final fitting and testing of the rover's scientific instruments will now take place in Stevenage and not in Italy, as had previously been proposed. The rover is being tested in a sandy 'Mars yard' at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage (pictured) Base: The 150-strong Stevenage team had come on 'leaps and bounds' developing the rover's cutting edge technology, it was said . 'From supplying the first nut and bolt to when it's ready to be put on a rocket and sent to Mars, all that work will now be done in Stevenage,' said Mr Close. The announcement comes hard on the heels of ESA's hugely successful Rosetta mission to land a probe on a comet more than 500 million miles from Earth, in which British scientists played a big part. News of the Mars mission was Mr Osborne's cue to deliver a joke aimed at Labour. To loud guffaws, he said: 'We have often gazed on the barren wastelands of the Red Planet and long given up hope of finding intelligent life there. But signs of any life at all would be an advance.' A total package for the UK space sector worth more than £200 million has been promised by the Government including £55 million in new resource and capital funding for the next year. The Treasury pointed out that every pound of public money spent on space exploration produced a £10 return for the UK economy. Britain's leadership of the ExoMars mission would create more than 200 new jobs and 'vital spin-off technologies'. More than £130 million has also been pledged for new satellite telecommunications technology which will be matched by industry. The UK space sector is worth £11.3 billion to the UK economy and directly employs a workforce of 34,300.","European Space Agency's ruling council has put UK experts in charge .

"Families with children will save hundreds of pounds on the cost of their holidays after George Osborne axed taxes on flights today. The Chancellor abolished air passenger duty on all flights for children under the age of 12. Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement announcement is a major boost for families who are hit by higher holiday costs during term time. At the moment a family of four pays £52 in flight taxes for a ticket to Europe - of which £26 is for children . The £50million tax break cuts £138 from the price of a family of four's holiday to North America – and almost £200 for a family of four travelling to Australia. It will also reduce the cost of a family holiday to Spain  by £26. The tax currently adds between £13 and £97 to the cost of a flight, depending on how far the final destination is from London. A campaign in Parliament calling for the measure to be included in the Autumn Statement has widespread support. Mr Osborne said: 'We're going to require airlines to list the charges separately from taxes on tickets. 'But I also want to reduce the cost of those tickets for families directly. 'From May 1 next year, Air Passenger Duty for children under 12 will be abolished. And I'll go further. From the following year, we'll get rid of Air Passenger Duty for children under 16 altogether.' David Cameron reportedly lent his support to the idea at a meeting of Conservative MPs in October. He is quoted as having said: ‘I really like this one. I have three children under 10 myself.’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has led the campaign to scrap the tax, said scrapping air passenger duty on children's flights was a ‘no brainer’ Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who has led the campaign to scrap the tax, said the tax cut was a ‘no brainer’. He added: ‘It’s got cross-party support and it’s not expensive. I do have a habit of getting what I want from the Government.’ Around three millions flights are taken by under 12s every year, Mr Bridgen said. But he said the Treasury will lose just 1.6 per cent of the £3.2billion it rakes in from air passenger duty every year. Mr Osborne’s announcement will ease the pressure on families stung by exorbitant travel costs during school holidays. At the moment a family of four pays £52 in flight taxes for a ticket to Europe - of which £26 is for children. The duty adds £138 for two children’s tickets to North America, £170 to the Caribbean and £194 for flights to Australia or New Zealand. Mr Osborne last year announced that the two higher air duty tax bands would be scrapped in April 2015 – with all flights over 2,000 miles charged at the same rate. It meant that flights to the West Indies, South America, India, China and Australia will all be charged the same tax as a flight to New York. All long haul flights will, from next year, will be charged £71 extra per ticket. But the system could be scrapped in Scotland after the Government handed Holyrood complete control over air passenger duty. The announcement has infuriated Labour MPs in northern England who fear regional airports will lose business to Scotland. Labour politicians said the move was a ‘kick in the teeth’ for northern constituencies, which would have a ‘crippling’ impact on airports in the region as airlines divert flights to Scottish locations to take advantage of lower taxes. The SNP made the abolition of the duty part of their business pitch for independence. Ed Balls and fellow frontbenchers admitted the change would cause ‘uncertainty and risk’ for regional airports. The airports themselves called for the Treasury to commit to fresh protections. Frank Field, the Birkenhead MP and former welfare minister, said fellow Labour MPs would join forces with southern Tory rebels to bring down the Smith proposals unless the devolution of APD was dropped. ‘The idea is we are trying to build up northern airports not cripple them. This proposal cripples them. This will reinforce the London bias,’ Mr Field said. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways's parent company IAG, said people would be ‘rushing across the border’ as a zero rate would make it £276 cheaper for a family of four to fly to the US. Search and Rescue and air ambulance charities are to get VAT refunds and more government cash following lobbying by Prince William. In today’s Autumn Statement, the Chancellor will announce VAT breaks for the sector from April, alongside £7.5million extra support for air ambulances. The tax refunds will be worth £25million over five years. The Duke of Cambridge is said to have been angry at pressure on air-sea rescue services. As a helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey, he has helped out with mountain rescue, Coastguard and air ambulance services. David Cameron revealed at Prime Minister’s Questions in 2011 that the Prince had urged him to do more to support the services, many of which are run by charities. Today’s measure will mean all 150 search and rescue and air ambulance charities will be able to apply for VAT refunds on all their search and rescue activities as of April 1. Hospices are to get VAT refunds worth millions of pounds a year. After a long campaign by the hospice movement, George Osborne will agree today that they should receive an annual grant to cover their VAT costs. Currently, NHS organisations are able to recover VAT on non-business supplies such as catering, laundry, staff training and vehicle and maintenance costs. But hospices do not enjoy the same advantages – meaning they are unfairly disadvantaged and face large VAT bills. Mr Osborne will say today that the VAT refund is expected to be worth £4million a year to the sector, though if it is more the bill will still covered. ‘Hospice charities provide vital support services for the NHS and its patients and we want to support their work,’ said a government source.","Chancellor abolished air passenger duty on flights for children under 12 .

"A prostitute and her unemployed partner, arrested over the murder of a Gold Coast man after luring him with an online advertisement for sex, have faced court. 33-year-old mother of three, Peta Lorang-Goubran,and her 28-year-old partner Mark Dayney were arrested on Wednesday over the murder of Gold Coast man Mark Emanuel Spencer, found bludgeoned to death on October 1. Mr Spencer, 37, sustained severe head injuries at his Coomera home in what police have described as a targeted attack. The couple have been remanded in custody after appearing at the Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday. Mark Emanuel Spencer was found bludgeoned to death at his Gold Coast home on October 1 . Mr Dayney reportedly blew a kiss to supporters as he was led from the dock at the Southport court on Thursday; one person in the room telling him to keep his 'chin up'. The court heard Dayney was on bail when accused of participating in the murder, though his lawyer said the breach of bail charge against his client would be contested. Ms Lorang-Goubran wept in the dock during her brief appearance. Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said Mr Spencer had replied to an advertisement for sex on the classified website Craigslist, falling victim to the couple's  ploy. 'They had a plan together to go to the client's residence and actually rob that person,' he told reporters on the Gold Coast. Detectives found a bloodied tennis racquet and broken baseball bat at the scene. Police claim he had replied to an advertisement for sex on the classified website Craigslist, which was part of his killers' ploy to rob him and a number of other victims . Detectives found a bloodied tennis racquet and broken baseball bat at the alleged murder scene . Police were unable to speculate how often similar sex-related robberies occur through classified sites like Craigslist -  but note the likely embarrassment of victims means perpetrators of such crimes are less-likely to be caught out. 'It is quite apparent that victims would be reluctant to report the matters to police and the offenders probably count on this being the case, particularly if drugs are also stolen,' Det Supt Hutchison told Daily Mail Australia. He said one other victim has been positively identified, as well as a number of other people who had communicated with Ms Lorang-Goubran via email and text messages but who never actually met up with her for various reasons. Det Supt Hutchison is urging other victims to come forward to police. 'We would still like to speak to anyone who responded to any Craigslist advertisement for sexual services who were subsequently victims of robbery,' said Det Supt Hutchison. 'The manner in which these transactions occur creates significant risks for the ‘client’ as is the case with any online interactions where the identity, history and background of the other party is not known and cannot be validated,' Det Supt Hutchison said. There have been a number of similar Craigslist related crimes in the United States in recent years, including one case in which a newly-wed couple  created an escort ad on the site to lure a married engineer so they could kill him 'for the excitement' of it. They were sentenced to life in prison. Police are pictured outside the 37-year-old's home in Coomera, following his murder. Mr Spencer's body was found on the back porch of his home . A 33-year-old mother of three and her 28-year-old partner were arrested on Wednesday over his murder . Mr Spencer reportedly knew Ms Lorang-Goubran but wasn't aware she was the prostitute responsible for the advertisement. The pair have been charged with murder and robbery with violence over Mr Spencer's death, as well as charges relating to a robbery in Holmview, south of Brisbane, the night before the murder. A friend of Mr Spencer, Tim Stewart, said it was tough to face the father-of-two's alleged killers in the courtroom on Thursday. '(I'm) very angry,' Mr Stewart told reporters when asked to describe his emotions. 'He (Mr Spencer) was a great person, beautiful kids, and he'll be truly missed.' The matter will return to court on February 20. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Mark Emanuel Spencer was found bludgeoned to death at his Gold Coast home .

"A British expat has died of suspected hypothermia after he slipped and fell into a ditch while out shopping near his hilltop village in Tuscany. Stephen Paul Sorini-Dixon, 71, perished after getting stuck in the four foot gutter of icy water, investigators believe. It is thought that he slipped in the dark and was unable to climb out, remaining there all night, exposed to the icy stream of water. Stephen Paul Sorini-Dixon, 71, slipped into a four-foot gutter of icy water near his home in a hilltop village outside Tuscany, pictured, and it is believed he got stuck in the freezing stream after he became trapped (file) The pensioner who moved to Italy some years ago was found on Sunday morning by a hunter who spotted his shopping trolley. The expatriate, who lived alone but has several children living in the UK, was last seen getting off a bus about a mile from his home after doing the shopping on Saturday evening. On the way home in the dark he fell off the road into a substantial ditch, police believe. He was stuck with his arms and legs above him, failed to clamber out of the slippery slope and spent the night in the icy water of the stream, scientific police said. The Briton, nicknamed the Englishman in the mountainous village, has several children who live in England but had lived in the area for years. The man' s children were informed and are thought have travelled to Italy to help with the funeral arrangements. More than 6,000 Britons die abroad every year, averaging 100 a week, figures show. This is mostly down to the high number of elderly expatriates who live overseas, with the bulk opting to retire to the sunny climes of southern European countries such as Spain and Italy. The pensioner, who moved to the mountainous village in Italy some years ago where he was nicknamed the Englishman, was found the next morning by a hunter who had spotted his shopping trolley (file picture) Most die in natural circumstances, but 10 per cent of all British people murdered were killed overseas, showing that crime also plays a part, official figures reveal. The statistics came as the Foreign Commonwealth Office came under fire for not being sensitive to the needs of grieving families who requested consular help over the death of a loved one abroad. A damning report last month showed families had accused officials of being uncaring and unhelpful – and even of failing to dress appropriately – making their heartache even more traumatic. The criticisms came in a report by a cross-party panel of MPs which ordered the Foreign Office to improve its services to bereaved families. MPs also demanded an inquiry into claims some torture victims were failed by consular staff.","Stephen Paul Sorini-Dixon, 71, got stuck in four-foot gutter of icy water .

"Critics of Uber have attempted to crash the taxi app in any way they can, one of which is getting drivers to rate passengers just one star and thereby making the rating system meritless.

Kamer decided to shake Uber's rating based system so that he could cause chaos for the popular app and fuel the anti Uber revolution. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Disbelieving: This Uber driver laughs in disbelief when Nimrod Kamer asks him for just one star . The man with the plan: Journalist Nimrod Kamer believes that by asking for a one star rating he inspire others to take suit who will then overthrow Uber's rating based system . Uber demands that both drivers and passengers rate each other anywhere between one and five stars with five being the best and one being the worst. Kamer believes that if passengers ask drivers to rate those, just one star that it, 'will throw the drivers off-guard, mixing up the system, and sparking total anarchy.' Kamer explains that since drivers need high scores to stay employed that they might be afraid to give a passenger one star in fear of getting one themselves. When Kamer visited New York in November he got 15 different drivers to rate him one star and ended up with an average rating of 1.8. Kamer told Business Insider that he 'is the first one to get a 1-star average, but it doesn't mean I'm a bad passenger, it just means I convinced fifteen drivers to give me a low rating.

"The FBI are hunting a bank robber they have dubbed the 'Chit Chat Bandit' as he continues to chat up the tellers while stealing from them. The man has now targeted two banks in the San Diego area in two days and on both ocassions has fled the scene on the crime on a BMX-style bike. Investigators say even as the cash is being handed over, he continues to chat to the female tellers to lull them into a false sense of security and to make it look as though he is a regular customer. The man dubbed the Chit Chat Bandit, who is being hunted by the FBI after robbing two banks in the space of two days in the San Diego area . The man was first captured on CCTV on Wednesday, November 26, when he entered the Wells Fargo bank on Girard Avenue in La Jolla, California. He then walked over to the counter and handed the female teller a note demanding all of the money in her cash drawer. The robber also made a verbal demand for cash before engaging in small talk with her so he appeared like a normal customer. Then two days later after Thanksgiving, he targeted another Wells Fargo branch inside the Vons store on Camino Canada in El Cajon. Again he walked over to the counter and demanded money from the teller, and while she was collecting it, he also asked another employee for money. In the first robbery, the man targeted the Wells Fargo bank on Girard Avenue in La Jolla, California, pictured, where he demanded money from the teller but continued to chat her up while robbing the branch . He carried on talking to them while he was given the cash and then exited the store before making his getaway on a small green BMX bicycle. No injuries have been reported at either of the robberies and no weapon has been displayed. The FBI are now chasing down the man and are offering a $1,000 cash reward. He is described as white, in his mid-thirties of around 170 pounds and approximately five foot ten inches tall with a slender build and blonde with facial hair. In the first robbery he was wearing dark sunglasses, an orange reflector vest with a long-sleeved, dark tan shirt underneath. In the second raid he wore a dark baseball cap, dark shirt and light coloured pants.

"European politicians will sit down for a special lobster and foie gras lunch today – subsidised by British taxpayers. The European Parliament restaurant is laying on a three-course Christmas feast despite continuing austerity across the Continent. MEPs, who earn around £75,000 a year, can enjoy the lavish menu for just 20 euros – which works out at less than £16. The European Parliament restaurant is laying on a three-course Christmas feast despite continuing austerity across the Continent . For that price they can sample smoked duck breast and truffle oil, pheasant with foie gras and truffles, lobster au gratin with lemon sabayon or vegetable broth with quail eggs and smoked garlic. Side dishes range from piped potatoes with chestnuts and chopped dried fruits, samphire flan, bundles of green beans, or an assortment of asparagus, mushrooms and cherry tomatoes, the Evening Standard has revealed. For those not wanting a hot meal, the salad bar offers a range of pâtés, meat, fish and charcuterie terrines. The meal is finished off with Bûche de Noël - Christmas log - or fresh fruit salad. Paul Nuttall MEP, Ukip’s deputy leader, said the subsidised feast was ‘a kick in the teeth for hard pressed families across the country’. The European Parliament authorities defended the price of the meal as “eminently reasonable”. They stressed that the menu was a Christmas special, therefore “exceptional”, and that it was being served in a canteen-like staff restaurant. There had also been a drive to push down “substantially” the costs to public funds of the catering services over the last two years.

Research has revealed that there has been an increase of 66 per cent in bookings for the Italian city, which hit the headlines this autumn when film star and director Clooney married Amal Alamuddin at the seven-star Aman Canal Grande Hotel. However, the rise in bookings could in part be attributed to Venice's dedicated Christmas food market in the Campo Santo Stefano, with stalls offering creamy-white almond stuffed nougat, fruit-filled panettone from Verona and white truffles from Alba. The Christmas markets of Venice - they offer charm and an exquisite array of gifts . George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin in a lavish ceremony in Venice . Andy Washington, Expedia.co.uk MD said: 'The Christmas period is always an extremely popular time for travel, with Brits getting away to visit traditional and non-traditional Christmas markets in the UK, as well as Europe for festive-filled breaks. 'With its central location Venice is a great starting point to discover the North East of Italy, whether exploring Prosecco country or aristocratic villas near Verona, Padoa and Vicenza, all within one hour distance by car. London remains the most popular for Brits to visit this Christmas, ahead of New York and Paris. The table to the right shows the biggest percentage rises of visits to other cities . 'Of course the Clooney wedding effect may also be playing a part in the popularity of Venice, with tourists looking to experience some of the city's romantic magic.' As excitement for Christmas builds and Christmas markets spring up across Europe, Expedia.co.uk has revealed the most booked Christmas destinations, with London experiencing a 39 per cent increase in bookings for the festive season (2013-2014 year-on-year). Germany and the Netherlands have enjoyed 35 per cent rises respectively. The festivities at London Southbank Christmas Market are the envy of the world and with bookings to London for the upcoming festive period rising by 39 per cent year-on-year, the capital once again promises to be an extremely popular destination. But could the bright lights of Venice be a favourite of Brits as they want to see what all the fuss was about when George Clooney married there this autumn . London's Christmas markets on the South Bank are a popular stop-off for tourists around the world . This year it celebrates the spirit of Charles Dickens, creating a magical landscape resplendent with a Christmas Tree Maze, showcasing 300 real blue spruce trees. The Netherlands has seen bookings rise 35 per cent year-on-year for the festive season and hosts one of the oldest underground markets in Europe. A visit to Valkenberg's 'Christmas Market Velvet Cave' goes beyond decorations alone, as visitors will admire its cosy atmosphere and 18th century sculptures as they meander down a path marlstone. Located beneath the impressive Valkenburg Castle, the Velvet Cave is truly breath-taking. For festive travellers looking for beautiful ambience this Christmas, the Royal Christmas Market at Hohenzollern Castle in Stuttgart, Germany (35 per cent rise) is the perfect fit. The many market stalls will satisfy everybody's Glühwein and bratwurst fix.","Bookings for Venice have risen by 66% this year compared to 2013 .

"France has been ordered to pay thousands in compensation Somali pirates who had attacked French ships, because the pirates' human rights were disregarded when they were arrested. The French army took too long to bring the pirates before a judge when they apprehended the sea-faring criminals in 2008, the European Court of Human Rights ruled. France now has to pay between 5,000 and 2,000 euros (£3,945, and £1,578) to each pirate for 'moral damages'. Inlaws or Outlaws? France has been ordered to pay between  £1,578 - £3,945 to each Somali pirate for 'moral damages' as well as from £2,367 to £7,100 to cover each pirate's legal costs . They were also ordered to pay amounts varying from 9,000 euros to 3,000 euros (£7,100 to £2,367) to cover the pirates' legal costs. The ECHR said French authorities should have presented the pirates 'without delay' to a judge when they arrived on the country's territory after holding the men at sea. The Somali pirates were apprehended on the high seas by the French army on two separate occasions in 2008, and taken back to France for trial. In the ruling, the ECHR acknowledged the French were operating under 'completely exceptional circumstances' -  the arrest took place'more than 4,000 miles from French territory - which explained the long detention without seeing a judge. Poor pirates: The European Court of Human Rights ruled that France needs to compensate the pirates as the French Army 'took too long to bring the pirates before a judge', during a 2008 arrest . The ECHR, located in Strasbourg, eastern France, also noted that the Somali authorities were 'incapable of fighting' against the pirates. Nevertheless, the court ruled that after their arrival on French soil, authorities were wrong to keep the pirates in custody for an additional 48 hours before bringing them before a judge. 'Nothing justifies such an additional delay,' read the ECHR verdict. This constituted a 'violation of their rights to freedom and security,' the court ruled. Pirate attacks off Somalia have been slashed in recent years, with international fleets patrolling the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, as well as armed guards being posted aboard many vessels. At their peak in January 2011, Somali pirates held 736 hostages and 32 boats, some onshore and others on their vessels.","France to pay compensation to Somali pirates over 2008 arrests .

"This is the moment a brazen thief calmly walked into a pensioner's home and stole a 'substantial amount of money' as the victim pottered around in the garden just yards away. CCTV footage shows the burglar sneaking into the house through a side gate while the 89-year-old homeowner tends to the garden outside his property in the Gorton area of Manchester. The video, released by police today in a bid to help catch the intruder, then shows the offender casually walking out of the front door of the property after raiding the home for cash. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage shows the intruder sneaking into the house (pictured) through a side gate while the 89-year-old homeowner potters around outside his property in the Gorton area of Manchester at about 1pm on October 16 . The suspect walked through the side gate before entering the property and taking a 'substantial' sum of cash . The 89-year-old homeowner was completely unaware of the incident, despite being just yards from the thief . Police said he made off with a 'substantial' sum of money, despite the burglary taking place right under the nose of the homeowner. In the footage, the victim can be seen in his front garden, before the offender walks through a side gate to gain access to the property. The pensioner then moves to the side of the house as the intruder escapes through the front door. Officers have now released CCTV footage of the incident, in a bid to identify the man who they wish to speak to in connection with the burglary. PC Rebecca Rudden, of Greater Manchester Police, said the burglary, which occurred at about 1pm on October 16, was a 'targeted attack'. She said: 'We believe a man may have been acting as a look-out at a nearby bus stop while another walked into the home. The homeowner, who was gardening at the time of the incident, can be seen in the far left of the frame tipping out some rubbish, while the thief calmly walks out of the front door (top) and down the drive onto the road . The victim tips out his rubbish (far left) while the offender makes off (top centre) following the burglary . 'The victim was bent down gardening and did not see the man walk in. 'When he left, the 89-year-old was in the back garden and had not realised what happened. 'I would urge people to take a good look at the person in the image and if they recognise them, call police. 'This was a targeted attack against an elderly gentleman who had been saving and a substantial amount of money was taken.' Anyone with information should contact Greater Manchester Police on 101.","Thief brazenly walked into house while 89-year-old homeowner was in yard .

"It was a battle of claw versus jaw, but the king of the jungle reigned supreme in his battle against a crocodile. The two killing-machines fought over feeding rights at a Kenyan river in Samburu, Africa after the crocodile tried to take the lion's lunch - a dead elephant. The lion was among a pride that was about to eat the elephant when the crocodile crawled up and tried to take a bite. The lions then began to drive the beast away by clawing and biting at the armoured reptile's legs. Jaws versus claws: The lion and the crocodile square-off at a Kenyan river in Samburu, Africa, after the reptile tries to take the big cat's lunch . Paws for thought: The lion lifts one of its paws and prepares to strike the crocodile which lunges forward baring its teeth . Eventually the crocodile retreated to the safety of the deeper waters. Photographer Hung Ta, 50, captured the battle unfolding. He said: 'For a while there was a Mexican standoff with neither making the first move but I believe the lion was fearing for the safety of its cubs and made the first move. 'It wasn't long before other lions moved in and began to claw and bite at the legs of the crocodile all the while making sure to stay clear of its huge jaws. Dine in, but not takeaway: The lions guard the dead elephant and appear to be looking towards the water cautious of the crocodiles intentions . Lowest of the low: The crocodile slides along on its belly as a young lion hovers on the waters edge, keen to deter it from lunging futher . Fancy a pedicure? The lion nips at the reptiles claws as it thrashes about in pain, trying to edge back into the safety of the water . Two on one: An adult lion and a young cub leap at the crocodile whose open mouth looks big enough to swallow them whole . Back you go: A lion bites the soft underside of the reptile, left, as another stands on its back and attempts to push it away . On your tail: The crocodile seems to acknowledge defeat as three lions straddle its rear quarters and force it back into the water . 'The crocodile actually tried to get closer for a second time but was soon overwhelmed so it backed off.' Mr Hung said it was 'amazing' to watch the fight. He said: 'It's not very often these two predators fight and neither animal underestimated its opponent.'","A pride of lions were trying to eat a dead elephant when they noticed a crocodile had taken an interest in their meal .

"A former IRA intelligence officer has claimed in a new book that members of the Irish police force tipped-off senior republicans about a plan to arrest the entire organisation's leadership in 1974. Kieran Conway, who is now a barrister in the Irish Republic joined the IRA in the last 1960s and claims that senior Irish police officers colluded with the IRA. Mr Conway's book alleges that as well as members of the Irish police force, an Garda Siochana, the provisional IRA were also assisted by a top banker, a stock broker, a journalist as well as several mainstream politicians. Kieran Conway, pictured, claims the IRA received tip-offs from the Irish police force in advance of arrests . Mr Conway, who is now a barrister in Dublin, joined the IRA in the late 1960s served as an intelligence officer . Mr Conway told The Guardian: 'I think that the army council had particular contacts with those in the security area which weren't even shared with me. We had contacts in the law offices of the states and contacts in the upper echelons of the guards.' Mr Conway said much of the republican leadership was in talks with members of the Protestant clergy in Feakle, County Clare. He said: 'Take something like Feakle, the place was raided and they (the leadership) got away. Because  a tip-off was received that the special branch were on their way to Feakle and that tip-off came from within the Gardai. 'It wasn't just in 1974 and it wasn't just concentrated in border areas like Dundalk, it was some individuals but it was more widespread.' Mr Conway's allegations come as the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland reported that there was no evidence to suggest that the RUC had colluded with the IRA in the murder of Arthur Rafferty in 1974 in Belfast. The Ombudsman said that while there had been failures in the police investigation, there was no evidence to suggest any form of cover-up. A review by the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland found no evidence of collusion between the IRA, pictured, and the RUC over the murder of Arthur Rafferty who was shot in Belfast on August 15, 1975 . Dr Michael Maguire of the Police Ombudsman's office said: 'We have looked in great detail at all the available information and intelligence, both about the murder itself and about the various people family members thought were linked to it. 'We found no evidence that would indicate police knew about the planned attack beforehand and could have done something about it, or that anyone was protected from arrest or prosecution because they were a police informant.' Arthur Rafferty was shot at Newington Street close to its junction with the Limestone Road in north Belfast on August 15 1974 and died in hospital several weeks later. The IRA claimed responsibility for the fatal attack. In a complaint to the Ombudsman's office, a member of the Rafferty family alleged that police colluded with the killers by failing to investigate the murder properly in order to protect police informants within the IRA. They also claimed police had destroyed the murder weapon, lost significant exhibits and failed to pursue the names of five suspects which had been supplied to them. Dr Maguire said: 'Investigative failures are not in themselves automatic evidence of collusion. 'We did not find any evidence that police chose not to pursue relevant lines of inquiry or that information was withheld from the detectives investigating the murder.' The Ombudsman's investigation found that 12 spent cartridges and a bullet head were recovered from the scene by the RUC and military personnel, as was a piece of card with writing on it which was attached to a coat hanger which was also found. The report said although detectives were able to speak with Mr Rafferty in hospital several times and to his wife, the interviews did not open up any new leads. Mr Rafferty's family claimed that RUC officers protected the killers because they were informants in the IRA . Days after the attack, on September 23 1974, it was revealed police had received a report that a rifle, ammunition and clothing had been found in a flat in Newington Street and that forensics had linked the weapon to Mr Rafferty's murder and two other shooting incidents. A man was arrested in 1974, but the Ombudsman said there were no notes available to indicate whether or not this person was interviewed. Three years later, in 1977, police authorised the destruction of the rifle and ammunition which had been found. But in 1978, a police search of a social club in Belfast on an unconnected matter uncovered a handwritten document which appeared to be a debrief of Mr Rafferty's shooting. The document made reference to the involvement of three people, two of whom were subsequently arrested and interviewed. In 2005, a member of Mr Rafferty's family provided police with names of people they believed were involved in the murder but police later recorded that there was nothing to link them to the killing. In 2007, the same family member provided the Police Ombudsman's Office with the names of two people believed to be involved in the attack. The Ombudsman said records indicated that one of the suspects was in prison at the time of the murder, while the other one was in police custody. Dr Maguire concluded that police did not manage the crime scene properly and that critical evidence had not been preserved or examined. Similarly, he found no meaningful investigation into how police responded to the discovery of guns, ammunition and clothing. The Ombudsman said there was no evidence that the person who reported this material to police was ever interviewed; no rationale why police submitted the rifle and ammunition for examination but not the clothing, and no audit trail of what happened to any of these items.","Irish police tipped-off the IRA about planned arrests, a new book claims .

"A North Texas jury convicted a former public official Thursday of capital murder in a revenge plot against a district attorney, his wife and a top assistant who had prosecuted him for theft and ruined his career, prosecutors said. Eric Williams now faces a potential death sentence after he was convicted in the 2013 murder of Cynthia McLelland, the wife of slain Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland. Testimony in the trial involved the deaths of both McLellands, and Williams also is indicted in the death of assistant prosecutor Mark Hasse. Guilty: Eric Williams makes his way into the courtroom before closing arguments in his trial at the Rockwall County Courthouse in Rockwall, Texas on Thursday, December  4, 2014 . Legal Battle: Prosecutor Toby Shook (left) gives closing arguments during the Eric Williams capital murder trial as Matthew Seymour (right), Williams' defense lawyer talks about a bullet shell as he gives his closing arguments . Grief and anguish: Wyvonne McLelland, mother of Mike McLelland, gets emotional as the guilty verdict is read in the Eric Williams capital murder trial at the Rockwall County Courthouse in Rockwall, Texas on Thursday . Prosecutors took just three days to present their case against Williams, whom they called a 'ruthless killing machine' in closing arguments. His defense lawyers only made a closing argument and did not call witnesses. 'The case is so air tight, it sucked the oxygen, it sucked the energy out of any potential defense,' prosecutor Bill Wirskye said in closing arguments. After the verdict, Williams' brother-in-law, Zach Bellemare, said the defense team 'was terrible.' Defense attorneys and prosecutors declined to comment outside of court. The McLellands' bodies were found inside their rural home east of Dallas in March 2013. The couple had already changed to go to bed when Williams charged into the home and opened fire. Prosecutors say Williams shot Cynthia McLelland in the head, and he then shot Mike McLelland and stood over his body, firing repeatedly. Murdered: Williams shot dead District Attorney Mike McLelland, his wife, Cynthia, (left) and Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse (right) in 2013 . Forensics: James Jeffress, forensic scientist explains his findings of connecting the shells found at the crime scene of the McLelland's and the one found at a storage shed connected to Eric Williams . Circumstantial: Mark Wild a latent fingerprint examiner with the Texas Department of Public Safety gives testimony about the tests he performed on fingerprints found on items in a storage unit . Mike McLelland's mother, Wyvonne McLelland, wept as the verdict was read. Their deaths occurred two months after a masked gunman killed prosecutor Hasse outside a local courthouse building. Williams was a former justice of the peace who lost his job and his law license after McLelland and Hasse successfully prosecuted him for stealing three computer monitors from a county government building. Williams was convicted in March 2012, about 10 months before Hasse was killed. 'My life has taken a drastic turn,' Williams told a probation officer at the time. 'He lost his sitting as a justice of the peace, he lost his law license, everything he worked for. The law was his life,' Bellemare said, adding that he believed Williams was innocent. Incriminating: Photo of evidence collected at a storage unit connected to Eric Williams is shown on the screen during the trial of Eric Williams . Expert: James Jeffress, forensic scientist explains letters on one of the bullets found in a storage shed connected to  Williams . The case was built on circumstantial evidence against Williams, and the weapon used to kill the McLellands has never been found. 'It's a fantasy. It's a guess. There's no proof of it,' defense attorney Matthew Seymour said in closing arguments. But prosecutors showed jurors evidence from a storage locker he had a friend rent in secret. Inside the locker was the suspected getaway vehicle, more than 30 guns and police tactical gear. A dive team that searched a local lake also found a gun believed to have been used to shoot Hasse and a mask Williams allegedly wore. Scene: Interior crime scene photo of the house shown during the Eric Williams trial that show the path of the bullets once he attacked . Multiple wounds: Gunshot wound evidence pertaining to Mike McLelland during the Eric Williams capital murder trial . Williams' estranged wife, Kim, has been indicted for capital murder, though her attorney has said she is cooperating with prosecutors. She did not testify in the trial. She's accused of having driven the getaway vehicle after Hasse's killing. Prosecutors also found a password in Williams' home to an account on the Crime Stoppers tips website used to send a partial confession. One message presented in court said, 'Do we have your full attention now?' Prosecutors decided to pursue the three murder charges individually, because if Williams was acquitted in the death of Cynthia McLelland, they then could try him in the slaying of Mike McLelland. Had prosecutors not won either case, they would bring Williams to trial in Hasse's death. The trial was held in neighboring Rockwall County due to the attention the case received in Kaufman County. The sentencing phase begins Monday.","Eric Williams, 47, found guilty of capital murder after a prosecutor called him 'a ruthless killing machine' who had carefully plotted his crimes .

"There were nearly 6,000 victims of sexual assault in the U.S. military this year, up eight per cent from last year, according to a new study. The Pentagon report, based on an anonymous survey and shared with the Associated Press, also found that retaliation remains an ongoing problem  in  stern military culture that emphasizes rank, loyalty and strength. Indeed, 60per cent of the women who reported some type of unwanted sexual contact complained about social backlash from co-workers or other service members. Scroll down for video . Ongoing problem: There were nearly 6,000 victims of sexual assault in the U.S. military this year, up eight per cent from last year, according to a new study . Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., a leading advocate for improvements in protecting victims of sexual assault, pointed to the retaliation figures as troubling. 'For a year now we have heard how the reforms in the previous defense bill were going to protect victims, and make retaliation a crime,' she said. 'It should be a screaming red flag to everyone when 62per cent of those who say they reported a crime were retaliated against - nearly two-thirds - the exact same number as last year.' Under fire from Congress, Pentagon leaders and the White House, the military services have launched programs to encourage reporting, provide better care for victims, step up prosecutions and urge troops to intervene when they see others in threatening situations. 'Pending the report's public release Thursday, assuming news accounts are correct - reporting of assaults being up and incidents of assault being down are exactly the combination we're looking for. 'I'm sure there's more work to do, and I'm anxious to hear how victims feel about the services and support offered to them when they report an assault,' said Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo. In May, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel declared sexual assaults as a 'clear threat' to service members and he ordered a number of new initiatives, including the review of alcohol sales and policies. He said the review must address the risks of alcohol being used as a tool by predators to ply a victim with drinks before attacking. Speaking out: In May, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel declared sexual assaults as a 'clear threat' to service members and he ordered a number of new initiatives, including the review of alcohol sales and policies . According to the new Pentagon survey, some of that may be taking hold. Officials said an overwhelming majority of those who filled out the survey said they took action to prevent an assault when they saw a risky situation. The services also created hotlines, plastering phone numbers and contact information for sexual assault prevention officers across military bases, including inside the doors of bathroom stalls. And they expanded sexual assault prevention training, hired victims' advocates and response coordinators, and have tried to curtail drinking, which is often a factor in assaults. The new report comes as Congress continues to press for an overhaul of the military justice system to change the way that sexual assault cases are handled. Defense officials discussed the results with the White House on Tuesday and were expected to release the reports publicly on Thursday. The Pentagon cites the spike in sexual assault cases as increased trust in the military justice system. According to the latest report, one in four victims of sexual assault reported the crime in 2014 compared to one in ten two years ago.","The new Pentagon report was based on an anonymous survey .

"Eight primary school children were rushed to hospital and more than 20 were treated by paramedics after a lorry slammed into the side of their school bus as they travelled home from a carol concert. The 40-seater bus was pulling out of a side street across a busy road  on Tuesday afternoon when it was hit by a HGV, leaving the side of the coach crumpled and windows smashed. The incident took place as the pupils from St Nicholas Church of England Middle School in Pinyin, Worcestershire, were travelling through Pershore after attending a carol concert at Pershore Abbey. Eight primary school children were rushed to hospital after a lorry slammed into the side of their school bus as they travelled home from a carol concert in Pershore, Worcestershire . The bus was pulling out of a side street across a busy road just after 3pm on Tuesday when it was hit by a HGV, leaving the side of the coach crumpled and windows smashed . Eight of the children and the driver  were taken to hospital. One was taken on a spinal board after complaining of neck pain. The driver of the bus was also taken to Worcester Royal Hospital. The other 19 children were checked over by medics at a private house nearby and were reunited with their parents at the school. Three ambulances, as well as two rapid response paramedics, had been called to the scene. There was also a paramedic area support officer, a doctor and the Air Ambulance. The children, all between nine and 11 years-old, were travelling back to their school when the crash happened on the B4084. The road was closed for the rest of the day and police were asking motorists to avoid the area where possible. Parents were alerted to the incident by text messages sent from the school and the remaining uninjured students were taken back to St Nicholas on a mini bus where they were reunited with their parents. An ambulance team were at the school briefing parents on a one-to-one basis on the aftercare of their children. In a statement on its website, the school said that all the children from the school were 'doing well' and were back in school today. The executive headteacher Andrew Best said there had been a special school assembly held this morning and that it was a 'blessing' that no one was seriously injured. It said: 'The children, from our school, who were taken to hospital yesterday, with minor cuts and bruises after their bus was involved in a collision with a lorry in Pershore, are all doing well and have been back in school today. 'Nineteen other pupils were taken to a private house nearby, where they were assessed by local doctors before being transported back to school. An ambulance team were at the school briefing parents on a one-to-one basis on the aftercare of their children.' Mr Best added that he wanted to thank the emergency services for their 'swift and very professional work'. He said. 'Everyone's priority was to ensure that the children and staff involved received the best care possible. Nine people - eight children and the driver - were taken to hospital, one on a spinal board after complaining of neck pain . 'We contacted all parents of injured children by telephone and maintained contact with other parents about the incident by text. 'The remaining uninjured pupils were taken back to school in our mini bus where they were reunited with their parents. 'And this morning we have held a special assembly in school for all children and staff about the incident. 'It was a blessing that no one was seriously injured yesterday, but it has been a big shock to us all. 'Two counsellors are in school all day today, to talk to pupils affected and any parents are invited to come into school and discuss any issues as well.' A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We were called to reports of a large number of patients following a collision between a coach and a lorry. 'Over 40 children and adults were on the coach at the time of the crash with the children believed to be between nine and 11 years old. 'A total of 27 school children were assessed away from the road side. 'One boy, complaining of neck pain, was treated at the scene and immobilised with a neck collar and spinal board. He was transferred to Worcester Royal Hospital. 'Three further children and the man who was driving the coach all received treatment at the scene for minor injuries and were conveyed to the same hospital. 'The remaining children were all checked over by the doctor and ambulance crews and were discharged on scene. 'The children were transported back to school on two separate minibuses, where a number of ambulance staff joined them to give advice to their parents who had come to collect them. 'The lorry driver was uninjured in the incident.' The crash follows another school bus which overturned in Hereford last month, while it was taking 53 pupils to school. The coach overturned and slid 10ft (3.1m) down an embankment on November 10 and students had to scramble out of windows to get free of the wreckage. West Mercia police said no arrests had been made.","Bus was pulling out of side street onto busy road when it was hit by a HGV .

"Five of the BBC's most senior bosses were handed jobs with pay totalling £1.8million-a-year without  the roles ever being advertised, it was revealed today. Lord Hall, who earns £450,000-a-year as Director General, did not have to apply for his job and then brought in several other executives in the same way. The majority of his senior management team are also graduates of Oxford and Cambridge, with critics saying it shows the BBC is run by 'an old boys' network'. Lord Hall was parachuted in after the Jimmy Savile scandal shook the corporation in 2012 but the Director General job was not advertised. Senior posts: Director General Lord Hall was parachuted in in 2012 and then appointed former colleague Anne Bulford without advertising her post . Controversy: A senior backbench MP has accused the BBC, based at Broadcasting House in London, pictured, of being a self-serving old boys' network . As a result of the Savile scandal, Helen Boaden was forced out of her previous job, head of BBC news because she dumped the Newsnight investigation into his abuse. She was appointed BBC radio chief instead on £352,900. Lord Hall's former Royal Opera House colleague Anne Bulford was given the managing director for finance and operations on £395,000 without the job being advertised. British employment law does not insist that businesses advertise jobs when they become available. But critics believe this can end up discriminating against those who may be suitable. Or meaning that jobs can be handed out to friends or people from a particular group or background. The Equality and Human Rights Commission says: 'If an employer doesn’t advertise at all or advertises in a way that won’t reach people with a particular protected characteristic, this might in some situations lead to indirect discrimination, unless the employer can objectively justify their approach. 'This is because not advertising or only advertising in a very limited way may stop people with a particular protected characteristic finding out about a job, which could count as worse treatment'. And former cabinet minister James Purnell was offered the £295,000 job of director of strategy and digital have previously worked at the BBC as head of corporate planning from 1995 to 1997 under former director general Lord Birt, a friend of Lord Hall. Tim Davie was acting director general during the Savile crisis and was then became CEO of BBC Worldwide and Director Global, on £400,000, earning £670,000 in total last year. It came after it emerged the BBC pays 11 of its most senior bosses twice as much as the Prime Minister and a further 80 executives take home more than David Cameron’s £142,500-a-year salary. Conservative MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: 'The BBC is a self-serving old boys' network. 'The BBC has recently said they have cut their senior management to the bone and there are no more savings to be made there but it’s only at the BBC where you could cut senior management to the bone and end up with more people paid more than the Prime Minister than before you started. ‘It’s just extraordinary and goes to show how much fat there is. ‘What the BBC should do is be cutting out all of these managers, most of who if they disappeared no one would notice, and start delivering some value for money to the licence fee payer.’ Bosses: Helen Boaden was moved to Director of radio in the fallout of the Savile scandal while former Labour MP James Purnell was offered an unadvertised role . The BBC said today that it does sometimes not advertise posts to avoid expensive recruitment processes. The spokesman added that one in three of all executives are Oxford or Cambridge graduates, which is lower than some other sectors. She added: 'These appointments were widely reported on at the time. We appoint the best people wherever they come from. Sometimes where people are uniquely suited to the role there is no need for a lengthy and costly recruitment processes.'

"A 1962 Nobel prize for the discovery of the structure of DNA has sold at auction for $4.7 million, a world auction record for any Nobel prize. Christie's says the gold medal won by James Watson was purchased yesterday by a buyer who wished to remain anonymous. The New York City auction house says it's the first Nobel medal to be offered at auction by a living recipient. Watson made the 1953 discovery with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins. The 1962 Nobel prize won by James Watson for the discovery of the structure of DNA has sold at auction for $4.7 million, a world auction record for any Nobel prize . Watson's 1962 Nobel Prize medal for his role in the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson made the 1953 discovery with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins; Crick's medal sold in 2004 for $2.2million . Crick's Nobel prize sold last year at Heritage Auctions for $2.2 million. He died in 2004. Watson had a very public fall from grace in 2007, at the age of 79, after he began making racist and sexiest remarks in the media. The comments led to him being shunned from the scientific community as well as the general public. He told one Sunday paper he was 'inherently gloomy' about the prospect of Africa because 'all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – whereas all the testing says not really.' Watson went on to say the divide in intelligence had also been witnessed by people who had black employees. Later defending the comments, he said he was not 'a racist in a conventional way'. Watson meeting former Prime Minister Tony Blair at a reception in Downing Street in April 2003 . A short time later Watson was fired from his position as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory. He was also said to have been relieved of his position on a number of boards, and to have not given any public lectures since. But his downfall can't only be contributed to his comments on Africa. He has talked-down Rosalind Franklin's contribution to the work on DNA and even said women aren't 'as effective' at science as men. Part of the proceeds from the sale will go to the University of Chicago, Clare College Cambridge, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Long Island Land Trust and other charities.","James Watson made the discovery with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins .

"The average British man has grown over the past 60 years and is now taller and heavier than his Fifties counterpart. In 1954, a typical British male was just over 5ft 7in tall, weighed 11st 6lbs and had a chest of 37 inches and a waist of 34 inches. He wore size seven shoes, had a collar size of 14. Then and now: In 1954, a typical British male was just over 5ft 7in tall and weighed 11st 6lbs, like Marlon Brando, left. Today, Brad Pitt typifies the body shape of Mr Average, at 5ft 9in, weighing just over 12st . But over the past 60 years the shape has changed significantly and 1950s men would sit in the shadow of modern men. Today, the average man is 5ft 9in, weighs 12st 6lbs and has a chest of 42in and a waist of 37in. He wears size nine shoes, has a collar size of 16. As well as being larger, modern man is also stronger and healthier with a life expectancy of 79 - 11 years more than the average life expectancy for a man in the Fifties. The changing shape is perfectly demonstrated by Fifties movie star star Marlon Brando and current Hollywood A-lister Brad Pitt. Healthier: Brad Pitt represents the average modern man and can expect to live 11 years longer than his Fifties counterpart . At 5ft 9in, Pitt typifies the body shape of the modern Mr Average - weighing just over 12st with a 43 inch chest. His 1954 equivalent was Marlon Brando, who starred in On The Waterfront in the same year. Brando was 5ft 7in and weighed just over 11st in his heyday. He had a much less muscular physique than modern movie stars. Oliver Tezcan, chief executive of online menswear brand, The Idle Man, which researched data on changing body shapes from government statistics said the fashion industry has had to adapt fast to the changing shape of Mr Average. Not so macho: Men in the Fifties, as portrayed in TV show Mad Men, were shorter and less muscular than men in 2014 . Measuring up: Men today have a 37in waist on average compared to  34 in in 1954 . He said: 'It is extraordinary how much Mr Average has changed in the last 60 years. He has gone from being what we might consider a bit of wimp these days into a taller, more rugged muscleman. 'That has presented real challenges for designers and fashion brands. 'It means that suits are being cut in a completely different way to reflect this changing body shape, with much bigger sizes in the upper body. 'Collar sizes have gone up markedly to reflect modern man's much more muscular neck.' Tezcan said that 2014's Mr Average was far more body conscious than his 1954 equivalent. He added: 'He is likely to exercise at least twice a week and eat and drink about a quarter more than he did in the Fifties - consuming 2,500 calories a day compared to 2,000 calories back then.' Difference in 60 years: Men have grown taller, heavier and wider but will now live for longer . 33 per cent of homes had a washing machine . 10 per cent of homes had a telephone . Average wage was £10 a week . Life expectancy was 68 years for men and 71 for women . 96 per cent of homes have a washing machine . 72 per cent of us have smartphones . Average wage is £509 . Life expectancy for men is 79 years and 83 years for women .","In 1954, a typical British male was just over 5ft 7in tall, weighing 11st 6lbs .

"The city of Cleveland's police department is set to be overhauled after federal investigators concluded that officers use excessive and unnecessary force far too often and have endangered the public and their fellow officers with their recklessness. A two-year investigation by the Justice Department, released on Thursday, found that Cleveland police use guns, Tasers, 'impact weapons,' pepper spray and their fists in excess, unnecessarily or in retaliation. In some cases unnecessary force was 'in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution,' claimed the report. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, right, appeared at a news conference Thursday to announce the findings along with  Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams, left, and Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, center . Officers also use excessive force on those 'who are mentally ill or in crisis,' the Justice Department said. Accountability, or the lack thereof, was a reoccurring theme of the report. Of the period reviewed, 2010-2013, the investigation found that officers were suspended on only six occasions for improper use of force. 'Discipline is so rare that no more than 51 officers out of a sworn force of 1,500 were disciplined in any fashion in connection with a use of force incident over a three-and-a half-year period,' the report said. More disturbing was an admission by investigators carrying out reports into the use of deadly force that they always sought to show the officer involved in the best possible light. 'Deeply troubling to us was that some of the specially trained investigators who are charged with conducting unbiased reviews of officers' use of deadly force admitted to us that they conduct their investigations with the goal of casting the accused officer in the most positive light possible,' said the report. Last week, hundreds of people blocked a Cleveland freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old boy, by a white officer outside a Cleveland recreation center . Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and the U.S. Justice Department signed an agreement on Thursday that said both sides will work toward the appointment of a court-appointed monitor to oversee reform. 'We understand the progress we seek will not come over night,' Attorney General Eric Holder said at a press conference to announce the findings. The Justice Department found a systemic pattern of reckless and inappropriate use of force by officers and cited concerns about search-and-seizure practices. Jackson was among those who asked the department to conduct the inquiry. It also said officers frequently violated people's civil rights because of faulty tactics, inadequate training and a lack of supervision and accountability. Officers' excessive use of force has created deep mistrust in Cleveland, especially in the black community, the report concluded. 'We saw too many incidents in which officers accidentally shot someone either because they fired their guns accidentally or because they shot the wrong person,' the report said. In November 2012 police officers fired 137 shots into a car killing 43-year-old driver Timothy Russell, left, and 30-year-old passenger Malissa Williams in the parking lot of a suburban middle school . The federal investigation was prompted by several highly publicized police encounters, chiefly the deaths of two unarmed people who were fatally wounded when police officers fired 137 shots into their car at the end of a high-speed pursuit in November 2012. In that incident, the Justice Department said, police began chasing Timothy Russell and passenger Malissa Williams after officers and witnesses thought they heard a gunshot coming from their car as they drove by a court building. The report said it now appears that what they heard was the car backfiring. More than 100 officers engaged in a chase of the two unarmed suspects in violation of division policy. After a 25-minute chase that reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended in an East Cleveland school parking lot, 13 officers fired 137 rounds hitting Russell and Williams more than 20 times each, the report said. 'The officers, who were firing on the car from all sides, reported believing that they were being fired at by the suspects. It now appears that those shots were being fired by fellow officers,' the Justice Department wrote. A two-year investigation by the Justice Department, released on Thursday, found that Cleveland police use guns, Tasers, 'impact weapons,' pepper spray and their fists in excess, unnecessarily or in retaliation . The report comes amid inflamed tensions between police and residents in several cities where white officers have killed young blacks, including in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri. All those events have raised urgent national questions about the sense of trust between police and communities, Holder said. Last week, hundreds of people blocked a Cleveland freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a black 12-year-old boy, by a white officer outside a Cleveland recreation center. Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams has defended Rice's shooting, saying he reached for an air pistol that was 'indistinguishable from a real firearm.' The Justice Department has opened civil rights investigations into the practices of some 20 police departments in the past five years, and it is reviewing both the Ferguson police department and the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City. It's also currently enforcing more than a dozen agreements to overhaul police department practices nationwide. The report comes amid inflamed tensions between police and residents in several cities where white officers have killed young blacks, including in New York City and Ferguson, Missouri, (pictured above) 'We have seen in city after city where we have engaged that meaningful change is possible,' Holder said. Cleveland and the Justice Department will begin negotiating an agreement that will be submitted to a federal judge outlining the scope of reforms, to include the appointment of an independent monitor. A joint statement signed by city and federal officials said Cleveland's mayor, safety director and police chief 'will always retain full authority' to run the police department. Jackson said on Thursday that the city disagreed with some of the facts and conclusion in the report, but he did not dispute the overall findings. The report notes that the Justice Department first looked at Cleveland officers' use of deadly force in 2002 and that an agreement was reached two years later on how such policies would be changed. There was no court order or independent monitor assigned then. The Justice Department began its investigation in March 2013 and reviewed nearly 600 use-of-force incidents - both lethal and not - that occurred between 2010 and 2013. The report notes that Cleveland police officials did not provide many of the documents sought by federal investigators. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said the details of the 58-page report were difficult to hear. 'People of this city need to know we will work to make the police department better,' he said.","Two-year investigation, released on Thursday, found that Cleveland police use guns, Tasers, 'impact weapons,' pepper spray and their fists in excess .

"A foreign currency trader accused of masterminding a £5.5m fraud to fund his playboy lifestyle was dubbed 'King Popper' after he sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne at revellers in a nightclub. Alex Hope, 25, allegedly concocted the £5.5m Ponzi fraud which he used to fund his gambling habit and penchant for spending tens of thousands of pounds on champagne at exclusive nightclubs, Southwark Crown Court heard. The former catering manager racked up a bill of £2m in just 13 months after visiting the clubs, buying large bottles of champagne and going to an exclusive Mayfair casino. Prosecutors described Hope's spending - which included splashing out almost £50,000 on a single bottle of champagne on one occasion - as 'eye-watering'. Today jurors were shown a video of his alleged activities. Scroll down for video . Alex Hope was dubbed 'King Popper' after he allegedly sprayed £32,000 worth of champagne in a club in London. The former catering manager is accused of masterminding a £5.5m Ponzi-style fraud . A video of the Champagne Spray event shows dozens of bottles of champagne which revellers spray on each other . Hope features in the six-minute video in a drenched blue t-shirt and black beads as champagne is sprayed . They said the amount of money he was spending must have represented  part of investors' money who had been persuaded to invest in his scheme after he offered huge returns. Hope reinvented himself as a currency markets expert and was promoted by Raj Von Badlo as a talented trader and financial whizzkid, it is claimed. Von Badlo has already admitted enticing people into fraud and making misleading statements. The 25-year-old set himself up as a successful Forex and currency trader, promising investors huge returns on cash funnelled into his scheme. In just 13 months he managed to take £5.5m. But many of his investors lost considerable sums of money - including Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott who lost £50,000. He is accused of running the scheme in a 'Ponzi fashion' - using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave it. The court heard that on one evening alone he spent £32,000 at the five-star Grange Hotel near St Paul’s Cathedral earning him the title ‘King Popper’. Prosecutor Sarah Clarke said: ‘According to the receipts he managed to spend about £32,000 in one night in February 2012 at something called the Champagne Spray event. ‘The was an event that was organised where people could go to this hotel and buy bottles of champagne and, in effect, spray them over each other.’ In a video shown to the jury Hope is seen wearing a drenched blue t-shirt and black beads as dozens of bottles of expensive champagne are sprayed around the room by revellers. And in a further example of excessive spending Hope spent almost £50,000 on a Midas sized bottle of champagne while partying at the Playground Hilton in Liverpool. Hope has been accused of masterminding the Ponzi style fraud to fund his champagne and playboy lifestyle . ‘Mr Hope spent £45,987 in one night, and the lion’s share of that went on this bottle, this Midas sized bottle, of Ace of Spades champagne that was opened effectively as a publicity stunt by him,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘The nightclub PR in fact ran up a bill of something like £200,000 and then it was put out in the press that this high-roller spent £200,000 in one night. ‘The truth was that he only spent a mere £45,000, £40,000 of that going on this bottle of champagne,’ she said. On another night he spent £65,113 at the Aura nightclub in Mayfair, close to Buckingham Palace and the Ritz. Hope also funnelled just under £1m to the Palm Beach Casino, whose website brags it is the ‘most exclusive casino in Mayfair’. Between joining the casino in November 2011 and his arrest in April the following year, he visited the lavish venue 81 times, jurors heard. Dozens of revellers are shown throughout the video spraying champagne and waving bottles with sparklers . He lost £353,600 after playing games where more than £5m was passed backwards and forwards over the table, it was said. ‘What that figure does seem to suggest is that he was an extensive and prolific gambler during that period,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘The amounts of money that were being lost... when he lost you may think he lost big.’ But £604,400 simply disappeared from the cash deposited with the casino, probably in cash withdrawals, and has not been traced, the court heard. ‘Were any of the investors told that their money was going to be put into a casino and then withdrawn in cash for it to disappear?’ asked Ms Clarke. Receipts unearthed at Hope’s address showed just a ‘snapshot’ of his allegedly wild spending. Hope is shown in the video where he is interviewed and asked if he is enjoying the champagne event . ‘The sums of money being spent is, the prosecution say, eye-watering and must have represented in whole or at least in very substantial part investors’ money and again you might want to ask yourselves if any of the investors were told that is what was happening to their money,’ said Ms Clarke. Hope also treated himself to luxury trips around the world, travelling to Miami, New York and Dubai, jurors heard. He spent £130,327 on a stay at beach front resort the Fontainebleu in Miami and racked up bills of £38,838 on night at the Cirque du Soir in Dubai. Ms Clarke added: ‘The Fontainebleu Miami trip was not the only luxury foreign travel experience that he treated himself to during this period with, we say, the investors’ money. ‘Bear in mind of course this was really a relatively short period of time as well. ‘We know he was enjoying them because he recorded some short films on his mobile of one particular trip he enjoyed to New York,’ she said. The video shows revellers at Champagne Spray, held at the five star Grange Hotel near St Paul's Cathedral . Revellers are shown soaking wet after dozens of bottles are sprayed around the room and at eachother . The video shows Hope in his suite at the five-star Trump SoHo hotel in New York. He pans around the luxurious suite and ends pointing the camera at the bed which is strewn with money and designer clothes. ‘Here is the bedroom,’ he says, ‘just being silly, laying some money out, you can see the 50s and the 100s. ‘Did a little bit of shopping today as you can see, bought some Ralph [Lauren], bought some trainers as well, bought some Burberry... yeah, this is me.’ Other short videos taken from his mobile show him panning stacks of cash, in one he brags ‘£28,000 profit, boys’ and in a second ‘£50,000 profit, boys, ten, 20, 30, 40’ before the video cuts out. Nearly £64,000 was spent on ‘upper class’ travel to destinations including Las Vegas and New York, it is said. And the spending did not stop there, with Hope allegedly using investors’ cash to fund a taste for designer clothes - particularly Christian Louboutin shoes and watches. Hope, of Canary Wharf, is on trial for fraud at Southwark Crown Court and has denied the single charge . Ms Clarke added: ‘This gives you a snapshot of the ways in which he was enjoying himself, treating himself with investors’ money during the period of the fraud. ‘His trading really wasn’t keeping pace with what was coming in from investors and what was going out. As the money from investors was increasing and his expenditure was increasing, in fact the amount of money that was being deposited on trading platforms in the first place was drying up to virtually nil.’ Jurors heard Christopher Millard, a retired teacher, ploughed £25,000 of his own money into Hope’s scheme which saw him lose £15,000. Hope promised him: ‘I am a man of my word, I have never not paid anyone, let’s get that straight first and foremost.’ Jamaican international footballer Marvin Elliott, 30, was also drawn into the scheme. Hope is pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court where he is on trial for fraud, which he denies . The midfielder, who plays for Crawley Town in Football League One, handed £50,000 to Hope after he promised 50 percent returns in just three months, but lost his investment, jurors previously heard. Ms Clarke said Hope told a ‘pack of lies’ and added his trading was ‘spectacularly unsuccessful’. Van Badlo, who does not appear in the dock with Hope, acted as the ‘promoter’ for the fund. He used PR companies to present Hope as a ‘talented and successful trader’, drawing £4,292,000 into the alleged scam.The pair also allegedly blew £3,000 a month of client’s cash on publicity provided by London PR firm Full Portion Media, jurors heard. Hope set himself up as a successful Forex and currency trader, promising investors huge returns on cash funnelled into his scheme. Through his deception, he took an ‘eye-watering’ £5.5m in just 13 months, between March 2011 and 3 April 2012, jurors heard. ‘The truth was this was not a successful trading scheme, in fact it wasn’t a trading scheme really at all - it was a fraud,’ said Ms Clarke. ‘Mr Hope was not a successful trader, investors funds were in fact paid into his personal bank account and they were used by him as his personal piggy bank,’ said Ms Clarke. Hope was allegedly using new investors’ funds to pay off those who wanted to leave the scheme, in the classic Ponzi fashion. Hope has admitted violating City rules which state he must have a licence from to work on behalf of others, although he is allowed to trade currency for his own profit. After suspicions around his Forex fund grew, the Financial Services Authority intervened and arrested him. Hope, of Canary Wharf, east London, denies one charge of fraud. He has pleaded guilty to carrying on a regulated activity when not an authorised by the FSA. Von Badlo, of Buckinghamshire, admitted making misleading statements and communicating an invitation or inducement to encourage investment activity following the collapse of the first trial. Jurors were told this is a retrial and that jurors at the first trial were discharged before retiring to consider their verdicts. The trial continues.

"A world leader in aging research has died aged 73 following a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer. Dr Stephen Coles spent his career studying the reasons why supercentenarians - or those who live to 110 or more - survived as long as they did. The longtime University of California Los Angeles professor died Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, and his body is set to be cryopreserved in the hope of future revival. Pioneer: Dr Stephen Coles, a world leader in aging research has died aged 73, following a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer . He is survived by his wife Natalie, daughter Electra McBurnie, and one granddaughter, Cailyn McBurnie. Coles' colleagues described him as a pioneer in the field of gerontology. His aim was to learn how to slow 'and ultimately reverse' human aging within 20 years by studying the genomes and DNA of the world's oldest living human beings. He conducted much of his work through the Gerontology Research Group, which he founded in 1990 and printed more than 100 scientific journals. Robert Young, who worked with Coles for 15 years, said that the scientist believed the primary driver of longevity was biological and not caused by the environment. 'He had 110-year-olds, and they smoked cigarettes,' Young said. 'Not that it's OK to do bad things, but that the people who lived longest are the ones who had biological predisposition for living the longest.' John Adams, another colleague, said Coles was an outgoing person with various interests. 'Although the effects of the chemotherapy and the treatments were debilitating, he remained mentally sharp. I was amazed at his strength and resilience,' Adams said. Coles married his second wife, Natalie, in 2007 and the two worked together on scientific research. Coles lived in Los Angeles but was in Arizona toward the end of his life so he could be put in cryopreservation when he died. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on Christmas Eve, 2012 and underwent surgery to remove the tumor. However, ultimately treatment was unsuccessful.","Dr Stephen Coles spent his career studying the reasons why super-centenarians survived as long as they did .

"A team of West Coast chefs celebrated Thanksgiving in an over-the-top way by creating a protein monstrosity that makes the decadent turducken seem practically austere by comparison. The epic, artery-clogging Roast Beast, which was served up at Bourbon Steak and Pub in Santa Clara, California, on Thanksgiving Day, combined in itself seven different types of protein all mounted on a massive rotisserie and cooked to greasy perfection. The meaty menace, which has been given the moniker 'lambpigcow' on Twitter, was made up of 24 quail; 12 chickens; 8 ducks; 6 turkeys; 2 lambs; a pig and a blanket-size side of wagyu beef butterflied open to wrap all the other ingredients. Not your grandma's Thanksgiving dinner: Bourbon Steak and Pub restaurant in Santa Clara, California, cooked up this meaty monstrosity dubbed the Roast Beat for Thanksgiving last week . Meat madness: The culinary madmen combined 24 quails; 12 chickens; 8 ducks; 6 turkeys; 2 lambs; a pig and a blanket-size side of wagyu beef for the gargantuan dish . Unusual cooking tools: The colossal meat course was bundled with a 20-foot metal garden fence . Burning at the stake: The cooks required a huge rotisserie to cook the meaty beast to perfection . To keep everything in place during the hours-long roasting process, the mad culinary geniuses at the Santa Clara eatery bundled the colossal meat course with a 20-foot metal garden fence, secured it in place with eight stainless steel clamps, and mounted it on an enormous rotisserie. Besides the various layers of poultry and meat, the beastly creation also included chestnut and turkey sausage stuffing. The mastermind behind the epic dish was Seattle chef David Varley, formerly of Bourbon Steak and Pub, who returned to his old haunt last week to oversee the creation of the gargantuan roast. Varley's Seattle restaurant, RN17, and Bourbon Steak and Pub located at the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium, are both owned by chef and restaurateur Michael Mina.

Mastermind: The Roast Beast was the brainchild of Seattle chef David Varley, formerly of Bourbon Steak and Pub, who returned to his old restaurant to orchestrate the tailgate . Dinner is served! The final product was served to hungry football fans along with a pair of turkeys, a half dozen Seattle sea chickens and a gravy fountain . Varley’s edible colossus dubbed the Roast Feast was served up at the Thanksgiving Tailgate party after the Seattle Seahawks beat the 49ers 19-3 in San Francisco. The hulking slab of meaty goodness was presented alongside a pair of plump turkeys, a half dozen Seattle sea chickens in honor of the Seahawks - who ended up defeating their San Francisco opponents 19-3 - and a gravy fountain . ‘I'm taking a few years off from working on thanksgiving after this,’ David Varley joked on Instagram after the holiday dinner. The mad culinary scientists at the Bourbon Steak and Pub in Santa, Clara, California, brought together 24 quails; 12 chickens; 8 ducks; 6 turkeys; 2 lambs; a pig and a blanket-size side of wagyu beef for one epic dish dubbed the 'Roast Beast.' The preparation of the tailgate feast required a 20-foot metal fence, clamps and a massive rotisserie to cook the gargantuan roast to perfection. The birds used in the preparation were stuffed with a mixture of chestnut and turkey sausage. A team of cooks butterflied a side of beef and used it to wrap all the other ingredients, securing the entire creation with the metal fence.","The roast was prepared at Bourbon Steak and Pub in Santa Clara, California, for Thanksgiving tailgate celebrating 49ers-Seahawkes football game .

"A designer is turning roadkill into high-end fashion in an attempt to prove that it is possible to source cruelty-free fur. Patricia Paquin, the Vermont-based founder of fashion label Petite Mort, picks up discarded animal carcasses from the side of the road and turns the skins into a variety of beautiful fur accessories, from leg warmers to hand muffs which are all made to measure and range in price from $380 to $1,000. 'It's so much a part of everyday life to see these animals,' Paquin told Modern Farmer of her decision to start working with roadkill. 'Who of us doesn't look away? You don't want to see it because when you fully soak in the meaning of what happened, it's emotionally draining.' 'It's ethical': Designer Pamela Paquin uses roadkill carcasses to create her designs in order to prove that it is possible to source ethical fur . And while some might be shocked at Paquin's slightly bizarre choice of materials, she points out that more than seven times as many animals die as a result of being hit by a car every year, than are killed for their fur each year. According to Culture Change, 1 million animals a day are killed by cars - or 365 million a year - in comparison to the 50 million which die as a result of fashion's ever-present need for fur. 'The scale of it is so overwhelming — you can't possibly wrap your head around the suffering that went into those numbers,' Paquin added. So high are America's roadkill numbers, that there has been a serious increase in the number of people turning to discarded roadside carcasses as a cheap source of meat. Last year saw a surge in 'roadkill cuisine' which is being marketed by experts as the 'ethical way to eat meat'. When it comes to fashion, however, Paquin's set-up is completely unique, and something which has been years in the making. Cash for carcasses: Pamela's custom-made designs range in price from $380 to $1,000 . Having finally decided to take the plunge and set up her business - after returning to the US following a seven-year stint living and working in Denmark - Paquin turned to a local taxidermist in Vermont, who taught her how to skin the discarded animals. 'We both had a shot of whiskey, I put some peppermint oil under my nose, and we found a branch in the woods to hang this thing from,' she said of her first experience skinning an animal - a raccoon which she had found at the side of the road. 'It was super intense.' While the process of preparing the furs might seem slightly brutal, Paquin's love and respect for animals is evident. Drawing on her Native American heritage, the designer blesses each body with a prayer to honor the animal spirit, before returning them to nature, leaving the animals in the woods near her studio. 'It was super intense': Pamela asked a local taxidermist to teach her how to skin the animals properly . And it seems that the fashion industry is staring to cotton on to the idea of ethical fur; Paquin's business is booming and orders for her bespoke roadkill designs are coming in thick and fast. Thus far, she has fashioned everything from hats to gloves out of her roadkill furs, marking each one with a specially-designed silver disc so that they know it is a one-of-a-kind, ethical product. 'People need to look at the fur and say okay, that’s Petite Mort, it’s an ethical fur,' she says of the distinctive label.","Pamela Paquin founded fashion label Petite Mort in an attempt to show animal-lovers that it is possible to source cruelty-free furs .

"Archbishop Welby (pictured) said the abuse stemmed from a time when television did not 'make too much fuss' about the sexual exploitation of children . The Archbishop of Canterbury said today that the television industry condoned an era of ‘nightmare’ child abuse. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said the Church of England is trying to clear up the legacy of an age in which the sexual abuse of children was considered ‘relatively acceptable’ In an interview in which he spoke about the Church’s efforts to deal with past abuse by its own clergy, the Archbishop said the crimes stemmed from the time when television and organisations in other areas did not ‘make too much fuss’ about the sexual exploitation of children. His charge against the television industry follows a two-year period in which a number of former BBC stars have been accused of serious sexual offences and the Corporation has come under fierce criticism for its failure to curb the criminal excesses of some of its heavily-promoted celebrities. Jimmy Savile, once a children’s TV presenter highly-prized by the BBC, has been exposed since his death in 2011 as one of the country’s most prolific paedophiles. Rolf Harris is serving a five years and nine months prison sentence for sexually assaulting four girls, and former disc jockey Dave Lee Travis was given a three-month suspended sentence in September for a 1995 assault on a 22-year-old television researcher. The Archbishop told CNN: ‘The biggest issue for us is the legacy of vast abuse in the days when in, if I may say so, also, television and all kinds of areas, it was considered relatively acceptable. ‘We, you know, so-and-so was known to be a bit dodgy, but nobody made too much fuss. ‘We’ve gone through every file, back file of every living clergy person in the Church of England and looked for any signs that there was a problem and followed them up where there was.’ Archbishop Welby spoke to Christiane Amanpour in the wake of a damaging report on abuse in the Church of England and the humiliation of one of its most senior clergy, former Archbishop of York Lord Hope. Archbishop Welby (pictured) said the Church gone through all its files on living clergy to check for any signs of offending against children . Following his death, Jimmy Savile (pictured left) was revealed to be one of the country's worst paedophiles, while children's entertainer Rolf Harris (right) is serving a prison sentence for sexually assaulting four girls . Lord Hope surrendered his position as a bishop in the Diocese of Bradford at the end of October after a judge found he had protected a senior paedophile priest, the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, from exposure, investigation and prosecution. Waddington, who rose to become Dean of Manchester, in charge of the city’s cathedral, was a lifelong paedophile who had attracted complaints in every decade from the 1950s. It suggested the suicide in 1989 of a former Carlisle choirboy may have been connected to abuse by Waddington in the 1970s, and it said a complaint laid against Waddington by Manchester Cathedral’s organist in 1989 was ignored. Former Dean of Manchester Robert Waddington died in 2007. He had been accused of abusing seven different victims between 1955 and 1996 . But Lord Hope deflected queries about Waddington, wrongly told other bishops that Waddington was too sick to carry out any further abuse, and allowed him to continue taking services and befriending choristers at York Minster. In another case The Bishop of Gloucester, the Right Reverend Michael Perham, was questioned by police in August over indecent assault allegations dating back to the early 1980s involving a woman and a girl. Police said in October that there will be no charges. Bishop Perham ‘stepped back’ from clerical duties earlier this year. In 2011 a review by retired senior judge Lady Elizabeth Butler-Sloss said the Church had failed to take allegations of abuse in Sussex seriously. A bishop apologised for his diocese’s failure to stop the activities of two paedophile priests. Archbishop Welby said in the CNN interview his realisation of the extent to which things had been covered up was the most traumatic part of his job. He said that new allegations of abuse are now instantly reported to police and council children’s services. The Archbishop also repeated his warnings to politicians not to turn immigration into a menace, warning there was a danger of simply using language that appealed to emotion.","Most Reverend Justin Welby said the TV industry 'condoned' era of abuse .

"A rescue helicopter has captured amazing footage as it pulled a cruise passenger to safety off the coast of Miami. The young man aboard a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship choked on a piece of meat and at one point was reported to have stopped breathing. The daring rescue sees a helicopter hover over the vessel and lower a stretcher before loading the passenger onto it and winching him to safety. A young man aboard a Norwegian cruise ship had to be rescue airlifted out after choking on a piece of meat . The feat was just an average day for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, which captured the entire scene on a GoPro camera attached to the helicopter. As the rescue helicopter approaches the massive ship – distinguishable by the large happy face on its front bow – the fire brigade begins to lower ropes toward their ‘reference points’ below. Fast forward and the man is being airlifted out on a stretcher, while the flight medic holds onto the side of the bed to secure. At about 20 seconds in, the manoeuvre seems to be a success. Rescue workers were unable to organise a ship-to-ship transfer, so the helicopter was called in . A flight medic was lowered down onto the gigantic ship to secure the man to a stretcher and lift him out . The man was transferred to a local hospital, though his current condition is unknown . ‘We’re looking good,’ a voice says off camera. Once he reaches the interior of the helicopter, it quickly speeds away from the glowing lights of the massive cruise ship. According to rescuers, attempts to transfer the passenger from the ship to a boat were unsuccessful, which is why the helicopter was brought in. 'The fire boat making its way out there felt that the seas were going to be too rough to do a ship-to-ship transfer of any patient,' Lt. Chris McCory of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue told CBS Miami. The patient was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. His current condition is unknown.","Young man was air rescued on November 29 after choking on-board ship .

He wanted to re-install it at his catering business and use it for taking wedding photos. Cortis says the bridge has sentimental value because his father built it and it has spanned the Taribussi Creek for about 25 years. When he saw it had gone, Cortis launched an appeal online. Of value: Cortis feared the It 40-foot-long, six-foot-wide and seven-foot-tall bridge, weighing between 5,000 to 10,000, had been taken by scrap metal thieves .

"A high-flying wife who 'sacrificed' her career to be a homemaker has won the chance of a bigger slice of her ex-husband's multi-million-pound fortune. Career woman, Julia Hammans, 55, was once finance director of high-end retailer, Dickins & Jones, but gave up the board room for nappy changing. She married top accountant, Nicholas Hammans, in 1983, and stayed at home with the children whilst his career flourished. Mrs Hammans said he sometimes earned over £900,000-a-year as a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers and is now worth up to £11 million. Former high-flying career woman Julia Hammans, 55, and her ex husband Nicholas, a top PricewaterhouseCoopers accountancy executive, are pictured outisde London's Appeal Court where judges have ordered a rehearing of her divorce settlement case . And Mrs Hammans fiercely objected after a family judge ruled in March that an £80,000 income for her was 'generous'. Although she had £1 million in savings, she said the judge's order would force her to 'downsize' from her £1.75 million West London home. Now Appeal Court judges have ordered a rehearing of her case, after accepting that she 'arguably' suffered 'discrimination'. Lord Justice Ryder said it was right that Mrs Hammans should be 'compensated' for the glittering career she had lost. The court heard the couple, both in their 50s, split in 2004 and their divorce was finalised in August the following year. Mrs Hammans who appealed  a divorce court order that she must sell her £1.75m six-bedroom home in Twickenham (pictured) to provide herself with an income,  arguing that her multi-millionaire former husband should give her 'compensation' for having 'sacrificed' her career . She was awarded £1.37 million of the marital assets and he received about £1.2 million. Mr Hammans, 54, also paid his ex maintenance of £90,000-a-year before that was upped by agreement to £150,000 in 2007. But the court heard he now wants to retire for personal reasons and had asked the family judge to capitalise his wife's entitlement into a one-off lump sum. In March, Mr Justice Coleridge rejected Mrs Hammans' claim for up to £2.6 million and awarded her just £400,000. He said that, together with her savings and the £500,000 she could make from downsizing her home, would give her a 'generous' £80,000-a-year income. At the Appeal Court, Mrs Hammans' lawyers argued that was discriminatory and nowhere near enough to compensate her for the loss of her career. Allowing her appeal, Lord Justice Ryder said a fresh hearing was needed to ensure a fair distribution of assets between the former couple. 'To do otherwise is to discriminate against the wife because she is not the income earner', he told the court. Mrs Hammans, 55, was once finance director of high-end retailer Dickins & Jones (pictured) but gave up the board room for nappy changing . Forcing her to downsize from her six-bedroom home, in order to boost her income, was 'arguably discriminatory.' The ex-couple's assets, income and needs had to be analysed in a more 'sophisticated' way to avoid any discrimination against Mrs Hammans, he concluded. The dispute was sent back to the High Court family division for reconsideration by a different judge. 1983: Julia Hammans, a finance director for department store Dickens and Jones marries accountant Nicholas Hammans . 1989: Mrs Hammans becomes pregnant and the couple 'agree' she will give up work. 2005: The couple divorce, Mrs Hammans is awarded the £1.75million family home, as part of a larger settlement.March . 2014: After Mrs Hammans requests a further £2.6million from her ex-husband, a the family judge at the High Court rules Mr Hammans should pay just £400,000. He says the £400,000 sum, plus money from the sale of the house and interest on her £1million savings, would produce around £2million - giving her the £80,000-a-year he said she needed to live on. October 2014: At the Court of Appeal, Mrs Hammans argues she deserves £2.2million, in addition to the £400,000, and should be free to keep her house. Mrs Hammans' solicitor, divorce partner Simon Preston of Stewarts Law, said following the decision: 'Our client is happy that the courts continue to recognise that she sacrificed her career so her husband could progress with his. ' She feels it is only right and fair that her compensation should reflect that sacrifice. 'Julia hopes her case will encourage other divorcing spouses in similar circumstances to look closely at their own situation and any offers on the table. 'We welcome the judgement of the court and the emphasis on the need for courts dealing with cases of this kind to properly address the question of compensation for spouses who have sacrificed careers for the benefit of their families.' Although Mr and Mrs Hammans earned similar salaries, it was she who gave up work to care for the children, now aged in their 20s. She had sacrificed 'a serious professional career' and, although she made a little by working as a counsellor, had a negligible earning capacity after so many years away from the office. By contrast, Mr Hammans, as the family's sole bread-winner, went on to carve out a career as a tax specialist and one of the most successful men in his profession. The couple had enjoyed a high standard of living on the husband's 'very big earnings' until they split after 21 years of marriage. Following the divorce, Mrs Hammans received the Edwardian family home, in Cole Park Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, now worth £1.75 million. Desperate to stay there, she particularly objected to the judge's view that she should sell it, buy a smaller home and add the capital to her savings pot. Mr Hammans also lives in a £1m-plus house in Twickenham, as well as enjoying a holiday home in Paris, and the court heard he earned £800,000 last year. Although the ex-couple's children had 'flown the nest', Mrs Hammans' lawyers insisted she deserves to live a similar 'affluent' lifestyle to her former husband.","Julia Hammans was finance director of high-end retailer Dickins & Jones .

"Lee Rigby's heartbroken fiancée and estranged wife both sobbed with relief today after one of his Muslim extremist killers had an appeal against his murder conviction thrown out in just 45 seconds. The soldier's future bride Aimee West said she hoped 'this is the last we will hear from them' as Michael Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 23, also lost appeals against their life sentences for the 'barbaric' murder. Rebecca Rigby, who was married to the Fusilier and had his son Jack, said the family is 'relieved that this is over and justice has been done'. Adebolajo ran down the 25-year-old soldier in Woolwich south-east London in May last year before 'butchering him' with his accomplice. Both had denied murder because they were 'soldiers of Allah' but were found guilty at the Old Bailey last December. Members of the soldier's family, including his fiancée Aimee and also his estranged wife Rebecca Rigby, broke down as the High Court as their applications were rejected by judges. Quashed: One of Lee Rigby's killers, Michael Adebolajo, right, had his appeal against his conviction thrown out in 45 seconds today . Emotional: Rebecca Rigby, left, broke down as she and Miss West watched Michael Adebowale, who appeared in the High Court via video link . Adebolajo's legal team today claimed he should have his conviction quashed because he was 'at war' with Britain, before also failing to argue his whole life sentence should be reduced. His application for leave to appeal was rejected by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, sitting at the Court of Appeal in London with Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Openshaw. They spent less than a minute explaining why they would not agree to it, and later called the argument pushed by his QC 'hopelessly misconceived'. Anyone in Britain who believes they have suffered an injustice when convicted of a crime can make an application to appeal the decision. If accepted a full hearing will be held at the Court of Appeal. The judges then heard argument on behalf of Adebolajo against a whole-life sentence which condemns him to die behind bars. Lawyers for his co-accused Michael Adebowale, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 45 years, were also arguing for a reduction in sentence. But Lord Thomas said it was 'just' punishment for the 'horrific and barbaric' murder. Adebowale, who appeared from Broadmoor jail via video link did not react while Adebolajo, who is at HMP Frankland, had refused to appear for the hearing at all. Members of Fusilier Rigby's family gasped with relief and there were tears as the decision was announced. Bereft: Rebecca Rigby, the estranged wife of Lee Rigby and mother of his son Jack, was in court for the hearing, as was the soldier's fiancée Aimee West and both sobbed as the appeals were rejected . After the decision was announced, Fusilier Rigby's fiancee Aimee West said: 'I am relieved and thankful with the outcome of today's hearing. 'I hope that this is the last we will hear from them both, so that I can focus on rebuilding my life and keeping Lee's memory alive.' Choking back tears, Lee Rigby's estranged wife Rebecca said: 'I would like to thank everyone who made today's verdict possible. 'We are relieved that this is over and justice has been done. I would like to thank everyone for their continued support over the last 18 months and hope I can now build a future for my son Jack and ensure his (Lee's) memory lives on.' The British-born Muslim converts ran 25-year-old Fusilier Rigby down in a car before hacking him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack in Woolwich, south London. They dumped the body of the father-of-one in the middle of the road near Woolwich Barracks in south east London on May 22 last year. Plot: Adebolajo and Adebowale lay in wait near the barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack . They dumped the body of the father-of-one in the middle of the road near Woolwich Barracks and then waited for armed police to arrive hoping they would be 'martyred' Adebolajo and Adebowale lay in wait near the barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. After driving into him, the killers - who had armed themselves with eight knives, including a meat cleaver and a five-piece set bought by Adebolajo the previous day - butchered him in the street in broad daylight in front of horrified onlookers. Both men were shot by police in dramatic scenes captured by CCTV. They claimed they were 'soldiers of Allah' and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing. Both were convicted of murder at the Old Bailey and sentenced in February. Explaining his decision to give Adebolajo a whole-life term, trial judge Mr Justice Sweeney said he was the leader of the murderous plot and had 'no real prospect of rehabilitation'. However, Adebowale's younger age, mental health problems and 'lesser role' meant that he escaped spending the rest of his natural life behind bars. Whole-life terms came under the spotlight earlier this year when judges at the Court of Appeal ruled that murderers who commit the most 'heinous' of crimes can be sent to prison for the rest of their lives. Those currently serving whole-life terms in England and Wales include Moors Murderer Ian Brady, who tortured and murdered children along with accomplice Myra Hindley, and serial killer Rosemary West.","Michael Adebolajo hacked to death Lee Rigby with Michael Adebowale .

"A female teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with her 17-year-old student after she was dobbed in by her husband. The 44-year-old woman was arrested at her home in St Marys, in Sydney's west, on Tuesday and was taken to Penrith Police Station. It is understood the woman's husband found out about her alleged sexual relationship with the male teenager and reported his wife to police, the Daily Telegraph reported. A female teacher has been arrested for allegedly having sex with her 17-year-old student . The woman was granted conditional bail to appear at Penrith Local Court (pictured) on Monday 19 January . Police also searched the Year 11 student's home and took a number of items. The 44-year-old was charged with four counts of sexual intercourse with a child between 16 and 18 under special care. The woman was granted conditional bail to appear at Penrith Local Court on Monday 19 January 2015. She has been suspended from her role as teacher at a Western Sydney high school. A NSW Education spokesman said the Department has removed the teacher from the school. It is understood the woman's husband found out about her alleged sexual relationship with the male teenager and reported his wife to police . 'She will be placed on alternative duties away from all students,' he said. 'Counselling has been offered to the student involved. 'As the matter is before the courts, it is not appropriate to comment further at this time.'

"Freshwater crocodiles with an appetite for the toxic cane toads have worked out a clever way to get a delicious meal without being poisoned. The  crocodile population in Northern Territory has dropped dramatically in the past few years but the ‘dwarf’ crocs have been munching away at the hind legs of the pests to survive. Crocodile specialist Dr Adam Britton told Daily Mail Australia that they discovered a significant amount of toxic cane toads with missing legs after observing the areas around Bullo and Liverpool rivers in Arnhem Land, around 500 kilometres from Darwin. Poisonous cane toads found without their hind legs - believed to have been eaten by a freshwater 'dwarf' croc . ‘My wife Erin did some surveys in 2009 after the cane toads reached the areas. She observed the twisted and mangled toads and noticed the crocodile teeth marks,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We know that they often like to flick and tear off whatever they’re holding in their mouth and that’s what we’re seeing a lot around the area. ‘We were sceptical at first but now we’ve seen patterns and it’s obvious that they’re mangling the back legs to feed themselves.’ 'The freshwater 'dwarf' crocs have found a clever way to survive - by munching off the hind legs of toads . Dr Adam Britton and his wife Erin discovered a significant amount of missing legs on toxic cane toads . Dwarf crocs can grow to one-and-a-half metre in size and are classified in the same freshwater croc species . While the inevitable arrival of poisonous cane toads could have affected the small population of freshwater crocs, Mr Britton said the toads may have found a safe way to consume the toxic pests. ‘The toads have toxins in parts of their body that will usually kill the crocodiles when they consume them,’ Mr Britton said. 'We're afraid that the toads could wipe them out - it's a serious effect on the crocs' population and there weren't many of them to start with. 'The ones who have been tearing of their legs from its limbs are the ones who have survived. ‘Or the previous ones who have consumed toads before were put off after eating a whole toad. ‘So they simply learn during the trial and error and found that this is the way to eat delicious toads in a natural progression and they know its safe.’ Dr Britton and his wife Erin observed areas around the Bullo and Liverpool rivers in Arnhem Land . Poisonous cane toads found without their hind legs - believed to have been eaten by a freshwater 'dwarf' croc . Dwarf crocs can grow to one-and-a-half metre in size but Dr Britton added that they are still categorised in the same species as freshwater crocodiles. ‘We call them dwarfs or pygmies because they’re half the size smaller than a normal freshwater croc,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘The reason why they’re so small is because there is less food for them to eat but they’re incredible survivors – If they don’t get enough food or they eat really slow – they just won’t grow as much.'","'Dwarf' crocs have worked out how to survive off toxic cane toads .

"Prominent ABC journalist Leigh Sales has copped a barrage of complaints on social media from those claiming she was too soft on Tony Abbott during a televised interview. The Prime Minister was interviewed by Sales on the ABC's 7.30 program on Thursday night and her name quickly started trending on Twitter. Viewers claimed Mr Abbott got away with the 'lightest and fluffiest' of interviews, with some even comparing Sales to Today host Karl Stefanovic who was applauded for putting tough questions to the PM on Monday. Scroll down for video . ABC journalist Leigh Sales has copped a barrage of complaints on social media from those claiming she was too soft on Tony Abbott during a TV interview on Thursday . Mr Abbott hinted at a Cabinet reshuffle during the interview and when Sales pressed him about it, he said: 'At some stage between now and the next election, quite probably, but this is a good frontbench'. He then went on to praise the work of his Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann and Treasurer Joe Hockey. Sales also asked Mr Abbott whether he would step aside if it meant giving the Liberals the best chance of holding onto power. But the prime minister would not give her a direct answer, saying that it was 'a fair question'. The Prime Minister was interviewed by Sales on the ABC's 7.30 program on Thursday night and her name quickly started trending on Twitter . 'The one fundamental lesson of the last catastrophic government was that you don't lightly change leaders,' Mr Abbott said while placing his words carefully. 'Governments that change their leaders haven't done very well lately.' Twitter lit up following the interview suggesting the interview allowed Mr Abbott to get an easy ride. 'And as predicted @leighsales gives Abbott the lightest and fluffiest of interviews. Allowing him to go on and on, no brakes applied,' one user wrote. 'Abbott really believes his own lies. That looked like a scripted interview to me too,' another quipped. 'Might be time for the ABC to hire Karl Stefanovic to ask the serious questions. This Leigh Sales is no good.' Viewers claimed Mr Abbott got away with the 'lightest and fluffiest' of interviews . Some even comparing Sales to Today host Karl Stefanovic who was applauded for putting tough questions to the Prime Minister on Monday . Mr Abbott hinted at a Cabinet reshuffle during the interview but didn't give much away when Sales pressed him for a definite answer . Mr Abbott was also questioned over his government's broken promises. 'People sure may well feel dismayed, disappointed, occasionally even surprised, but I think that they also understand that governments have to respond to the circumstances they find themselves in,' he said. But he said much had happened in 12-14 months and circumstances did change, with Labor's promised $18 billion deficit actually coming in at $48 billion. 'I think that they (voters) also understand that governments have to respond to the circumstances that they find themselves,' he said. Sales also asked Mr Abbott whether he would step aside if it meant giving the Liberals the best chance of holding onto power . But the prime minister would not give her a direct answer, saying that it was 'a fair question' Mr Abbott said the government had kept faith with the Australian people because it had fundamentally honoured core commitments to stop the boats, repeal the carbon tax, build the roads and start the job of budget repair. He said there had been a lot of unjustified cries he had broken his promises. On ABC funding cuts, he said plainly he did say the night before the election there would be no cuts to the national broadcaster. 'We flagged a very urgent task of budget repair,' he said. Twitter lit up following the interview suggesting the interview allowed Mr Abbott to get an easy ride . Mr Abbott said there had been a lot of unjustified cries he had broken his promises . 'It's interesting that in the run-up to the budget, the messages we were getting back from our constituents and, yes, from Liberal Party polling, was people were frightened we would squib it.' Mr Abbott said he was saying to the Australian people there was a need to adjust to changed circumstances and the government was deadly serious about returning the budget to surplus. 'If you are trying to get from point A to point B and one way is blocked you find another way. You don't abandon your objective,' he said. Mr Abbott said he would not flag potential compromises to get stalled budget measures through the Senate. 'That's going to be a matter for discussion and negotiation with the crossbench,' he said. 'There will be further things to be announced by this government. We will be governing right up until Christmas Eve.' According the latest Newspoll released on Tuesday, Labor (party leader Bill Shorten pictured above) is leading on 54 per cent, with the Coalition trailing behind on 46 per cent . Mr Abbott was asked about changing leaders, just like the former Labor government who went through two leadership changes going from Kevin Rudd (right) to Julia Gillard (left) then back to Kevin Rudd .","ABC journalist Leigh Sales faced a barrage of Twitter complaints following her interview with Tony Abbott on Thursday .

Simple pleasures: When asked what she's planning to give her mother, one fiery girl responds: 'Probably like some sort of jewelry or maybe a new purse or something. Like a crocodile Birkin' The video takes place in a grand living room decorated with a huge plush panda bear, a Christmas tree, a tartan sofa and piles of Moda Operandi shopping bags. 'We're talkin' bout what we want for Christmas,' says one of the young children, who are nicknamed 'Fashioneasters' by the online luxury fashion retailer. The girls are all decked out in sparkling jewelry and fancy apparel, with one wearing a big fur hat with the price tag dangling from it. 'What are you getting your mommy for Christmas?' one girl asks another. 'A beautiful necklace with diamonds!' she exclaims.

The wishlists get even more high-end when one girl declares: 'We should get Mommy a Basquiat.' Her sister agrees: 'Yeah she would love it!' Back in September, the Fashioneasters did a video on New York Fashion Week, chalking it up to a minefield of confounding footwear, agonizing outfit decisions, and difficult-to-pronounce designer names.

"Fixing jet skis, posting bail and storing lost property are some of the things Australian embassies cannot help with when travellers run into trouble overseas. These may sound like strange demands but remarkably these are the kind of requests embassies have received from Australians every year, which also include borrowing a laptop and providing legal assistance. And Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop thinks it is time for some tough love. The Australian government is cracking down on people who do the wrong thing and request help from the embassies, which include posting their bail . The department has launched a campaign to alert travellers about what is reasonable - and more importantly, unreasonable - to expect from Australia's consular services abroad. 'Our consular staff are not there to pay for the repairs to your jet ski. They are not there to pay your hotel bill,' Ms Bishop said in Canberra. 'Consular assistance is a last resort service.' Australia's diplomats have noticed some trends in recent years as the number of trips taken abroad has exploded to nearly ten million a year. Last year diplomats helped nearly 15,000 Australians in trouble, and juggled more than 1,000 active cases a day . Last year they helped nearly 15,000 Australians in trouble, and juggled more than 1,000 active cases a day. Less people are needing medical evacuation or emergency financial assistance these days but more are dying, getting arrested or winding up in hospital. Bangkok remains the busiest consular post in the world, unsurprising as Thailand's the top destination for Australians dying or getting hospitalised. But hundreds of the cases at that embassy were classed as 'general welfare', and the growing number of travellers seeking help for trivial matters is putting strain on the system. But Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop stressed that those in genuine need - like victims of serious crimes or natural disasters - would not be stranded . Ms Bishop stressed that those in genuine need - like victims of serious crimes or natural disasters - would not be stranded. But she said some people rort the system, pointing to activists who willfully break the law overseas and then demand help. 'And yet the Australian consular staff are meant to get on a plane and fly to some remote place to bail them out,' she said. Last year Ms Bishop suggested the government might ask Greenpeace to repay the tens of thousands of dollars spent helping activist Colin Russell get out of a Russian prison. She's decided not to introduce a cost recovery system for consular services for now, but says it remains a 'live option'. 1) A traveller who was destitute in Europe refused to return to Australia without their pet bird, which could not be returned for quarantine reasons . 2) A mother who wanted the embassy in Bangkok to book accommodation and a return ticket to Australia for her son, then provide an embassy driver to take him to the airport . 3) A request from an Australian traveller for DFAT to feed her dogs while she was away . 4) 'I'm attending a conference overseas with a large group of Australians but I have heard it is a dangerous city. Can the High Commission arrange for a risk assessment and some armoured cars. We only need them for a week.' 5) Multiple enquiries to embassies overseas seeking the closest pub televising State of Origin games . 6) An Australian who had his laptop stolen overseas requested that embassy staff pick him up from the airport, loan him a laptop and provide him with office space for a few days . 7) A traveller who asked whether the sand in Egypt would affect her asthma . 8) Panicked callers regularly reporting Australian travellers missing overseas, after not hearing from them within the first few hours of arriving in country. Consular officers usually explain that getting through customs and immigration can take time . 9) 'Why won't the Australian embassy come and pack my bags for me? I'm an 80 year old architect travelling by myself and too old to pack my own bags' 10) 'I left some items on an aircraft when I changed flights. Can the embassy collect it from the airline lost property?' 11) 'Can the embassy obtain prescription medicine from Australia and send it to me so I can continue my holiday?' 12) Requests for embassies to store luggage, hold mail, provide banking facilities or arrange tours for Australian travellers . 13) 'What is the best way to get a polecat out of your roof?' 14) 'I'm going on a cruise. What will the food be like? Can you drink the water on the ship?' 15) Some travellers evacuated from civil unrest in Egypt on government funded flights questioned why they were not entitled to frequent flyer points. Similarly, some travellers evacuated from the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami made seat requests, including for first class . 16) A caller to DFAT's Consular Emergency Centre wanted to know the average salary for an expat to expect in Thailand . 17) 'Does the embassy know if there are any hotels in Phnom Penh with vacant rooms?' 18) 'Can the embassy tell the local police that I have an excellent driving record in Australia and should not have to pay those outstanding speeding fines?' 19) 'What is the best hotel in Phuket?' 20) 'On my last trip to the Philippines I had some trouble with the law. What is the number of the embassy in Manila so I can call them to get me out of jail when I go back?'","Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs is cracking down on outrageous requests it gets from travellers .

"The federal government's plan to boost its refugee intake by 7,500 has been overshadowed by claims that officials mistreated two pregnant Iranian asylum seekers who refused to get off a bus at a Darwin detention centre . The refugee increase will occur over four years and bring Australia's overall humanitarian intake to about 18,750. The move is expected to cost the government an estimated $100 million, which will be funded by savings within the immigration portfolio. It is one of a raft of measures that Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has agreed to as part of a deal with Senate crossbenchers to win  support for his bill to resurrect temporary protection visas. Mr Morrison was forced to defend accusations that officials mistreated two heavily pregnant Iranian refugees who refused to get off a bus parked at Wickham Point detention centre 40km south of Darwin on Saturday. The federal government's boost to its refugee intake by 7,500 has been overshadowed by claims that officials mistreated two pregnant Iranian asylum seekers who refused to get off a bus at Wickham Point detention centre in the Northern Territory (pictured) Immigration minister Scott Morrison denies the pregnant women and their families were mistreated describing them as 'malicious claims by asylum activists' Mr Morrison said the welfare of the two heavily pregnant women, their husbands and one son was monitored and they had access to food, water, amenities, toilets and health professionals as they batted with authorities over the right to live in the community ahead of the births. But Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said the air conditioning  was turned off on the bus during the stand-off which started at 10pm on Saturday when the women, Maryam and Tahere, refused to get off the bus. 'On Monday, both pregnant women fainted after the bus was intentionally allowed to heat up,' Mr Rintoul said on Wednesday. Maryam's husband collapsed and was taken to the medical centre in the facility, he added. Mr Rintoul also disputes the time frame for the end of the stand-off, saying the two women 'were dragged off the bus' between 5.30pm and 6pm on Monday, rather than Tuesday morning as reported. The second man, Adnan, alleges he was physically restrained by four guards as his wife Maryam was taken off. However, Mr Morrison rejected these claims stating that the department and detention service provider, Serco, had acted appropriately towards the women and their families. 'My understanding is they're fine,"" he said. Adnan and Maryam pictured boarding a plane in Nauru bound for Darwin, according to the Refugee Action Coalition . The 7,500 increase in Australia's refugee intake will be rolled out over four years. 'The government denies claims of cruelty and mistreatment of the individuals in the strongest possible terms,' he said in a statement. 'These are yet more malicious claims by asylum activists.' The two families had been on Nauru for 15 months, and had lived in the community for part of that time after being recognised as refugees. Mr Morrison said the government will 'hard-wire' its refugee intake commitment into a 'disallowable instrument,' so the intake can't be reduced without Senate agreement. Senator Nick Xenophon's amendments were also backed by the government and are expected to result in better alignment with the UNHCR when it comes to refugee assessments. The government's fast-tracking process will be limited to 30,000 cases left over from Labor government. A total of 25,000 asylum seekers now on bridging visas will be allowed work rights. Mr Morrison's announcement came after reports that his bill was set to be defeated in the Senate. 'The ultimate determination of this bill is in the hands of the Senate, it is not for me to commentate on the position of individual senators,' Mr Morrison said. The bill would also boost powers to turn back boats and head off a High Court challenge and create a five-year safehaven enterprise visa for genuine refugees. Senator Nick Xenophon's amendments were also backed by the government that will result in better alignment with the UNHCR when it comes to refugee assessments including greater efficiency which is free of bias .","Increase will occur over four years and will bring intake to about 18,750 .

"North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has banned citizens from sharing his name and ordered people using it to get 'trained' to change it. A leaked internal state document from the secretive state obtained by South Korean television contained 'an administrative order' to all party, army and police officials to ensure that the directive was carried out. According to the document: 'All party organs and public security authorities should make a list of residents named Kim Jong-Un... and train them to voluntarily change their names.' North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un has banned any people in his country from sharing his name ordering them to undergo 'voluntary training' Officials in the secretive state have been ordered to search through identity records to uncover any fellow Kim Jong-Uns and re-educate them . He ordered the Communist Party, the army and the police to conduct checks and told officials to refuse any birth certificates sharing his name . Anyone named Kim Jong-Un would have their official documents, identity cards and even school diplomas changed to the person's new name. Officials were also told to reject all birth certificates for babies named after the dictator. The document continued: 'Authorities should make sure that there is no one making unnecessary complaints or spreading gossip... regarding this project.' The authenticity of the official directive could not be independently verified, and Seoul's Unification Ministry declined to comment on whether it was genuine. But one government official noted that the Pyongyang regime was known to have banned citizens sharing the names of founding president Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-Il. One South Korean Official said: 'Given the North maintained the policy under the two previous leaders, there is a possibility that it would continue to do so now.' The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea for more than six decades with an iron fist and pervasive personality cult. Park Jin-Hee, a North Korean defector working for KBS who obtained the document, said she was sure the 2011 directive had been effectively enforced. A similar rule applied to Kim Jong-Un's father Kim Jong-Il and his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who are revered in North Korean society . Officials were warned against allowing any gossip of rumours surrounding the new naming policy to spread within the secretive state . The new naming policy was contained in a leaked document which was published by a South Korean TV station earlier this week . Park, who defected in 2008 said: 'There is no one in the North named Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, and there is no doubt the same rule applies for Jong-Un. Kim Jong Un made his international debut in late 2010 when he was awarded a slew of top political jobs. His father, who reportedly suffered a stroke in 2008, was seen as moving fast to hand over power so his family could rule for a third generation. Kim Jong Il inherited power in 1994 when his father Kim Il Sung died. North Korea enforces strict, state-organised public reverence of the Kim family, which serves as the backbone of the family's authoritarian rule of the impoverished country. All North Koreans are required to wear lapel pins bearing the images of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and to put the leaders' portraits on the walls of their homes. Their birthdays are considered the most important holidays in North Korea.","North Korean citizens have been warned against naming their children after their dictator Kim Jong-Un .

"A U.S. couple cleared in the death of their 8-year-old daughter arrived home to Los Angeles on Thursday and reunited with family members following a legal battle that kept them in Qatar for nearly two years, including almost a year spent in jail. Matthew and Grace Huang arrived with smiles on their faces, according to The David House Agency, which represents them. 'Mission accomplished. Matt and Grace are in Los Angeles. They have not stopped smiling,' the agency tweeted. American couple Grace, center, and Matthew Huang, right, walk to their departure gate with U.S. Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, left, at the Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar .

If the Qatari prosecutors could only see this moment!' The agency later tweeted a photo of the couple embracing their sons and other relatives, saying it was a 'Glorious family reunion. If the Qatari prosecutors could only see this moment!' The Huangs gained international attention when they were arrested in January 2013 on charges of starving their African-born daughter, Gloria, to death. The couple, who are of Asian descent, had adopted Gloria in Ghana when she was 4 years old, and are the parents of two other adopted, African-born children. Throughout the case, the family's representatives expressed concern that there were cultural misunderstandings underpinning the charges against the couple in a nation where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. American couple Matthew, left, and Grace Huang, smile. The Los Angeles couple had been detained in the country after their arrest in January 2013, on murder charges following the death of their 8-year-old daughter . The Huangs spent nearly a year behind bars before their case was heard for the first time in November 2013. They were eventually convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison . An initial police report raised questions about why the couple would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits.' Prosecutors said the couple denied food to their daughter and locked her in her room at night. The Huangs said Gloria suffered from medical problems complicated by an eating disorder that was the result of her impoverished early years in Africa. The Huangs spent nearly a year behind bars before their case was heard for the first time in November 2013. They were eventually convicted of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. An appeals court judge overturned their conviction Sunday and said they could leave, but their passports were confiscated at the airport later that day. Their situation remained tense until the moment of their departure Wednesday, with Matthew Huang being detained for several minutes at the airport's passport control station as his wife watched in tears. The suspense encapsulates the twists and turns of a slow-moving case that became an irritant in otherwise close relations between the U.S. and Qatar, a key ally that hosts an important U.S. military air base. 'We feel relieved. We feel gratitude to the legal system in the state of Qatar, which after some time worked as a good legal system should,' said U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith, who accompanied the couple to the airport. The couple and their children moved to Qatar in 2012 after Matthew Huang was hired to work as an engineer as part of preparations for the 2022 World Cup.","Matthew and Grace Huang were detained in the country after their arrest in January 2013, on murder charges following the death of their 8-year-old girl .

"A 98-year-old woman lost her bid to persuade a judge to erase her 1950 conviction for conspiracy to obstruct justice in the atomic spying trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Miriam Moskowitz, of New Jersey, served two years in jail for lying to a grand jury as it investigated the Rosenbergs, who were convicted of passing nuclear weapons secrets to the Soviet Union. On Thursday, 61 years after the Rosenbergs were executed, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein rejected Moskowitz's unusual request to clear her name. Immediately after hearing oral arguments, he said her lawyers could not show that transcripts of grand jury statements by the lone witness against her would have changed her trial's result. Disappointed: Miriam Moskowitz, 98, accompanied by her nephew Ira Moskowitz, leaves federal court in New York on Thursday after a judge refused to declare her innocent of obstructing justice in the Rosenberg case . Convicted: Moskowitz is pictured with her business partner Abraham Brothman in a prison van after both were charged with conspiracy. She was fined $10,000 and jailed for two years. Brothman was jailed for seven years . As he left the bench, Hellerstein wished Moskowitz well and told her it was a pleasure to have her in his court. 'OK, that's the end,' a cheerful Moskowitz, walking with a cane toward spectators, told a film crew that has been following her. 'You can finish your documentary now.' Outside court, she said she was disappointed and referenced the McCarthy era, when fear of Communism was rampant in the United States and a blacklist made it hard for some to find work. 'Too bad,' Moskowitz said of Hellerstein's ruling. 'My 98-year-old life goes on, and it's not affected me one way or the other except I am disappointed because it reflects ... the prejudice of the McCarthy era.' She added: 'The decision today doesn't help understand that era.' Executed: Julius (left) and Ethel Rosenberg (right) were executed in 1953 after being found guilty of passing nuclear weapons to the Soviet Union. Cables have confirmed Julius' involvement but shed doubt on Ethel's . National news: The controversial espionage case was one of the most lengthy and complicated in US history . Guilty: She served two years in prison for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating the Rosenbergs . Rejected: A judge said the suggestion that information was withheld during her trial was not enough proof . The government had opposed Moskowitz's request, saying her conviction was supported by the evidence and that she conspired with two men to lie to a grand jury investigating allegations of atomic espionage. 'Her claims, even if taken at face value, are insufficient to establish an error under today's law, let alone the law when she was convicted in 1950,' prosecutors said in court papers. Moskowitz's lawyers said FBI and grand jury statements by the key government witness against her — Harry Gold — were withheld from the defense. They said the papers showed that Gold repeatedly told the FBI that Moskowitz was unaware of plans by others to lie before the grand jury until the government threatened him with the death penalty. Moving on: Moskowitz told a documentary team following her that this signaled the end of her journey . Lengthy battle: The New Jersey-based woman blames McCarthy-era prejudice for her conviction . The Rosenbergs, convicted of passing nuclear weapons secrets to the Soviet Union, were executed in 1953 . Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Allen told Hellerstein on Thursday that the jury heard statements at trial that were similar to statements Moskowitz's lawyers claim are new. Gold served about half of a 30-year prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to violating the espionage act. Since then, decoded Soviet cables have appeared to confirm that Julius Rosenberg was a spy, but doubts have remained about Ethel Rosenberg's involvement. Ethel, an actress, singer and secretary, was 37 when she died. Electrical engingeer Julius was 35 when he died.","Miriam Moskowitz, 98, served 2 years in prison for obstruction of justice .

"Terry Waite, 75, said diet of rice and beans 'is not too hard to bear for a couple of weeks' and life in jungle was a 'paradise' compared to the hardship of the homeless sleeping on the streets this Christmas . The contestants in I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! who moan about their food should be thankful for their meagre rations, former hostage Terry Waite has said. And Mr Waite, 75, who spent years in captivity after being kidnapped by Islamic terrorists in the Lebanon, compared life in the jungle as 'paradise' to the 'real jungle' suffered by the homeless living on the streets at Christmas. He said: 'I have no doubt they find it uncomfortable at times, but in reality it's not all that bad. 'Rice and beans is not too hard to bear for a couple of weeks. 'That was my main diet in captivity for almost five years and I survived.' Gemma Collins was the first celebrity to leave the jungle after complaining of feeling starved. The Only Way Is Essex star, also concerned about contracting malaria, vowed to 'stay strong' but left after three days when the struggle became too much to bear. But Mr Waite, president of homeless charity Emmaus, said the 'trials' faced by the celebrities were nothing compared to the hardship faced by those without a home. He added: 'It's really terrible to be homeless and have to suffer night after night under the arches, or in a hostel where one is surrounded by threats of every kind, most of them far worse than the trials endured by these well-paid participants. 'It was interesting to see in a recent episode how emotional the celebrities became when they received a parcel from home with messages from their families. 'Some of them were in tears and they had only been parted for a matter of weeks, if that!

But 'curious' to see how the celebrities have been getting on, he has watched the tears and tantrums from Down Under. Writing on the Emmaus charity website, he added: 'When all is said and done, 'I'm a Celebrity' is designed as entertainment and we can't take it too seriously. 'However we look at it though, homelessness is not entertaining. 'It's a grim reality but Emmaus has enabled hundreds of people to get out of a real jungle and gain stability in their lives.'","Said life in jungle a 'paradise' to 'real' suffering of homeless at Christmas .

"The mother of an autistic boy who was slashed in the neck in an unprovoked attack said her son is lucky to be alive. Eamonn Finn, 16, was chased by three teenage boys and assaulted in Pimlico, central London, in June, leaving him so traumatised he still has nightmares six months later. His mother Margaret Finn said she just wanted 'closure' for her son as police renew their appeal to catch the boys responsible for the attack.

Ms Finn posted a picture of her son's neck wound on Facebook which has been shared nearly 200,000 times . Detectives want to speak to these three teenagers about the attack on Eamonn Finn,16, in Pimlico, central London . Ms Finn posted a picture of her son's neck wound on Facebook which has been shared nearly 200,000 times. Speaking at Scotland Yard's headquarters in central London today, she said: 'I strongly believe someone does know who did this to my child. I would appeal to them to contact the police and do the right thing. 'He's still having dreams about the event. He says ""I think about those boys a lot and what they did to me."" 'It's really hard for me to talk about without getting emotional because there is no one who could invite this less than Eamonn. He's such an amazing young man and he deserves some closure and we don't have that at the moment.' Ms Finn said she had 'real concerns' that if the culprits were not caught, another victim 'might not be as lucky'. Scotland Yard has released CCTV footage of Eamonn being chased as he walked alone to a youth centre in Pimlico at around 7.20pm on June 4. Eammon is in the foreground . One of the attackers asked the boy what he was looking at before Eamonn ran away along Regency Street, close to the junction with Causton Street . He was then slashed across the neck with an unknown weapon and needed hospital treatment, police said . His mother Margaret Finn said she just wanted 'closure' for her son as police renew their appeal to catch the boys responsible for the attack. They have released these CCTV images as part of the appeal . 'He's lucky to be alive as far as I'm concerned,' she said. 'It's really impacted on his independence. Anyone who has a child with autism knows that's really hard fought for. 'In Eamonn's case that was two years in the making. That's gone now. We're having to start from scratch.' Scotland Yard has released CCTV of Eamonn being chased as he walked alone to a youth centre in Pimlico at around 7.20pm on June 4. One of the attackers asked the boy what he was looking at before Eamonn ran away along Regency Street, close to the junction with Causton Street. He was then slashed across the neck with an unknown weapon and needed hospital treatment, police said. Ms Finn said the gang were 'immediately abusive, confrontational and aggressive' which frightened her son before he ran away. 'He clearly didn't want trouble,' she said. 'He was running away and they chased him. That's what is so difficult. They pursued him. 'I don't think there's all bad in everyone. I hope there's a part of them that realises they did something wrong but they can do something right now. 'The person they did this to didn't deserve it. They have an opportunity now to take responsibility for their actions.' Acting Detective Chief Inspector Dave Bolton said: 'The victim is a vulnerable young person and this was one of only a few times he has walked anywhere alone. For some unknown reason the three suspects have taken umbrage to him and attacked him with no provocation and no known reason. 'It is sheer luck that the weapon missed his artery and he was not more severely injured. 'Six months into this investigation we have undertaken extensive enquiries to identify the suspects and have followed various leads, but they remain unidentified at this time. I would like to appeal to the public for their help to identify these males.' The suspects were described by the victim as black or Hispanic males. One was wearing a blue Adidas top and another was described as being around 16 years old.

"Families flying abroad could save up to £71 per child after the Chancellor scrapped the controversial air tax for the under-12s from next May. And from March 2016, all children under the age of 16 travelling in economy will be exempt from the Air Passenger Duty. Airlines will also be required to display on tickets exactly how much of the fare was spent on fuel surcharges – so passengers can see at a glance where their money is going. Scroll down for video . Lift-off for your holiday: The air tax has been scrapped for children under the age of 12 from next May . Strong words: George Osborne said in 2016 air tax would be scrapped for all children under the age of 16 . In this year’s Budget Mr Osborne had already announced that the two highest bands in the four-band system of Air Passenger Duty would be scrapped from April 1, 2015. The new changes mean that from May 1, a family of five flying to Florida could save £213, or £71 for each child under 12. Those who fly premium economy, business or first class will not benefit, and it remains unclear if families who have already booked flights on or after the May 1 start date will receive refunds. However, the Treasury has issued advice to airlines that there will be ‘an expectation’ that parents with children under 12 who have already booked tickets for May 1, 2015, or later ‘will be due a refund’. Air Passenger Duty, an airport departure tax, has been dubbed the ‘poll tax of the skies’. Mr Osborne has previously admitted that the charge, which was introduced as an environmental measure, is now a pure revenue raiser. He told the Commons yesterday that he is also putting pressure on airlines to curb the fuel surcharges imposed on passengers when fuel costs go up – and which are often slow to be removed as prices fall. The Shah family (right) will be able to venture much further afield when the changes take effect. Raj and Fiona, from Sheffield, travel with sons Oliver, three, and Alexander, 19 months. Mr Shah, 39, said: ‘It is a hugely positive change. It’s going to open our children up to many more experiences that they would not have the opportunity to have otherwise. ‘Flights for the children will be a lot cheaper.’ Mr Shah, the director of Blue Wealth Capital, a financial planning firm, added: ‘We go abroad twice per year and this year we took the kids to Spain and Greece. We haven’t booked anything for next year yet, but we’re considering long haul now. ‘We have relatives in Kenya and Toronto and it would be lovely to visit them more, or our friends in the Middle East. 'We also have family in Australia, but it’s probably a bit too far for the little ones at the moment. But we would definitely consider visiting them as they get older.’ The Chancellor said: ‘We’re going to require airlines to list the charges separately from taxes on tickets. But I also want to reduce the cost of those tickets for families directly. From May 1 next year, Air Passenger Duty for children under 12 will be abolished. ‘And I’ll go further. From the following year, we’ll get rid of APD for children under 16 altogether.’ The Treasury said the changes will ‘save an average family of four £26 on a flight to Europe and £142 on one to the US’. It follows a recommendation that decisions on APD in Scotland should be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The SNP has said it wants to scrap the tax, which has been in force since 1994. Airports in Newcastle and Manchester fear this would lead to an exodus of English passengers seeking cheaper flights from Scottish airports. Airlines and airports welcomed the news, but insisted the entire tax should be scrapped. Airlines are required to pay the unpopular APD to the Treasury once a passenger’s flight has departed. Willie Walsh, the head of British Airways’ parent company, the International Airlines Group, said: ‘Scrapping APD for children might be popular with some voters... but it will do nothing to improve the UK economy. Willie Walsh (above), the head of British Airways’ parent company, said: ‘Scrapping APD for children might be popular with some voters... but it will do nothing to improve the UK economy' ‘APD must be axed in its entirety. The UK still has the highest flying tax in the world and it should be abolished to allow the aviation and tourism industries to flourish.’ EasyJet said it would refund APD to any customers who had booked tickets for children on or after the May 1 deadline. Chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ‘This is really good news for families.’ BMI regional also said that it would honour the refunds. Virgin Atlantic boss Craig Kreeger said: ‘This is great news for families and is another step on the long road to reform of this economically damaging tax’. British Air Transport Association chief executive Nathan Stower called it ‘an early stocking filler for families’, but warned the May 1 deadline presented ‘significant practical difficulties’. He said: ‘The industry has always said that changes to APD should have at least a 12-month lead-in time due to advance bookings.’ Travel organisation Abta said the news was ‘a hugely positive step’, while Flybe said the move merely ‘tinkered with the edges’ of airport policy and should be taken further. Autumn statement: George Osborne and chief Treasury secretary Danny Alexander yesterday . State loans of up to £10,000 will be offered to postgraduate students for the first time. George Osborne said the funding would ‘revolutionise’ access to postgraduate courses, as high costs deter bright students from poor backgrounds. The loans will only be available to those under the age of 30 – dealing a blow to mature students – but will cover master’s degrees in any subject. They will be available from 2016-17, benefiting 40,000 students. The proposals expect to bring an extra 10,000 into postgraduate study. They will be repaid ‘concurrently’ with undergraduate loans – on which repayments only start once earnings reach a certain level – but may be charged at a higher rate. Children's television has been given a leg-up, in what has been dubbed the ‘Teletubby’ tax break. The Chancellor said he wanted to ensure a new generation of children’s programmes is made in Britain by offering incentives to production companies. Tax relief for children’s animated productions in the UK was introduced in April last year, and it will be extended to live-action shows this coming April. Mr Osborne said: ‘We will help one area of television production that has been in decline.’ Pact, a body representing UK production companies, estimates the Treasury could also benefit by up to £3million a year from the move.","Going abroad will save up to £71 per child depending on the distance .

"Pie Face fans could be buying their favourite Australian pastries from the freezer section of Woolworths early next year, in a move that could potentially save the struggling franchise. The pie company is in talks with the supermarket giant to sell their products frozen and in bulk, with a trial already under way in 15 stores, according to Fairfax. The sale-boosting business move has come only a few weeks after Pie Face announced it was entering into voluntary administration to restructure the business in an effort to cut costs. Pie Face could be selling their pies in the frozen section of Woolworths next year if the current trials are successful . Kevin Waite, the company's CEO, assured that franchises would prosper from the strategy, which is still under consideration, saying he believed Pie Face had a 'strong future'. 'The customer normally going into a Pie Face for hot pies doesn't swap their purchasing occasion by buying a frozen pie for diner,' Mr Waite told Fairfax. The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, said sections of the franchise, 'were still profitable' 'We'll make sure it's a different shopping occasion. Our franchisees are first and foremost in everything we do.' Despite insisting that it was 'business as usual' following their restructure announcement, 19 Pie Face stores closed last week while Fairfax reports that the company owes $20 million to its creditors. The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, gave his global company over to the advisory and consulting firm, Jirsch Sutherland, who are 'conducting a review of operations', Fairfax reports. Rod Sutherland from Jirsch Sutherland confirmed that some of the company's stores were losing money. However, Mr Homschek told Fairfax that sections of the franchise, which is known to sell meat pies, pastries and sandwiches until the early hours of the morning, were 'still profitable' 'We're potentially going to refinance Macquarie Capital and are looking at bringing in new senior lenders,' Mr Homschek said. Pie Face was founded in 2003 with the first 20 stores opening within the first five years of the company's launch. The company assured that their 'international businesses are not affected' as two stores prepared to open in the Middle East in November.

"Curiosity almost killed this cat, as it found its way into a home moving box and got taped in with no food or water for more than a month. Ashley Barth's kitty Mee Moowe disappeared in September as movers packed her family's belongings for a 4,800-plus mile move from Suffolk, Virginia, to Hawaii.

"High-end estate agents have turned on the Chancellor today warning that new stamp duty charges will hit at least 500,000 properties worth more than the new more expensive £937,000 threshold. George Osborne has announced a major overhaul of the system in his Autumn Statement and demanded that the top two per cent of home buyers must pay more in tax from Midnight. Experts have today called the decision 'disastrous' and a 'kick in the guts' for those buying and selling expensive homes. Pressure: High end estate agents fear the market in London an other areas where many houses are worth more than the new £937,000 threshold could be stifled by the Chancellor's stamp duty changes . Up and down: While the majority will pay far less in tax on house purchases the rich will pay significantly more . Shares in leading London estate agent Foxtons, where the majority of Britain's most expensive properties are, fell this afternoon after the Chancellor's stamp duty announcement. The Tory Chancellor announced the changes to raise more money from multi-million pound property transactions and to nullify Labour's calls for a mansion tax. George Osborne today urges voters to allow him to 'finish the job' of repairing the nation's finances . What is the stamp duty change? Previously buyers paid the percentage above thresholds on the entire purchase price – creating a situation where tax bills rocketed from £2,500 to at least £7,500 when buying a home costing more than £250,000. Chancellor George Osborne said the reformed stamp duty will kick in from midnight tonight. Bands are now 0 per cent up to £125,000; 2 per cent to £250,000; 5 per cent to £925,000; 10 per cent to £1.5million and 12 per cent above that. Previously they stood at 1 per cent above £125,000; 3 per cent above £250,000, 4 per cent above £500,000; 5 per cent above £1million and 7 per cent above £2million. Who will pay less? Under the new system anyone buying a home costing under £937,000 should pay less. Those buying a £200,000 home will pay £1,500 instead of £2,000. The big win though is for those previously caught in the 3 per cent tax trap, someone previously hit with an £8,250 bill on a £275,000 home will now pay £3,750. Meanwhile, those buying a £600,000 home will now pay £20,000, compared to £24,000 before. Who will pay more? Buyers at the top end will pay the price for the reform. Someone buying a £1million home will pay £43,750 instead of £40,000, but someone buying a £2,000,000 home will pay £153,750 rather than the current £100,000 levied just before the 7 per cent threshold kicks in. Critics of the current 'slab' stamp duty system say it distorts the market because it suddenly jumps up if you pay a penny over the current thresholds. But while the majority will now pay less in stamp duty those buying homes that cost over £937,000 will pay significantly more a £5million pound house will see taxes due on completion rise from £350,000 to £514,000. Some experts have warned the changes due to start from midnight tonight will be 'disastrous' and called the reforms a 'kick in the guts' for top end of the market. Experts believe the top-end market will be 'choked', particularly because those selling a house worth over the £937,000 tipping point will now find it harder to sell their home. Some buyers are now rushing through the purchases today to avoid paying tens or even hundreds of thousands in extra stamp duty and sellers want the same to avoid sales collapsing overnight. Trevor Abrahamsohn, who specialises in selling multi-million pound homes, says the market he deals in is already struggling and the changes are 'disastrous'. He said: 'It is a big mistake. This is not something you apply to a shrinking market and if Labour get into power they will still introduce a mansion tax. 'The top-end of the market has been clubbed in recent years and now it is being hit harder. It is like giving medicine to the person that is well while forgetting about the poorly patient. 'It is good that they have got rid of the slabs but they have increased the rate in an area that is struggling. 'Instead of listening to everyone in Whitehall, they need to be speaking to people on the ground. Other agents keep ringing me to discuss the changes. It is mad.' Simon Tyler, managing director of Tyler Mortgage Management, said: 'The top end of the market is getting absolutely whacked by this new system. 'I don't suppose many people will have much sympathy but it will be a kick in the guts for people who are stretching to borrow to buy that multi-million pound house, and will doubtless dampen demand at the top end as people reconsider the economics of moving compared to improving or expanding their existing home instead.' Tremor: Shares in leading London estate agent Foxtons, where the majority of Britain's most expensive properties are, fell this afternoon after the Chancellor's stamp duty announcement . Uplift: This mansion in Hampstead, north London is priced at £2.25million. Before midnight the stamp duty  £157,500  but from tomorrow it will be £183,750 . Stamp Duty is Britain's oldest tax and under the old system the headline rate of stamp duty was imposed on the entire amount. Jess Brammar, journalist, London . 'Friend buying a flat that's £250k (ie just under stamp duty slab threshold). Offer accepted, seller just pulled out and gave no reason. Hmmm. Wonder if flat will go back on the market straight away at a slightly higher price.' Ash Rees, property worker, Cardiff . 'Not keen on the Autumn Statement figures in regards to Stamp Duty. Those higher priced properties just got even harder to sell. These HMRC Stamp Duty Calculators are not great reading for people who have recently completed on £250k+ properties #SorryDad' Max Woolf, IT developer, Birmingham . 'Dear George Osborne. I just bought my first house. Can I have my stamp duty back please?' Melissa Blake, personal assistant, Brighton . 'Not sure if the stamp duty change is going to make things easier or if house prices will continue to rocket in price.' David Miller, retired diplomat, Bedfordshire . ‏'Perfect timing for me! Just exchanged contracts and this welcome change will save me almost £5,000 stamp duty. Very happy.' Until tonight a property costing between £125,000 and £250,000 was charged one per cent of its value as tax, but a penny over the £250,000 threshold it suddenly jumped to three per cent. With the new system, only the amount above £250,000 will be taxed at the higher rate, making the jump less painful. It will end the long-standing problem of people struggling to sell homes at values just above each threshold. It means any home sold for less than £937,500 will cost less in stamp duty than under the old system. Homes worth less than 125,000 will continue to carry no stamp duty at all. Anyone buying a home worth between £125,001 and £250,000 will have to pay two per cent in tax. On houses worth between £250,001 and £925,000, they will pay 2 per cent on the slice from £125,001 and £250,000 and then only 5 per cent on the amount between £250,001 and £925,000. The value of a property between £925,001 and £1.5million will be taxed at 10 per cent, and on more than £1.5million it will rise to 12 per cent tax. People owning an average priced house will save a four-figure sum in tax. But it is the very high priced houses which are affected the most though. A £1.5 million house will now see the buyer paying £93,750 in stamp duty, an increase of 25 per cent on £75,000 currently paid. A £2.5 million home will see stamp duty increase from £175,000 to £213,750. Anyone buying a £4 million home will pay £393,750 in stamp duty - a 41 per cent increase from £280,000. Expensive: This north London home is worth £1.35million and stamp duty on it will rise from £67,500 to £78,750 . The Chancellor today abolished the 'slab' system which meant the amount paid in stamp duty increased sharply at each threshold . Under the changes, stamp duty on properties under £937,500 will fall but the bill will rise for more expensive houses . Revealed: HMRC has produced this table showing whether home buyers will be better or worse off after today's announcement . Meanwhile, a £10 million home will incur a 59 per cent increase, rising from £700,000 to £1.1 million. Trevor Abrahamsohn, who specialises in selling high-end homes, says the market he deals in is already struggling and the changes are 'disastrous' Edward Heaton, a property consultant, believes the increase would further stifle the 'subdued market' but said buyers will end up taking it on the chin. He said: 'Unwelcome as this news might be to those of us in the industry, I don't think this will make London and the UK any less attractive to international buyers whilst wealthy British buyers will also come to terms with it.' Peter Rollings, CEO of high-end agent Marsh & Parsons, said: 'Any additional strain on the top tiers of the housing market will be absorbed, and the natural rhythm of the property market won't be disrupted'. And Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, told MailOnline: ‘Scrapping the UK’s most unfair tax is something few can disagree with. ‘The market distortion caused due to the cliff-hanger taxes has always been wrong, and it’s good to see the Chancellor following what has already been announced in Scotland by scrapping it. ‘The great difficultly was trying to mimic similarly proportioned charges under the new system and a reasonable job has been done of that with the exception of million pound plus houses.’","Chancellor announced major reforms to unpopular stamp duty system .

"An Ayn Rand novel written, temporarily shelved and later published as a play is finally being released in its original form. Coming soon: Ayn Rand's novel 'Ideal' will be published July 7, the New American Library said . The New American Library, an imprint of Penguin Random House, announced Thursday that Rand's 'Ideal' would be published July 7. 'The arrival of a never-before-seen Ayn Rand novel will thrill dedicated readers and is a true publishing event,' New American Library's vice president Kara Welsh said in release. Rand had worked on the novel, about a Greta Garbo-like actress and the fans she confronts, in the mid-1930s. Protagonist Kay Gonda 'pleads for help from six of her most devoted fans: an upstanding family man, a farmer, an artist, an evangelist, a wealthy playboy, and a lost soul,' the release said. In the story, Gonda asks her fans for help and says she has been accused of murder, the release said, per Publisher's Weekly. Unhappy with how 'Ideal' turned out, Rand turned the novel into a play, which came out in 2005's 'Three Plays'. Next summer's publication will include both the novel and the play. Dr. Leonard Piekoff first read 'Ideal' after Rand's death before he put it in the Ayn Rand Archives, Publishers Weekly reported. Then, the Ayn Rand Institute's Richard Ralston discovered the book as the archives were being saved digitally. He directed Peikoff to the work, according to the trade magazine. The book is set to include an introduction from Peikoff. Rand, who died in 1982, is still widely read and is known for the million-selling novels 'Atlas Shrugged' and 'The Fountainhead,' both of which have been adapted for film. In 2013, the Ayn Rand Institute claimed that 29.5million copies of Rand's books have been sold. 'Atlas Shrugged' is widely known for a speech delivered by character John Galt. The sentence 'Who is John Galt?' regularly appears on bumper stickers and other merchandise. Rand herself came to be known as the founder of the Objectivist movement. Individualism and laissez-faire capitalism are two tenets supported by the philosophy. The New York Observer wrote that during Rand's lifetime 'To the left, she was a reactionary, a fascist, a capitalist pig who advocated for a complete separation between government and economics, limitless individualism and the virtue of selfishness. 'To the right, she was an atheist; to moderates, an absolutist.' Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, radio host Rush Limbaugh, and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have counted themselves as fans of Rand's work. Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and Rob Lowe, Hugh Hefner, Mark Cuban and Billie Jean King are just a few of the many celebrities that have  voiced their support for Rand's philosophy and writings, Mother Jones reported in 2009.

'However, we feel the decision to stop selling GTA5 is in line with the majority view of our customers.' Mr Cooper said Target would continue to sell other R-rated DVDs and games. 'While these products often contain imagery that some customers find offensive, in the vast majority of cases, we believe they are appropriate products for us to sell to adult customers,' he said. 'However, in the case of GTA5, we have listened to the strong feedback from customers that this is not a product they want us to sell.' GTA5 is an award-winning game which set a sales record for entertainment products, passing the $1 billion sales mark after three days.","General manager of corporate affairs Jim Cooper said Target would no longer sell Grand Theft Auto V .

"Naomi Hunter was just three-years-old when she was first sexually abused by two men close to her. She suffered in silence until the age of 10 and when the physical abuse stopped, her mental torture continued into her teens as she developed an eating disorder at the age of 13. ‘It happened for so many years it was just normal for me. My whole view of the world was skewed,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Hunter, is now 31, a mother and a primary school teacher and as part of her mission to help others from suffering sexual abuse she has written an illustrated book to teach children about the subject and to show parents and teachers how to talk about it. Primary school teacher Naomi Hunter has written an illustrated book to help children speak out about sex abuse . 'I connected strongly with children I think because of my own childhood experience and lack thereof, I really found my own joy being around them,' she said of being a teacher. 'I always knew I wanted to do something more and when the idea of the book came up I realised that's what I wanted to do, to provide help... on a level that's respectful of what children go through,’ she said. ‘There is no sexual abuse education at all in Australia, it's more just sexual and puberty education which doesn’t happen until grade five or six which is such a shame,’ Ms Hunter added. She believes parents should begin teaching their children about ‘body safety’ as soon as they can talk so that the children have the ‘confidence to know what is right or wrong’. Ms Hunter, seen here as a little girl, was abused as a child until the age of 10 . ‘It doesn’t have to be about abuse but body safety...  for example washing yourself in private areas and who is allowed to touch those areas… it’s about talking about these things in a real, nurturing and informative way.’ Ms Hunter lives with her husband, her high-school sweetheart Jeremy, and their five-year-old daughter Marli in Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, Victoria. She wrote her book, A Secret Safe To Tell, four years ago but it has taken years to get it published because it was seen as a ‘risky topic to invest in’. 'I wrote the first draft relatively efficiently as it came from such a personal place. I felt at ease in writing it,’ she said. Editing it so that it was perfectly reachable and appropriately sensitive took a while but now it is published and already helping children to speak out. The book describes one little girl's experience alongside illustrations. Naomi hopes her book, A Secret Safe To Tell, will be used by parents, psychologists and in schools . One page says: 'He said that I was a GOOD GIRL and I would be PERFECT... I liked hearing that. We had SECRETS that no one else could know.' Another paragraph reads: 'When I closed my eyes all I could see were HIS GAMES and HIS HANDS. It DID NOT feel nice.... But HE SAID IT DID feel nice.' As Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes’ sex crimes were revealed this year, Ms Hunter said her publisher believed it was the right time to release the book. Since then the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and Rolf Harris’s abuse conviction in the UK have also opened the gateway for discussions around the topic in Australia. ‘People are feeling safer to talk about it. There is so much shame going through it that you hide it for so many years,’ she said. Ms Hunter said she didn’t speak out when she was young because she ‘probably wasn’t strong enough’. In her teenage years Naomi developed a severe eating disorder. She said it was her way of coping with her childhood abuse . ‘I didn't know that behaviour wasn't normal. I’ve really been trying to speak out my whole life in some ways... but now I’m a in a really strong place,’ she said. Ms Hunter hopes her book will be used by parents, support careers, in schools and education programmes and by clinical psychologists. 'The feedback has been amazing. Everyone is so supportive of it as a nurturing tool to break the taboo,’ she said. Ms Hunter believed there wasn’t much support for her when she did reveal the abuse and so she found comfort in anorexia. ‘I was very unwell and very troubled. I didn’t really feel I could relate to anyone. But at school I was the head prefect, I got amazing grades,’ she explained. While she was at highschool Naomi met her future husband Jeremy. She credits him for helping her become strong again and said he always believed in her book . Ms Hunter, is now 31, a mother to five-year-old daughter Marli (centre) and a primary school teacher. She lives with her family in Victoria and hopes to continue writing books about her experiences . The mother-of-one said her life turned around when she met her boyfriend, now husband, Jeremy at highschool. ‘He was a massive turning point. We met when we were 16 and were high school sweethearts, we are so connected and so amazing together and are stronger together. ‘He's the reason why I’m here today. He’s provided me with so much strength.’ Ms Hunter said Jeremy believed in her book from ‘the first moment’. Child sex abuse is not the only subject Ms Hunter wants to raise awareness of. She also hopes to write books on mental health, cancer and grief. ‘This is just one of many ideas. I’ve got heaps of experiences to draw on. A family member suffers from schizophrenia. I lost my brother to leukaemia. I suffered anorexia. ‘After what I went through, I just want to provide beautiful nurturing books without frightening anyone.’ For more details on Naomi Hunter's book visit www.naomihunter.com.au and or www.facebook.com/naomihunterauthor .","Naomi Hunter suffered sexual abuse as a child from the age of three .

"A donkey is missing her annual nativity show for the first time after being stabbed 12 times by a manic in a night time attack. Cheeky the donkey, who is 22 years old, was due to star in the Christmas show at Greenmeadow Farm in Cwmbran, South Wales, until she was knifed in the night at her farm by a mystery intruder. Police are today hunting the cruel attacker who attacked the 22-year-old just days before the nativity show where she would be cheered by children. Cheeky the donkey was due to star in the Christmas show until she was knifed in the night  by an intruder . Mare Cheeky has been stitched up and will watch the nativity from the wings as she receives treatment for her deep stab wounds. Workers at the community farm in Cwmbran, South Wales, where Cheeky lives are in shock at the senseless violence. Manager Elizabeth Burns said: 'It is abhorrent that someone could do this to an innocent animal - especially before the nativity. 'As well as being upset that Cheeky has suffered we are really disturbed. The nativity is going on in Cheeky's absence with an unnamed stand in donkey (pictured) Cheeky has been stitched up and is receiving treatment for her deep stab wounds (pictured) 'Now our focus is on monitoring Cheeky and nursing her back to health. 'It is a shame that we are having to hide Cheeky away while she gets better because her appearance could upset the children who visit the farm at this time of year. 'But the show must go on and all the other animals are performing well without their friend Cheeky.' Despite sharing a paddock with two other donkeys Cheeky was the only animal injured at Greenmeadow Community Farm. The farm are working closely with Gwent Police who believe the wounds were deliberately inflicted. It has now incorporated regular night patrols and the farm has increased their security. A spokesperson for Gwent Police said: 'We are appealing for information after a donkey was injured. 'The 22 year old donkey, called Cheeky, received 12 puncture wounds to both hind legs, the abdomen and it's neck. 'She has received treatment from the vet, is back at the farm and her condition is being monitored.'

"Littlewoods has been accused of overcharging shoppers with its interest free 'buy now, pay later' option - which can lead to hard-up customers paying double what they would elsewhere. The weekly payment option available online spreads the payments over a number of weeks, making it more manageable for families to cope with the cost of Christmas, the retailer claims. But it can lead to some of the most cash-strapped families paying as much as double what they should over the year once the money is totted up. Littlewoods has been accused of overcharging shoppers with its high profile campaign interest free 'buy now, pay later' option- fronted by presenter Myleene Klass - which can lead to hard-up customers paying double what they would elsewhere . The high profile campaign - fronted by presenter Myleene Klass - tells customers: 'Whether you're buying clothes for the kids or updating your dishwasher, you can make it all manageable by spreading the cost. 'Everything you buy is available interest free – giving you more flexibility when it comes to your budget.' But a quick internet search reveals that some of most desirable gifts this Christmas are available at a fraction of the price elsewhere. Littlewoods offers Barbie's Malibu House for £100, but the toy was available on Amazon for just £49.99. And an IPhone 5 64gb in white, will cost £519 at Littlewoods, compared to 359.99 . An Xbox one with Alien games costs £449 at Littlewoods - compared to just £339 at online retailer Very. And a Radley Bloomsbury Barrel Bag was £256, compared to £209 from the Radley website .

And an IPhone 5 64gb in white, will cost £519 at Littlewoods, compared to 359.99. Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said that it was a 'disgusting rip-off', and compared the deals to that of a 'payday loan company'. He said: 'It's not just a marginal increase. How sad. This really does prey on poor people and it is going to hit the most cash strapped families the hardest this Christmas - like payday loans do. The weekly payment option available online spreads the payments over a number of weeks - but it can lead to some of the most cash-strapped families paying as much as double what they should over the year . 'What a shame that Littlewoods used to be a family retailer, and now they are capitalising on this reputation and milking it. They are using the poor as a cash cow at Christmas.' A Littlewoods spokesman said: 'We totally refute any suggestion that Littlewoods is misleading customers with its interest-free offer. We make it very clear for Littlewoods customers exactly what they're buying and how much they're paying, with no hidden extras. 'Littlewoods customers benefit from a range of flexible payment options to help spread the cost of purchases – a simple offer that they tell us they really value and that we've been providing for more than 80 years. 'Comparing a handful of prices at one point in time doesn't tell the full story. Littlewoods has regular sales, discounts and promotions, so the headline price customers see isn't always the price they end up paying – it's often lower. We're currently offering up to 50% off a wide selection of toys, gifts, furniture and electricals, for example. We also have regular three for two offers in the run-up to Christmas.

"The first letter sent by Airmail from Britain to Australia has been unveiled, along with a host of retro travel posters to celebrate 80 years of the Kangaroo Route. British Airways has marked the 80th anniversary of its regular mail service between the UK and Australia - which falls on December 8 - by releasing the posters which encouraged Britons to make the journey Down Under. The first Airmail letter was sent on December 8, 1934, when Imperial Airways, a precursor to British Airways, began its regular weekly mail service between England and Australia. Generations of families have kept in touch via the UK-Australia Airmail post service from British Airways . The first letter was successful sent by airmail on December 8, 1934 - almost 80 years ago . British Airways still has the envelope of one of the first letter sent that day, to the Right Hon Sir Auckland Geddes, which arrived in Brisbane 13 days later. His son, Eric Campbell Geddes, was then the chairman of Imperial Airways. The weekly mail service, which began exactly 80 years ago to the day, on December 8, 1934, started off as a partnership between three different airlines; Imperial Airways, Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Qantas Empire Airways. Imperial Airways and Indian Trans-Continental Airways together flew Airmail from Karachi to Singapore, with stops in Jodhpur, Delhi, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok and Alor Star. Qantas Empire Airways flew the Airmail the final leg from Singapore to Brisbane, via Darwin. The delivery service started off as a partnership between three different airlines; Imperial Airways, Indian Trans-Continental Airways and Qantas Empire Airways . On April 13, 1935, British Airways, then operating as Imperial Airways, and Qantas Empire Airways opened the 12,754 mile route for passengers. The journey took 12 days and a single fare from Croydon to Brisbane cost £195 one-way. Now British Airways, the only European carrier flying between Heathrow and Sydney, makes the daily flight from London to Sydney in just over 22 hours. John Chisholm, Airmail product manager for IAG Cargo, the cargo arm of British Airways and Iberia, said: 'Over the last 80 years British Airways has played a huge part in keeping families, friends, businesses, diplomats and governments in touch with one another, by providing the vital link for Airmail between the UK and Australia. To this day, the postal service carries 34,000 tonnes of Airmail annually - though now it's a direct flight . In 1934, Imperial Airways was responsible for Airmail between London and Karachi, Pakistan . 'We're very proud to carry the Royal Mail logo on the side of every British Airways aircraft. Australia is still one of our biggest airmail cargo destination and we transport over 500,000 kgs of letters and parcels a year between the Sydney and London. 'We expecting demand to build very quickly as everyone rushes to try and beat the Post Office's December 4 postal deadline for mailing cards and presents to Australia in time for Christmas!' While the number of letters posted has fallen, the number of parcels sent between the UK and Australia has increased, thanks to the growing popularity of ecommerce sites and internet shopping. IAG Cargo carries approximately 34,000 tonnes of Airmail annually, including those letters intended for the is British and US military, deployed overseas. Then, Imperial and Indian Trans-Continental Airways carried it along to Singapore with Quantas finishing the route to Brisbane . Imperial Airways and Indian Trans-Continental Airways together flew Airmail from Karachi to Singapore, with stops in Jodhpur, Delhi, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon, Bangkok and Alor Star.

"Foreign billionaires, multinational businesses and UK-based banks will be hit with swingeing tax hikes, George Osborne said today. Wealthy ‘non doms’, who have based themselves in Britain for years without paying tax, will  see the annual charge for staying in the country double. 'Non-domiciled residents' live in UK but are registered as foreign nationals to save tax on income made abroad. But from next year  non-doms who have lived in the UK for 12 of the last 14 years will have to pay £60,000 a year to qualify for the status – rising to £90,000 if they have been in Britain for 17 of the past 20 years. The current rate is £30,000. Scroll down for video . George Osborne said some banks won’t pay tax for 15 to 20 years. He said this was 'totally unacceptable' Mr Osborne said the tax changes meant the richest 20 per cent in Britain were contributing more than the remaining 80 per cent put together. He said this proved ‘we are all in this together’. A new levy on multinational businesses - dubbed a ‘Google tax’ - will also be introduced to stop giant technology firms avoiding tax. The Chancellor claimed that some of the largest companies in the world ‘including those in the tech sector’ use complex tax arrangements to ‘avoid paying taxes’. He announced there would be a new 25 per cent tax on profits generated by multinationals  in the UK. At the moment many firms ‘artificially shift’ profits out of the country to cut their tax bill, he said. Mr Osborne told MPs: ‘That’s not fair to other British firms. It’s not fair to the British people either. Today we’re putting a stop to it. My message is consistent and clear. Low taxes; but taxes that will be paid.’ Google was last year accused by MPs of 'calculated and unethical' tax affairs after its HMRC bill came to light. The company generated £11.5billion in revenue from the UK between 2006 and 2011 and paid just £10million in corporatation taxes in the same period. The multinationals targeted include Silicon Valley technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple, and also Starbucks. The tax - officially referred to as the 'diverted profits tax' is intended to raise an extra £1billion over the next five years. Mr Osborne said the tax changes meant the richest 20 per cent in Britain were contributing more than the remaining 80 per cent put together. He said this proved ‘we are all in this together’. UK-based banks will also be stopped from using losses from overseas to cut their tax bill in Britain. The Chancellor also laid out plans to ‘make sure our banks pay their fair share too’. Mr Osborne told MPs: ‘Under the rules we inherited banks can offset all their losses from the financial crisis against tax on profits for years to come. ‘Some banks wouldn’t be paying tax for 15 to 20 years. That’s totally unacceptable. The banks got public support in the crisis and they should now support the public in the recovery. ‘I am today limiting the amount of profit in established banks that can be offset by losses carried forward to 50 per cent and delaying relief on bad debts. ‘Together that means banks will contribute almost £4billion more in tax over the next five years.’","Wealthy 'non doms' in UK for years to be charged up to £90,000 a year .

"A 12-year-old Florida girl suffered burns to 71 per cent of her body after a can of gasoline exploded next to her. Heather Tyer and her family were having a pit fire at their Polk County home last week when the explosion happened. The gas was being used to set logs on fire. Polk County Fire Lieutenant Charles Irving told 10 News: 'Burn patients are so difficult from one minute to the next. you know, they can seem fine, and then things can go terribly wrong very quickly.' Heather Tyer suffered burns to 71 per cent of her body after a can of gasoline exploded next to her at the Florida's 21-year-old's family home last week . Mr Irving was first on the scene, and even returned to get Heather's mother Amy on to the emergency helicopter to accompany her daughter to Tampa General. Heather is said to be recovering well from the ordeal, and her local community are now fundraising to help with her treatment. Heather's aunt Amanda Tyler told local media that her niece was 'strong' and 'doing just fine'. Another one of Heather's relatives, Janice Anderson, said seeing how many volunteers had turned out to help her, 'gives me goosebumps'. So far more than $26,000 has been raised to help pay for Heather's hospital treatment and rehabilitation . In less than a week, more than $26,000 has been raised to help Heather through fundraising website gofundme. Mr Irving said the accident was a reminder for people to be careful when using gasoline which was 'not one of the better fuels to use'. He said: 'There has to be water on the site at all times, and someone attending to the fire at all times. And if we do that, tragedies like this can be avoided.'","Heather Tyer's family was having a pit fire at their Florida home .

"A mother-of-two facing her last Christmas after being diagnosed with inoperable cancer will get her dream wedding after well-wishers donated cash, rings and even a venue. Aimee Willett, 26, of Sittingbourne, Kent, made a bucket list of things she wanted to do when she discovered she had terminal cancer - including marrying her fiancé, Michael Bond, 26. Ms Willett and Mr Bond thought they would never be able to afford their dream wedding - but following a fundraising appeal generous well-wishers have donated thousands of pounds in money and services to ensure the couple get their dream day. Aimee Willett, who has an inoperable tumour (pictured with sons Charlie, eight, and Kaleb, three) has been able to book her dream wedding thanks to the generosity of well-wishers touched by her bravery . Ms Willett's inoperable tumour was found in June this year and she is now campaigning for a lowering of the age limit for smear tests on the NHS. Ms Willett, who is mother to Charlie, eight, and Kaleb, three, has undergone surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy but has been warned she is unlikely to survive until 2016. The couple, who have been together six years, thought they would never be able to afford their dream wedding in time and have now said they are overwhelmed by the offers pouring in from sympathisers. Wedding planners, florists, car companies, professional photographers, venue owners and cake makers have all reached out to the couple offering to donate to the event. Aimee made a bucket list of things she wanted to do - including marrying her fiancé, Michael Bond (pictured) Ms Willett wants her boys have the best Christmas ever - and is taking them to Lapland UK as a surprise . Ms Willett has now booked to have her big day in February at Westenhanger Castle in Hythe, Kent. The Remi Collection, a company from Walton-on-Thames, is providing the rings. Ms Willett, who previously worked as a waitress, said: 'It's been overwhelming, mental. I never thought this was going to happen. People offering all this, it's lovely, it's beautiful. 'But it's got the message out there to raise awareness which is the only thing I really wanted.' Westenhanger Castle director Sarah Poole offered the fortified manor house, which was once owned by Henry VIII, for free. She said: 'It's every girl's dream to get married in a castle.' Ms Willett said the generosity of her well-wishers has left her feeling overwhelmed . Cinderella's Dreams Wedding and Event based in Sevenoaks, Kent, is supplying chair covers and decorations. In addition, a fundraising appeal with an original target of £7,000 has raised more than £31,000. The target was smashed by an anonymous single donation of £25,000. David Fairbank, 27, from Suffolk, created the JustGiving fundraising page and said: 'I'm gobsmacked by it and pretty chuffed. 'We don't know who made the £25,000 donation. 'It could be a celebrity or a business person.' Ms Willett says now hopes to give her family the 'best Christmas ever' as part of her bucket list and is taking her children to Lapland UK. Last week she said she hopes her story will encourage women to go to their cervical cancer screening and hopes the national smear test age will be lowered. She said: 'I am bitter about it and I would like to see the age lowered. 'I think 25 is too old - especially if a girl has had a child at a young age. 'The biggest thing for me now is for people to be more aware. 'If you experience anything that's not normal, go to your doctor and get it checked out and when you get a letter asking you to go for a smear test make an appointment straight away and keep it. 'I always thought it would never happen to me because I was young, but cancer doesn't pick an age group.'","Aimee Willett, 26, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at her first smear test .

"Mr Justice Mostyn said the case was 'terrible' and the most 'chilling' in his 30-year career . A baby girl was beaten and shaken to the point of death in a series of ‘macabre and chilling’ attacks by her father, a High Court judge has ruled. The 20-year-old man subjected his daughter to ‘diabolical’ assaults which broke ‘the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society,’ Mr Justice Mostyn found. In a judgement made public today he said the four-month-old child was saved after she collapsed and was taken to hospital. She was found to have a broken neck and severe damage to her spine. Doctors who examined her also discovered that she had five broken ribs, inflicted over a three-month period, and as many as five fractures to both legs, suffered between mid-December last year and early January this year. There were numerous more minor wounds, grazes and bruises . The father – who has been jailed for 12 years - admitted in a statement to the High Court: ‘I am a monster.’ However in a controversial decision by judges he has not been named, even though he is considered ‘a serious risk to the public’. His identity will remain unknown when he is released from prison, when he will be aged in his early thirties. Mr Justice Mostyn said in his High Court ruling, handed down in Swansea in June but only published after the end of a Crown Court trial last month: ‘This is a shocking catalogue of injuries.’ He added: ‘This is a terrible case. In 30 years as a lawyer, of which the last thirteen were as a part-time judge, and after four years sitting as a full-time judge I have never read and heard evidence so macabre and chilling as I have heard here. This is not overblown or rhetorical language on my part. ‘The father admits that almost from the time that his beautiful newly-born daughter returned from hospital at eleven days old until 13th January 2014 when she was only four months old, he systematically subjected her to a series of diabolical attacks (and I use for once the adjective advisedly), attacks of such frequency and severity that it was providential that she did not perish. ‘In his statement of 6th March 2013, the father admits everything. ‘At this point, I would only say that I doubt that even if Freud or Jung were alive today and able to advise me, that they would be able to give me an explanation for conduct that is so completely at variance with any understanding of human nature, conduct which has no basis rational or irrational, so it seems to me, but which violates the most basic and elemental taboos which govern our society.’ The judgment was published only after the conclusion of a Crown Court trial in Swansea last week in which the father was found guilty of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm. Pictured, Swansea Crown Court . Mr Justice Mostyn said the baby’s mother was ‘controlling’, ‘needy’ and ‘dictatorial’. ‘She certainly knew how to wind the father up,’ the judge said. The mother would watch pornography to provoke the father, who took over most of the care of the baby. The judge listed 19 kinds of assault to which the father subjected the baby while they were alone together, including pressing his thumb into her eye until it bled, throttling her, bending her double, holding her upside down and shaking her, bashing her head against a cupboard, forcing a bottle into her mouth until it bled, and submerging her in the bath so the baby had the sensation of drowning. The High Court judge said: ‘I cannot conceive that the mother would not have been aware that something was amiss while these barbaric attacks were being carried out.’ Mr Justice Mostyn’s family division ruling found that ‘exceptionally serious crimes have been committed by the father’ and that the girl’s 19-year-old mother ‘is guilty of neglect’. At the time of the ruling in June the father was free and living with his step-father, and had resumed a sexual relationship with the mother. Mr Justice Mostyn called on the Crown Prosecution Service ‘to make their decision about whether to prosecute at the soonest opportunity so that all aspects of this desperately tragic case can be concluded as soon as possible.’ The June judgment was published only after the conclusion of a Crown Court trial in Swansea last week in which the father was found guilty of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm. The jury took just 90 minutes to bring in its verdict. The 20-year-old was sentenced to 17 years, with 12 years to be served in prison before release on licence for five years. The Crown Court judge, Judge Keith Thomas told the father: ‘You do present a serious risk to the public. In order to do what I can to protect the public, I am going to maximise that term.’ But Judge Thomas ordered that the name of the man should remain secret. The judge is understood to have been concerned that nothing should allow the public to identify the child, who is now in local council care. The unusual decision means that naming the father has been banned by both Judge Keith Thomas in the Crown Court and Mr Justice Mostyn in the High Court. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, a campaigner against secrecy in the courts, said: ‘The evidence from the Rotherham scandal is that secrecy does not necessarily protect children. It should not be imagined that failing to name an offender is doing the right thing . ‘In this case, the wider public has been left at risk. It is doubtful that failing to name the monster will protect the child, but it certainly puts the rest of society at risk. So often secrecy has not protected the child – it has protected the abusers.’ During the Crown Court trial in Swansea, Judge Keith Thomas made an order under section 39 of the Children & Young Persons Act, 1933, prohibiting the publication of material which might identify the victim of the offences. These concerned the potential harm caused by being identified as the victim of a locally notorious crime. But the judge also took account of concerns from the local authority involved that if she was identified it could harm attempts to place her with a new family as well as make it harder for her to fully integrate with any new family. The judge made the point in court that he was not prohibiting the publication of the defendant’s name, but that if the name was reported care had to be taken not to identify the relationship between the the convicted man and the victim.","The infant was found to have a broken neck and severe damage to spine .

"A Brooklyn hipster and new dad learned that beards and babies don't get along and so he decided to shave the facial hair he sported for most of his adult life and devise a way to preserve it forever. Luke Hughett didn't realize his beard would be such a target for his baby daughter Willa who tugs on it, spits up on it, and bursts into tears if it gets too close to her face. 'She pulls on it. It's a magnet. It gets in her face it annoys her. It's like a target,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In her face: Hughett's beard gets in his daughter's face and annoys her to the brink of tears .

'There's gotta be a way I can keep both my baby and my beard,' he said. After having a barber trim both his beard and mustache in just one piece, he had an artist preserve the beard in a 45-block of solid Lucite, reports Gothamist. While his fiancé Erin thought him strange for so desperately holding on to his beard, baby Willa took lovingly to daddy's baby face. 'Now that I don't have a beard it's been great with Willa. I can put my face right up next to hers and she likes it. There's not this barrier between us anymore.' Now Hughett kisses his baby goodnight and then goes to kiss his other prized possession, the beard he had permanently preserved in Lucite so he'll never have to part with it even after his baby becomes an adult and leaves home.

"Russian president Vladimir Putin is despised so much in one Ukrainian city that his picture is regularly melded with an image of Hitler and printed onto products which allow locals to urinate and wipe their bottoms on his face. Adding the Nazi leader's distinctive moustache and side parting to a picture of Putin's face, the image has been posted onto urinals and printed onto toilet paper. Cheeky market stall holders in the pro-European city of Lviv have also printed the image onto T-shirts and bags and all sorts of other paraphernalia. A young girl carries a bag with an image depicting Putin as the new Hitler, complete with the Nazi dictator's iconic moustache and side parting.

More chillingly, some have printed images of Putin with a single, bloody bullet wound through his forehead, while others have printed swastikas onto the Russian flag. Posters across the city also compare Putins annexation of the overwhelmingly ethnic Russian Crimean peninsula in March, with Hitlers 1938 annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, urinals feature a prominently placed picture of Putin with an expletive underneath to describe him.

"Boris Johnson has claimed it is part of human nature to have a fear of immigrants and that having such feelings 'doesn't make you a bad person'. The Mayor of London said it was up to politicians to highlight the benefits immigrants bring to the UK and has urged the Government for a 'welcoming policy' for those who choose to come to the country. His comments come after the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby described immigration in Britain as a 'great tradition'. Scroll down for video . The Mayor of London Boris Johnson (pictured) said it was up to politicians to highlight the benefits immigrants bring to the UK and urged the Government for a 'welcoming policy' for those who come to Britain . The Mayor has just concluded a week-long tour to the Far East as part of a UK Trade and Industry mission . Speaking after a week-long tour of the Far East as part of a UK Trade and Industry mission, Mr Johnson, 50, said it was natural to feel xenophobic on occasion. The 50-year-old told the Evening Standard: 'All human beings are prey to that feeling. 'It's part of human nature. It doesn't mean people are bad people, okay? 'What we've got to do is point out that there are benefits of immigration and that there are benefits of having talented people, and having a welcoming policy to people that will work hard.' He also described the benefits of immigrants to the UK housing market and said it is good that international investors can help support the industry because Britain is 'not awash with billionaires of our own'. His comments came after the Archbishop called immigration a 'great tradition' but warned it needed to be 'handled carefully'. Mr Welby, who spoke from Vatican City, said that despite the UK being a 'very, very crowded country', the tradition of welcoming immigrant communities stretched back hundreds of years. He said that while immigration is 'deeply embedded in our tradition of hospitality', it should be 'handled carefully' because of the 'strain on communities'. In a rare interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Mr Welby said: 'England, is a very, very crowded country. 'Since 2010, we've had net immigration of over 600,000 people. 'And immigration is something that has to be handled carefully, because it is a cause of strain in communities where very large numbers arrive. Always has been. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby today described immigration in Britain as a 'great tradition' 'There's an amazing chapel in Canterbury Cathedral in which the dean of the cathedral gave a space for worship to Huguenot refugees from religious persecution in the 16th century. 'He gave it to them temporarily. It's still there. They still have a Sunday service every week. 'It is the great tradition, secondly, of this country to be a place of asylum and safety and rescue and hope for people from all around the world. It is deeply embedded in our tradition of hospitality.' Mr Johnson has just concluded a week-long tour of the Far East as part of attempts to boost trade and investment between the UK and Far East. During his trip, the senior Conservative met politicians, including Indonesian president Joko Widodo, and a raft of business leaders  in Singapore and Jakarta, Indonesia. He was the first British politician to have a substantial meeting with President Widodo since his inauguration. Earlier this week, he also met Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak. The south east Asian country now has an economy worth £153billion ($241bn) and is predicted to reach developed economy status within the next six years. Following newly introduced legislations which liberate Malaysia's architecture and engineering sectors, Mr Johnson said British businesses should take advantage of what is on offer. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson, 50, met Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri Mohammad Najib Abdul Razak . 'This fast developing nation is awash with new and exciting trade and investment opportunities crying out for London's great minds and expertise,' he said. 'From great new feats of transport engineering to cutting edge design and architectural projects, I urge more British companies to get involved.' Mr Johnson, running for a return to Parliament in May, also defended the levels of affordable housing in the Malaysian-backed Battersea Power Station redevelopment. He said the 'affordable' element of the project, 15 per cent of the 3,000-plus properties, represented a gain of 600 discounted homes for Londoners. Mr Johnson said: 'It's with that spearhead of Malaysian money coming in and redeveloping Battersea Power Station that we are able to get on and build 25,000 homes, the majority of which will be for people in the UK and loads of which will be affordable. 'Plus we are able to get the extension of the northern line...don't forget that out of this development we have got to fund the first extension of the tube we have seen in 25 years, it's not a cheap thing to do. 'We have to build two new stations and it will produce as I say overall in the area 25,000 new homes. 'I think 600 affordable homes is better than no affordable homes.' Mr Johnson was caught up in a  mid-air scuffle during the return flight from Kuala Lumpur after a passenger had to be restrained at 35,000 feet. The Mayor joined efforts to restrain the man who was later arrested . Mr Johnson's defence of the project came after he met Prime Minister Razak in Kualar Lumpur to unveil Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) as the architects designing Malaysia Square, the £8bn main public space at the power station project. The London Mayor returned from his week-long tour this morning, although his journey back to the capital was not without drama. He was caught up in a dramatic mid-air scuffle during the return flight from Kuala Lumpur after an abusive passenger had to be restrained at 35,000 feet. The Mayor, a passenger on the flight which was destined for London's Heathrow, joined efforts to restrain the man who was described as 'off his head' by one of Mr Johnson's delegation. A spokesman for the Mayor told the MailOnline: 'The Mayor along with a number of other passengers and members of the cabin crew did make several attempts to calm the gentleman concerned but to no avail.' The incident occurred at about 5.40am and the man, who is believed to be British, was detained by police officers when the 13 hour Malaysia Air flight landed at Heathrow. Met Police confirmed the man was arrested on suspicion of being drunk aboard an aircraft and common assault involving a member of the cabin crew. He was being held in custody at a west London police station this morning.","London Mayor said 'all human beings are prey to feelings of xenophobia'
