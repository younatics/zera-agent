"(CNN) -- Facetime with Saad Hariri, Leader of Future Movement . Saad Hariri is the leader of Lebanon's majority party, Future Movement. Lebanon's economic growth may have slipped from an estimated 7 percent to 4 percent so far this year, but according to politician and businessman Saad Hariri, the country should largely escape the effects of the global slowdown. The leader of Lebanon's majority party talks to MME about the credit crisis, its impact on remittances, and how he believes peace in the Middle East is the only way to bring political and economic stability to his country. In focus -- The Land Grab . The Gulf might have oil, but it has a shortage of arable land. A year ago, food prices skyrocketed and there were shortages of all kinds -- even for basics, such as bread. The shortage caught the region flat-footed, and now food security is a top concern for many countries. It has prompted the likes of Saudi Arabia and Qatar to use their petro-dollars to buy farmland in Africa and Asia to feed their people. In the long run, could this search for food security also develop sustainable agricultural businesses and local jobs in the process?

"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton claimed victory in Puerto Rico on Sunday and insisted that she is leading Sen. Barack Obama in the popular vote. Clinton won 68 percent of the vote compared with Obama's 32 percent. Her vote tally was 263,120; his was 121,458. The win gives Clinton the larger share of Puerto Rico's 55 delegates. The Democratic primary season ends Tuesday when Montana and South Dakota cast their votes. ""When the voting concludes on Tuesday, neither Sen. Obama nor I will have the number of delegates to be the nominee,"" she said in San Juan, Puerto Rico. ""I will lead the popular vote; he will maintain a slight lead in the delegate count,"" she said. Obama leads in the overall delegate count -- 2,070 to Clinton's 1,915.  CNN analysts weigh in on Clinton's next steps » . A candidate needs 2,118 to claim the Democratic nomination. The Clinton campaign has been focusing on the popular vote as it tries to convince superdelegates to pick her instead of Obama. The superdelegates are a group of about 800 party leaders and officials who vote at the convention for the candidate of their choice. But the popular vote count is debatable. If all the primary results including Florida and Michigan are counted, but not the caucus votes, Clinton leads in the popular vote 17,461,845 to Obama's 17,244,762, according to CNN estimates. That number includes giving Obama all the ""uncommitted"" votes from Michigan. Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early. Clinton won both states, but Obama's name was not even on the ballot in Michigan. The Democratic National Committee decided Saturday to reinstate all of Florida and Michigan's delegates to the national convention, with each delegate getting a half-vote to penalize the two states for holding their primaries earlier than party rules allowed. The DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee's move gave Clinton 87 delegates and Obama 63. In a second scenario, which adds in CNN's estimate of the caucus-goers, Obama leads Clinton 17,928,000 to 17,843,000. And in a third scenario, which includes all of the caucuses but does not give Obama Michigan's ""uncommitted"" vote, Clinton leads 17,873,000 to 17,703,000. Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence that Obama would clinch the nomination in the coming days. ""If not Tuesday, I think it will be fairly soon,"" he said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We hope this week, absolutely,"" he added. At a campaign stop in Mitchell, South Dakota, Obama congratulated Clinton for her win Sunday and praised her for being an ""outstanding public servant."" ""She is going to be a great asset when we go into November to make sure that we defeat the Republicans,"" he said.   Watch Obama rally in South Dakota » . As Clinton tries to win over the undecided superdelegates, she argued Sunday that she would be the stronger candidate to face Republican John McCain in the fall. ""In the final assessment, I ask you to consider these questions: Which candidate best represents the will of the people who voted in this historic primary? Which candidate is best able to lead us to victory in November? And which candidate is best able to lead our nation as our president in the face of unprecedented challenges at home and abroad?"" In the Puerto Rico primary, Clinton swept Obama in every major demographic group, including groups Obama generally wins, such as younger voters and higher-income voters, according to CNN's exit polls. CNN estimated turnout to be between 325,000 and 425,000. ""Most people in Puerto Rico, I would venture to guess, they are not even aware that there's a primary going on,"" said Luis Pabón-Roca, a local political analyst. Part of the reason for the lack of interest, he said, is because voters feel the primary isn't meaningful since Puerto Ricans cannot vote in the general election. The Democratic and Republican parties run the primaries and caucuses, and they allow U.S. territories, such as the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, to take part in the process. But only the 50 states and the District of Columbia vote in the general election.

"OAKLAND, California (CNN)  -- A former transit police officer charged with murder was released from custody Friday after posting a $3 million bail. Video shows Johannes Mehserle shoot Oscar Grant III in the back as another officer knelt on him. Dozens of demonstrators gathered in downtown Oakland to protest the release of Johannes Mehserle, 27, charged with killing an unarmed man on New Year's Day. iReport.com: Watch the protest . The former Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer's release funds came from unknown sources, Alameda officials told CNN. Video taken by a bystander showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Oscar Grant III, 22, in the back as another officer kneeled on Grant. Mehserle may have intended to draw and fire his Taser instead of his gun, according to a court filing by his attorney. In January, protests turned violent after a judge decided to allow bail for Mehserle's release. A preliminary hearing in the case is set for March 23, authorities said.

"A new company in Germany is trying to break into the fashion business selling stylish clothes designed and produced by prison inmates. Inmates design and produce the Haeftling range. The company Haeftling, which in English means inmate, has just opened its first store in Berlin. ""We want to have basic, durable, timeless, beautiful clothes,"" said Stephan Bohle, one of the company founders. Many of the clothes, cooking aprons and even stainless steel food trays offered in the Berlin store were either designed or manufactured in jails, but not just German ones. One design shows a female comic figure that was drawn by a man sitting on death row in Texas. Bohle said part of the proceeds from sales go to organizations that support prisoners' rights and better conditions for inmates, like Amnesty International. But in some cases, money goes directly to the inmates that designed certain pieces. ""In the case of the female cartoon figure, this man was almost granted a stay from execution because of the design he did for us but in the end unfortunately the appeals court ruled against him,"" Bohle said . The clothes offered at the Haeftling shop also tell the story of the inmates that designed individual pieces. A small text inside the item lays out the prisoners story, including the name, where he is in jail and how long the term will be. Some of the clothes are manufactured at a corrections facility in Halle, near Leipzig, in Eastern Germany.  Watch the inmates at work » . Prisoners sew cooking aprons in a jail workshop for several hours a day. ""It's wonderful, at least it takes your mind off jail for a little while,"" says Mario Hildebrand, who is serving a 20 month term in Halle. ""We can really identify with this label,"" he said. ""We are the prisoners and without us this label would not be possible, so we do take some pride in making these clothes."" However, Mario said he would not wear the clothes himself: ""Look, I am a prisoner, and I'm really not proud of it. It isn't something I want to be parading around."" But others seem to be catching the fever. Bohle said the company wants to start selling in the United States. ""We've had people from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles ask about Haeftling,"" he said in an interview in the flagship store in Berlin. Bohle said he hopes socially responsible clothes will also make for a good business for the company. E-mail to a friend .","Prison inmates design clothes for new shop in German capital .

"(CNN) -- Despite Hillary Clinton's landslide victory in Kentucky, Barack Obama has won a majority of pledged delegates in the race for the Democratic nomination. Clinton won Kentucky by more than 30 points, but Obama's share of the state's 51 delegates was enough put him over the threshold, according to CNN estimates. Obama is expected to pick up at least 14 delegates in Kentucky, and by CNN estimates,  that will give him 1,627 of the 3,253 pledged delegates at stake in all of primaries and caucuses. Obama will also pick up a win in Oregon, CNN projects, giving him the larger share of the state's 52 delegates. Obama's top strategist, David Axelrod, said getting the pledged delegate majority was an ""important milestone,"" but not the end of the trail. Neither candidate is expected to reach the  2,026 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. That means the race is likely to be settled by ""superdelegates"" -- party leaders and officials who will cast votes at the Democratic convention in August. Speaking in Iowa, where he won the first-in-the-nation caucuses, Obama told supporters, ""it was in this great state where we took the first steps of an unlikely journey to change America.""  Watch Obama say he's in reach of the nomination » . ""The skeptics predicted we wouldn't get very far. The cynics dismissed us as a lot of hype and a little too much hope. And by the fall, the pundits in Washington had all but counted us out. But the people of Iowa had a different idea,"" he said. Obama continued to look to the general election, focusing his attacks as he has for the past week on Sen. John McCain, while commending Clinton for ""her courage, her commitment and her perseverance."" Obama said McCain's policies don't represent change. ""This year's Republican primary was a contest to see which candidate could out-Bush the other, and that is the contest John McCain won,"" he said. McCain's camp accused Obama of launching ""the tired old political attacks of a typical politician, not the 'new politics' he's promised."" ""Without a doubt, Barack Obama is a talented political orator, but his naive plans for unconditional summits with rogue leaders and support for big tax hikes on hardworking families expose his bad judgment that Americans can ill-afford in our next president,"" spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement. After Kentucky's results came in, Clinton thanked her supporters for handing her a win ""even in the face of some pretty tough odds."" ""Tonight we have achieved an important victory,"" she said in Louisville. ""It's not just Kentucky bluegrass that's music to my ears. It's the sound of your overwhelming vote of confidence even in the face of some pretty tough odds.""  Watch Clinton vow to keep going » . Clinton beat Obama across all age groups, income groups and education levels in Kentucky. Eighty-nine percent of Tuesday's voters in Kentucky were white, according to the exit polls. Among them, Clinton won 72-22 percent. Nine percent of the voters were African-American and they overwhelmingly broke for Obama, 87-7 percent. The exit polls from Kentucky also suggest a deep division among Democrats.  Watch how Clinton's win could affect the race » . Two-thirds of Clinton's supporters there said they would vote Republican or not vote at all rather than for Obama, according to the polls. Forty-one percent of Clinton supporters said they'd cast their vote for McCain, and 23 percent said they would not vote at all. Just 33 percent said they would back Obama in the general election, according to the polls. Those numbers are even worse for Obama than in West Virginia one week ago, where 36 percent of Clinton voters said they would back him in the fall. Obama on Tuesday downplayed the idea that his party will have trouble unifying once there is a nominee. ""Some may see the millions upon millions of votes cast for each of us as evidence that our party is divided, but I see it as proof that we have never been more energized and united in our desire to take this country in a new direction,"" he said. ""More than anything, we need this unity and this energy in the months to come, because while our primary has been long and hard-fought, the hardest and most important part of our journey still lies ahead."" Obama leads Clinton in the number of states won and in the popular vote in the primary and caucus contests this campaign season, but he has been careful not to declare victory in the Democratic contest. Obama doesn't have enough delegates to capture the nomination outright; Clinton still has a chance, if a slight one, to win the nomination if enough of the roughly 800 superdelegates were to back her. ""I'm going to make [my case] until we have a nominee, but we're not going to have one today, and we're not going to have one tomorrow, and we're not going to have one the next day,"" Clinton said Monday in Kentucky. She argues that she leads in the popular vote, but her argument is debatable. For Clinton to claim such a lead, primary states but not caucus states -- which Obama mostly won -- would only be counted, plus the popular vote totals in Florida and Michigan. Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early, in violation of Democratic Party rules. Obama's name wasn't on the Michigan ballot, and he received no votes in that state's contest. Clinton also argues that she's won the states that she contends would stack up stronger against McCain in the general election. ""The states I've won total 300 electoral votes. If we had the same rules as the Republicans, I would be nominee right now,"" she said. ""We have different rules, so what we've got to figure out is who can win 270 electoral votes. My opponent has won states totaling 217 electoral votes."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Obama captures majority of pledged delegates .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As President Obama approaches day 100 of his administration, some in Washington caution that the torture tug-of-war could be a costly distraction. Leg restraints await detainees at Guantanamo Bay in this 2006 photo. Earlier this month, the Obama administration released four Bush-era memos detailing ""enhanced interrogations"" of suspected al Qaeda members. Now, the White House is reviewing former Vice President Dick Cheney's request to make more memos public. Two weeks before Obama released any memos, Cheney submitted a request to the National Archives calling for the release of other documents. He says that what he requested will prove that the Bush interrogation tactics -- which critics have called a torture program -- worked. ""I haven't talked about it, but I know specifically of reports that I read, that I saw, that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country,"" Cheney said in an interview with Fox News last week. The White House is signaling that not only is it considering honoring Cheney's request, it may go even further. ""I think the president, as you know, is a big believer in transparency,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I think one of the things that will have to be examined is whether there are additional memos that have to be released that give a broader picture of what's gone on in enhanced interrogation techniques."" The almost daily revelations are dividing Democrats between those calling for full disclosure and those urging caution. ""We don't just turn the page without reading it. We want to make sure what the mistakes were so that the Obama administration doesn't make these mistakes,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. said Sunday. But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, warned Sunday against moving to quickly. ""We need to find these things out, and we need to do it in a way that's calm and deliberative and professional, because I think all of this, on the front burner, before the public, does harm our intelligence gathering, it does harm America's position in the world,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Across the aisle, Republicans are insisting the Justice Department drop any investigation of Bush administration officials who authorized harsh interrogations. ""I think that would be a stab in the back. I think he has already demoralized the CIA, put them in a CYA mode,"" Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri, said Sunday on Fox News. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the former Republican presidential candidate, said prosecuting those who gave legal advice is wrong. ""I don't think those memos should have been released, but the fundamental point now is whether to prosecute people who gave the president, in my view, legitimate advice, even though it was wrong,"" he said.  ""We should not be prosecuting people who gave legal advice. It's wrong to do that to them, and it sets a terrible precedent for the future."" Rep. Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, and House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio are calling on the White House to release a list of who was briefed about the interrogation programs. ""Congress and the American people deserve a full and complete set of facts about what information was yielded by CIA's interrogation program, and they deserve to know which of their representatives in Congress were briefed about these techniques and the extent of those briefings,"" Boehner said in a statement Monday. ""To date, the administration has fallen short in providing this information. ... The American people have been provided an incomplete picture of exactly what intelligence was made available by the interrogation program,"" he said. But Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent, said the whole debate over the memos is ""moot."" ""What do we gain, first, by releasing the memos; but, secondly, what do we gain from indicting lawyers for their opinions, if that is a possibility here? ... It will poison the water here in Washington. It will achieve nothing. It will make it harder for President Obama to do some of the big things he wants to do for the country,"" he said.","Former Vice President Dick Cheney wants more memos released .

"(CNN) -- In just one day, you'll get a mere glimpse of Rome, a city teeming with over two millennia of culture -- but it will surely whet your appetite for more. The sun sets behind St. Peter's Basilica on a beautiful spring day in Rome. Spring is one of the most beautiful times of year to visit the ""eternal city,"" when flowers begin to bloom from ancient monuments, cafe tables reappear on bustling sidewalks and throngs of summer tourists are yet to descend en masse. Food-lovers will also be thrilled to find many traditional Italian ingredients in high-season -- look out for fresh fava beans, agretti and wild mushrooms. Before dawn, head up to the Janiculum Hill to catch the sun rise. From here you'll be able to see the Vatican, Borghese Gardens, Pantheon, Colosseum, Castel Sant'Angelo and Campidolgio, all come to light in one breathtaking cityscape. In Rome, breakfast is on-the-go. Your best bet is to stroll through one of the early morning markets to pick up a hot cornetto and some fresh fruit. One of the oldest is Campo di Fiori, a daily mix of food and flower stalls in an eclectic renaissance square. Proceed from the Campo through the ruins of the Roman Forum, past the spot where Julius Caesar was slain, toward the Pantheon. Built in 124 A.D. as a temple to all the gods of Rome, the Pantheon remains today as a Catholic church and a tomb for Italian luminaries, such as the artist Raphael and King Vittorio Emmanuelle II. Stand in the center of the rotunda and gaze up to the heavens through the eight-meter-high oculus at the center of the five-ton concrete dome --a stunning feat of ancient engineering, still intact after two thousand years. The most important part of the morning is the coffee, and Romans are passionately divided as to who makes the best cup: Sant Eustachio (Piazza Sant'Eustachio, steps behind the Pantheon) or Tazza d'Oro (Via degli Orfani, a few feet in front of the Pantheon). Take your coffee the traditional Italian way, standing up at the bar. Spend the rest of the morning exploring St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museums. Home to the papacy, Vatican City is brimming with extraordinary artworks and monuments of history. Once inside St. Peter's, admire Michaelangelo's ""Pieta"" and the incredible soaring dome he helped complete. Climb to the top of it for an incredible view, and perhaps another coffee. Image gallery: See more of Rome's art treasures » . Splurge on a private tour guide for the Vatican museums to avoid the hour-long lines outside. Highlights include the Sistine Chapel, featuring Michelangelo's famed ceiling fresco series and ""Last Judgment,"" works by Raphael, da Vinci, Caravaggio, and ancient wonders from Rome and Egypt. After the Vatican, stroll across Via Cola di Rienzo and the Ponte de Margherita to the Piazza del Popolo, where an Egyptian obelisk of Rameses II has stood since 10 B.C. The food at Dal Bolognese, a fixture on the well-heeled lunch scene, is consistently outstanding and the view on the square cannot be beaten (don't miss the Caravaggios tucked inside the tiny Santa Maria del Popolo church nearby). In the afternoon, head to the Borghese for a leisurely stroll through the gardens and a stunning collection of Baroque sculpture. If you're in the mood for shopping, head down the Via Babuino towards the Spanish Steps. Drop into l'Offatorio perfume bar on the way for a ""fragrance tour"" and get a custom-made scent bottled. Also check out TAD, a minimalist-design luxury lifestyle store for everything from shoes to a haircut. Some of the city's best boutiques are nearby - find them by meandering through the side streets between Via Croce and Via Condotti. Essential to any afternoon in Rome are a few scoops of ice cream. The renowned classic Giolitti, in the Piazza Colonna, is an Italian institution: politicians flock here between their government meetings. Enjoy a few of their 40-odd flavors of gelatto as you stroll around the Column of Marcus Aurelius. If you're over by the Spanish Steps, try San Crispino on Via della Panetteria, and sit at the edge of Bernini's Trevi Fountain while you indulge. In the evening, take in a performance before dinner either at the Teatro dell'Opera, or the Accademia Santa Cecilia, for classical music. For dinner, Rome's casual outdoor trattorias cannot be beaten. For pizza, locals line up outside Da Ivo in Trastevere, then take their piping-hot thin-crust pie over to Piazza Santa Maria, the neighborhood's heart, and watch impromptu performers and musicians cheer the crowds. For homemade pasta, try Maccheroni or Da Francesco (particularly for gnocchi) near Piazza Navona. For a formal meal, head to the Michelin three-starred La Pergola at the Cavelieri Hilton. Arrive early for a gorgeous view of the sunset from the hotel bar, perched high atop Monte Mori. At night, the spirit of Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" lives on, in low-lit cafes, wine bars and nightclubs. Bar della Pace is a fashionable Roman classic for drinks. For all-night dancing, try the see-and-be-seen La Maison. Both are tucked behind the Piazza Navona, where you can stroll past Bernini's ""Quatro Fiumi"" (Four Rivers) fountains, beautifully lit up in the early hours of the morning.

"(CNN) -- The arrival of autumn in Australia will be a welcome relief for international visitors emerging from a bleak winter in the northern hemisphere. There's no mistaking the city of Sydney -- fine weather means you may struggle to see a cloud in the sky. Peak season may be winding up but with temperatures off their sticky summer highs it's a great time to sample one of the country's most recognizable cities. While few international visitors are likely to find themselves stranded in Sydney for 24 hours (if only!), here's our fast-track tour for travelers short on time. See the sun come up over Sydney Harbour. At this time of year, the sun rises at around 6:30am, an hour after the first ferries leave the wharf, so there's plenty of activity on the water. Early risers can waste no time in immersing themselves in Sydney's cultural highlights. At 7:00am, the Sydney Opera House hosts tours for just eight people to backstage areas normally off-limits to theatre-goers. At $100 per person, the two-hour tour is not a budget option but it does include breakfast. Be warned, the tour includes 300 steps. If you're not exhausted by the machinations of the Opera House, cool off with a relaxing dip. A recent spate of shark attacks may have put you off Sydney's beaches, but there are plenty of outdoor pools that offer both sun and seawater. For serious laps, try the North Sydney Olympic Pool (next to the Sydney Harbour Bridge) or for a lazier affair have a massage at Wylies Bath in Coogee. Image gallery: 24 hours in Sydney » . Once in Coogee you can admire the Australian coastline by following it all the way back to Sydney's famous Bondi Beach. Most people start in Bondi but there's no reason why you can't do it in reverse. The two-hour walk takes you past bays and beaches and through the dramatic Waverley Cemetery where you can reflect on life while breathing in the views. The path ends at the Bondi Icebergs surf club where you can grab a cold fizzy beer at the bar or stay for lunch at the Bistro. The hungry seagulls and pelicans at the Sydney Fish Market make lunch there a more interesting affair. Select your meal from the huge variety of seafood inside the market, grab a bottle of wine and an outdoor table and prepare to guard your chips. There is no shortage of up-market alternatives when it comes to dining out in Sydney. For one of the best try Tetsuya's in Kent Street. It was opened by Japanese-born Tetsuya Wakuda in 1989 and was lauded in a recent review as ""magical dining."" It's only open for lunch on Saturdays and you'd be advised to book well in advance for dinner. A cheaper option would be any of the BYO (bring your own) restaurants dotted around the city. Most restaurants allow you to bring your own bottle of wine, but they will charge you corkage. Still, it's cheaper than the mark-ups on bottles at licensed premises. Until May 24, visitors can drop into the Art Gallery of New South Wales to see the finalists and the winner of this year's Archibald Prize, Australia's leading portraiture contest. Shoppers can pick up a souvenir close by in one of Sydney's oldest and most beautiful shopping centers, the Queen Victoria Building. The building opened in 1898, underwent major refurbishment in the 1980s and is now not only a great example of Victorian architecture but a stunning place to grab a quick coffee. (Note: The builders are back but the building remains open. The new improvements are scheduled to finish in July 2009.) In the evening, take a twilight cruise of Sydney Harbour aboard a yacht. Sunsail invites everyone for a ""fun blast"" around the harbor every Wednesday evening from 5:30pm to 8:30pm. The yacht leaves from the Boat House in Lavender Bay, a short hop from the city on the north side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Two new festivals have been added to a busy calendar in Sydney this year. In June, Vivid Sydney promises to turn the city into ""a living canvas of music and light."" And on October 25, 20,000 people will have the opportunity to have ""Breakfast on the Bridge"" (yes, the Sydney Harbour Bridge) as part of the month-long Crave Sydney festival. Check the NSW Master Events Calendar for more. In the evening, join the pretty young things at The Ivy in George Street, or take the lift to the fourth floor of the Hilton Hotel where you'll find the Zeta Bar. The Loft on King Street Wharf is also popular, but it has a strict dress code so don't turn up looking like a traveler or you won't get in. And finally, there's no better place to end the night than in one of Sydney's karaoke bars. Some allow you to bring your own drinks. Check out the private booths at Karaoke World on Elizabeth Street where you can warble without shame until the early hours.","Start the day in Sydney with a backstage tour of the famous Opera House .

"SINGAPORE (CNN) -- Co-founder and executive director of Architecture for Humanity, Cameron Sinclair opened the second Principal Voices debate on Design for Good by outlining just what the term means to him, but also what it means to the communities his design solutions are aimed at. 'When your focus is social change... why wouldn't you want to share that openly?' Taking the ego out of architecture, Sinclair sees the sharing of transformative design ideas as being a moral responsibility of today's designers and architects. ""When your focus is social change and not financial change why wouldn't you want to share that openly?"" Below are some of Sinclair's thoughts on a number of topics that were discussed at the debate. On shared design . ""I always think of the design world like the medical world; we have people who are plastic surgeons, but we have a lot of people who are in the emergency room and a lot of our designers are in the emergency room dealing with the critical issues like post-disaster issues or systemic issues or poverty. When I was in college the idea of being a socially responsible architect was unheard of, it was almost taboo: 'We're trying to make jewels in the city', whereas a lot of us wanted to create cities that were jewels."" ""When your focus is social change and not financial change why wouldn't you want to share that openly? Innovation only succeeds when it's shared. If you're a pioneer and you come up with something that can change the world and you turn round and say 'I'm not going to share this idea with anyone' then you only impact the few and not the many."" ""But we're in a situation right now where we have to deal with a huge variety of issues. If you have a design idea that can improve the lives of a million people it's almost ethically irresponsible to keep to it yourself."" On sustainability . ""It angers me when sustainability gets used as a buzz word. For 90 percent of the world, sustainability is a matter of survival. When you as a designer design something that burdens a community with maintenance and old world technology, basically failed developed world technology then you will crush that community way beyond bad design; you'll destroy the economics of that community and often the community socially is broken."" ""You have to do this marriage between what is appropriate, learning from the local nature, but also can we leapfrog technologies, so we're not burdening people with outdated technologies. If we can come up with that, then it truly is sustainable."" On community involvement in design . ""The community is not your client but your partner. You don't just put up some nice big rendering and tell them this is what you might have and do a Q&A. Doing workshops within the community and having them design these quiet moments of innovation within the larger developments, not only allows an empowerment of that community, but also ownership."" ""Just because you put their name on the building doesn't mean they feel like they own it; but empower them in the process not only does it quicken the process, but you find you have the political will you can put through things you never even imagined."" ""When you have strong common will, then projects go forward. There's nothing worse than selling or convincing, but if you're inspiring and including then it's a beautiful thing, and at the end of it you're part of the community.""","Second Principal Voices debate took place in Singapore on July 9 .

"High blood pressure is truly a silent killer. In fact, a heart attack or stroke may be the first sign that you even have a problem. That's why it's so important to get your blood pressure checked every time you go to the doctor -- especially if you're a woman. High blood pressure can lead to stroke, kidney problems, heart trouble and other conditions. About 35 million American women have high blood pressure, and a third of them don't know it. In part, experts say, the increase comes just because women are living longer and doctors are paying more attention to the problem. But less-benign factors -- such as the exploding use of anti-inflammatory medicines (which make your body retain salt) and ever-increasing waistlines -- may be at play in what the American Heart Association calls a rise in uncontrolled hypertension in women. Fortunately, there are many ways to control your blood pressure, even without medication. And just knowing your numbers is half the battle, says Dan Jones, M.D., president of the AHA. But that doesn't mean fighting high blood pressure is a cinch. Here are the stories of three women whose high blood pressure took them by surprise. Think about them the next time that cuff goes around your arm. Erin O'Connell Peiffer, 45 . While Peiffer exper­ienced hypertension during all three of her pregnancies, her blood pressure always returned to normal after each birth. Later, as she juggled working and caring for her young children, the thin, nonsmoking telecommunications executive who lives outside of Baltimore, Maryland, considered herself healthy (except for her high cholesterol). Then one day about seven years ago, she couldn't stop coughing during a water aerobics class. A month later, she was shocked to find out that she had congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema, or swelling of the lungs. High blood pressure was behind the problems. Following open-heart surgery to repair a 99 percent blockage in her left main coronary artery, Peiffer was terminated from her job because of her illness and went on disability. She hasn't worked in seven years because of chronic chest pain and other conditions. Learn some tricks to lower your blood pressure . Looking back, she remembers that in her 20s, her blood pressure was elevated when she was first found to have high cholesterol. ""They said it was white-coat hypertension [the idea that just being in a medical office can drive blood pressure up],"" Peiffer says. ""No one said, 'Hey, you need to exercise,' or anything."" So she didn't. Now she's on two blood pressure medications -- an ACE inhibitor that lowers levels of blood vessel-tightening chemicals and a beta-blocker that slows heart rate -- and her pressure's normal. Daily two-mile walks help, too. ""Get a baseline number, and keep an eye on it,"" she says. ""Take care of yourself first so you can be there to take care of your children."" Carolyn J. Daniels, 43 . On the way to a regular medical checkup last year, Daniels, an Atlanta, Georgia-area marketing director, was in good spirits. Her weight was under control at 145 pounds, and she thought she was healthy. Her blood pressure had been slightly elevated at past checkups, but she had never been told to do anything about it. This time was different. Her reading was 160 over 100, and she remembers her doctor saying, ""You're like a firecracker -- ready to pop."" Daniels was petrified: ""I thought I was going to die."" Her doctor put her on blood pressure medication immediately. Read which 10 foods are best for your heart . Now she takes a beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker, which also relaxes blood vessels. To stay healthy, she and her husband walk every other evening after dinner. The hardest part? Giving up the fried foods she loves. ""Every now and then, I'll cheat and have some fried chicken over at my sister's house,"" she confesses. But she's learned to broil, bake, and stir-fry tomatoes, collards, cabbage, and other vegetables. Daniels is among the 43 percent of African-American women who have hypertension. The risk for African-Americans is much higher than for Asians or whites, although it's not clear why. Daniels thinks there is only one way to cope: ""I felt fine, but that' s not good enough. It's especially important for African-American women to go to a doctor routinely. That's the only way you're going to know you have it."" Antoinette Trammell, 50 . Even though her mother had hypertension, Trammell, a hospital human resources specialist in Richmond, Virginia, didn't think about her family medical history 20 years ago when she started having headaches and blurred vision -- two of the very rare symptoms of high blood pressure. Then one of the hospital's nurse managers took Trammell's blood pressure and sent her straight to a cardiologist. Read who is at risk of high blood pressure . Her blood pressure is now under control thanks to an ACE inhibitor, a diuretic, and some overdue diet changes. She's trying to lose weight -- hoping to drop 30 pounds -- and the self-professed saltaholic has cut way back on her favorite foods. ""Potato chips, fries, all those good things,"" Trammell says. ""I could literally put salt in my hand and eat it."" Too much salt makes many people retain water, which increases blood volume and puts more pressure on arteries. The diuretic also helps break that cycle. Why wasn't Trammell more active in controlling her risks at a younger age? Probably because she grew up on a farm, and her parents rarely saw a doctor. Her mother died at age 80 in 2002 after a stroke and heart attack. ""Now I make sure to have my blood pressure checked once a week,"" Trammell says. ""This isn't a condition that I can just take care of when I have the time."" Try a FREE TRIAL issue of Health - CLICK HERE!

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Teratomas of the brain are very rare and comprise less than 1 per cent of all brain tumors. Teratomas have been the subject of intense fascination among scientists because of their sometimes strange qualities -- some have been reported to contain hair, teeth, bone and, very rarely, more complex organs such as eyeballs. Thoughts about the origin of these tumors have attracted much debate. CNN spoke with Dr. Thomas L. Ellis, senior neurosurgeon at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, in North Carolina, United States, about the tumors sometimes known as ""the monsters"". He explained some quick facts: . • ""Teratoma"" comes from the Greek word ""teraton,"" meaning ""monster"". • Teratomas are seen most commonly in children and young adults. • Teratomas are made up of tissue from all three germ layers -- mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm -- that occur during the formation of an embryo. • Although teratomas can occur during embryonic development, most arise much later in life. • Teratomas occur most often in the midline of the brain, therefore often obstructing and putting pressure on critical areas of the brain. This can lead to loss of basic functions, but this loss can be temporary -- until the tumor is removed or reduced in size. • Teratomas are commonly very solid and rubbery making them resistant to dissection with standard instruments.","Teratomas of the brain are very rare tumors -- less than 1% of all brain tumors .

"(CNN)  -- An outbreak of the deadly ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo has prompted neighboring Angola to close its border with that country, Angola's state news agency reported Tuesday. Angolan Health Minister Jose Van-Dunem announced the ""suspension of migratory movements"" at the country's north-eastern border Sunday, the Angop news agency reported. The World Health Organization reports 41 suspected cases of the deadly fever in Congo since November 27. Thirteen people have died, and 183 cases are under observation. Two people are being held in quarantine. The handling of dead monkeys may be the source of the outbreak, the WHO suspects, according to Angop. Diosdado Nsue-Micawg, the WHO representative in the Angolan capital of Luanda, said the health agency does not know the source of the virus, but fears that hunters and women who visit the forest might have been in contact with infected monkeys. The outbreak is centered in the western Kassi province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been reporting intermittent cases of the disease since 1976, according to Angop.","Democratic Republic of Congo has reported intermittent cases of ebola since 1976 .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A British woman who suffers from multiple sclerosis has lost her appeal to clarify Britain's laws on assisted suicide, a charity working with the woman said Thursday. Debbie Purdy and husband Omar Puente pictured outside the High Court in October 2008. But the woman did get a strong hint that anyone who helped her travel to a country where assisted suicide is legal would not be prosecuted. Debbie Purdy, 45, had asked the Court of Appeal to clarify Britain's laws on assisted suicide -- an option she has said she wants if her pain one day becomes unbearable. Under the current laws, Purdy says, it is not clear at which point her husband would be breaking the law if he helped her to travel to an assisted suicide clinic. Purdy was appealing an October ruling by the High Court, which also refused to clarify the laws. Purdy suffers from primary progressive multiple sclerosis, in which symptoms become progressively worse over time. She has said she wants the option to travel abroad to have an assisted death should her condition deteriorate. Under Britain's current law, Purdy's husband, Omar Puente, could face 14 years in prison if he accompanies her to a country, such as Switzerland, where assisted suicide is legal. Purdy had asked the High Court judges to tell her at what point Puente would be subject to prosecution -- whether it would include helping her into a car, sitting with her on the plane to the clinic, or helping her with her bags. In its judgment Thursday, the appeal court did imply Puente would be safe from prosecution. The judges referred to the earlier case of Dan James, a 23-year-old British rugby player who died in an assisted suicide last year. James had been paralyzed from the neck down in a rugby accident. James' parents, Mark and Julie James, flew with their son to an assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland. They faced questions on their return to Britain but were not prosecuted. The court said the decision not to prosecute the Jameses ""is illustrative not only of the care with which the issue in these cases would be approached, but also an extremely helpful example of the kind of broad circumstances in which ... the ultimate decision would be that a prosecution should not be mounted,"" according to an excerpt released by Dignity in Dying, the charity that worked on Purdy's case. ""If the prosecution amounts to an abuse of process, the court will dismiss it,"" the court said in its judgment. Purdy said that wording made her feel like she had won her argument, even though she lost the appeal. ""I am very grateful for, and respect the ruling of the appeal court,"" she said in a statement. ""They have done everything they can do to clarify that, given the Dan James judgment, Omar would be unlikely to be prosecuted if he were to accompany me abroad for an assisted death, and we are therefore one step closer to the clarification I need."" Dignity in Dying has said it is important for the British government to distinguish between people who maliciously encourage suicide and those who accompany a loved one abroad to die. Under current law, the 1961 Suicide Act, assisting a suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment. Anyone who aids, abets, counsels or procures the suicide of another, or an attempt by another to commit suicide, is liable. Dignity in Dying has said it ultimately wants British law changed to allow the terminally ill the choice of assisted death. To date, no one who has accompanied a loved one to the Swiss clinic Dignitas has been prosecuted, but they have been questioned by police and threatened with prosecution, according to Dignity in Dying. ""The courts have done all they can,"" said Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying. ""They make quite clear that only Parliament has the authority to change the law. If there's no public interest in prosecuting, there must be a public interest in updating the law to remove doubt.""","UK court rejects appeal calling for clarification of laws on assisted suicide .

"(CNN) -- Inspectors found mildew on a ceiling and other problems last year at a peanut butter producing plant in Georgia that has been linked to a salmonella outbreak, according to reports released Monday by the state Department of Agriculture. A salmonella outbreak linked to a peanut butter plant has sickened nearly 500 people, the CDC says. But the owner of the Blakely, Georgia, plant -- Virginia-based Peanut Corp. of America -- described the problems as ""relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" PCA this month stopped production at the Blakely plant and launched a nationwide recall of peanut butter and peanut paste made there after July 1, 2008. The New York Times reported Monday that Georgia agriculture inspection reports from 2006 and 2007 depicted a series of sanitation lapses in the Blakely plant. Citing an inspection report from August 23, 2007, the Times noted at least three incidences in which ""food-contact surfaces"" were ""not properly cleaned and sanitized."" In an apparent response to the Times article, PCA released a statement saying, ""When the observations were noted during inspections by the Georgia Department of Agriculture, corrective action was taken immediately where possible and subsequently when immediate action was not possible."" The statement, which PCA sent to CNN accompanied by a copy of a state inspection report from last October, said ""the most recent inspection observations by the state [the October inspection report] were relatively minor and for the most part corrected on site."" In the October 23, 2008 report, an inspector said she found ""mildew and possibly some static dust on ceiling of butter storage room."" The report did not specify the amount of mildew. The report continued with the notation, ""Correct By: 11/05/2008,"" but the report did not indicate whether any action was taken or whether a follow-up inspection occurred. Moisture was blamed for an unrelated salmonella outbreak two years ago. That outbreak was traced to a different Georgia peanut processing plant. A June 2008 inspection of PCA's Blakely plant found violations including dust buildup on a fan in the butter room, and ""possible metal flakes from metal scrubber which is used to clean outside of equipment,"" according to an inspection report. The report did not indicate where the flakes were found. PCA has said that the peanut butter and peanut paste made at the Blakely plant were sold in bulk to manufacturers, and that the recall does not involve any peanut butter jars sold directly to consumers. However, more than 125 products that include peanut butter or peanut paste, including Trader Joe's celery with peanut butter packs and nutrition bars from Clif Bar, NutriSystem and Luna, have been recalled in connection with the PCA's recall. See a list of recalled products . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has counted nearly 500 cases of salmonella illnesses in 43 states from the most recent outbreak, and says the bacterial infection might have contributed to seven deaths. The American Peanut Council has a list of peanut products that are not affected by the recall.","Inspectors: Plant linked to salmonella outbreak had mildew, other problems last year .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Would you still watch your favorite television program if you had to cycle for an hour before you could view it? A computer-generated image of Club Watt, Rotterdam's human-powered club. Couch potatoes will be horrified, but fresh advances in human-powered technology -- where users power appliances through their own motion -- could one day see a 'workout-to-watch' scenario become reality. Human power is rapidly gaining in popularity worldwide as businesses seek 'greener' methods of operating. The profile of the technology is set to receive a further boost this month when a human-powered gym opens in Portland, Oregon, and again in September when the human-powered 'sustainable dance club', Club Watt, opens its doors in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Human power is already being used to run the 'California Fitness' gym in Hong Kong, and to power the recently opened 'Club Surya' in London. iReport.com: Can you predict what the future will be like? Beyond all of this, further concepts have been developed for human-powered 'river gyms' for the waterways of New York. But, how does your sweat and strain turn into power for lights, music and machines? The general concept is known as energy harvesting, which simply refers to the gathering of energy from one source and applying it to power an object. Italian inventor Lucien Gambarota, who designed California Fitness's method of storing energy and using it to power lights and music in the gym, told CNN the concept is straightforward. ""One of the oldest types of energy used by people is muscular energy -- so this is nothing new."" Gambarota said machines such as exercycles created a load, used as a counter-force by means of a resistor. ""I disconnected the resistor and started storing the energy into a battery... that is then used as power. It was a way to show there can be very simple solutions. It doesn't always have to be high-tech,"" he said. Portland's 'green' gym will have spinning bikes connected to wind-generator motors. The users should generate enough electricity to power the gym's music system or run personal DVD players on the machines, the gym's manager Adam Boesel predicts. While harnessing the energy from people working out at a gym seems logical, utilising the movement of clubbers at dance clubs is a little more complex. Two methods have developed -- the first of which is piezoelectricity, used by Club Surya, where crystals in blocks under the dance-floor rub together with the assistance of dancers on the floor. This generates an electrical charge which is then fed into batteries. A second method using wheels to generate energy under a slightly moving floor will be used at the soon-to-be-opened Club Watt. This model involves coils and magnets which move under the dance-floor to create a charge. Vera Verkooijen, spokeswoman for Sustainable Dance Club, the company which is behind the floor for Club Watt and produces smaller, portable floors, said the human power would be enough to power about 30 percent of the club's requirements. Verkooijen admitted the first floors were not very efficient, and said the designers were already working on new models to improve the amount of energy captured. ""This is just the first version. We are willing to take it further,"" she said. At Club Surya the power shortfall is made up by solar panels and a wind turbine. Putting the current buzz aside, how far could this human-powered technology develop? And how widely can it be applied? Verkooijen told CNN she already had some indications of where the technology was heading. ""We receive a lot of requests from other companies for people who want to use the floors. We get many of these for bus and train stations -- places where there are lots of people."" Lights and display boards at those spaces could be powered applying the same concept as that being used in Club Watt, she said. Evert Raaijen, technical director of energy conversion company Exendis, felt the technology could have a number of different applications. From pedal-powered computers on bicycles, to self-powered soldiers in militaries, Raaijen predicted human power would be developed widely in coming years. ""I think it's a science field which will be one of the future,"" he said. Gambarota believed there were ways human power could be brought into practical use in the home. He had generated an idea of using human-powered batteries for television or portable video game consoles. ""With so many kids not exercising enough, a battery could be created for these devices so they had to create the energy to use them. The same could be done for television sets. ""We could get the situation where people have to cycle so they can use it,"" Gambarota said. Despite these potential developments, human-power is attracting its share of criticism. Although he shows enthusiasm for the battery project, Gambarota, who now spends much of his time developing micro wind turbines, is sceptical about the future of human-power on a mass-scale. He raises doubts about the efficiency of human power and questioned its economic viability. The average amount of power one person could produce going about normal activities on any given day was about one kilowatt-hour (kWh), which only amounted to about € 0.10 worth of electricity, Gambarota said. ""It's a very good marketing tool for businesses, but in terms of economics it does not make sense at all."" The main reason it was being used was because companies wanted to ""look green, taste green and smell green"", he said. Raaijen, who was consulted on the Sustainable Dance Floor project, agreed that opting for human-powered technology at present was not a financially-based decision. ""The project (dance floor) in itself doesn't save a lot of energy. It's more of a statement than anything."" Observing recent trends, the sustained drive for 'green energy' should continue to push human-powered technology forward, and despite the limitations to development, human-powered gyms, dance clubs, and maybe even video game consoles are likely to feature strongly in our immediate future.","A Hong Kong gym and London dance club are part powered by human power .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Hong Kong authorities Sunday announced that two recalled candy products made by British confectioner Cadbury had high levels of melamine. The industrial chemical has recently been found in Chinese-made milk products that have sickened nearly 53,000 children in China, killing four. Countries around the world have since banned the import of Chinese products containing milk, or have withdrawn products that contain milk from China -- such as candy -- amid worries they contain melamine. Last week, Cadbury recalled all of its Chinese-made candy products after preliminary tests showed they contained trace amounts of melamine. Cadbury took the action because ""no level of melamine is appropriate,"" spokesman Tony Bilsborough told CNN on Sunday. He could not comment on the latest test results. The company stresses that its products manufactured at its Beijing plant are only exported to Taiwan and Hong Kong, with one product -- Cadbury Eclair -- sent to Australia, Nauru and Christmas Island. Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety tested 104 samples of products made by a variety of manufacturers, including Cadbury, Nestle, and some U.S. and Chinese companies. Only two of the samples showed unsatisfactory levels of melamine -- Cadbury Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate (bulk pack 5kg) and Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate (bulk pack 5kg). The sample of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Hazelnut Chocolate contained melamine levels of 65 ppm (parts per million) which is more than 25 times the acceptable level of 2.5 ppm, according to Hong Kong's government. According to the center, a child weighing 22 pounds (10kg) would have to eat more than 10 small pieces of the hazelnut chocolate to surpass the tolerable daily intake. An average adult weighing 132 pounds (60kg) would have to eat more than 112 small pieces to surpass the level. The melamine levels in the samples of Dairy Milk Cookies Chocolate were 6.9 ppm -- more than twice as high as the legal limit of melamine. Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety said it will continue to test dairy products and other products with dairy ingredients. Test results on other products -- including milk powder, soya drinks, yogurt, butter, baby food and frozen confections -- would be released on Monday, it said. Chinese authorities have implicated 22 Chinese dairy companies in the tainted milk scandal. Investigators suspect people watered down milk in an attempt to sell more of it, and added melamine in order to fool quality checks, Chinese authorities have said. The toxic chemical is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor-quality milk. On Saturday China announced that a test of 607 batches of liquid milk from 27 cities found the samples to be melamine-free, state-run media said. The tests were the sixth Chinese officials have carried out since melamine was discovered in powdered infant formula last month. Chinese authorities have promised to subsidize farmers hit by the shrinking demand for milk, the news agency Xinhua said. Among them is the northern Hebei province, which has earmarked 316 million yuan ($46.1 million) for subsidies. That translates to giving a farmer 200 yuan ($29) per cow, Xinhua said. Melamine is used to bolster apparent protein levels in diluted or poor-quality milk. Chinese authorities have arrested 40 people in connection with the scandal, including two brothers who could face the death penalty if convicted. Authorities have implicated 22 Chinese dairy companies in the scandal.","Hong Kong authorities say two Cadbury products have high levels of melamine .

"Having a CT scan of the heart to check for heart disease? You may want to ask how your hospital plans to conduct the test. A new study suggests that people who get the common heart test can get a dramatic range of radiation exposures. When cardiac CT angiography is used appropriately, the benefits far outweigh the risk of the radiation, experts say. In the study of 1,965 patients undergoing the CT scans (also known as cardiac CT angiography), the median exposure was roughly equivalent to 600 chest X-rays, or about 12 milliSievert (mSv) of radiation, according to the report in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Traditional angiography -- a technique in which a catheter is snaked though a blood vessel and dye is injected near the heart -- exposes patients to roughly half the dose of CT angiography, or about 5--8 mSv, says study author Jorg Hausleiter, M.D., of the University of Munich in Germany. It's also about the same amount of radiation as other standard cardiac screenings, such as the nuclear stress test. There was a wide range of exposures in the study depending on the medical center and the way the tests were performed. The median radiation dose ranged from 4.6 to 30 mSv. About 80 percent of the centers studied used techniques to reduce radiation, such as adjusting the CT scan to the patient's size (meaning smaller patients get less radiation) or precisely timing the radiation dose to a particular point in the heart rhythm (which shortens the duration of exposure). Health.com: How to help your heart for better health . Overall, the danger posed by radiation is very small, according to Hausleiter. Being exposed to 10 mSv increases an individual's cancer risk by 0.02 percent, he says. However, the greater the exposure to radiation, the greater the risk.  Watch Dr. Gupta talk about the cardiac CT scan » . Nearly all of the 50 sites in the international study, which included sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, were making at least some effort to limit excess radiation. Other medical centers may be doing even less to cut down on radiation during the test, says Andrew J. Einstein, M.D., Ph.D., of Columbia University Medical Center, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""Probably the group of centers which were studied in this paper are more sophisticated and more aware of radiation-reduction methods than your typical center that is performing cardiac CT angiography,"" he says. According to Einstein, many other sites may not be using radiation-reduction techniques at all. When cardiac CT angiography is being used appropriately -- meaning, for example, in people with chest pain suggesting blocked heart arteries, rather than as a screening test for people with no symptoms of heart disease -- the benefits far outweigh the risk of the radiation, according to Einstein and Hausleiter. However, cardiac CT scans are often marketed directly to patients interested in finding out how much plaque they have in their arteries, even though there's no evidence to show that this is an appropriate way to use the test, Hausleiter says. Health.com: 28 days, 28 ways to slash your risk of heart disease . Critics of cardiac CT angiography question whether its benefits warrant its current widespread use and the amount of radiation exposure. In fact, on Monday the American Heart Association issued an advisory warning that imaging tests, including CT scans, be used cautiously to minimize exposure to radiation. In the new study, Hausleiter and his colleagues looked at patients who underwent cardiac CT angiography at 21 university hospitals and 29 community hospitals between February and December 2007. They found some regional differences in radiation exposure; for example, the median dose was three times higher in South America and Latin America than in Canada and the United States. More than 70 percent of the centers in the study were using electrocardiographically controlled tube current modulation (ECTCM), which is currently the best-known strategy for reducing radiation dose. It involves timing the radiation beam to the diastole, when the heart is resting between beats. This is when the heart is the quietest, so it's easiest to get a good image of the organ. Health.com: Tricks to lower blood pressure . Another strategy involves using less energy (100 kV instead of the standard 120 kV), which is effective but useful only for patients who are not obese. Finally, sequential scans take a series of pictures of the heart at the same exact point in the cardiac cycle, which also reduces radiation dose. This approach, as well as ECTCM, can be used only in people with slow, steady heartbeats. Another problem, Einstein noted, is that doctors often don't know what a patient's heart rate will be until he or she is on the table being readied for the scan. But the fact that centers were able to use at least one radiation-reduction technique in most patients ""should serve as a wake-up call to cardiac CT laboratories that do not routinely use these methods,"" Einstein writes in his editorial. Health.com: I paid $450 to up my cancer risk . Patients who undergo cardiac CT angiography are within their rights to ask about what strategies, if any, are being used to reduce radiation dosage, he said. ""I would not recommend anyone to have this test done without discussing it with their doctor first. It's not something patients should be initiating on their own,"" he adds. Caution is warranted not only due to the radiation exposure, according to  Einstein, but also because the dye that must be injected into the veins to perform the test can cause kidney damage in some people. While a person's doctor would be able to judge if he or she would be harmed by the dye and thus shouldn't have the test, he said, ""there are some sites that would be willing to perform this test on anyone."" David J. Brenner, Ph.D., D.Sc., of Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research was not involved in the current study, but he coauthored a 2007 report warning that overuse of CT scans could contribute to excess cancer risks. He said that such CT scans are still controversial. New technology can decrease the radiation dose from cardiac CT scans, but as this study shows, ""It's very variable from institution to institution -- in part because there is no regulatory body making sure that there is some degree of quality control,"" says Brenner.

"(CNN) -- Ever caught a glimpse of the secretive Iberian lynx? Or heard the croaking bark of a Mediterranean monk seal? Arctic foxes are trapped and skinned for the pelts. If not, and you want to do so, you had better hurry because pollution and habitat degradation have pushed both species to the brink of extinction. According to a recent study by the Switzerland-based World Conservation Union (IUCN) human activity is threatening almost one-sixth of Europe's total land mammal population. Among marine mammals the situation is even more grave, with some 22 percent of total numbers being pushed towards annihilation. The IUCN's recently published European Mammal Assessment identified 17 European mammal species that are ""vulnerable,"" seven that are ""endangered,"" and six that are ""critically endangered."" The Mediterranean monk seal population, for example, has now dwindled to just 350-450 individuals. The outlook for the Iberian lynx is even worse, with only an estimated 150 still surviving, making it the most endangered cat species on earth. Other species on the critically endangered list include the Arctic fox, Bavarian pine vole, European mink and North Atlantic Right whale. ""This new assessment proves that many European mammals are declining at an alarming rate,"" said IUCN Director-General Julia Marton-Lefèvre, a position echoed by the EU's Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas. ""The results of the report highlight the challenge we currently face to halt the loss of Europe's biodiversity,"" said Dimas. ""It is clear that the full implementation of the Habitats Directive (adopted by the EU in 1992 to safeguard Europe's endangered wildlife) is of the utmost importance to protect Europe's native mammals."" Europe is home to a rich diversity of native mammal species ranging from the small such as shrews and voles, to the large such as wolves and brown bears. to the enormous -- in the case of the 70-ton North Atlantic Right Whale. Human activity, however, especially in the form of agriculture, deforestation, hunting and pollution, has reduced the numbers of these species, leaving many of them in danger of vanishing. The aforementioned Habitats Directive -- a corollary of the 1979 Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats -- introduced a range of measures aimed at protecting endangered species (including plants, birds and fish as well as mammals). That directive has certainly had an effect, with a number of mammals that previously seemed destined to disappear from Europe now enjoying something of a revival. The Alpine Ibex, for example, was almost hunted out in the 19th century, its population reduced to just a small group of survivors in Italy's Gran Paradiso National Park. Thanks to extensive conservation and protection efforts, however, the species is once again flourishing and has been downgraded to the ""least concern"" category on the IUCN's ""Red List."" It is the same story for the European bison, which was limited to just a few zoos before re-introduction programs across eastern Europe helped re-build the population to current levels of around 1,800. ""The fate of the European bison provides an example of the way in which a species may be brought to the brink of extinction in a very short time, and then saved only through great efforts,"" said Dr. Zbigniew Krasinski of Poland's Bialowieza National Park. ""The saving of the bison has been an undoubted success, although further action will continue to be essential."" Dr. Jean-Christophe Vie, Deputy Head of the IUCN's Species Program, agrees that significant progress has been made. ""In Europe we now have a network of protected areas, as well as strong conservation laws,"" he told CNN. ""It is possible for species to recover even when their numbers drop to extinction level. ""Both the Alpine Ibex and European bison are recovering well because of appropriate conservation measures. ""The European beaver is another example. It was persecuted almost to extinction but has now been re-introduced and is colonizing all over the continent."" While there are positive stories, however, the overall picture remains a disheartening one, as the European Mammal Assessment demonstrates. Commissioned by the European Commission and a year in the drafting, it is the first such overview of its kind and draws on the work of a Europe-wide group of scientists, zoologists and conservationists. Its findings provide an unequivocal picture of biodiversity loss and species decline. Habitat destruction, usually due to agricultural practices, is the key driver of that decline, although many other factors are involved, including pollution, disease and the introduction of invasive foreign species. The case of the European mink, one of the IUCN's six critically endangered European mammals, is an example of how different elements can combine to drive a particular species to the brink of destruction. Once found in great numbers across Europe from Spain to the Urals, the mink population has plummeted in recent years. While hunting has certainly contributed to this decline, the main causes have been habitat loss and competition from invasive foreign species, according to Vie. ""The mink is freshwater dependent,"" explains Vie. ""The more you damage its habitat by polluting rivers, or channeling them, or building dams, the more the population declines."" The introduction of the American mink into Europe for fur-rearing also proved disastrous, with some of those mink escaping from captivity, establishing their own colonies in the wild and setting up direct competition for food and resources with the native population. The result: an 80 percent decline in that population in the last decade alone (in 1993 the IUCN only classified it as ""vulnerable""). But experts say that species loss can be reversed. ""There is more and more perception across Europe that biodiversity conservation is crucially important,"" says Vie. ""And we are seeing good recoveries in some species. ""The picture in the mammal world is not nearly as bad as, say, among freshwater fish, where the number of threatened species is far, far higher."" At the same time, the latest figures remain a source of considerable concern. At a time when so many conservation initiatives and laws are already in operation, the population of many European mammal species is in apparent free fall. It is not simply the possibility of losing a particular species that worries experts, but also how the loss will affect the species' wider ecosystem . ""The food web is extremely complex,"" says Vie. ""If you lose one element that has a very specific role in that web, it has a knock-on effect and the whole system is threatened. ""It is very worrying. Some people think it is a disaster if a famous painting is lost in a fire, but that is just the work of a few weeks or months. These species and systems are the product of millions of years of evolution. ""I am biased, of course, but I think it would be an absolute tragedy if we lost these native species.""

"(CNN) -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday. Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery. The 22-hour face surgery was completed two weeks ago by a team of eight surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient had severe deformity in the middle of her face and was missing her right eye and upper jaw, the Cleveland Clinic doctors said. She could not taste or smell, and she had trouble speaking. Dr. Maria Siemionow, the head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital, said many people are ""hiding from society because they're afraid to walk to the grocery stores; they're afraid to go to streets because they're called names and humiliated."" ""Our patient was called names, and our patient was humiliated,"" she said. ""We very much hope for this special group of patients, there is hope, and one day they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things which we take for granted."" The patient is doing well, the doctors said.  Interactive: More details of the surgery » . Details about the recipient, including her name and age, were withheld at her request. In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted. The forehead and chin were left intact. In this transplant, tissue from the donor's face was shaped and fitted into position. Multiple layers of tissue, bone, muscles and blood vessels, nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected.  Watch an explanation about face transplants » . ""Our hope is she should be able to smile again,"" said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. With physical therapy, surgeons hope the patient will regain her ability to smell and blink and will have other facial functions. Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, ""the donor never looks like the recipient. The recipient never looks like the donor."" Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004. She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved. The doctors' approach from the beginning was to consider ""only patients who are the most disfigured"" and had ""exhausted all existing procedures,"" Siemionow said. ""This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient,"" she said.  Watch Dr. Siemionow in the news conference. » . Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics, said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery. ""This patient had very robust decision-making capacity,"" he said. Like with all transplants, there is a risk that the recipient's body could reject the graft. The doctors say they haven't seen any such signs. The transplant recipient has to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of his or her life to prevent rejection of the donated tissue. In the past three years, facial transplants have been completed in France and China, but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions. Read about the first facial transplant . Some candidates for a face transplant are survivors of trauma, such as burn or accident victims, who have exhausted all other reconstructive possibilities. The recipient in France, Isabelle Dinoire, had been mauled by a dog, and the Chinese man, Li Guoxing, was attacked by a bear. Both received major facial disfigurements. In 2007, a French team performed the third partial facial transplant on a man who was disfigured by a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. Watch a 2006 report about China's first face transplant . Guo Shuzhong, the face transplant doctor who handled Li's case, confirmed to CNN that he died in July of unknown causes. Li last visited the hospital in summer 2007, and he stayed in his hometown in Yunnan province. The doctor told CNN that Li had a checkup in a small hospital in his hometown three weeks before his death but that no health problems had been found. Watch an ITN report about the Li's case . The facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks. Those procedures have been ""under an ethical cloud,"" said David Young, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California, San Francisco. The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said. Criticism of facial transplants . Critics such as Peter A. Clark, director of the Institute of Catholic Bioethics at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said a facial transplant introduces unnecessary risks for a procedure that is not a matter of life and death. ""With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant,"" Clark said. ""Even with a kidney or liver [transplant], you have to be put on immunosuppressants with serious side effects."" Bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's Medical Ethics Department, said Wednesday on CNN's ""American Morning"" that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant, which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it, but was gradually convinced. People with major facial disfigurements ""don't come out and basically stay at home and have a huge suicide rate,"" Caplan said. ""They're really up against it."" At the news conference Wednesday, Kodish said the transplant had ""abundant moral justification"": the face as a personal embodiment as self. He added that people with disfigurements are often isolated and suffer tremendously and that this case was ""not cosmetic surgery in any sense."" Patient's reaction . Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself. ""At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face,"" Siemionow said. ""She was happy when she could go over her face"" and could feel that ""she has a nose, she has jaws and has a full face."" After the surgery, the patient was heavily sedated from being on the breathing machine. As she was slowly awakening, medical staff members asked her how she was feeling and whether she was comfortable. ""She gave a thumbs up, first indication she was comfortable,"" said Dr. Chad Gordon, a fellow at the clinic's department of plastic surgery. ""She has been speaking to us very slightly. Most of communication has been through writing."" Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration. CNN's Miriam Falco and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","Reconstructive surgeon Dr. Maria Siemionow led face transplant team .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When HIV-positive Winnie Sseruma was invited to speak on the subject at the United Nations in New York last June, she never expected that her condition would prevent her from obtaining a visa. HIV positive Winnie Sseruma was repeatedly questioned before being allowed into the United States. Winnie Sseruma has been  living with the disease for over 20 years. Preparing for her trip, UK-based Winnie discovered that the United States was one of 70 countries worldwide that either banned or restricted inbound travel for people with HIV. ""I was told I needed to come to the U.S. embassy for an interview and bring a doctor's letter stating I was fit to travel,"" Sseruma, HIV coordinator for charity Christian Aid, told CNN. ""At first, the embassy told me that the first available appointment for my interview would be at a date past the U.N. High-level Meeting I was meant to attend."" Only when the U.N. intervened on Sseruma's behalf was she granted an earlier interview date. Sseruma was relieved when she finally received her visa on time. But the hurdles were far from over. At the airport in New York, Sseruma was detained twice for further questioning. ""It was so humiliating,"" Sseruma said. ""The immigration officers were asking me very personal questions about my health."" A month after Sseruma's ordeal, the U.S. Senate passed the re-authorization of President Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), including an amendment to the ban on travel and immigration for HIV-positive non-citizens. But the United States travel ban still remains in effect, and will continue to be the law until the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) modifies its regulations. Fifty-eight Members of Congress have sent a letter to the HHS, urging them to take action. Russia also places restrictions on travelers with HIV. Affected visitors are not permitted to stay in the country for more than three months. Anyone applying for a visa for long-term stay must present a certificate stating that they are HIV negative. The Russian embassy's spokesperson in London told CNN no changes to the ban were currently being considered and declined to comment further. Crusading against these bans is ""Ctrl.Alt.Shift,"" a UK-based organization that attempts to engage youth to combat global and social injustices. The organization argues that there is no public health rationale for ""restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of HIV status."" Are these laws outmoded? What do you think? Tell us in the Sound Off below. The fight against stigmas associated with HIV and AIDS has been widely adopted by the organization's young members. Many are joining Ctrl.Alt.Shift's protests across London. Last week, following two protests at the embassies of Saudi Arabia and South Korea -- both countries ban HIV positive travelers from entering their borders -- the organization launched its third protest in front of the Russian embassy in London. ""The level of proliferation of the HIV virus in countries that do not implement bans on HIV travelers is proof that these bans have no impact whatsoever, except for reinforcing the stigma,"" said Neil Boorman, Ctrl.Alt.Shift's project manager. Boorman told CNN that the bans and restrictions further the spread of the epidemic by driving the issue underground and force people to lie about their health on visa applications. Tinchy Strider, a 22-year-old British rap artist, was also present at the protest. ""I'm here because many young people are not aware of these issues, but if they knew these bans existed, they would want to do something about it,"" Tinchy explained. Eighteen-year-old Sian Anderson agrees. Anderson believes it is bad enough to live with HIV and that these regulations make life ""even harder."" ""Some people are completely not at fault, they might have gotten the virus through blood transfusion and Russia doesn't take that into consideration,"" Anderson said. ""Science has moved on from the days where HIV was an unknown virus. Now the world needs to move on too,"" Sseruma said.

"(CNN) -- The leading champion of democracy in Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, emerged from house arrest Wednesday to meet with political supporters, a diplomatic source told CNN. Activists display a portrait of detained democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. Military leaders in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, let Suu Kyi leave her house to meet with senior leaders of the National League for Democracy, the source said. The meeting comes after the U.S. State Department criticized Myanmar for arresting 10 democracy activists. ""The United States condemns the regime's decision to press criminal charges against ten Burmese pro-democracy activists ... for the peaceful expression of their political beliefs,"" the department said in a statement Tuesday. The department noted that the 10 were charged with crimes that can carry lengthy sentences.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For more than two decades, artist Robert Wyland -- simply known as Wyland -- has wowed people with his giant whale murals that cover the walls of city parking decks, high-rises, convention centers and hotels around the world. Arist Wyland in front of his 50th Whaling Wall in Atlanta, Georgia. They are an expression of his love of the sea and all its inhabitants, he says. Wyland, a conservation advocate, believes art can change the way people, kids especially, look at the ocean. ""Art can play a role in the 21st century for conservation of clean water and healthy oceans,"" he says. ""There are things we can do everyday to protect water and conserve it."" Wyland is taking his campaign for clean water across the nation. Wyland and his non-profit Wyland Foundation will visit kids at zoos, aquariums and schools showing them how they can help conserve water.  Watch Wyland paint a whale shark » . ""If we are going to keep the oceans clean we need to think about what we are doing here on land. We need to protect the rivers, the lakes, the ponds, the streams, the estuaries -- it's all connected. Every drop of water on the planet is connected,"" Wyland explained. Along with mural painting with children, Wyland's Clean Water Challenge tour includes a mobile learning truck where participants can learn about water quality. He hopes to encourage everyone to reduce water waste by 10 million gallons or more over the next year. Wyland and his team kicked off their campaign at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta on October 7. Stops along the East and West coasts as well Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; and Phoenix, Arizona, are planned over the next month. At the Georgia Aquarium, Wyland was surround by children who joined him in painting a mural that will hang inside the aquarium. ""I got to paint a whale shark with kids. That was fun,"" he said. ""We have some great artists here in Georgia."" ""Looking fantastic, everyone. Keep painting!"" Wyland shouted enthusiastically. Roxie Stricker, 8, from Atlanta, Georgia, asked Wyland if she could paint a baby right whale tail right next to his adult right whale tail. ""What a great idea,"" Wyland responded. Wyland says that when children paint their favorite animals of the sea, they become more aware and sensitive to those animals' needs. And it's this awareness that can make a difference. ""I learned that we should start saving water and stop throwing trash in it,"" said Stricker. ""I believe that this art is going to make a difference and these kids are going to change the world,"" Wyland said. ""Every drop counts."" Growing up in Detroit, Michigan, Wyland, 51, was surrounded by lakes but it was the ocean that captured his imagination. ""I was inspired by Jacques Cousteau,"" Wyland says. ""He was my hero."" At 14, he traveled west to visit his aunt in Southern California. ""I jumped into the ocean and I immersed myself in the Pacific for the first time. And as I came up two gray whales were migrating along the coast and spouted right in front of me and that changed my life,"" he says. Those two whales became the subject for his first Whaling Wall in 1981 in Laguna Beach, California. Over the past 26 years he has painted 95 Whaling Walls.  See some of Wyland's amazing Whaling Walls » . He collects no fee for his murals. Each is a gift to its city. In 1993, he entered the Guinness Book of World Records for painting the largest mural in the world. Wyland's ""Planet Ocean"" mural wraps around the Long Beach Convention Center, Long Beach, California. The mural, depicting a variety of sea life, is 1,280 feet in diameter and 185 feet high. He will reach his goal of 100 murals in the summer of 2008 in Beijing, China. Wyland, along with student artists, will paint an epic mural that will span nearly 3 miles. The Beijing Olympics will be his inspiration. He's been selected as the official artist for the U.S. Olympic team. Wyland won't be taking any breaks after he completes his 100th Whaling Wall.

"(CNN) -- Pakistani civilians were given a brief window on Friday to flee the ongoing fighting between government forces and Taliban militants in the country's north, according to military officials. Pakistani civilians pack a bus leaving Mingora, the capital of the troubled Swat Valley. The Pakistan army is trying to push the Taliban away from regions within the troubled Swat Valley. A curfew was relaxed until 2 p.m. local time Friday in Kabal, Kanju and Mingora -- in the Swat Valley -- and in Malakand Agency, which is a separate district. The government provided an estimated 150 vehicles to evacuate people, as private cars are not allowed to enter Mingora. The Taliban have been concentrating forces there -- digging trenches, laying mines, taking positions on rooftops, according to strategic expert Reva Bhalla of Stratfor, a firm that describes itself as a global intelligence company. ""The Taliban are concentrating forces in Mingora -- digging trenches, laying mines, taking positions on rooftops,"" said Bhalla. ""It is not clear if the Pakistani military is trained and even equipped to go into a situation like that,"" she said, adding that even the United States military ""would have to think twice"" about such an offensive. She estimates there are 5,000 Taliban fighters in the area. ""The question is: Are they going to try to stand and fight, or try to regroup?"" she asked. With a government offensive against the Taliban nearly three weeks old, a spokesman for Pakistan's army said the military intends to drive the Taliban out of the contested area. ""The whole resolve of the government and the military is to once and for all finish the Taliban from the Valley of Swat,"" Pakistani military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN's Reza Sayah. The Pakistani military is trying to push the Taliban away from the heavily forested and mountainous regions of the Swat district toward the south, so the army can encircle the militants, Bhalla added. According to the chief minister of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, some 1.5 million people have been displaced by 10 months of fighting between the military and Taliban militants along its border with Afghanistan. The number of people at the Yar Hussain displaced-persons camp in Swabi district is expected to reach 2 million, Amir Haider Hoti said. The military announced earlier this week the number was 1.3 million. The huge refugee camps that the conflict is creating could be ""the perfect recruiting grounds for the Taliban to prey on,"" Bhalla said. Meanwhile, the United Nations' top official on refugees told CNN Thursday the world must launch a ""massive international effort"" to care for the refugees, or it will be ""absolutely impossible"" to provide for them. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, in a speech to parliament Thursday, called the refugee crisis a massive and unprecedented predicament. ""They are our own people and their children are my children,"" Gilani said.","Curfew relaxed from 6 a.m. until 2 p.m. local time in Swat Valley, Malakand .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN)  -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Lebanon on Sunday to pledge U.S. support for the country and its push for free elections. Lebanon President Michel Sleiman greets U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday. ""The people of Lebanon must be able to choose their own representatives in open and fair elections, without the specter of violence or intimidation, and free of outside interference,"" Clinton said during an unannounced visit to Beirut. It was Clinton's first time visiting the country since taking office. Lebanon is preparing for legislative elections in June that analysts say could bring the militant group, Hezbollah, to power. The Obama administration backs the unity government of Sleiman, while Syria is allied with Hezbollah. ""Both of us are committed to supporting President (Michel) Sleiman's efforts to build a peaceful, prosperous, sovereign and democratic Lebanon."" Clinton is expected to meet with Sleiman and lay a wreath at the tomb of former Lebanon Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was killed in a bomb attack in 2005. Many Lebanese, as well as the United States, accused Syria of orchestrating the assassination of Hariri, an outspoken opponent of Syria. Damascus denied responsibility. But massive popular protests after Hariri's death led to the pullout of thousands of troops that Syria maintained in Lebanon from the 1970s. A senior state department official said Clinton's visit is intended to reassure Lebanon that the United States will not forgo its support of the country as it opens dialogues with Syria and Iran. ""Beyond the election, we will continue to support the voices of moderation in Lebanon, and the responsible institutions of the Lebanese state they are working hard to build,"" Clinton said.

"(CNN) -- The surgeon who performed heart surgery Wednesday on former first lady Barbara Bush said Thursday that she is recovering well from the 2 1/2-hour surgery in which her aortic valve was replaced with a pig valve. Former first lady Barbara Bush had heart surgery Wednesday in Houston, Texas. ""From our perspective, this was a very routine procedure, and we expect her to make an excellent recovery,"" Dr. Gerald Lawrie told reporters at Methodist DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center in Houston. Bush had experienced ""severe narrowing of the main valve that lets the blood come out of the heart into the circulation,"" Lawrie said. ""This valve, instead of being a soft, flexible structure that opens and closes, breaks down,"" he said, adding that calcium deposits cause it to stiffen, which can result in fluid in the lungs and progressive deterioration. He said an echocardiogram showed her condition was ""extremely severe."" Typical symptoms of problems with an aortic valve include shortness of breath, fatigue, weakness and swelling, he said. Though his patient is 83, ""she's a very fit lady,"" which helped make the operation a ""relatively straightforward"" procedure,"" he said. Diagnosed with the condition less than a week before the surgery, Bush entered the operating room at 7 a.m. and, after an hour of preparation during which lines were attached to her and anesthesia was administered, the main work began, Lawrie said. In all, she was on a heart-lung machine for 55 minutes; the implantation of the valve took 45 minutes, he said. She required no blood transfusion. Bush was back in the intensive care unit by 10:45 a.m., where she awoke ""quicker than most"" patients of her age, he said. He described her as ""very lucid."" ""She recognized all of us immediately and actually started tearing us up with some humorous comments just as soon as we took that tube out."" He predicted she would remain in the ICU until Friday or Saturday, and then be transferred to a standard hospital floor for another five to seven days. But already, he said, she is ""walking around the room a little bit."" Bush's husband of 64 years, former President George H. W. Bush, visited her shortly after the operation. ""I've been a nervous wreck about it,"" said the former president, who said he had received telephone calls of support from President Obama and all the other surviving former presidents. ""I think there is a lot of interest because of who she is,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""She looks well. I just came from her room and she's doing well. I keep saying, 'You look great.' [She says] 'Don't tell me that.' But you know, she does ... she looks well to me -- and beautiful."" Bush added, ""She's in command. She's in control of our whole family."" Asked to describe what occurred between the two when he saw her, he said, ""I don't remember any words. I'm not the anecdotal one in the family. It was just a reunion of two people who love each other."" Afterward, the former president turned to a hospital administrator and said, ""I'm sorry I get emotional, but I can't help it."" The Bush family matriarch is the mother of former President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.","Surgeon: ""We expect her to make an excellent recovery""

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian E. Zelizer says it's vital that new media provide support for journalism that strives for objectivity. (CNN) -- Last week, Sen. John Kerry convened a discussion of the troubled state of journalism in America by way of a hearing by the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet. In Kerry's home state of Massachusetts, the Boston Globe is barely surviving. Several major metro papers have closed down, and there are indications that many more could soon follow. Experts have been warning in recent months that much of the newspaper industry may not survive. While the end of the metro newspaper would constitute a huge blow to journalism and the political system, realistically there might be nothing that we can do. The popularity of news on the Web and the potential of mobile devices such as the Kindle makes it difficult to see how we can sustain news in print -- unless electronic delivery can produce enough revenue to support the cost of newspaper staffs. Sometimes technological innovations and consumer preferences cause changes that are irreversible. The industry has seen other important shifts in the way that Americans receive their news, such as the advent of television news in the 1950s and 1960s. But the real issue is not whether we can save the newspapers, but how we can create the best Internet news system possible. As Kerry said in his opening statement: ""There also is the important question of whether online journalism will sustain the values of professional journalism, the way the newspaper industry has."" The first challenge we must address has to do with editorial control. A great danger of blog-based news is that information disseminates instantly with very little editorial supervision. On too many sites, information goes right from writer to reader. In the heyday of daily newspapers and network news, the news cycle was slow, lasting over the course of a day. There was a considerable amount of time for reporters, editors, and producers to check and verify information before it reached the public eye. Those days are gone. The result is too often that incorrect information circulates quickly. It will be crucial that television news networks continue to maintain Web sites which have the financial capital to support an editorial and production staff and that the newspapers which do survive find ways to expand their online operations, turning them into commercially lucrative ventures. Only they can finance the kind of infrastructure that good journalism requires. The second challenge we face has to do with polarization. Most studies of politics show that polarization has increased significantly throughout American politics. The media are both a product and cause of this political phenomenon. In Congress, there are fewer centrists in either party who are willing to compromise. Unfortunately, we have seen a similar phenomenon in the news business. During the 1990s, FOX News promoted a style of journalism framed within a clear conservative perspective. In recent years, liberals have mimicked these efforts. The nightly broadcasts of MSNBC have offered a counterpoint on the left, with television shows offering news from a liberal perspective. Bloggers on the Web follow this model as well. Not believing that the norm of objectivity is attainable, they prefer to present their political views openly and tend to be much more partisan in how they interpret world events. Moreover, readers and viewers tend to go for their information to sites and channels where they can see their own perspectives confirmed. It will be difficult to counteract these kinds of trends since they are so deep-rooted in American politics. But at a minimum, someone needs to fund reporters who keep covering the story and who at least strive to achieve as much objectivity as possible. There are many Web sites that do undertake this mission, but it will be essential that there is continued and expanded support for reporting as the metro newspapers slowly vanish. The final challenge has to do with fragmentation of news outlets. One of the great advantages of the Internet is that it has broken the monopoly the networks and major newspapers maintained on reporting the news. But the cost of fragmentation is that there are so many competing sites, some run by lone individuals and others by organizations, that Americans have fewer sources that can expose them to a diverse range of stories and that can make clear the interconnections between events that are taking place. When you read the newspaper, it is possible to get a rounded picture of the world by flipping through the international news, national news, arts, business, sports, and more. Now, many sites focus on narrow subject matter. How can we bring the pieces together? The multiplicity of sources on the Web forces the reader to be his own editor, and not many people are inclined to do all the work of scanning a variety of the relevant sites to get a full picture. All of these are challenges to journalism, but we should not lose hope in the potential of the Internet to provide high-quality news. The Internet offers many advantages. The speed can be an asset as readers learn of breaking stories more quickly. Editors have less power to stifle stories because of political or economic pressure. With so many more outlets, somehow the news will get out. Hyperlinked stories can offer readers easy connections to related information and even to original documents through which they can draw their own conclusions about what reporters are saying. The Internet offers room for many more perspectives than existed when just three network anchors and the local newspaper told Americans what was happening. The Internet can also combine written news with video and audio sources, as well as disseminate stories through social networking sites. Readers have the opportunities to interact with reporters and comment on stories. The death of the metro newspaper would be a huge loss. But rather than only focusing on lament, our best response would be to make the new medium of Internet news as strong as it can possibly be. We must address the major challenges by developing sites with the resources to edit, insisting on venues where the pursuit of objectivity remains a goal, and cultivating sites that help bring together different subject matter. If we do, the technological transition that we are living through can turn into a positive moment of advance for the media rather than a moment of decline. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Sen. John Kerry held hearing on future of newspapers and news .

"L'AQUILA, Italy (CNN) -- The youngest hadn't lived half a year. The oldest had lived nearly a hundred. A rescue worker Friday kisses the coffin of a child killed by this week's earthquake in central Italy. The official government list of victims from this week's earthquake in central Italy reached 287 on Friday, as Italians held a mass state funeral to lay the victims to rest. They included Antonio Loavan Ghiroceanu, who was born December 11. He would have been  6 months old on Saturday. The oldest-known victim of the quake was Evandro Testa, 96, who was born in 1913. More than 200 caskets were lined up at the funeral, draped with flowers. At least one small white coffin belonging to a child sat atop a larger coffin, a baby's pastel outfit hanging off the side. The funeral was being held outside a hangar in Coppito, a town adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter of L'Aquila. Officials elected to hold the Mass in the open air to avoid the risk of injury from falling debris. Aftershocks continue to shake the region more than four days after the earthquake, and some were even felt during Friday's funeral. All of the area's cardinals and bishops, along with 100 priests, attended the special funeral Mass. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was also there, greeting and embracing some of the thousands of mourners before the service. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone presided over the Mass as an envoy from Pope Benedict XVI, who plans to visit the region after Easter.  Watch Italy bury its dead » . Bertone said the funeral was a ""precious moment"" to understand the meaning of life and death. ""Everything can stop in a second -- projects, plans -- everything finishes. All that remains is love,"" he said. Watch more on funeral . Mourners, who were transported to the funeral on buses, dabbed their eyes and noses. Some stared at the ground or held each other. Few appeared focused on anything but remembering the victims. ""I feel rebirth in the heart, because below that rubble there is a will to rebuild, to start again, to plan and to dream,"" Bertone said, offering a message of hope. The towns of L'Aquila and the surrounding region, he said, ""will come back stronger, will have more courage and give life to these places with that power and strength and dignity of the soul that distinguishes them."" As well as sending Bertone to deliver his message, the pope sent holy oils to L'Aquila and a chalice with which to take Communion. Archbishop Giuseppe Molinari of L'Aquila also planned to deliver a message. The 6.3-magnitude quake Monday morning left about 30,000 people without their homes. Almost 20,000 of them are braving chilly nights in tents while about 11,000 others are staying in hotels, said Agostino Miozzo, a spokesman for the Italian Civil Protection Agency. Watch more on the aftermath . Recovering from such losses and rebuilding the city of L'Aquila will take several years, according to Miozzo. The medieval city is about 120 km (75 miles) northeast of Rome. Berlusconi has said rebuilding will cost several billion euros. Aftershocks have heightened anxiety in the area -- including a moderate 5.6 magnitude tremor that struck the area Tuesday. ""The mood is a little bit afraid,"" said Marco Volponi of the Civil Protection agency. He was working in a tent camp, housing people whose homes were inhabitable. In the nearby village of Onna, 40 people -- more than one out of every eight residents in the town of 300 -- were killed in the earthquake. On some streets, every single home was destroyed. Anna Rita Difilice lost her son, Fabio, 20, to the quake -- the deadliest to strike Italy in decades and the first major quake in the country in seven years. She said she doesn't know what comes next for her. Her village has become populated with tents, fold-up beds and feeding stations handing out food, water and other supplies for survivors. But she said she knew one thing: she's not going anywhere. ""My son died here,"" she said. ""There is no way I'm leaving this town -- not ever.""","Italians have gathered to farewell nearly 300 earthquake victims .

"(CNN) -- Some of the $85 million in hurricane relief supplies given away as federal surplus will be sent back to Louisiana and given to nonprofit agencies for distribution, the state's hurricane recovery office said Tuesday. Hand towels sit unused in Fort Worth, Texas. Goods ranged from cots to camp stoves to coffee makers. ""Today we can report that we have been notified that some of the surplus property has been located in Texas and will be coming to the state of Louisiana for distribution by Unity New Orleans,"" said Paul Rainwater, the executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. A CNN investigation revealed last week that FEMA gave away the supplies as government surplus, even though agencies like Unity -- which works to resettle hurricane victims -- were still seeking the kind of supplies given away. After the disclosure, Rainwater's organization asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to return some of the extensive stockpiles of household goods that had been purchased as ""starter kits"" for people living in trailers after Hurricane Katrina. After CNN reported on the giveaway, other Louisiana officials also asked that the supplies be redirected to the state, which originally passed on them. John Medica, director of Louisiana's Federal Property Assistance Agency, told CNN he was unaware Katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, an outspoken critic of FEMA's response to the hurricane, told CNN the supply giveaway was ""just a shame."" ""It's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy,"" Landrieu said last week. She wrote Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to request an explanation. FEMA Administrator David Paulison on Sunday defended the agency's decision, telling CNN that Louisiana had been offered some of the stockpiles, but that state officials had declined the goods. Rainwater said state officials ""will move to quickly get these supplies in the hands of those who need them."" ""Moving forward, we have made it clear that I am to be the point of contact for FEMA when supplies for Katrina and Rita victims are set aside for our state,"" he said. ""We will also be informing nonprofits about how to access such supplies, so that we can all better serve our citizens who are struggling to rebuild their lives.""

"(CNN) -- United Airlines and US Airways have joined American Airlines in charging passengers to check bags on certain flights. Passengers check in at the United Airlines counter at the Miami International Airport Thursday in Miami, Florida. Citing higher fuel prices, United Airlines said Thursday it will begin charging domestic passengers $15 each way for one checked bag. The Chicago, Illinois-based airline said the fee to check a second bag will be $25 each way. The fee to check three or more bags, overweight bags or ""items that require special handling"" will increase from $100 to $125 or from $200 to $250, depending on the item, United said in a statement. The $15 charge will apply to customers who purchase a ticket on or after Friday for travel within the United States, and who buy on or after August 18 a ticket to or from Canada, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The $15 service fee will not apply to customers flying in United First or United Business or who have premier status with United or Star Alliance airline network, the carrier said. iReport.com: How do you feel about the new fee? For itineraries that include international flights (except Canada), checking a first and second bag will continue to be free, United said. The cost to check more than two bags or items that are overweight or require special handling varies by destination. US Airways, meanwhile, said it will begin charging passengers $15 for their first checked bag for travel on or after July 9. The airline said it also has recently started charging passengers $25 for second checked bags. The new policy applies to flights in the United States as well as flights to and from Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean. Some airlines have been adding fees to once-free benefits, such as snacks. Despite this cost-cutting, airlines are finding it harder to survive as they get squeezed by soaring fuel costs. ""With record-breaking fuel prices, we must pursue new revenue opportunities while continuing to offer competitive fares, by tailoring our products and services around what our customers value most and are willing to pay for,"" said John Tague, United's executive vice president and chief operating officer. United said it estimates that the $15 fee will apply to one out of three customers, and the potential revenue from baggage handling service fees, including those for checking a first and second bag, will be approximately $275 million a year. The move comes a month after American Airlines announced a $15 service charge for the first checked bag. Delta, Continental and Northwest told CNN they are not charging for passengers' first checked bags. However, a spokesman for Northwest said the airline is well aware of changes in the industry. ""We are always keeping an eye on what our competitors are doing,"" the spokesman said.","United: Second bag to cost $25; $125 to apply to three or more or overweight bags .

"(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir landed in Qatar on Sunday for an Arab League summit, a move that could put him at risk of arrest on war crimes charges leveled by a U.N. tribunal. Omar al-Bashir is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over allaged war crimes in Darfur. Al-Bashir met with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, after arriving in Doha, Qatar's capital. Earlier this weekend, al-Thani criticized the timing of the arrest warrant issued in early March by the International Criminal Court, arguing it has undercut his government's efforts to resolve the long-running conflict in Sudan's Darfur region. ""We believe that peace and justice should go hand in hand to settle the conflict in Darfur, or for that matter, any other conflict,"" al-Thani told Arab League foreign ministers Saturday in remarks carried by the Qatar News Agency. ""But we also believe that justice cannot be reached in the absence of peace."" The March 4 arrest warrant is the first issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. But the ICC has no arrest powers of its own, and depends on its 106 member states to take suspects into custody. Qatar is not a member of the tribunal. Sudan refuses to recognize the legitimacy of the ICC, and has made no efforts to hand over two other officials indicted by the court. Al-Bashir has called the charges an attempt by Western powers to recolonize Sudan. The court accuses al-Bashir of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity in his government's campaign against rebels in Darfur, in western Sudan. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict. Qatar had been mediating talks between Sudanese officials and representatives of one of the rebel factions, who signed a confidence-building agreement in February.

(File photo) In an exclusive telephone interview Friday night with CNN, Mohammed Ibrahim Hanafi said the Taliban intelligence wing was actively gathering information on foreign aid workers. ""If we get someone, that is how we will deal with it under our new constitution,"" he said. He added that he was telling ""Afghan brothers not to work with NGOs."" In the 15-minute interview, arranged by an intermediary for CNN, Hanafi repeated the Taliban's pledge to keep girls out of public schools. ""Our law is still the same old law which was in place during our rule in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""Mullah Mohammad Omar was our leader and he is still our head and leader and so we will follow the same law as before."" ""In my opinion,"" he added, ""Taliban aren't allowing girls to go to schools because Taliban want women to preserve their respect by staying in their homes, not to work as laborers for others."" Dozens of crimes across the country, especially acid attacks, have marred the opening of the new school year in Afghanistan. Afghan girls have been burned and scared randomly with acid as punishment for going to school. More than 600 schools did not open this year because of security issues, according to the Afghanistan Education Ministry.  Watch what females face in Afghanistan » . The schools that did open, however, remain defiant. Young women admitted to CNN being fearful but also said they are determined to get an education and better their lives. It is a sentiment echoed by their principal, a 35-year veteran of Afghanistan's girls schools. ""I am asking those who close schools and throw acid on girls to let the children of this country go to school because it's crime to close the schools, a crime against the children of this country,"" said Safia Hayat, principal of the Zarghona Girls School in Kabul. Hanafi, meanwhile, went on to discuss possible reconciliation talks with the Afghan government. ""I don't think there can be any discussion of peace until the the foreigners leave Afghanistan,"" he said referring to the presence of coalition troops. While he seemed to confirm that some reconciliation talks were ongoing, Hanafi also said he wondered what kind of peace was possible as long as Afghans are still dying in NATO bombardments. Hanafi described himself as a commander in the southern province of Helmand, but announced a new Taliban offensive in the north was about to begin and that he would be playing a key role there.","Top Taliban commander issues threat to execute foreign aid workers .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- What to do with 50,000 used, possibly smelly and dirty prison mattresses that need to be disposed of every year? Discarded mattresses  pile up alongside trash in London in January of this year. Britain's Prison Service won praise Thursday for its innovative solution to the problem: recycle the mattresses for carpet underlay, or break them down for fencing or even roof tiles. Most of the mattresses are sent to landfills. There are enough of them each year to fill 30 double-decker buses, the National Audit Office said Thursday. The Prison Service wanted to find a better way to dispose of the mattresses -- a ""zero-waste"" solution that also cost less money, the NAO said. It worked with suppliers and launched a competition to find the best solution. They ended up coming up with several proposals to reuse the mattresses, and the Prison Service is now testing them out, the NAO said. Thursday's report highlighted several other examples of ways that government departments have used innovation to their advantage. ""We have selected them as good examples of innovative approaches which have lessons for how innovation can be managed in government,"" the report said.","UK's prison system wins praise for recycling mattresses .

"(CNN) -- Doctors Without Borders has embarked on a massive vaccination campaign in three African countries to combat an outbreak of meningitis that has killed hundreds of people, the organization said Wednesday. A child gets vaccinated against meningitis in Niger in August 2007. The vaccinations are being carried out in Niger, Nigeria, and Chad -- part of a large swath of what is known as the ""meningitis belt"" of sub-Saharan Africa, the organization said. The ""belt"" stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia. Doctors Without Borders, widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres, said medical teams have treated and vaccinated 5.4 million people and plan on vaccinating another 1.7 million -- making the vaccination campaign the organization's largest ever. The group said more than 1,900 people have died in this outbreak since January. More than 56,000 cases have been reported in Nigeria, Niger and Chad alone, the organization said. Last month, the World Health Organization said the disease was at epidemic level in 76 areas of in Niger and Nigeria, and a spokesman in Nigeria, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, said the outbreak was ""bigger than usual."" In March, the organization said a total of 24,868 suspected cases had been reported in the ""meningitis belt,"" including 1,513 deaths. The outbreak began around the start of the year, Soyinka told CNN. It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust, winds and cold nights, before dipping around May when the rains come, he said. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, according to the World Health Organization. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for the current outbreak -- is one of the most important because of its potential to cause epidemics.","Doctors Without Borders embark on vaccination campaign to combat outbreak .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as ""The Simpsons Movie"" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont . Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. ""We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,"" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. ""What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,"" he said. ""We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie."" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, ""The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive."" Its creators hope that ""The Simpsons Movie"" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, ""This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get."" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, ""When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof. I don't know what that says about humanity, but we do like to see cartoon characters hurt themselves and there's quite a bit of that."" But how have Springfield's finest led the field for so long? Groening believes that a large part of the Simpsons' success is down to the traditional animated techniques used to create it -- and that its hand-drawn charm puts the movie ahead of its CGI rivals. He told CNN, ""The difference between our film and these other films is that we have no penguins, okay? So that's the big difference. (Although we do have one penguin.) ""But the other thing is, our film is done the old fashioned way. It's got a lot of errors and flaws in it. These computer-animated films -- and I love them -- are perfect. They're spooky, they're so good. Ours is a way for us to honor the art of traditional animation."" Al Jean thinks that the series' success is also down to its wide appeal. He says, ""I have a two year old and she loves the Simpsons already, just because of the way it looks and the family. And then on the other hand, we do satirical references that only an adult would get."" A large part of the appeal of ""The Simpsons"" comes from its ability to portray the more touching moments in family life, like Jean's favorite moment in the movie. ""It's a scene where Bart is really mad at his father,"" he told CNN. ""He's sitting in a tree outside the Simpson house at night. He looks over and sees the Flanders house and thinks how wonderful it would be if he lived there. It's just really sweet: there's something really warm about that scene."" Groening, who has been meeting fans worldwide while promoting the movie, said that the Simpsons phenomenon has excelled his wildest dreams. ""It's not just the numbers,"" he told CNN. ""The numbers are good, but it's the intensity and the tattoos. The tattoos are freaky. You know? And it's not all just Bart and Homer. You'd think it would be just Homer. I talked to this one guy and he had Millhouse, and I said, 'Oh my god, Millhouse!' and he said, 'Yeah, everybody gets Bart.'"" While Groening never expected the series to run for so long, he told the Screening Room he has no plans to quit while it's ahead. ""The answer is, 'No end in sight! No end in sight!'"" he said. ""We're having fun, we hope the audience has fun, and as long as that's true, we'll continue doing the show."" Jean believes the show has proved it has longevity. ""I'm sure [it], like Mickey Mouse, will live on and on,"" he said. And he also hopes the Simpsons' success will continue. ""In terms of new episodes, we're doing another season after the movie comes out for sure, and then the casts' contracts expire, but I'd love to get another three seasons and maybe another movie,"" he said. But what is the legacy of this much-loved yellow family? Matt Groening sees the film as the culmination of two decades of hard graft. He says, ""I want to make sure that everyone who's ever worked on this show is proud of their work on this movie, so this rewards the writers, the animators, the actors. It's basically a celebration of twenty years of The Simpsons."" E-mail to a friend .","Simpsons creator Matt Groening: Movie is culmination of 20 years' hard work .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Colombian police foiled a plot by Marxist guerrillas to assassinate the nation's defense minister, according to President Alvaro Uribe. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe says authorities foiled an assassination plot against the country's defense chief. Ten guerrillas dressed as police planned to infiltrate the family farm of Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos over Easter week and kill the official and his family, Uribe said Thursday on national television. The guerrillas, who belong to the FARC, the Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, were captured, Uribe said. Uribe thanked and congratulated federal authorities, saying, ""This investigation had been proceeding for several months, and fortunately the National Police has dealt this well-placed blow."" Police Director Oscar Naranjo said eight of the guerrillas were captured at a property near Santos' farm in the municipality of Anapoima, 54 miles (87 kilometers) from Bogota, the capital. Officials did not reveal where the other two guerillas were captured. The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, has been waging war against the government since the 1960s. Security analysts have said the FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador, analysts said. The guerrilla group is known to pull off audacious operations, sometimes dressed as police, soldiers or other government officials. On April 11, 2002, a 20-member commando group dressed in police and military uniforms faked a bomb alert at the parliament building in Cali, Colombia's third-largest city. They tricked 12 congressmen into getting on a bus by telling them the military provided it for their safety. They then drove off, taking the congressmen into captivity. Eleven of those congressmen died in June 2007 during a shootout between military and the FARC. The sole surviving congressman, who was released in February, said the FARC shot the hostages when the soldiers approached.","Plot was against Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, president says .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- The suspected leader of the Basque separatist group, ETA, and two alleged accomplices were arrested over the weekend in France. Jurdan Martitegui Lizaso is the fifth ETA suspect arrested in France in the past two weeks. Jurdan Martitegi Lizaso, 28, was arrested Saturday in a French-Spanish operation near Perpignan in southeast France, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said Sunday in a nationally televised news conference here. Hours later, in northern Spain's Basque region, six other ETA suspects -- ages 25-31 -- were arrested, Rubalcaba said. Police suspect Martitegi replaced the suspected ETA military chief who was arrested last December and who, in turn, had replaced the alleged ETA military chief who was arrested last November, Rubalcaba said. Those arrests occurred in France, from where ETA has launched a number of attacks into Spain. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its more than four decades of fighting for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States. Rubalcaba said police had also dismantled two ETA commando cells before they could strike, one of them last October in northern Spain's Navarra province, and the other late Saturday, when the six suspects were arrested. Martitegi's arrest came after police trailed an alleged ETA local leader from Spain to a meeting in France with Martitegi for a two-hour training session on the use of explosives and weapons, Rubalcaba said. Police made the arrests in France right after the meeting, before the alleged local leader could return to Spain to share those details with his alleged commando cells, Rubalcaba said. Police seized three pistols, two vehicles, and a small quantity of explosives from Martitegi and the two others arrested in France, Rubalcaba said. ""I think it's very good news and shows the constant police coordination and the cooperation between the police and the courts,"" Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who was involved in the latest investigation, told reporters. Martitegi is the fifth ETA suspect arrested in France in the past two weeks. Given the heavy police crackdown, Rubalcaba said investigators have noted some internal discussion among ETA members about whether they should continue their armed fight or try for a negotiated end to the violence. But he said the government, which held failed peace talks with ETA under three prime ministers since the 1980s, was no longer willing to negotiate. ""The process of dialogue is the past, and the past never returns,"" Rubalcaba said, adding that ETA would have to decide to end the violence itself, or the state would force the group to end it. Over the past two years, police in Spain and France have arrested 365 ETA suspects, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said in December. But top Spanish officials have repeatedly warned that ETA, while weakened, is not finished. There are about 600 ETA convicts or suspects in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in both countries have told CNN.","Jurdan Martitegui Lizaso wanted for various ETA attacks in Spain .

"(CNN) -- Goldendoodle? Bernese Mountain Dog? Irish wolfhound? Chihuahua? Gina Goodman says a Pomeranian would be a good pet because they're like a stuffed animal come to life. After selecting a chief of staff, President-elect Barack Obama quickly turned to the more pressing issue of finding the perfect puppy for his girls, Sasha and Malia. ""We have two criteria that have to be reconciled. One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic,"" Obama said Friday in Chicago, Illinois. ""On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog. But, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts, like me."" CNN asked iReporters to weigh in on what kind of dog he should get and what to name it. The response was tremendous. After all, everyone's got an opinion about which pooch will be the Obamas' best friend. Gail Hurson, who lives outside Allentown, Pennsylvania, shared the opinion of many iReporters who want the Obamas to get a shelter dog. She says these pups appreciate having loving owners and a place to call home. iReport.com: What do you think the Obamas should pick? ""Mr. Obama, I say give your girls both a puppy of their own to care for, and give those dogs a second chance, like this country is going to get now that you've been elected to lead us back on track,"" Hurson said in her iReport. Although there was a mix of monikers for the First Dog, many iReporters believe that Hope would be a good name. ""I really believe that with a new president in the White House, there will be hope,"" Teri Satterlund said. The Troutdale, Oregon, resident wants the dog's name to reflect Obama's message of change. Barbara Martinez remembered that Malia is allergic to dogs, so she suggested that Obama get a Goldendoodle or a Labradoodle. Both breeds are hypoallergenic and have a sweet temperament, perfect for a family with children, she said.  See some of the more popular hypoallergenic breeds » . America's Yankee Doodle Dandy would make for a great name, Martinez said. Of course, it's a mouthful, but ""Dude,"" ""Doodle"" or ""Dandy"" could work as nicknames. Finding a name that would celebrate Obama's African heritage was what led Don Belgard to the name Ubuntu. The Pittsfield, Maine, resident said Ubuntu is an African philosophy that promotes ""peace, harmony and good will."" Because Dale Jacquef shares a birthday with Obama -- August 4 -- he jokes that he is qualified to give some puppy advice. The San Jose, California, engineer says his Alaskan Klee Kai is a big hit with everyone. ""All my daughter's friends go crazy over him, so I thought it would be a good one for the Obamas."" Elizabeth Shumway of Geneva, New York, envisions the Obamas having a fluffy Bernese Mountain Dog. These ""big, cuddly pieces of fur"" take a while to grow up, maintaining their puppy playfulness, Shumway said. ""I could picture them standing in front of the White House with this big, beautiful dog."" Huguette Rainforth raised Irish wolfhounds on her farm outside Montreal, Canada, for seven years and thinks the Obamas should get one, too. Rainforth thinks Obama and an Irish wolfhound would make a fine pair because of their comparable personalities. ""I think it's a very noble dog. It's very loyal, trustworthy,"" she said. ""I just felt it was the dog for him."" A Pomeranian would be the perfect pooch for Obama, according to Gina Goodman, who runs a petsitting service out of her home in Malvern, Pennsylvania. ""They would be ideal for the sweet little Obama girls because they would be like having their stuffed animals come alive for play,"" she wrote in her iReport. Paris Pujol's pet Rocco died a month ago, but she will always remember him for being a great pup. The white Chihuahua loved to zip around outside his home in Natalbany, Louisiana. Being fast and fun-loving does not mean a Chihuahua will be too much for Obama to handle. Obama won't have to fret about it taking too long to train the puppy, because Chihuahuas are easy to train, Pujol said. iReport.com: Spunky little pup brought family lots of love . Dogs are too high-maintenance for Jeremy Larson of Belleville, Illinois, who says Obama should get a cat instead. ""Cats are easier to take care of you don't have to walk them outside. They run around inside and entertain themselves."" Rusty Clark of West Springfield, Massachusetts, suggests that the Obamas go for a more unusual pet: a llama. iReport.com: An Obama llama? When Clark thought of the ""cute and fuzzy"" creature, she couldn't help but chuckle at the rhyme that popped into her head. ""Obama llama. It just sounded like a '50s doo-wop song,"" she said. ""If they've had donkeys and ponies at the White House, then why not a llama?""","CNN.com readers suggest the perfect presidential pet .

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome! Thanks for spending part of yours with CNN Student News! From the CNN Center, I'm your host, Carl Azuz. First Up: Focus on: The Economy . AZUZ: First up today: Technically, recession isn't a four-letter word. But it is one that Americans don't like to use, because it describes a downturn in the economy over time. Why might this happen? Well, many Americans' home mortgages are going up. And they're not able to pay. More people are out of work, consumers --like you and me-- are spending less money overall. And we don't even need to mention gas prices. Now these factors add up to an economic forecast that's not so good; Your family may be feeling the pinch. And all this is lighting a fire under government officials to fight a possible recession. Brianna Keilar considers the options Congress has, to try to prevent America from slipping into the red. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN REPORTER: With fears of a recession growing, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was on Capitol Hill Thursday, urging Congress to act quickly on an economic stimulus package. BEN BERNANKE, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: Stimulus that comes too late will not help support economic activity in the near term and it could be actively destabilizing if it comes at a time when growth is already improving. KEILAR: The president had a conference call with Senate and House leaders from both parties, the White House characterizing it as a consultation rather than a negotiation. All sides are indicating partisan bickering will take a backseat to finding a quick solution. Today marks the first time the White House has said President Bush is backing a stimulus plan, but spokesman Tony Fratto shied away from discussing specifics. TONY FRATTO, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECY.: The headwinds that we're dealing with right now are things that we see over the next coming quarters. So we do want to try to pass something quickly. KEILAR: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner met for the second day in a row. Both sides are stressing a bipartisan effort, but proposals are still vague. One option Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on: tax rebates: checks sent to taxpayers in an attempt to quickly pump money into the economy. Democrats say they'll scuttle any Republican attempts to extend the president's tax cuts as part of the stimulus package. Privately, congressional Republicans acknowledge it's a fight they can't win. What's more, Bernanke told Congress Thursday, making the tax cuts permanent won't help in the short term. BERNANKE: I think that the evidence suggests that measures that involve putting money in the hands of households and firms that will spend it in the near term will be more effective. KEILAR: Speaker Pelosi is hoping to have a final agreement before the State of the Union on January 28th. Brianna Keilar, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) No Girls Allowed .

MAZZEO: She spends hours here in the batting cage and working with coaches on her curveball. But this week, Alyssa went to try out for the middle school baseball team at the Providence School and was told she couldn't play. PITRE: I'm a girl. So what? You're not supposed to discriminate against females if they want to try to do something new, and try to make history at their own school. MAZZEO: The school's headmaster says they have no problem with her playing with the boys, but that she isn't allowed by the Florida High School Athletic Association. DON BARFIELD, HEADMASTER OF PROVIDENCE SCHOOL: Since we have a softball team, the state has indicated to us that she would not be permitted to play baseball. MAZZEO: The most obvious difference between softball and baseball -- it's the ball. The softball and the baseball. But Alyssa says there's much more to it than that. PITRE: The pitching is different. The ball is different. In softball they have longer bats -- different gear. MAZZEO: Alyssa isn't alone in her baseball dreams. her parents are considering taking legal action in hopes of changing the rules. ALYSSA'S MOTHER: If she wants to pursue baseball, then we'll pursue baseball. I just want to give her a chance. You know, give her a chance to try out, to see if she's good enough to make any team.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL GOODMAN, CNN REPORTER: The English proudly sing their national anthem, the Americans croon to theirs. And then, there's Spain. Hold it. The Spanish anthem doesn't have any words. This man won a nationwide contest with his lyrics for the anthem. But then suddenly the Spanish Olympic Committee, which sponsored the contest, withdrew the winning entry. ALEJANDRO BLANCO, SPANISH OLYMPIC COMMITTEE: Once Spaniards heard these lyrics, they sparked a lot of controversy, even rejection. GOODMAN: Viva Espana, or Long Live Spain, is how the now-discarded lyrics began. The phrase struck a sour note. Critics say it harkened back to the long right-winged dictatorship of Francisco Franco. MARGARITA SAENZ-DIEZ, JOURNALIST: You have to understand that many Spaniards do not consider the national anthem as their own. It was played a lot under Franco. GOODMAN: Spain is now a democracy, but many still bristle at the military march that's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem. Spain is made up of many different peoples, and five languages are spoken across the country. So, naturally, getting agreement on one set of lyrics is no easy task. One of those languages, ancient Basque, is among those taught in Madrid: Basques have their own national anthem and lyrics. At the Basque Cultural Center we found a Spaniard who liked the proposed lyrics for the Spanish national anthem. They're good, he says, and very neutral about Spain. Many others say the proposed lyrics lacked polish and shine. ANTONIO VILLALON, RETIRED CIVIL SERVANT (TRANSLATED): The French and American anthems speak about an enemy to defeat; our lyrics mentioned fields, wheat and friends. It's just stupid. MANUEL RINCON, TAXI DRIVER (TRANSLATED): The anthem should give us goose bumps. Spain's long history and diverse culture should show, in the lyrics. GOODMAN: The Spanish Olympic Committee says the search will go on, but in Beijing, Spanish athletes will likely have to just hum along to a wordless anthem, as they've done for years. It's a tune almost every Spaniard knows. Al Goodman, CNN, Madrid. (END VIDEO CLIP) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, smaller cell phones: Cool. Smaller MP3 players: Cool. Smaller bridges?

"(CNN)  -- Movie director John Landis is suing Michael Jackson, accusing the reclusive entertainer of fraud in his handling of profits from the iconic ""Thriller"" video the two made together more than 25 years ago. ""King of Pop"" Michael Jackson, seen in 2005, made the ""Thriller"" video with John Landis more than 25 years ago. Landis claimed his 1983 contract with Jackson gave him 50 percent of net profits from the 14-minute video and the documentary about the making of it, both works that he directed and co-wrote with Jackson, court documents say. Jackson ""wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits,"" the suit, filed against the singer and Optimum Productions, says. The suit characterizes Optimum as ""a defunct corporation"" Jackson has used as an alter ego. The suit accuses Jackson of ""concealing the extent of net profits"" by not giving an annual accounting for at least the past four years, and maintains that Jackson is ""guilty of fraudulent, malicious and oppressive conduct."" Jackson's lawyers have not responded to the suit, which was filed on January 21. The video was based on Jackson's 1982 album by the same name, one of the top-selling of all time. Landis, best known as director of ""Animal House"" and ""An American Werewolf in London,"" made the song into a short horror movie, complete with Vincent Price adding narration. Word of the suit comes just after an announcement that Jackson has signed a deal to take the dancing zombie story to the Broadway stage. The Nederlander Organization, a Broadway production company, announced Tuesday that it had signed a contract with Jackson to produce ""Thriller"" on stage. The show, which Jackson is to be involved with, also is to include music from other Jackson albums, the company said.

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We're back with a brand new school year of CNN Student News. Glad to have you with us everyone. I'm Carl Azuz. Bracing for the storm: U.S. and Mexican authorities are preparing for a powerful hurricane tearing through the Caribbean and looks to be headed for the Gulf of Mexico. And wrapping up the summer: You might have been out of school, but the news doesn't take time off. So we're reviewing some of the summer's big stories . First Up: Stories of Summer '07 . AZUZ: You might have spent the last couple months working at a summer job or working on your tan, but the news didn't stop when school let out last spring. There was tragedy in the Twin Cities when a bridge in Minnesota collapsed during rush hour, and questions in America's pasttime when a slugger's record-breaking trip around the bases raised a cloud of controversy. We've followed it all and we're ready to get you caught up on some of the biggest headlines of the summer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSTY DORNIN, CNN REPORTER: It was an extended family of rescue workers from around the country who converged on Charleston to honor the nine fallen firemen, joining blood relatives, friends and the local community. HARRIS WHITBECK, CNN REPORTER: The relatives of those victims deal with the wrenching but definite news that everybody on board the flight from Puerto Allegre died during yesterday's crash. LIZ KENNEDY, CNN REPORTER: The questions for the CNN-sponsored debate were submitted to the online video sharing Web site YouTube. BRIAN TODD, CNN REPORTER: Animal rights protesters target their rage at an NFL star as he enters a federal courthouse. Inside, Michael Vick pleads not guilty to felony charges of dogfighting and conspiracy. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN REPORTER: Six o'clock on Wednesday evening, rush hour in Minneapolis. Cars, trucks, buses crawl across the I-35W bridge bumper to bumper. Just minutes later, that slow traffic comes to a tragic halt. JOHN VAUSE, CNN REPORTER: Many of the toys made here for the U.S. giant Mattel were coated in lead paint, and earlier this month more than a million were recalled. BARRY BONDS: This record is not tainted at all, at all, period. You guys can say whatever you want. JOHN LORINC, CNN REPORTER: Nearly a week into the search for six miners trapped in the Crandall Canyon coal mine, rescuers will now try a new tactic: drilling a third hole in an effort to find the men. BARBARA STARR, CNN REPORTER: Top U.S. commanders are now using the strongest language to condemn the killing and wounding of hundreds after multiple suicide vehicle bombs exploded in remote northern Iraqi villages, home to a religious minority group known as Yazidis. HARRIS WHITBECK, CNN REPORTER: People waited in lines for hours, desperate for food, water and blankets. Civil defense authorities estimate more than 17,000 homes were destroyed in one town alone.

Hurricane Dean has been tearing across the area since late last week, and on Friday, it strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane. Jamaican officials turned off some power grids in advance of the storm's approach and advised residents to move into shelters, and the Mexican government issued a hurricane watch for areas in Dean's projected path. This massive storm is large enough to easily be seen from space, and with its menacing winds bearing down on the Gulf of Mexico, Liz Kennedy reports on what officials are doing to get ready. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ KENNEDY, CNN REPORTER: FEMA officials came out Sunday with a message: If Hurricane Dean does make landfall on the American Gulf Coast, help is ready to go. DAVID PAULISON, FEMA DIRECTOR: We are ready. This is one of the best efforts I've seen, the best coordinated efforts I've seen. KENNEDY: FEMA says their latest information shows the storm not making it as far north as Texas. However, they say hurricanes are ultimately very unpredictable and they are working under the assumption the United States will be affected. The White House has already approved a request to free up federal assistance for Texas. On the Gulf of Mexico off the Texas coast Sunday, oil rig workers were evacuated via helicopter to nearby Galveston. A veteran of the rigs says he was happy to comply. KEN YATES, OIL RIG WORKER: I know what its like to be on, get caught, trapped on one and you can't get off of it. Its not much fun. KENNEDY: Dean is being blamed for several deaths in the Caribbean. Forecasters say it could bring up to 20 inches of rain in heavily populated Jamaica, which could trigger life-threatening floods. I'm Liz Kennedy, reporting from Atlanta. (END VIDEO CLIP) Fast Facts . GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for some Fast Facts! Using categories of 1 to 5, the Saffir-Simpson scale gauges how much power a hurricane packs. A Category 1 hurricane, for example, has wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour and is capable of lightly damaging trees and shrubs. Contrast that to a seriously damaging Category 4, which has wind speeds of more than 130 miles per hour and a storm surge of up to 18 feet above normal. Earthquake in Peru . AZUZ: As you saw in our summer wrap-up, parts of Peru are recovering from a different natural disaster. A massive earthquake struck there last week, killing more than 500 people. This tremor registered an 8.0 on the Richter scale, which measures the magnitude, or strength, of earthquakes. Towns along the country's Pacific Coast suffered the most severe damage, and many Peruvians were left in need of food, shelter and supplies. Harris Whitbeck has more on the relief efforts in the South American nation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HARRIS WHITBECK, CNN REPORTER: Three days after the powerful earthquake, aid continued to flow into the stricken Ica region of southern Peru. A sports stadium in the regional capital hummed with activity as workers sorted supplies. Among the workers, Peruvian President Alan Garcia's daughter. GABRIELA GARCIA (Spanish): We are trying not only to give support and all the solidarity that we have, but also to give our time to help in moving and classifying things. WHITBECK: People waited in lines for hours, desperate for food, water and blankets. Civil defense authorities estimate more than 17,000 homes were destroyed in one town alone. Many of the area's residents spent the night in the streets for a third time in a row. They were surrounded by the destruction, accompanied by little more than what lay beneath the rubble . EARTHQUAKE VICTIM (Spanish): The dead are still buried under all this. It is going to start stinking here and we can be contaminated by cholera or many other epidemics. WHITBECK: Military personnel patrolled the stricken cities in efforts to prevent looting. Gunfire was heard throughout the night in Ica. Eyewitnesses reported armed inmates who had escaped from a nearby destroyed prison were roaming parts of town looting homes. Amid the chaos, a sign of hope. A baby was born to an earthquake victim while the visiting President Alan Garcia looked on. But other parents worried about the future for their families. EARTHQUAKE VICTIM (Spanish): I need to think about rebuilding so that my son can live here. I know it is too soon, but someday I will die and my children will live on. WHITBECK: They might live on, but they will do so with the memories of the horror of the past. Harris Whitbeck, CNN, Lima, Peru. (END VIDEO CLIP) Promo .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Guerrillas in Colombia tortured and killed 17 Indians who they believed were helping the government, a governor and two human rights organizations said Wednesday. Marxist rebels with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as FARC, swept into a village in southwest Colombia last week and abducted an undetermined number of Awa Indians, Human Rights Watch said. The guerrillas tortured and killed 17 Awas, including at least two minors, the human rights group said. Another human rights group, the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, or ONIC, also reported the allegations. Navarro Wolff, the governor of Narino province, where the Awas live, decried the reported killings. ""The guerrillas took several families, recriminating them for their supposed collaboration with the army,"" Wolff told El Pais newspaper. ""A young man was able to escape and told how he had been tied. Later, they tortured him, they beat him and they killed eight with with a knife."" Nine other villagers also were executed, unconfirmed reports said. The allegations are based partly on the information provided by the young man who said he escaped. Human Rights Watch also said it received reports from ""reliable sources,"" whom the organization did not name. ""These cruel killings violate the most basic principles of human decency and dignity,"" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch. ""There is no possible excuse or justification for these horrific actions."" The remote village is a 12-hour trip away from the nearest large town, and no independent verification has been obtained. Besides the unforgiving terrain, the presence of land mines and the existence of numerous armed groups virtually prevent outsiders from visiting the area. Monsignor Ruben Salazar Gomez, the president of the Episcopal Conference of Colombia, joined the chorus of criticism, alleging a ""crime the whole country should condemn."" Another religious leader said the Awa need protection. ""We are very worried about the Awa community,"" said Monsignor Gustavo Giron Higuita, the bishop of the city of Tumaco. ""It is a community that is pretty unprotected and that in the past five years has received a type of persecution by armed groups."" The prelate said that although there were indications that the FARC was behind the killings, ""we are not certain of that,"" El Pais said. The Awas, he said, ""are pacifist, want respect of their organization and want to regain their traditions. We have been accompanying them in this process, and that's why this hurts so much."" New York-based Human Rights Watch said group members have made numerous visits to Narino, which is one of Colombia's 32 departments, or states. Narino is in southwest Colombia, on the Pacific Ocean and the border with Ecuador. The area has a heavy presence of various armed groups and Colombian military forces, and has among the worst human rights conditions in Colombia, the human rights group said. The Awa territories have been particularly affected. The Colombian government has issued a ""risk report,"" warning authorities that civilians in the region are at risk. The FARC is said to have ""confined"" some villages, cutting them off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to enter or leave. In another report Wednesday, ONIC, the indigenous human rights group in Colombia, said the FARC has abducted 120 Awas since February 4. ONIC said the FARC kidnapped 20 Awa men, women and children February 4 from the Barbacoas area in Narino. The rebels returned the next day and grabbed children who had remained behind, ONIC said, according to Caracol Radio. ONIC also reported that a number of Awa had been knifed to death. The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, has been waging war against the government since the 1960s. Security analysts say the FARC has 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas. The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings, bombings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador.","Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia accused of torture, slayings .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In its opening weekend, ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" scared and thrilled millions of moviegoers across the country. In ""The Haunting in Connecticut,"" Virginia Madsen sees strange things happen in her old house. The film, which earned $23 million to finish No. 2 at the box office, emphasizes psychological horror over slasher film blood 'n' gore, which its audience apparently appreciated. But Virginia Madsen, who plays Sara Campbell in the film, confessed that, while filming, fear was not just reserved for the screen. ""We all stayed in this big, old hotel which was kind of like the one in 'The Shining,' one of those turn-of-the- century big, old hotels,"" Madsen told CNN. ""I had a little chat with my room. I said, 'Just out of respect, if there are any entities around, I need to stay here, I have a lot of work to do, I have to sleep at night, so please leave me alone.' "" Yet, Madsen admitted, her belief in ghosts is not very strong. ""I do have an attraction to paranormal investigation and all those kinds of shows but I'm not sure if I really believe in ghosts,"" she said. ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" is based on the true story of Sara Campbell, a mother who moves her family into an old house in Connecticut in order to be closer to the hospital where her son, Matt (Kyle Gallner), receives cancer treatment. The house was once a funeral home and, shortly after their move, the family begins witnessing strange, supernatural activities. ""Something very powerful and very real happened to this family. Whether or not you believe it was some sort of demon or, you know, they're manifesting it -- whatever it is -- it changed their lives,"" Madsen said. Madsen, 47, is probably best known for her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Sideways"" as Maya Randall, the restaurant waitress who gets involved in a romance with the prickly writer played by Paul Giamatti. Since that 2004 film, the actress has made several films, including ""A Prairie Home Companion"" and ""The Number 23."" She and the rest of the cast developed a close relationship on the set and were much like a family behind the scenes. ""I was more like a mother bear with my young actors,"" Madsen said. In fact, Madsen added, her close relationship with the younger actors made filming difficult at times. ""One scene in the movie that was the hardest for me to do was when [Matt] wakes up ... and his skin is all carved with these different incantations,"" she said. ""And I open his shirt and he's just looking up at me with these big blue eyes with tears ... and he really felt like my boy, he really felt like my second son."" Madsen said the film, complete with ghosts, séances and creaking floorboards, is successful because it has all the elements of a good horror flick. ""The movie works ... because it plays on our most basic childhood fears. 'Something's under the bed, something's in the closet, something's in the mirror.' And all of us still have those same childhood terrors,"" she said. The desire to experience those same terrors and to forget about everyday life, Madsen added, draws people to the theaters at an older age. ""I like things that go bump in the night, and scary things that are fun,"" she said. ""That's really what this movie really is. I think horror movies are so popular because times are especially hard and I think a horror movie more than any other kind of movie is a true escape ... You're forgetting about your life because you're like, 'Oh my God!' "" CNN's Elham Khatami contributed to this story.","""The Haunting in Connecticut"" had a successful opening weekend at box office .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- They've been called ""bromances"": those buddy films and TV shows, such as the movies ""Pineapple Express"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" that feature non-sexual but deep friendships between two or more males. Jason Segel and Paul Rudd star in ""I Love You, Man,"" which opens Friday. The forthcoming ""I Love You, Man,"" which opens Friday, appears to fit the bill. In the film, Paul Rudd plays a man who needs a best man for his wedding but has never made any male friends. Enter Jason Segel as Sydney Fife, whom Rudd's character, Peter Klaven, pursues on several ""man-dates"" that end up threatening his relationship with his fiancée (Rashida Jones). But don't call the film a ""bromance"" in the presence of Rudd and Segel. ""We hate that word,"" Segel told CNN. ""It was not part of the lexicon while we were filming,"" added Rudd. Still, both actors have plenty of experience in the, uh, guy-pal genre. Rudd has been in several comedies written, directed or produced by Judd Apatow, considered one of the leaders of the ""bromance"" trend with his softer, more openly emotional male characters. Segel has also been in Apatow projects -- including last year's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" -- and he stars in the TV series ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which finds plenty of humor in male bonding. Segel observes that what helps the films work is the discomfort of two men trying to talk about their emotions while hoping to maintain a dispassionate, hard-edged, prototypically manly façade. And he knows he's good at bringing out that discomfort in his co-stars. ""Judd Apatow told me that my special skill was that I am able to maintain my likability while getting incredibly close to the creepy line, and that's what I should try to cultivate,"" he said. ""That's what he does,"" Rudd noted. ""He just holds [the moment] a little too long."" ""It's the fraction of a second too long that makes people uncomfortable,"" Segel added. In ""I Love You, Man,"" Segel's character is rougher and looser than his characters in ""Sarah Marshall"" and ""How I Met Your Mother."" He welcomed the change. ""It was a real treat for me, to be honest for a minute, to play this character, because I've played sort of a puppy dog guy in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' and on ['Mother'] I play a husband, you know, a loving husband,"" he said. ""So to get to play a character who is a bit more of a man of mystery was very exciting for me."" In real life, claims Segel, he even has a man cave. ""It's filled with puppets,"" he said. ""And I keep wondering why I don't have a girlfriend. I'm like, 'hey, this is my house; come check it out. This is where I keep my 40 puppets.' ... I think that I have a reputation for being weird because of that."" But he quickly turns serious and maintains that ""I Love You, Man"" does have a message to go along with its comedy. ""I think we both had something to learn from each other,"" he said. ""Paul's character had to learn that it's all right to take a little distance from your significant other and have some dude friends and someone to vent to about things you can't necessarily talk about with your girl."" ""Sometimes buddies hold a mirror up to the way you behave in ways that relationships with the opposite sex don't,"" Rudd said. ""Yeah, and my character had to learn that maybe it's time to grow up a little bit,"" Segel added. So, this ""bromance"" thing, allowing a few feelings to show. Perhaps it's not so bad after all? Rudd says that the idea has its upside, despite its name. And he's glad it's been successful. ""That's us in a nutshell, not macho, not tough,"" he said. ""I think that we've all been kind of drawn to real stories, you know, characters that hopefully people can relate to and what's funny about just certain insecurites and just certain things in life. ""They could easily be dramatic,"" he pointed out. ""Just less fart jokes.""","""I Love You, Man"" stars Paul Rudd, Jason Segel as two men trying friendship .
Neither Rudd nor Segel likes the term ""bromance""

"(CNN) -- With President Barack Obama limiting how and where detainees at Guantanamo Bay can be interrogated, some analysts are asking if intelligence agencies will be able to get the information they need to keep the country safe -- and where the prisoners will eventually end up. President Barack Obama recently ordered the closing of Guantanamo Bay detention facility. Fresh off his inauguration, Obama issued executive orders relating to Guantanamo, including one requiring that the detention facility be closed within a year. During a signing ceremony at the White House on January 22, Obama reaffirmed his inauguration pledge that the United States does not have ""to continue with a false choice between our safety and our ideals."" The president said he was issuing the order to close the facility in order to ""restore the standards of due process and the core constitutional values that have made this country great even in the midst of war, even in dealing with terrorism."" At its peak, Gitmo held 770 people the U.S. government believed may have been involved in terrorist activity or military action against the nation. The facility drew sharp criticism, including from Obama as he campaigned for the presidency. Human and legal rights advocates complained that many Gitmo detainees were being held indefinitely without charge. There were a handful of reports of mistreatment of detainees and Obama, among others, said the facility was not an effective way to deal with alleged enemy combatants or gather good intelligence. With the closing of Gitmo and secret overseas CIA prisons, future detainees may stay in foreign custody. Those countries might not have the same constraints on interrogations, and they could share what they learn or let U.S. intelligence sit in.  Watch more on the Gitmo dilemma » . ""While you're able to say that you don't have U.S. secret prisons, in effect, you may be able to get the benefit through your relationship with foreign intelligence services,"" said CNN national security contributor Frances Townsend, who served as President Bush's national security adviser. But some say it's the mere image of closing Gitmo that will help U.S. relations around the world. ""Guantanamo is an extraordinary debilitating symbol in the United States and the United States' standing in the world community. Closing it makes good sense,"" Charlie Swift, a former naval defense attorney, said on CNN's ""State of the Union with John King,"" on Sunday. But Douglas Feith, who helped shape the Bush administration's terrorism policy, downplayed that notion. ""I don't think that it's much more than a symbolic decision,"" he said. ""The real issue is whether we can make sure that the extremely dangerous people that we're holding at Guantanamo can continue to be held so they don't engage in terrorism in the future."" That issue was raised last week amid a new report by the Pentagon -- released days before Obama took office -- which said 18 former detainees are confirmed to have participated in attacks, and 43 are suspected to have been involved in attacks.  Watch more on where Gitmo prisoners may go » . But security experts are questioning information released by the Pentagon, saying 61 former detainees from Gitmo may have returned to terrorist activities. That figure would be about 11 percent of the roughly 520 prisoners who have been released from the Guantanamo facility. But in a briefing Thursday, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates -- an advocate for closing Guantanamo while serving under Bush and, now, under President Obama -- seemed to downplay the number of former detainees who have returned to fighting. ""It's not as big a number if you're talking about 700 or a thousand or however many have been through Guantanamo,"" he said. On Friday, a Pentagon spokesman defended the integrity of the report but would not directly answer questions about where the figures come from. ""We don't make these figures up. They're not done willy-nilly,"" spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Pentagon officials said they would not discuss how the statistics were derived because of security concerns that such information could give clues to how U.S. intelligence officers collect their data. CNN learned some former Guantanamo detainees have returned to the fight. An al Qaeda video viewed by CNN's Nic Robertson showed militants labeled with their former prisoner numbers. Saeed Shihri, Prisoner No. 372, is believed to have been responsible for an attack on the U.S. embassy in Yemen that killed nearly a dozen people in September, barely a year after he was released from Guantanamo. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Ed Hornick and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","President Obama signs executive order calling for Gitmo facility to close .

"(CNN) -- No longer able to fit into a booth at a restaurant and too embarrassed to ask for seatbelt extensions on an airplane, Maggie Sorrells was desperate to lose weight. Maggie Sorrells lost 300 pounds and went from wearing a size  5X or 64 in men's clothing to a size 6. The day she stepped on a hospital scale and realized she weighed 440 pounds she knew she had to do something.  Name: Maggie Sorrells Age: 32 Hometown: Franklin, Tennessee Occupation: Receptionist in doctor's office Height: 5 feet 6 inches Heaviest weight: 440 pounds Current weight: 140 pounds Pounds lost: 300 pounds  Defining moment The moment I saw that I weighed as much as I did, it scared me, and I knew I had to do something about it.    How did you finally lose the weight? Diet: Weigh Down Workshop, a faith-based weight loss program. I ate whatever I craved, but only when I was truly hungry, and then I ate a lot slower, so I could tell when to stop. Exercise: Nothing out of the ordinary, occasionally I'd go for a walk, but never because I felt like I had to. How long did it take you to lose weight? Four years with two pregnancies within the same time period. One month after I lost 300 pounds, I became pregnant for the third time with my son. How has this changed your life? Drastically, the way I eat, the way I live my life. I am able to move better. I feel better emotionally and physically. I'm just a much happier person. I love to hike and I could never go when I was big. I almost killed myself going a half-mile. My chest would hurt and I would think I was having a heart attack. Just after we had our daughter, we went hiking all day and climbed rocks. I also love the beach. I'm no longer ashamed to go to the beach or wear a bathing suit. Do you have any tips for other people who want to lose weight? Yes, don't think about how much weight you have to lose because you'll get overwhelmed and discouraged. Set small goals, like 15 pounds. There were times I wanted to give up and there were days I felt like I couldn't do this. Food was my drug. Take [weight loss] in small increments because when you lose 15 pounds you'll be excited and before you know it you'll lose 50.","Maggie Sorrells could no longer squeeze into restaurant booths at 440 pounds .

"SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia (CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales on Monday accused a U.S. diplomat of contacting opposition groups, declared him ""persona non grata"" and ordered he be expelled. ""Francisco Martinez, a Mexican-U.S. citizen, was in permanent contact with opposition groups during the whole era of conspiracy,"" the leftist president said. ""He was the U.S. embassy person who contacted ex-police officers,"" Morales told reporters, according to The Associated Press, whose tape of the speech was broadcast on CNN en Espanol. ""The times of the colony will end in Latin America,"" Morales vowed to reporters. ""We are in profound transformation."" Martinez was identified in media reports as the second secretary at the embassy in La Paz, Bolivia's capital. Heidi Bronke, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department's Western Hemisphere Affairs bureau, acknowledged the move, but said it had not been communicated through diplomatic channels. ""We reject the accusations made by the government of Bolivia,"" she said. ""This decision is unwarranted and unjustified. It is inconsistent with recent statements by the government of Bolivia expressing a desire to improve bilateral relations."" Morales' move comes six months after he declared U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg persona non grata for allegedly having encouraged anti-government demonstrators to violence.

"LYON, France  -- Inter Milan have agreed to the transfer of Italian World Cup winning defender Fabio Grosso to six-time French champions Lyon. Grosso made 23 Serie-A appearances for Inter Milan last season. ""The player arrived late on Friday evening and passed his medical test before signing his contract with the club on Saturday morning, all three parties involved are in agreement,"" said Olivier Blanc, communications director of the French club. The 29-year-old Italian will be present at a ceremony at Lyon's Town Hall to launch the French champions 2007-08 season. Grosso is Lyon's highest-profile summer signing and will come as much sought after relief by a club who saw the departure of France international left back Eric Abidal to Barcelona. Lyon, chasing a record seventh consecutive League One title, have also signed Nadir Belhadj from French first division rivals Sedan and Mathieu Bodmer and Kadar Keita both from Lille. The Italian League champions Inter Milan decided to release Grosso after a below-par season and just one year at the club. The imposing defender played 23 matches in the league last term, scoring two goals. He will be bitterly remembered in France for scoring Italy's winning penalty in the final shootout that denied France their second World Cup success. Grosso will be the third Italian to play for the club since it was founded, following Orenzo Dito and Aridex Caligaris in the 1950s.

"Editor's note: Taresh Moore is a student at Winston Salem State University in North Carolina. The 21-year-old senior traveled to Washington, D.C., to attend the inauguration. Alfred Bouey is a World War II veteran and a grandson of slaves. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Alfred Bouey, an 84-year-old African-American, still remembers the stories from his grandfather about the scars on his body from the beatings he took as a slave in the South. Bouey, of Oak Park, Illinois, attended Tuesday's inauguration of President Obama. Words can't express his excitement and happiness about witnessing history. A World War II veteran, he never thought he would live to see a black president in America. Bouey grew up in Arkansas and saw racism firsthand. He witnessed his mother being mistreated by whites in the South, but he never saw her give up. He eventually left Arkansas for Chicago. Bouey attended the inauguration after winning Brookdale Senior Living's Experiences of a Lifetime contest. Residents at various Brookdale Senior Living communities nationwide shared their experiences and submitted their wishes as part of the contest. Bouey shared his story and said he'd like to be there when Obama was sworn in. ""My grandfather and grandmother were whipped and beaten, and had the scars to prove it,"" he said. With CNN.com's help, Taresh Moore spoke with Bouey about the inauguration ceremony. Below is a transcript of their interview. Moore: How are you today? Bouey: I'm great. I couldn't feel any better right now. Moore: How did it feel to take part in this historic inauguration? Bouey: It felt very great. I can't find any words to express my happiness. I am speechless and full of joy. Moore: What will you remember most about the inauguration? Bouey: I will remember that I was actually there. I lived to see this historic event. I'm 84, and I had the chance to witness this. Not too many people had that opportunity, and I am honored. Moore: How did you feel when you found out that you and your family were going to Washington, D.C., to take part in the inauguration? Bouey: I was happy. At first when I was asked to take part in the survey, I didn't mind sharing my story because I had many stories to share. When I found out I had the opportunity to go, I was very grateful. I couldn't wait to get here. Moore: Did you ever believe you would live to see an African-American president in your lifetime? Bouey: No. I never thought I would live to see one. Growing up, my mother wanted me and my brother and sister to get an education. And we all did. An education will take you far, and we see that it did for our new president and for me. But I'm glad I lived to see this. It's a wonderful experience, and I am very proud of it! Moore: How was it growing up in the South? Bouey: I was born in Philadelphia and moved to Arkansas at the age of 1. Growing up, everything was segregated -- in the schools, restaurants and just everywhere. Blacks couldn't do this and we couldn't do that. I came to the point where I got tired of it all in the South and just moved away. I moved to Chicago on June 2, 1946. Moore: Was it better in Chicago? Bouey: Yes, a lot better. Better opportunities for blacks. Moore: You have lived a life that has seen the scars on the body of a former slave, who was your grandfather, to seeing America's first African-American president all in one lifetime. How does that make you feel? Bouey: I feel that America has come a long way. And I mean a very long way. My grandfather had scars from slavery. My mother wasn't a slave, but she still was beaten in the cotton fields. Beatings didn't stop for some years after slavery. But there are no slaves now. It shows the great progress this country has made. Moore: How do you think your grandparents and mother would feel to see the first African-American president? Bouey: I believe it would mean more to them than it means to me because of how they were treated and the hard work they put in. This would be like their reward for all of the work and suffering they endured. Others, like Martin Luther King, who I marched with, would be very happy as well. Moore: How did you feel when President Obama was first elected? Bouey: Well, I had tears of joy on Election Night. I cried. They almost had to mop up the floor due to all of the tears that came out of my eyes. It was just a great feeling. Moore: How do you feel about President Obama and the future of America? Bouey: I feel that America is headed in the right direction. The youth are our future, and the youth in the African-American community has a great example of a role model to look up to. Any youth from any race can look to President Obama. They don't have to sell drugs or other bad things. Be like Obama, get an education and succeed in life. Moore: Millions of people of all races filled Washington this weekend to witness history. Of those people, many white Americans filled the city to see a black man being sworn in as president. How does that make you feel? Bouey: I feel happy. It shows change. It's good to see the white Americans appreciate and show love to the new president. And it's good to see everyone come together for a special occasion. We're all equal, no matter what color your skin is. Moore: If you could say anything to President Obama, what would it be? Bouey: I would say job well done. Our prayers are with you. Keep your faith in God, and he'll keep you.","Alfred Bouey, 84, attended the inauguration of the nation's first black president .

"Editor's Note: CNNU is following two student teams from the University of Southern California as they work to improve the quality of life in India. The student teams will be writing about their experiences for CNNU throughout the summer. Check back regularly for updates on their work. CNNU first introduced the Oral Cancer Awareness Team. It now introduces the Water and Health Team. The views expressed in this article are not necessarily those of CNN or its affiliates. Students visited slums to obtain data on the history of health and access to water in each household. (CNN)  -- The World Health Organization reports that 88 percent of the 1.8 million deaths resulting from diarrhea can be attributed to unsafe water or inadequate hygiene or sanitation. Unfortunately, a significant population in the city of Hubli, India, fall victim to these causes, and they are not even aware of the cause. The University of Southern California Hubli Water and Health Team is spending this summer implementing a project model that will improve these statistics in the community. The team of six students, visiting from the University of Southern California, will guide a pilot project in the under-served community of S.M. Krishna Nagar. Over the course of the next year, the Team will employ local college students to maintain the program and monitor the efficiency of the water purification technology. And by subsidizing the cost for those living within S.M Krishna Nagar, the Team will be providing state-of-the-art purification systems at affordable prices, creating an important sense of ownership and empowerment for the people. The team also plans to build awareness within the local community about the need to drink purified water. While the source of water currently received by the Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation is filtered, sewage leakage and the poor management of waste often contaminates drinking water on its way into the homes. This means that while the water from these pipes or the bore wells may look clean, it can be hazardous to drink. To compound the issue, even water contained in holding tanks on vehicles that visit the community is by no means guaranteed to be of sufficient, purified quality. The tanks carrying the water are rarely cleaned and the taps through which the water is dispersed may easily be contaminated. Families must be aware that the water they are provided is harmful to their health and provides a catalyst for breeding mosquitoes carrying malaria and other transferable diseases. Local reports have proven this, and communities in the past have fallen victim to water-related illnesses as a result of their consumption of unclean water. The USC Hubli Water and Health Team team hopes to shed light on this threatening issue, as confronting the challenge of dirty drinking water is a ""gateway"" step towards achieving measured, sustainable improvements in a wide array of serious health related issues. Through education at key points of community influence and the measured introduction of new technologies that encourage responsibility over simply charity, the Team will use its time in Hubli to affect change that is both scalable and sustainable.","Students from University of Southern California go to India to improve quality of life .

"Editor's note: Frank Micciche is managing director of the Next Social Contract Initiative at the New America Foundation, a think tank that promotes thought from across the ideological spectrum. He has worked for Sallie Mae, former Michigan Gov. John Engler and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Frank Micciche says Detroit has to justify its bailout while Wall Street is getting more without tough scrutiny. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There was good news and bad news in the recent filings Chrysler and General Motors made with the federal officials overseeing their multibillion-dollar rescue. The good news was that, if the federal government can see its way clear to adding another $21 billion or so to the more than $17.4 billion they received in bridge loans in December -- including a cool $7 billion by the end of March to forestall their insolvency -- the companies are confident that they will be able to retool, return to profitability and repay the money provided them. The bad news: it won't happen until late in President Obama's first term, if at all, and in the meantime they will eliminate at least 50,000 jobs this year alone, close even more plants than previously announced and discontinue several of their most recognizable lines of cars. If you think keeping the automakers afloat for another few years is expensive, you won't believe how much it would cost to let them fail. In the same report, GM CEO Rick Wagoner put the price tag for the feds should his company file for bankruptcy at $100 billion. Such is the through-the-looking-glass nature of bailout economics, circa 2009. Of course, even Wagoner's worst case scenario is a pittance compared to the more than $600 billion that will eventually flow to Wall Street through the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). Which begs the question of why, after four months and nearly $400 billion in capital from the U.S. Treasury, we have still not seen anything remotely resembling the detailed disclosures and strategic planning required of the automakers from the banks that have received TARP funds? For that matter, shouldn't the state and local governments that stand to receive hundreds of billions of dollars under the recently enacted economic stimulus bill have to submit something, anything, that would explain how they intend to use this money, what their spending will do to speed and sustain the nation's overall recovery and what they will do to wean themselves from this emergency aid once the crisis has passed? Small nonprofits and community organizations that receive federal grants will tell you that the paperwork and scrutiny that comes with even the most modest federal award is often so exhaustive as to nullify the benefits of the grant. Not so, apparently, if your request is in the billions. Perhaps the secret to avoiding the withering glances of bean-counting bureaucrats is to ask for serious cash from Uncle Sam. How do we square the double standard in reporting required of Chrysler and GM, whose combined request is in the range of $40 billion, with the inability of even a pit bull like U.S. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, to get answers as to exactly where and to what end the TARP money has gone? It may be that the situation on Wall Street is so complex, and the stakes so high, that lawmakers themselves have little confidence in their abilities to map a successful recovery for the industry, so they are relying on the sheer magnitude of their spending and the ingenuity of those left standing on Wall Street to work their market magic and revive the economy. The idea of a single ""Car Czar"" to oversee the rebuilding of the auto industry is now out the window, replaced by a task force led by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and National Economic Council Director Larry Summers, two of the most over-extended men in the history of American government. But it's still easier for Washington to imagine that they can manage Chrysler and GM back onto the road to viability than that anything short of massive infusions of vaguely traceable capital will unfreeze the credit markets and restore financial stability. In the meantime, the automakers await word on the acceptability of their plans to dramatically reduce production and add tens of thousands of new Americans to the ranks of the unemployed. Forty billion just doesn't go as far as it used to. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frank Micciche.","Frank Micciche: Auto companies are planning job cuts and plant closings .

"Editor's note: Penn Jillette -- the larger, louder half of Penn & Teller -- is a magician, comedian, actor, author and producer. Obama and McCain both promise a government that will watch over us ... ""I don't like that,"" says Penn Jillette. (CNN) -- Everyone I talk to seems to think the president of the United States right now is stupid. The Bush presidency is stupid speeches, stupid high gas prices, stupid bad economy, stupid war on terrorism, stupid war on drugs, stupid hurricane fixing, stupid global warming, stupid war -- stupid, stupid, stupid. They all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the White House fast, and Bush is so stupid, that task shouldn't be too hard. Not me. I'd like to say that I believe every president in United States history, including the stupid one we have now, is smarter than me. My alma mater is Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth Clown College, so I'm damning with faint praise, but I'm stupider than this here stupid president. Maybe I'm less stupider than Bush than I'm stupider than Jefferson. But I'm stupider than all the stupid in both of them put together. The idea, especially from the Democrats that I know, is, we just get a smarter guy in the White House, and all the problems will go away. We'll have smart speeches, smart high gas prices, smart bad economy, smart war on terrorism, smart war on drugs, smart hurricanes, smart global warming, smart war in Georgia -- smart, smart, smart. Barack Obama is way smarter than Bush -- so way, way smarter than me. Obama is way more charismatic than me. He did his big speech for about 80,000 people; I'll do my show tonight in Vegas for about 1,000 people. He's more ambitious than I; he's going to be the next president of the United States, and I couldn't even get to week three of ""Dancing with the Stars."" Obama is a great leader. He can fire people up and get them to do what he wants. He does smart speeches that promise everyone everything they need and make us feel good about our country and how much greater our government could be. But I don't think our next president being a great leader is a good thing. I'm worried about someone smarter than Bush taking over that tremendous power. Charisma and ambition increase my fear exponentially, and a great leader scares me to death. We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore shouldn't try. The only reason John McCain scares me a little less is because I think he's a little less likely to win. They both promise a government that will watch over us, and I don't like that. I don't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me. I may be stupid, but I want a chance to try to be a grown-up and take care of my family. Freedom means the freedom to be stupid, and that's what I want. I don't want anyone to feel my pain or tell me to ask what we can do for our country, or give us all money and take care of us. Gene Healy at the Cato Institute explains that the Founding Fathers wanted the president ""to faithfully execute the laws, defend the country from attack and check Congress with the veto power whenever it exceeded its constitutional bounds."" That sounds like plenty to me. You gotta be smarter than me to do all that, but you don't have to be as smart as Obama, and you sure don't have to be a great leader. Our first seven presidents averaged a bit more than three public speeches a year, and they didn't promise jobs for everyone, day care, dental exams and free stuff. It's really hard to find someone who trusts Americans to take care of themselves and each other without government force. It's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what George Washington humbly called the ""chief magistrate."" I think Ron Paul and Bob Barr mean it when they say they want much smaller government. But the government is already big enough, powerful enough and bipartisan enough (and ""bi"" means exactly two and no more) that Ron and/or Bob won't even be in the debates. People won't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves. The choice shouldn't be which lesser of two evils should have the enormous power of our modern presidents. The question should be, who would do less as president? Who would leave us alone? If we could find a lazier, less charismatic, stupider person than me to be president, I'd be all for it. But, it's not going to be easy; stupider than me is rare breed. So remember, the only way to waste your vote is to vote! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Everyone thinks we need to get a smarter guy in the White House, says Penn Jillette .

"(CNN) -- In the age of digital audio, what does good old-fashioned radio still have to offer? Teca Lima, the voice of RadarCultura, consults the Web site before talking into the mic. Plenty, according to the creators of RadarCultura, a community-based Web site and a daily three-hour AM radio program broadcast from Brazil's São Paulo. ""Radio is 'now,'"" says 22-year-old Brazilian André Avorio, who implemented the Web site. ""[Radio] is generally quick and live. This adds a special dynamic to the medium. Moreover, it is still one of the most popular means of mass communication in Brazil. Combining it with the power of the Internet can result in many new possibilities."" RadarCultura is an experimental project of the Padre Anchieta Foundation to promote public participation in audio-visual programming, eventually aiming to fuse its radio, television and Web programs into a single interactive, real-time platform. Like many online music sites, RadarCultura is always looking for new music and emerging talents, but its primary focus is to preserve the memory of the Brazilian repertoire by resurfacing classic, forgotten or unknown songs. The Padre Anchieta Foundation also happens to boast the biggest archive of Brazilian music in Brazil, including more than 15,000 songs dating from the 1920's to the present. ""Making it easy to search through the vast archive of songs was an important feature since version one of the Web site,"" says Avorio. Producer Alceu Maynard observes two types of RadarCultura members: ""There are people who listen to the show because they are fans of Brazilian music. There are others who like to produce the content on our site -- they collaborate actively with suggestions, playlists and all aspects of programming."" Meanwhile, RadarCultura team members Alceu, speaker Teca Lima and project manager Lia Rangel are busy podcasting interviews, moderating conversations, blogging, twittering and keeping the site relevant. Old media gets new blood . True to its non-visual origin, RadarCultura's Web site is strictly text-based, with icons that link to votes and streaming audio. And true to its Web-based platform, the site has adopted, and adapted, all Net-native systems for its daily operations. The site itself runs on the free Drupal content-management system, which allows content to rank and flow according to input and feedback from the site's online community. Members who wish to contribute their own audio material to RadarCultura's archive must either podcast it themselves first, or else they may upload it to the U.S.-based Archive.org to clear it of online rights. Given the quantity of music aired from the ever-expanding repertoire, copyright issues are the most common pretext to negotiation, most notably with ECAD, a privately owned civil society for the collection and distribution of copyright managed by 10 Brazilian music associations. Online, however, RadarCultura distributes the entirety of its streaming content under a Creative Commons license. The team has also been experimenting with the free CoveritLive software to enable live blogging, chatting and Twittering among audience, presenters and guests during its online coverage of radio and TV events, including the popular Roda Vivo TV show. RadarCultura's first live event coverage in February 2008 was of Campus Party Brasil, a seven-day tech-fest that saw people camping out in tents with broadband cables while sharing ideas and technological innovations. In April 2008, RadarCultura struck again with its live coverage of Virada Cultural, Brazil's largest cultural event, including art performances and exhibits in the streets of São Paulo during 24 continuous hours, attracting some 4 million people. ""I came up with the idea of inviting the audience to report directly from the streets using their mobile phones,"" says Avorio. ""A telephone system was installed, and the calls from the participants were automatically recorded. Our non-stop production team listened to every recording as they arrived and not only immediately published them online but geo-localized them on an interactive map of São Paulo. ""It was RadarCultura's first truly collaborative coverage, as the audience produced most of the interviews and reviews, of not only the main attractions of Virada Cultural, but also the very obscure ones that otherwise would not be covered by the mainstream media."" Next: Music for the masses, on demand . But still much remains to be done with RadarCultura's original content -- music. ""Due to legal restrictions, it has been very difficult to exploit many of the possibilities previously imagined for the RadarCultura Web site, like listening online to playlists or to the thousands of songs in the archive,"" Avorio reflects. ""Live radio has been a great success and will remain so for a long time, but it is now clear the value of on-demand content -- whenever you want it, wherever you are, on whatever device you have handy -- from the iPod to your mobile phone."" RadarCultura's Web site not only introduces Brazilian music and culture to the international online community, it brings its programming well beyond the limited broadcasting range of the station's native São Paulo to the rest of Brazil. In a nation notorious for violence rooted in social inequality, the democracy of the Web -- not unlike radio -- is a welcome new medium of communication. ""Certainly São Paulo is the most 'wired' city in the country, but the Internet and the possibilities associated with it have reached the most distant towns,"" says Avorio. ""It is amazing the value that such a technology delivers to a country in a fast development pace such as Brazil -- from education to more subtle ways of social inclusion."" For Gioconda Bordon, Padre Anchieta Foundation's radio coordinator, RadarCultura's most memorable moment took place on December 17, 2008, when the program celebrated its first anniversary. ""We had here in our studio the great composer Tom Zé, a very well-known musician, singing and talking live with a very young singer, Mallu Magalhães, a teenager, actually,"" she recalls. ""The listeners were as happy as we were and, of course, as moved as the two artists were. It was a day in our history.""","RadarCultura is a daily 3-hour radio program and community Web site .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Brittany Zimmerman, a 21-year-old college student who wanted to be a doctor, called 911 as she was being attacked by a stranger, police say. Brittany Zimmerman's screams and struggle for her life were captured by a 911 tape. But the police did not come for 48 minutes. By that time, Zimmerman was dead. Her fiance found her body. Although the dispatcher claimed later to have heard nothing, the 911 tape captured screams, gasps and what sounds like a struggle, according to the court documents. Spring was in the air when college student Zimmerman returned April 2 from classes at the University of Wisconsin to the off-campus apartment she shared with her fiance, Jordan Gonnering. He was out when she arrived home. He discovered her body when he returned. Zimmerman had been stabbed multiple times in her chest, near her heart. She'd also been beaten and strangled, according to warrants released recently.  Watch an update on the case » . Zimmerman managed to call 911 at 12:20 p.m. The call was taken by the Dane County 911 center and an internal investigation revealed the dispatcher did not hear any sounds that would signal an emergency. Because of that, police were not sent to the apartment until 48 minutes after Zimmerman made the call. Her fiance was already there. Dane County has taken some harsh criticism from the public regarding the delay, and tough questions have been raised about whether a prompt response might have saved Zimmerman's life. Police are still looking for her killer. ""We are working diligently on this case, have generated significant leads, and are making progress,"" said Joel De Spain of the Madison Police Department. The police said they believe Zimmerman was attacked by a stranger. Her apartment door showed signs of forced entry. After interviews with Zimmerman's family, friends and acquaintances, investigators determined there was no personal motive for the attack. ""In fact, we have not been able to determine any motive yet in this case,"" De Spain said. He emphasized that police have no reason to believe Zimmerman was the victim of a serial killer. During the investigation, police have tracked leads pointing to vagrants in Zimmerman's off-campus neighborhood. The vagrants often would knock on doors and beg for money. ""We are still investigating this avenue, but at this time we have not been able to develop any specific suspects,"" De Spain said. Zimmerman's family and friends describe her as a loving, warm young woman, who had much to look forward to. She was engaged to the love of her life and had dreams of earning a medical degree, they said. She was idealistic, and her goal was to help people, not to earn a large salary, they said. Other details in the released warrants reveal that Zimmerman was murdered in her bedroom, that her cell phone was found in ""parts,"" and that her bloody slippers and bloody computer paper were recovered. The murder weapon is described as a knife, two to five inches long. Police are not saying whether they have recovered it. DNA was collected from Zimmerman's body, as well as hair, blood samples, footprints and fingerprints. So far, no match has been made to a suspect. Zimmerman's family is offering a $14,000 reward, and Crime Stoppers is offering $1,000 for tips leading to the arrest and/or conviction of anyone responsible for Zimmerman's death. Please call the tip line at 608-266-6014.","College student's battle for her life caught on 911 tape .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The case against a Marine accused of murder in a 2005 incident involving the killings of Iraqi civilians in Haditha ""is simply not strong enough to prove against a reasonable doubt,"" the investigating officer said Thursday. The investigating officer has recommended that Sgt. Frank Wuterich not be tried for murder. Lt. Col. Paul Ware recommended that Sgt. Frank Wuterich face trial for lesser charges of negligent homicide. The case involved allegations that Marines killed up to two dozen Iraqi civilians in the town of Haditha, Iraq, in November 2005.  Ware said the evidence indicated Wuterich ""failed to exercise due care in his own actions in supervising his Marines."" ""When a Marine fails to exercise due care in a combat environment resulting in the death of innocents, the charge of negligent homicide, not murder, is the appropriate offense,"" he said in a statement.   The recommendation goes to Lt. Gen. James Mattis, the commanding general overseeing the case, who will make the final decision.  If the recommendation is accepted, it could mean that no one in the Haditha case will be tried for murder. Four enlisted Marines were initially accused in the case, and charges against two have been dropped. Murder charges remain against Lance Cpl. Stephen Tatum, although Ware has recommended dropping all charges against him. Ware said the evidence is too weak for a court martial. Four officers were later accused of failing to investigate and report the deaths properly. Charges against two of them have been dropped. Haditha, along the Euphrates River, was the target of previous Marine campaigns aimed at rooting out insurgents. Wuterich was leading a patrol through the city on November 19, 2005, when the unit was hit by a roadside bomb that killed one of its members. Twenty-four civilians were killed in what a human rights group and military prosecutors said was a house-to-house rampage by Marines after the bomb exploded. The military began investigating the killings in March 2006, and charges were brought the following December. A statement from the Marine Corps originally blamed the civilian deaths on the roadside bomb, triggering a parallel investigation into how commanders handled the incident. Arrest made in terrorist financing case . Earlier Thursday, the U.S. military announced the arrest of a man who smuggled $100 million into Iraq during the past few months to finance terrorist operations. The unidentified man, arrested Tuesday near Baghdad, allegedly employs 40 to 50 extremists at $3,000 per job for al Qaeda in Iraq bomb attacks against coalition forces, using money from supporters outside Iraq, the military said. ""The extremist financier is suspected of traveling to foreign countries to acquire financial support for terrorist activities and is suspected of supplying more than $50,000 to al Qaeda each month,"" the military said. The suspect, captured during a coalition raid in Kindi, operates a network of financing cells across Iraq, the military said. ""He is believed to have received $100 million this summer from terrorist supporters who cross the Iraq border illegally or fly into Iraq from Italy, Syria and Egypt,"" the military said. The $100 million figure is based on intelligence report estimates over several months, a spokesman for Multi-National Corps-Iraq said. The man is also accused of purchasing some of the explosives and weapons used in the 2006 attack on Samarra's al-Askariya mosque, also known as the Golden Mosque, and a second attack on it in 2007. The attacks heightened sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. During a separate operation in Radwaniya on Tuesday, Iraqi forces detained a suspected al Qaeda in Iraq platoon leader who commands 15 men in attacks on Iraqi and coalition forces with roadside bombs and direct assaults, the military said. Meanwhile, an Iraqi Ministry of Information spokesman said Thursday that Iraq has entered into a ""substantial"" deal with China to purchase weapons and light military equipment for its police forces, because the Asian nation promised the fastest delivery. Brig. Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf told CNN he was unable to confirm that his country was spending $100 million for the items, a number reported in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post, which quoted Iraqi President Jalal Talabani. Khalaf said there have been delivery delays from other countries, including the United States, and adequately arming police forces is a priority in Iraq's goal to provide its own security. In the United States, there are several layers of review before military equipment sales are approved. Khalaf said the deal was made last June during a visit to China by Talabani and Minister of Interior Jawad al-Bolani, whose department is in charge of policing and border control.

"(Oprah.com) -- It came as no surprise to a woman we'll call Joan when, after 16 years of marriage, she and her husband started discussing the possibility of divorce. Deep down she'd never believed her marriage, or any marriage, could be genuinely happy. Still, the reality was crushing. ""I was desperate,"" she says. ""I thought, 'I'd do anything to feel better.'"" How about singing every day, making lists of things that made her happy, and getting a ""joy buddy""? Those are among the suggestions given in Awakening Joy, a class taught by James Baraz, a meditation instructor and founding teacher of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, California. A series of exercises, lectures, and meditations stretched over 10 months, Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people's lives. Like some participants, Joan, who heard about the program while attending a meditation retreat at Spirit Rock, initially balked at the idea of singing. ""I thought James wanted me to join a choir,"" she says, ""but I took it on faith that the singing was going to work."" So she started trilling along with the ""Hairspray"" soundtrack while driving. ""It seemed ridiculous, but that's what initially helped me the most."" ""The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being,"" says Baraz. ""In other words, it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good."" The first and most important step, he says, is intention: making the decision to be happy. Robert Holden, Ph.D., author of ""Happiness Now! Timeless Wisdom for Feeling Good Fast"" and director of the Happiness Project in the United Kingdom, agrees that this is key. ""Intention is another word for focus. Whatever you focus on will become more apparent and will grow. For centuries, optimists and pessimists have argued over who's right, and the answer is they both are; each sees what they're looking for. If you focus on happiness, that's what you become more aware of."" Once participants have made up their minds to be happier, Baraz gives them the tools -- delivered in lectures to the live class he teaches in Berkeley and in twice-monthly e-mails sent to participants in other areas -- to teach them how to cultivate a positive state of mind. Among them: . • Writing what the word joy means to you . • Doing some form of physical movement -- such as yoga, dance, or walking -- a few times a week . • Making a ""nourishment list"" of activities you enjoy, checking off those you do regularly and circling the ones that could be done more often . • Checking in with your ""joy buddy,"" a kind of running partner in the pursuit of happiness. ""That's important,"" says Holden. ""One of the major blocks to happiness is a sense of isolation. If you're alive, you need help."" There are also guided meditations, including instructions on how to be mindful --being present for whatever you're doing and, as Baraz says, ""simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different."" For Joan, that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process. ""Awakening Joy isn't about being a happy little do bee,"" she says. ""You're taught that when feelings arise, no matter what they are, you stay with them. When my husband said we should contact a mediator, I cried years of tears. But by accepting those painful feelings, I had a watershed moment: I realized that I really wanted this marriage."" Rather than assuming divorce was inevitable, Joan started to see other possibilities. ""From that day to this, it's been a whole different experience,"" she says. ""My husband and I are still together, and in a way that I honestly didn't think was possible."" For Baraz, the best testimonials come from former skeptics; he admits that he himself wouldn't be the best case study. ""I've always been a relatively joyful, celebratory kind of person,"" he says. He found his spiritual path in Buddhism, but when his studies became very serious, so did he. ""Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One, and he said, 'Go for the highest happiness.' That became the focus of my teaching."" (Baraz points out that one needn't be a Buddhist, or of any particular faith, to reap the benefits of Awakening Joy. ""Ministers, rabbis, and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles,"" he says.) The idea for the course began eight years ago, when Baraz's wife, Jane, gave him a book called ""How We Choose to Be Happy,"" by Rick Foster and Greg Hicks. ""The instructions made a lot of sense, but they didn't have a spiritual dimension,"" Baraz says. ""So I added that and presented it as a series of talks with my weekly meditation group for about three months to see what would happen."" The results: ""We got happier and happier!"" Baraz then turned Awakening Joy into a six-month class and found that participants maintained a positive attitude even after it ended (as long as they practiced the exercises; as with diets or working out, continuity is essential). Word of mouth about the course that could make people happier began to spread: The first round of Awakening Joy meetings consisted of about 40 members. The next numbered 100; the next, 200, and then 500. It went international when its members began e-mailing their monthly homework assignments from the lectures to friends. Baraz was thrilled to receive messages from strangers in Europe, Africa, and New Zealand. ""It works!"" they wrote. Apparently, you didn't have to be there to get the joy. Nor do you have to be the type who can deftly turn a frown upside down. ""I'm the person who walks into a nicely designed room and notices only that the painting was hung too high,"" says Gretchen, age 56. In addition to being a ""serious"" woman from a depressive family, Gretchen also found herself in chronic pain after sustaining a back injury. ""It was horrible,"" she recalls. ""Medication made me sick. I felt guilty about not being able to work, and I thought people were judging me."" Though a specialist was able to alleviate some of her physical discomfort, Gretchen fell into a deep depression. She heard about Awakening Joy after taking Baraz's meditation classes at Spirit Rock. ""The first thing I was hit by was the instruction to notice what it feels like when you're happy,"" she says. ""I loved the walks I took to help my back, but before, I just plodded down the street, not noticing anything. Now I'm aware of how I feel when I'm walking, which enhances my enjoyment."" Writing lists of things she's grateful for was also a big help. ""A lot of my seriousness has lifted,"" she says. ""I have a lighter heart. I still have chronic pain, but I know there's a lot to feel good about."" Baraz is writing a book about Awakening Joy and the people who now routinely roll up the windows in their cars so they can sing as loudly as they want to. ""More than 2,000 people have tested it, so it's not some airy-fairy idea,"" he says. ""I've learned that it's possible to change, no matter what your history or the limiting beliefs you've held on to. If you have the intention to be happy and you do the practices, if you give it your best shot and are very patient, it works."" We're all so used to thinking that we'll finally be content when we find the perfect partner, lose weight, or get our dream job. Is it really possible to become happier just by deciding you can? ""We use the language of having, getting, and chasing to describe happiness, rather than being,"" says Holden. ""What we've learned about happiness is that it isn't an it or a thing. Research has proven that there is no one set of circumstances that makes someone happy; it's more about having a healthy mental attitude toward whatever you're experiencing. So, you can either chase happiness or you can choose to be happy. It really is that simple."" By Suzan Colón from ""O, The Oprah Magazine,"" January 2008.  E-mail to a friend .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN)  -- The grandparents of missing 2-year-old Caylee Anthony continue to stand by their daughter, who is accused of killing Caylee, an attorney said Monday. Caylee Anthony, 2, has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. The lawyer's announcement came just hours before a source confirmed authorities discovered bones in the area where a body believed to be Caylee's was found last week. The bones were scattered in the dirt, perhaps by an animal, the source said. Crime scene investigators were searching the area where the body was found and will continue searching through at least Wednesday, according to Commander Capt. Angelo Nieves with the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Outside agencies, including the FBI, were helping the sheriff's office sift through the area ""in order to make sure that no stone, no area, is left untouched where the child's remains were found,"" Nieves said. ""Significant finds have been made,"" he added. ""At this point, we cannot identify what items have been recovered."" George and Cindy Anthony were ""devastated"" upon learning a toddler's corpse had been found near their Orlando, Florida, home, attorney Brad Conway said, but the couple is waiting for authorities to confirm the body's identity. ""They're not grieving yet, because they don't know whose body this is, but if it is identified as Caylee they're going to go through that grieving process privately, and when they're ready to speak, they will,"" Conway told reporters. A utility worker discovered the remains in a plastic bag Thursday and alerted authorities. CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando reported the utility worker, a meter reader, picked up a bag at the site and a skull fell out.  Listen to the disturbing 911 call » . Later that day, authorities searched the Anthonys' home and removed ""a number of items,"" Conway said. Authorities have said Casey Anthony, 22, waited about a month before telling her family Caylee was gone. Caylee's grandmother called police on July 15, saying her daughter would not tell her where Caylee was.  See where remains were found » . The girl was 2 at the time of her disappearance. The FBI is using DNA analysis to try and positively identify the remains, Conway said. Though bureau spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday he did not know when tests would be complete, Conway said the FBI is likely to have results ""within the next week.""  Watch Conway describe the grandparents' devastation » . ""Everybody wants to make sure that there are no mistakes made, that the person responsible for this crime is held responsible for it and, if that happens to be Casey, a jury of her peers will have to make that decision after the state of Florida proves beyond a reasonable doubt,"" he said. If the remains prove to be those of their granddaughter, the body would be released to the Anthonys ""for proper and respectful burial,"" he said. Conway described his clients as ""good, honest, decent people that are getting publicity that they do not deserve."" Orange County Sheriff Office's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee's because no other children have been reported missing in the area, the remains are consistent with a child Caylee's age and the remains were found near the grandparents' home.  Watch how a home became a crime scene » . Caylee and her mother had lived in the house with Caylee's grandparents, but Casey Anthony moved into an apartment at the time Caylee disappeared. Casey Anthony faces charges including first-degree murder in Caylee's disappearance. If convicted, she could face a sentence of up to life in prison. Prosecutors said this month they would not seek the death penalty. Casey Anthony's attorneys have insisted she is innocent.  Watch Caylee's uncle dismantle a memorial » . After learning a corpse was found last week, attorneys sought a court order allowing them to observe the autopsy and conduct their own forensic tests. A judge denied the request after prosecutors said the motion was premature because the body had not yet been identified.  Watch why police think it's Caylee » . ""What I don't want to see, bluntly, is 24 hours after viewing an autopsy, a defense expert on a national news show describing this child's remains,"" prosecutor Jeff Ashton argued. ""The specter of that is nauseating to me."" Asked Friday how Casey Anthony responded to the news her daughter's remains may have been found, lawyer Jose Baez said, ""It's not something that someone takes well."" Casey Anthony remains in protective custody and has no contact with other inmates, corrections officials said. A psychologist has seen her, and she is on psychological observation, which is not the same as suicide watch, according to a statement. Casey Anthony's trial, originally set for January, has been postponed until at least March. When questioned by police this summer, Casey Anthony gave conflicting statements, including some that were later disproved, according to hundreds of documents and investigative reports released in the case. She claimed she dropped Caylee off with a babysitter, but when police checked out her story, they learned the address Casey Anthony supplied belonged to an apartment that had been vacant for weeks. The woman Casey Anthony named as her babysitter told police she did not know her.  Review a timeline of the case » . Investigators said cadaver dogs picked up the scent of death in Anthony's car as well as in her parents' backyard. They also said air quality tests conducted by the FBI found evidence consistent with human decomposition and chloroform in the car's trunk.

"(CNN)  -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari denied his nation was involved in last week's deadly attacks on Mumbai, India, and told CNN on Tuesday he's seen no evidence that a suspect in custody is a Pakistani national as Indian officials claim. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari says he believes the Mumbai attackers were ""stateless actors."" ""I think these are stateless actors who have been operating all throughout the region,"" Zardari said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" in an interview set to air Tuesday night. ""The gunmen plus the planners, whoever they are, [are] stateless actors who have been holding hostage the whole world."" At least 179 people were killed when a band of gunmen attacked 10 targets in Mumbai on Wednesday night, triggering three days of battles with police and Indian troops in the heart of the city -- the hub of India's financial and entertainment industries. Most of the deaths occurred at the city's top two hotels: the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal.  Watch Zardari blame ""stateless actors"" » . Indian officials have publicly blamed Pakistani militants for the attacks, and called on Pakistan to hand over a group of wanted militant leaders suspected of plotting them. On Tuesday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi proposed a joint investigation into the attacks and said, ""This is not the time to point fingers."" Zardari confirmed he is willing to have Pakistani security officials participate with India in a joint investigation. ""The state of Pakistan is in no way responsible,"" Zardari told King. ""... Even the White House and the American CIA have said that today. The state of Pakistan is, of course, not involved. We're part of the victims, Larry. I'm a victim. The state of Pakistan is a victim. We are the victims of this war, and I am sorry for the Indians, and I feel sorry for them."" Indian officials have said that the only suspected attacker in custody has told police he is a Pakistani national. Indian intelligence sources have told CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN, that police believe all the attackers  were Pakistanis. Indian police say nine of the 10 attackers were killed by Indian forces. Asked about the suspect in custody, Zardari said: ""We have not been given any tangible proof to say that he is definitely a Pakistani. I very much doubt it, Larry, that he is a Pakistani."" He said Pakistan is looking into the allegation, but added, ""Like I said, these are stateless individuals. ... We've had incidents the past two days in Karachi where we've lost more than 40 to 45 people, hundreds injured. These are stateless actors who are moving throughout this region."" India summoned Pakistan's high commissioner, the top-ranking Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi, to External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee's office Monday to inform him that last week's massacre in Mumbai ""was carried out by elements from Pakistan."" It renewed a demand that Pakistan hand over a group of militant leaders whose extradition it has sought since a 2001 attack on India's Parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear rivals to the brink of war. ""The government expects that strong action would be taken against those elements, whosoever they may be, responsible for this outrage,"" a statement from India's Foreign Ministry said. ""It was conveyed to the Pakistan high commissioner that Pakistan's actions needed to match the sentiments expressed by its leadership that it wishes to have a qualitatively new relationship with India."" The list reportedly includes Hafiz Mohammed, the head of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a now-banned Islamic militant group that denied last week that it was involved in the Mumbai attack. The group is blamed for the 2001 attack on India's Parliament. ""I am definitely going to look into all the possibility of any proof that is given to us,"" Zardari said. ""At the moment, these are just names of individuals. No proof, no investigation, nothing has been brought forward."" If proof of the individuals' involvement is provided, he said, ""We would try them in our courts, we would try them in our land, and we would sentence them."" Indian authorities said the suspect in custody was trained by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Zardari told CNN that Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is a ""banned organization"" in Pakistan and around the world. ""If indeed they are involved, we would not know,"" he said. ""Again, they are people who operate outside the system. They operate like -- al Qaeda, for instance, is not state-oriented. They operate something on that mechanism, and ... I've already offered India full cooperation on this incident, and we intend to do that."" ""I'm firmly committed to fighting terrorism per se,"" he said. ""That's why we are fighting them every day, Larry."" Asked about the possibility of Indian military strikes against terrorist camps in Pakistan, Zardari said: ""I would not agree with that because this is a time to come together and do a joint investigation and look at the problem in the larger context. We have a larger threat on our hands ... it's a threat throughout the region. So that would be counterproductive."" Pakistan and India, both nuclear powers, have a tense relationship and have fought three wars since the subcontinent was divided in 1947. On whether the Mumbai attacks could trigger a fourth war, Zardari said: ""Larry, democracies don't go to war. All those wars you're talking about did not take place in any democracy. They all happened in the times of dictators. ... ""The whole nation of Pakistan is united to ... becoming friends with India,"" he said.","Pakistani President Zardari: ""Stateless actors"" behind attacks in Mumbai, India .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Michelle Crawley says she's a ""freak"" about putting sunscreen on her two girls. Emily Crawley and her dad, Jere, hit the pool on the first day of a Florida vacation, which left Emily sunburned. ""They are both pretty fair skinned,"" says the West Chester, Ohio, mother of two. So every time Emily, 6, and Claire, 3, go out into the sun, she slathers them with SPF 30 or higher . But during a recent trip to Key Largo, Florida, Crawley's vigilance wasn't enough. ""I wasn't sure if it was my technique, the sunscreen or being in Florida,"" Crawley said, but ""that evening they were just fried beyond belief."" Slathering on sunscreen has become as much a part of the summer ritual as the vacation itself, but a consumer advocacy group has a warning for parents like Crawley who think they're protecting their family with sunscreen: You may be getting burned. The Environmental Working Group, a Washington-based nonprofit, has released an investigation of nearly 1,000 brand-name sunscreens that says four out of five don't adequately protect consumers and may contain harmful chemicals. The group says that some of the products of the nation's leading brands -- including Coppertone, Neutrogena and Banana Boat -- are the poorest performers. Read about the study . Coppertone was named by the Environmental Working Group as having 41 products that failed to meet the group's criteria for issues ranging from failing to protect adequately to containing potentially harmful ingredients to making unsubstantiated claims. But in a statement to CNN, the company says it ""rigorously tests all its products in the lab and in the real world"" to ensure that they're safe and effective.  Watch more on what to look for in sunscreen » . The makers of Banana Boat, which also failed to meet the Environmental Working Group's standards for various reasons, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Neutrogena says its sunscreen products have been ""embraced by dermatologists and consumers for their efficacy"" and says its new Helioplex technology provides broad-spectrum UV defense against sun damage. The science of sunscreens is simple: Active ingredients are compounds that absorb, reflect or block ultraviolet light. Sunscreens are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration not as cosmetics but as over-the-counter drugs. Sunscreens are rated based on their SPF, or Sun Protection Factor. The higher the SPF, the better the protection against sunburn. The Environmental Working Group says that the SPF rating on a sun product is only part of what consumers need to know and that one of the biggest problems with sunscreens is that they don't fully protect against sunlight. ""A good, effective sunscreen must prevent against a broad spectrum of rays,"" said Sonya Lunder, a senior researcher at the Environmental Working Group. Sunlight is composed of two types of ultraviolet light: UVB rays, which cause sunburns, and UVA rays, which tan. Although both may increase the risk of skin cancer, sun damage and wrinkles, the FDA doesn't require sunscreens to protect against both, just UVB. The FDA acknowledges that new rules mandating UVA testing and labeling requirements are being evaluated, but the Environmental Working Group wants tougher standards now. ""The fact most sunscreens still don't don't offer UVA protection and the fact the FDA has been working for years to finalize its rules is really what provoked us to look at this issue,"" Lunder said. Another issue: Is a key sunscreen ingredient safe? Oxybenzone is a a popular UV filter in many sunscreens, one evaluated by the FDA as safe. The Environmental Working Group says its analysis of hundreds of studies of more than a dozen sunscreen chemicals finds that oxybenzone can penetrate the skin and pose health concerns, anything from hormone disruption to cancer. The industry group representing sunscreen makers denies that oxybenzone causes harm and deems such claims irresponsible. ""Questions about the safety of oxybenzone unnecessarily alarm consumers,"" said John Bailey, the chief scientist for the Personal Care Products Council, which offers its scientific information about the safety of sunscreen ingredients online. ""Safe sun"" has always been a priority for the American Academy of Dermatology, which sees sun overexposure as the single most preventable risk factor in the more than 1 million new cases of skin cancer expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year. Although dermatologists agree that broad-spectrum sun protection is important, some experts see an even bigger sun danger if people perceive that their sunscreen isn't safe. ""We're concerned this will raise unnecessary confusion and cause people to stop using sunscreen,"" said the Skin Cancer Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to educating the public about sun safety. ""Consumers should rest assured that sunscreen products are safe and effective when used as directed."" While sunscreen effectiveness is debated, all skin experts agree that how a sunscreen is used is just as important as what kind of sunscreen is used. Dermatologists say that an ounce of sunscreen should be applied to all exposed areas 30 minutes before going outside and should be reapplied every two hours, or immediately if you swim or sweat. Common sense can also protect from the sun. Experts agree that children under 6 months old should be kept out of direct sun. Children need sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher. If you are sensitive to sunscreen, never go without. Instead, try sunscreens that provide a physical barrier, such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. New micronizing technology makes both appear more transparent on the skin, so you don't have to look like a lifeguard with a white nose. After her girls were sunburned, Crawley bought aloe and sun shirts, which they wore for the rest of their Florida trip. She is frustrated some consumers may not be getting the protection they think they are when they buy sunscreen. ""I think it's disappointing if you are putting your trust in these companies,"" she said. ""Someone needs to be keeping an eye on it to make sure they are meeting their claims."" CNN correspondent Elizabeth Cohen, senior producer Jennifer Pifer and Melanie Diaz contributed to this report.","Environmental Working Group: 4 out of 5 sunscreens tested don't adequately protect .

"(CNN) -- Harold Pinter, the Nobel Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter whose absurdist and realistic works displayed a despair and defiance about the human condition, has died, according to British media reports. He was 78. The much-honored Harold Pinter received the French Legion d'honneur in 2007. Pinter's wife, Lady Antonia Fraser, confirmed his death. Pinter, who had been suffering from cancer, died on Christmas Eve, according to the reports. Fraser told the Guardian newspaper: ""He was a great, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten."" Pinter was known for such plays as ""The Birthday Party"" (1957), ""The Homecoming"" (1964), ""No Man's Land"" (1974), ""Mountain Language"" (1988), and ""Celebration"" (2000). The works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary ""Pinter pause"" -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the English-speaking world and in myriad translations. His movie credits, like his plays, span the decades and include ""The Quiller Memorandum"" (1965) and ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" (1981). Pinter also wrote the screenplay for his 1978 play ""Betrayal,"" the story of a doomed love affair told backward, which was made into a 1983 film with Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge. He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2005. Pinter's later plays were more overtly political, with works such as ""One for the Road"" (1984) and ""The New World Order"" (1991) focusing on state torture. In commentaries, he became a blistering critic of the United States, writing in his Nobel lecture that the country ""quite simply doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, international law or critical dissent, which it regards as impotent and irrelevant. It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead, the pathetic and supine Great Britain."" But Pinter could also be a man of great humor. In 2006, he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier. ""Two days later, I woke up to find that I'd been given the Nobel Prize in literature,"" he said. ""So life is really full of ups and downs, you see."" Harold Pinter was born in London on October 10, 1930. He was the son of Jewish immigrants, his father a dressmaker, his mother ""a wonderful cook,"" he once recalled. In 1948 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, then as now one of Great Britain's most renowned drama schools. But the RADA didn't take; Pinter hated the school and dropped out after two terms. He became an actor and turned to playwriting with his first work, ""The Room,"" in 1957. Later that year he wrote ""The Birthday Party,"" a ""comedy of menace,"" in the words of one critic, that helped make Pinter's reputation -- though, in an irony he could appreciate, after it closed in London due to scathing notices. Ensuing Pinter plays, including ""The Dumb Waiter"" (1957) and ""The Homecoming,"" made him Britain's most famous playwright, as influential to ""late 20th-century British theater [as] Tennessee Williams is to mid-century American stages,"" CNN.com's Porter Anderson wrote in 2006. ""What's generally meant as a 'Pinter play' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted, even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat,"" Anderson wrote. Pinter's plays featured sparse dialogue, often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement. In ""The Birthday Party,"" a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it's his birthday; in ""The Homecoming"" -- which won the Tony Award for best play when it premiered on Broadway in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working-class British family, where the wife becomes the center of attention. Pinter credited Samuel Beckett, among others, as an influence. (He starred in a production of Beckett's ""Krapp's Last Tape"" in 2006.) In turn, writers such as David Mamet and Sam Shepard followed Pinter's elliptical lead. ""One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness,"" Pinter once said. He was married first to the actress Vivien Merchant. Following a 1980 divorce, Pinter married writer-historian Lady Antonia Fraser.","Harold Pinter died on Christmas Eve, his wife tells British media .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Three professors and a former professor at Columbia University's Teachers College received hate mail this week, the New York Police Department said. It's the campus that was shaken by several bias crimes directed at black and Jewish professors in 2007. Columbia University's Teachers College is once again the target of a hate campaign. Three professors received manila envelopes Tuesday with images of swastikas in them. The fourth, a former professor who is an African-American, was sent a manila envelope containing an image of a noose, according to NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne. Among those receiving a swastika image was Elizabeth Midlarsky, a Jewish psychologist who has studied psychological principles in the context of the Holocaust, police said. In 2007, her office door was spray-painted with a swastika. (A swastika is the right-angles cross symbol used on Nazi Germany flags). The NYPD Hate Crimes Unit is leading the investigation into the incident. No arrests have been made. ""The TC community deplores these hateful acts, which violate every Teachers College and societal norm,"" said an e-mail Wednesday to faculty and students from the college's president, Susan Fuhrman; and dean, Tom James. No arrests were been made in the 2007 incidents. Police declined to say if they believe there is a connection between those cases and the mailings this week.","Three professors, one former one at Columbia University receive hate mail this week .

"(CNN)      -- Two teams of scientists say they have found a key area of the H5N1 bird flu virus which seems to be vital to its ability to copy itself, and hope the discovery could lead to new drugs to fight the infection. Human-to-human transmission of avian flu is rare, but in some cases, the virus has passed from poultry to humans. The discovery is generating excitement among scientists who are looking for a new weapon against the bird flu virus that typically kills more than half its human victims. Two separate groups of scientists -- one in China, one in France -- used a highly technical process to identify protein that seems to be involved in its ability to replicate itself. That gives researchers a new target, as they try and develop new medications. The announcements, detailed in the British-based journal Nature, come at an uneasy time for those who follow the bird flu strain called H5N1. So far this disease is mainly affecting birds in some countries and the number of human cases remains small, but the virus has shown no sign of growing milder since it first infected people back in 1997. It continues to decimate bird flocks in sporadic outbreaks, mostly in Asia, and occasionally breaks into the human population. China's Ministry of Health reported eight human cases last month, including four deaths. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has confirmed 404 human cases worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of the victims have died. While H5N1 doesn't make headlines the way it did in 2005, health officials say the continuing severity of the infections means the alarm is still on. Influenza viruses, in general, spread easily. If H5N1 were to acquire the genetic ability to pass easily from person to person, it could turn into a major catastrophe. Many countries have stockpiled both vaccines and antiviral medications, for such a scenario. The same medications that are used to treat regular flu, oseltamivir (Tamiful) and zanamivir (Relenza), also seem to be effective against H5N1. But that's no reason to rest easy. All flu viruses tend to mutate rapidly, which is why the flu vaccine one year, won't protect you against the next year's flu. Those rapid mutations mean the virus tends to develop a resistance to any widely used medication. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told CNN, ""It always happens that eventually, sooner or later, the [flu] virus will develop varying degrees of resistance. You just hope that it's kept to a minimum."" The findings in Nature may lead to another option to fight bird flu, but an actual new drug is years away. A vaccine could be effective, but they first have to know what strain of flu they're fighting. The current strategy of health officials around the world is to try to contain isolated cases before they spread. The best case scenario would be, that this H5N1 killer remains primarily a disease for the birds.","Experts say they have found key component of the H5N1 bird flu virus .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A company accused of encouraging hundreds to illegally enter the United States and then hiring them using fake Social Security numbers has agreed to pay the largest settlement ever in a workplace immigration bust, the Department of Justice said Friday. Relatives of people arrested in IFCO raids gather for a news conference in July 2006. IFCO Systems North America, a pallet and crate company, will pay a $20.7 million settlement, which includes $18.1 million in fines and $2.6 million for overtime violations, the Department of Justice said. In early 2006, immigration officials raided 45 IFCO sites, arresting almost 1,200 low-level workers. Federal officials also charged several managers, accusing them of using ""as a business model the systematic violation of United States law."" To date, nine IFCO managers and employees have pleaded guilty to criminal conduct, the Justice Department said. Four managers are awaiting trial on felony charges and the investigation is continuing, it said. The Justice Department said it will not pursue criminal charges against the company if it complies with the terms of the settlement. ""The agreement severely punishes IFCO for its serious immigration and employment violations,"" acting U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter said. ""But it also allows the corporation to continue its operations, so that its lawful employees and innocent shareholders do not suffer the consequences of a business failure in this economy."" IFCO's violation of the law was flagrant, officials said. More than half of the company's 5,800 workers during 2005 had invalid Social Security numbers, and the company ignored at least 13 letters from the Social Security Administration about questionable Social Security numbers. IFCO records suggests that as many as 6,000 illegal immigrants worked at company plants from 2003 to 2006, the Justice Department said. Federal officials said Friday that IFCO ""acknowledges and accepts responsibility for the unlawful conduct of its managers and employees.""

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Searchers looking for a woman believed to have fallen from a cruise ship off the Yucatan coast of Mexico have seen no sign of her, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said Friday afternoon. The Norwegian Pearl is on a seven-day Caribbean cruise. Lt. Matt Moorlag, based in Miami, said crews would work into the night to find 33-year-old Jennifer Feitz, whose husband reported her missing aboard the Norwegian Pearl about 3:40 a.m. Friday. Ship personnel called the Coast Guard for help when they couldn't locate Feitz. Moorlag said he had not spoken with the woman's husband. The search was centered about 15 miles east of Cancun, Mexico, in the Caribbean Sea, said Petty Officer 3rd Class Nick Ameen, a Coast Guard spokesman. ""Initial reports indicate the guest may have gone overboard while the ship was at sea, east of Cancun,"" a spokeswoman for the Miami-based Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement. AnneMarie Mathews said the ship left Miami on Sunday on a seven-day western Caribbean cruise. The Coast Guard dispatched an Air Station Miami HU-25 Falcon jet crew, and a C-130 fixed-wing aircraft crew from the Air Station in Clearwater, Florida, also was headed to the site, Ameen said. The Mexican government was aiding the search with a helicopter crew and three water- and ground-surface crews.","Passenger Jennifer Feitz, 33, reported missing on Norwegian Pearl ship .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Italy's prime minister held emergency meetings on Monday to discuss the growing garbage problem in Naples, where more than two weeks of closed dumps and uncollected garbage has led to mountains of trash across the city. Collectors stopped picking up rubbish on December 21, saying that dumps are full. The garbage problem has become so bad that Neapolitan residents have started burning their waste, leading to noxious fumes permeating the air in the southern Italian coastal city. On Monday, the government called on the army to help with emergency trash collection for the second time in a year. Bags of rotting, uncollected waste now line city streets and sit in alleys beneath residential apartment blocks. In some places, the piles of trash tower over the cars driving past. Prime Minister Romano Prodi met with the interior and environment ministers in Rome after President Giorgio Napolitano, who is from Naples, said he was alarmed by the crisis. The latest problems began on December 31, when the government closed one of the area's two working dumps. Gian Francesco Raiano, a spokesman for the government's ""garbage crisis administrator,"" said the dump was closed at the request of residents. That left only one working dump, in the town of Serre, which is able to accept only 2,000 tons of trash a day. Raiano said that was the reason trash started piling up on the streets. Authorities are hoping to alleviate the problem when they reopen a long-closed dump in the town of Pianura, near Naples, by the end of this week. The government announced on December 30 that it planned to reopen Pianura, and the decision immediately sparked protests by nearby residents. They blocked roads to stop trucks from entering the site to prepare to open it after 12 years out of commission, and there were scuffles as police tried to move protesters away. Problems with Naples' garbage have been around in some form for 14 years, when Italian authorities first declared the situation an emergency. Complicating the issue is the involvement of organized crime, which has long controlled the region's waste business. The Camorra, as the mafia is known in Naples, controls both dumps and garbage trucks, making the problem enormously difficult for the government to solve. Forty dumping sites have operated in the Campania region over the past 30 years, but most have been closed for various reasons, including criminal investigations related to the Camorra. Residents' protests, over-saturation, and lack of proper equipment were other factors. Italian media have cited statistics saying that Naples produces 1.6 million tons of garbage a year, and that the government has spent 1.8 billion euros ($2.7 billion) over the past 14 years to deal with the problem.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- He's the butt-kicking, karate-chopping, kung fu superstar who rose from nowhere to conquer Hollywood in a spectacularly visual style. Action star Jackie Chan celebrates winning Best Actor at the 25th China Golden Rooster in 2005 . With his compact but wiry 5-foot, 9-inch frame, Jackie Chan seems to pale into insignificance when compared with muscle-bound Hollywood tough guys such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean-Claude Van Damme. But combining extraordinary athleticism and an acrobatic style, Chan could probably take them both on in a fight and emerge victorious. Best known to western audiences as star of the Rush Hour trilogy, Chan is a prolific actor who has made more than 100 films spanning three decades. But success did not come easy for Chan, who made a string of flops in the early 1970s in Asia. He struggled for years to break out of the shadow of Bruce Lee, the undisputed kung fu king of the time -- even appearing as a stuntman in two of Lee's films. But in 1978, Chan landed his first hit in Asia with ""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow."" This was quickly followed by ""Drunken Master,"" which catapulted him to fame, and he suddenly became one of the highest-paid actors in the industry. Chan is credited with creating a new film art form, with his comedic take on martial arts, reminiscent of Buster Keaton's slapstick style. ""He totally reinvented Hong Kong cinema,"" said Renee Witterstaetter, author of ""Dying For Action: The Life and Films of Jackie Chan."" ""He created a new film art form, mixing humor with martial arts,"" Witterstaetter said. ""It was so different and unique.""  Watch TalkAsia's exclusive interview inside Jackie Chan's den » . Although a household name in his native Hong Kong and most of Asia, Hollywood seemed largely oblivious to his talents. It was not until 1994 when he made ""Rumble in the Bronx,"" which grossed $10 million in its opening weekend and made it to number one at the U.S. box office, that Chan finally cracked Hollywood. Soon big-budget hits such as the ""Rush Hour"" series and ""Shanghai Noon,"" followed. ""Rush Hour"" was Chan's first movie to break $100 million at the U.S. box office, earning $141 million, according to the box office tracking Web site, Box Office Mojo. ""Rush Hour 2"" made $226 million and ""Rush Hour 3"" has earned $137 million so far. His current cinematic venture sees him paired with longtime friend Jet Li in ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" in their first movie collaboration. Set in a mythic, ancient China, it is described as ""The Wizard of Oz with lots of martial arts."" The martial arts dream team have already seen ""Kingdom"" debut at No. 1 with $20.9 million in ticket sales last weekend, but Chan says the reason it took him so long to work with Jet Li is because he didn't like the Hollywood scripts they were initially offered. Chan, 54, is also quite candid about the fact that he doesn't like most of the Hollywood films he has made. He revealed to CNN: ""I didn't really like 'Rush Hour.' In America, everyone likes 'Rush Hour,' but in Asia nobody likes it. ""They like talking too much in America but in Asia they like to fight more in the films."" After the film wrapped in 1998, he wrote on his Web site: ""When we finished filming, I was very disappointed because it was a movie I didn't appreciate and I did not like the action scenes involved. ""I felt the style of action was too Americanized and I didn't understand the American humor."" Chan has certainly come a long way from his impoverished childhood in Hong Kong, where the story has it that his parents were so poor, they nearly sold him to a British doctor for less than $100. However, his parents instead enrolled him at the China Drama Academy, a talent school of hard knocks with a draconian regime that included training in music, acrobatics and martial arts that lasted 18 hours a day. Beatings were commonplace. Children were made to perform headstands for hours on end and Chan describes being forced to run, arms outstretched, carrying two full cups of water, with strict instructions not to spill a drop. With his parents now living in Australia, Chan stayed at the school for ten years and was adopted by his Master. Undoubtedly, the academy's grueling regime would later stand Chan in good stead, turning him into an incredibly driven and disciplined stuntman turned actor, who always choreographs and performs his own stunts. As a consequence, no insurance company will underwrite Chan's productions, which are legendary for his death-defying super stunts. They include water-skiing barefoot behind a speeding hovercraft, jumping off a building and swinging from a hot air balloon. Chan holds the Guinness World Record for ""Most Stunts By A Living Actor."" He also holds the record for the most number of takes for a single shot in a film, having shot over 2900 retakes for a complex scene involving a badminton game in ""Dragon Lord."" Unsurprisingly, Chan has suffered a litany of injuries in the course of his film career. Over the years, he has dislocated his pelvis and broken his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck and ribs on numerous occasions. When filming ""Police Story"" in 1985, he suffered second-degree burns to his hands and palms after sliding 100 feet down a pole festooned in Christmas lights. Many of the injuries have appeared, in eye-watering viewing, as outtakes or bloopers during the closing credits of his films. But in 1986, he came close to death while filming ""Armor of God,"" when he fell 45 feet from a tree and fractured his skull, leaving a permanent hole in his head. Chan explained to CNN's TalkAsia host, Anjali Rao that he never insists on doing his own stunts. It's just the way things are done in Hong Kong. ""Making a film in Hong Kong in the old days was not like Hollywood,"" he says. ""We didn't have protection like elbow pads and we didn't have the knowledge about safety. I had to risk my life jumping from building to building."" Chan is a one-man movie-making machine. He has his own production and distribution company -- Jackie Chan Emperor Movies -- and controls all aspects of the movie-making process, from casting to directing, producing, screenwriting, choreographing and stunt coordinating. He even has his own stunt team and casting agency. His director on the Rush Hour series, Brett Ratner told CNN's The Screening Room that Chan's versatility gives him the edge over other martial arts stars like Bruce Lee and Jet Li. ""Jackie is the most gifted actor of the three because he has the most range. Bruce Lee is a legendary performer and martial artist, but I don't think he is as funny as Jackie Chan. ""Jackie can be funny, he can be dramatic, he can do the action and the stunts, he can direct, edit, shoot. He is also a stunt coordinator so he is everything wrapped into one.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William received his Royal Air Force pilot's wings at a graduation ceremony Friday. Prince William while attending Remembrance Sunday ceremonies last November in London. His father, Prince Charles, presented the wings to his son and 24 other graduating students at the ceremony, held at the Cranwell Air Force base in northern England. Prince Charles smiled broadly as he pinned the badge on his son's lapel. The two shared a few words and shook hands as the audience clapped. William's girlfriend, Kate Middleton, was among those watching the ceremony.  Watch William being presented with his wings » . William, 25, is already a second lieutenant in the British Army, where he serves in the Household Cavalry (Blues and Royals). Since January, he has been on a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force designed to give the future king experience with the various branches of the military. William plans to complete a similar attachment with the Royal Navy later in the year, according to his office at Clarence House. During his time with the RAF, William learned to fly three different aircraft: a Grob 115E light aircraft, the faster Tucano T1 plane, and a Squirrel helicopter. The prince was only eight days into his flying course when he made his first solo flight, Clarence House said. At the time, William described it as ""an amazing experience."" ""Going solo is one of those things -- if you had a list of the top 50 things to do before you die, it would be in there,"" he said in January. Clarence House said it was William's ""lifetime ambition"" to learn to fly. After the ceremony, he will be known in the RAF as Flying Officer Wales. Prince Charles earned his wings more than 35 years ago at the same air force base, graduating as a Flight Lieutenant. William's uncle, the Duke of York, flew Sea King helicopters during the Falklands War in 1982. E-mail to a friend .","Britain's Prince William due to receive his Royal Air Force pilot's wings .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York police have made an arrest in the case of an Ecuadorian immigrant beaten to death in an apparent anti-Latino and antigay hate crime in December, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced Wednesday. Jose Sucuzhanay was beaten after leaving a party at a church. Police arrested Hakim Scott, 25, on Tuesday and charged him with second degree murder as a hate crime. Police are still looking for a second suspect. On December 7, 2008, police say Jose Sucuzhanay and his brother Romel had left a party at a church and were embracing each other to keep warm in the cold when Scott and another man approached them in a car in Brooklyn's Bushwick section, about a block from the brothers' home. Police say the two assailants shouted antigay and anti-Latino vulgarities and attacked the brothers. Scott first assaulted Jose with a beer bottle before chasing after Romel, police said. The second assailant proceeded to ""savagely beat Jose about his ribs, shoulders,"" head and back with an aluminum bat, according to Kelly. Jose Sucuzhanay, 31, died of his injuries in December hours before his mother arrived in New York from Ecuador. Romel Sucuzhanay, 34, suffered minor scrapes. Police were able to identify two suspects after inferring that they had crossed the Triborough Bridge in the course of their flight from the crime scene. They interviewed bridge toll booth employees and combed through videotape of cars passing through cash-only lanes on the bridge. Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said the incident should send a message that antigay violence endangers straights and gays alike. ""If there was ever a message to the people of this city or anywhere as to why heterosexuals have to stand up and not permit this type of violence ... it is this case,"" Hynes said.","Hakim Scott, 25, charged with 2nd degree murder in New York case .

"(CNN) -- The slayings of two super-yacht staff within two weeks have shaken the luxury yacht industry and sparked calls for crews to exercise extreme caution. Australian luxury yacht captain Drew Gollan was killed in January in English Harbor, Antigua. Both slayings occurred in popular yachting destinations in the Caribbean and involved violent attacks. Last week, U.S. luxury yacht chef Sara Kuszak, of Savannah, Georgia, was killed after being abducted during a morning run in Puerto Rico. The body of Kuszak, who was five months pregnant, was found with a slashed throat in a field. A local man has been arrested by police in connection with the incident. On January 22, Australian Drew Gollan, captain of Perini Navi yacht Perseus, was shot dead in what was described as a ""failed robbery"" in English Harbor, Antigua. Gollan, 38, was described as a ""widely respected member of the yachting community."" His death came less than a year after the double killing of a British couple on the island. Suspects have been arrested and charged with murder in both cases. Antigua, in particular, is highly dependent on the luxury yacht industry to boost its local economy -- and it appears news of the crimes is already having a negative impact. In a press release, the Antigua Charter Yacht Meeting acknowledged that ""a number of boats have decided to leave Antigua in the wake of this incident."" Further reports from yachting magazine SuperYachtWorld suggest several captains on the island have also decided to leave. Meanwhile, luxury yacht staff who are remaining in the Caribbean have been urged by industry Web site yotcru.com to ""exercise vigilant personal safety at all times."" After the death of Gollan, local Antigua politicians and yacht industry representatives held an emergency meeting to discuss the problem. At the meeting, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, Baldwin Spencer, said: ""Antigua is still a safe place to be. It's an unfortunate situation, however we are all hoping that justice will be done,"" SuperYachtWorld reported. Spencer also pledged new security efforts to help prevent future crimes. An international charter company manager and luxury yacht industry expert, Els Bucknell, said yacht crews and clients were ""shocked and saddened"" by the deaths, and there would likely be a short-term impact on the Caribbean region. ""Most people assumed that this part of Antigua was safe and I think it has come as a shock,"" she said. ""Some boats have already left and I think you will see some of that."" However, Bucknell felt the incident would not affect the region in the long term. ""People do forget about these things over time ... and the local business people with police and other authorities have made a serious attempt to make it safer. ""The economy being the way it is has more to do with how business operates than these kind of things,"" she said.","Australian captain Drew Gollan shot dead in Antigua on January 22 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly seven years after the remains of federal intern Chandra Levy were found in a Washington park, a jailed laborer from El Salvador faces a murder charge in her death, authorities said Tuesday. Ingmar Guandique is serving a 10-year sentence for two assaults in the park where Levy's body was found. A judge on Tuesday signed an arrest warrant for Ingmar Guandique, 27, who is serving a 10-year sentence for two assaults in Rock Creek Park that occurred around the time of Levy's disappearance. Her remains were found in Rock Creek Park about a year after she was reported missing. ""We believe Levy was a random victim of Guandique, who attacked and killed her as she jogged in Rock Creek Park,"" said Jeffrey Taylor, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Guandique's public defenders said the case was far from over, and urged the public not to jump to conclusions. ""This flawed investigation, characterized by the many mistakes and missteps of the Metropolitan Police Department and every federal agency that has attempted to solve this case, will not end with the simple issuance of an arrest warrant against Mr. Guandique,"" the federal public defender's office said in a statement ...  We look forward to trying this case before unbiased jurors who will not rush to judgment."" Guandique faces a first-degree murder charge. A conviction on the charge would bring a mandatory sentence of 30 to 60 years in prison, Taylor said. The massive publicity surrounding the Levy case was largely a result of her romantic affair to then-Rep. Gary Condit, a California Democrat. Police questioned Condit many times in connection with the slaying, but the congressman was never considered a suspect.  Watch the police announce arrest » . A California native working as an intern for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Levy, 24, disappeared May 1, 2001. Her remains were found in May 2002 by a man walking his dog in a remote area of the park. Guandique has been imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution-Victorville, a medium-security facility northeast of Los Angeles, California. Officials hope to transfer him from California to the nation's capital in 45 to 60 days. He's serving his sentence on the two assault convictions in California because there are no prisons in the District of Columbia. Those convicted of federal crimes in the capital are sent to various federal prisons across the country. Guandique was considered a person of interest in 2002 in connection with Levy's death, authorities said Tuesday. Before the new charges, his projected release date from prison was October 5, 2011. According to officials at Tuesday's news conference -- and the affidavit supporting the arrest warrant for Guandique -- circumstantial evidence played a large role in the case. Authorities presented no evidence Tuesday of anyone seeing Guandique and Levy together.  Timeline of Levy's disappearance » . But the affidavit said a witness reported seeing and running from a man in the park, and she said she believed that occurred on the same day as Levy disappeared. Upon seeing a photograph of Guandique in the interim, the woman thought he looked like the man who followed her in the park, the affidavit said. Another witness reported seeing Guandique with ""a fat lip and scratches on his face"" about the time of Levy's disappearance, the affidavit said. The witness added that Guandique said he was injured by his girlfriend during an argument. Interviewed by police, Guandique's girlfriend at the time said that while he was violent with her on occasion, ""at no time during any of the arguments or fights did [she] ever strike Guandique or cause any injuries to his face or neck."" Two other witnesses reported that Guandique told them he committed crimes against women, including rape and murder, according to the affidavit. And another witness last month told police Guandique admitted his involvement in Levy's killing, as well as that he tried to rape two other women in the park at knifepoint, the affidavit said. When news emerged last month that Guandique's arrest was imminent in the Levy case, the same witness told police Guandique ""became very anxious and said something to the effect of, '[Expletive], it's over. They got me now. What am I gonna do?' "" Authorities searching Guandique's cell in California in September found a photograph of Levy that apparently had been taken from a magazine, the affidavit said. Speaking last month as news emerged that an arrest in the case was imminent, Levy's mother, Susan, said, ""It's a bittersweet situation for me as the mother of a daughter who is no longer here. I want justice. I want to know that the person who did it is in jail and will not do it to anybody else."" She added, ""Every day the elephant is there. Every day you get a knot in your stomach. It doesn't go away. It's a life sentence for the families and relatives that miss their loved ones. We have a life sentence of hurt.""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A longtime employee and vault manager for a jewelry company in Long Island City, New York, stole millions of dollars worth of gold and gold jewelry from her employer over a six-year span, the Queens district attorney has alleged. Teresa Tambunting, 50, of Scarsdale, New York, is accused of stealing as much as $12 million from Jacmel Jewelry, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a statement Wednesday. At an arraignment Wednesday, she did not enter a plea to charges of first-degree grand larceny and first-degree criminal possession of stolen property, the district attorney's office said. She was released on $100,000 bail and will return to court May 19, the office said. Her attorney, David Kirby, did not return phone calls seeking comment. Tambunting, who worked for Jacmel for 28 years, has returned about $7 million worth of gold, but $4 million remains missing, according to Brown. ""The defendant is accused of establishing a virtual mining operation in Long Island City which siphoned off millions of dollars' worth of the precious metal from her employer,"" Brown said. Police say Tambunting -- whose job responsibilities involved monitoring the vault in which fine gold, finished products and raw materials were stored -- confessed that for several months last year, she hid gold in makeshift slits in her purse. An inventory in January revealed that as much as $12 million in merchandise was missing, Brown said in the written statement. After an investigation, Tambunting arrived at the jewelry company's offices wheeling a suitcase containing about 66 pounds of gold, an estimated $868,000, the district attorney's office said. In February, about 450 pounds of gold was taken from her residence, the office said. Tambunting became vault manager in 1991, the office said. The dates of the alleged thefts were not immediately clear. The value of the gold returned fluctuates because of the rise and fall of gold prices. However, the charges are based on what Jacmel claims it lost: $3 to $12 million, according to the Queens district attorney. Jewelry manufacturer owners often find themselves in precarious circumstances when protecting their companies from thievery, said Benjamin Mark, who owned a jewelry manufacturing company in New York for 20 years. ""Unless you have metal detectors where every single employee removes their shoes and belts, you can't be certain,"" said Mark, who now operates a one-man business. ""Stealing jewelry is relatively simple."" Jacmel Jewelry is one of the country's largest manufacturers and distributors of popular price jewelry, according to its Web site. It employs more than 1,000 people worldwide, according to its president, Jack Rahmey. Rahmey said he is cooperating with authorities. Tambunting faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.","Vault manager worked for Jacmel Jewelry for 28 years .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- More than $20 million from dozens of clients is unaccounted for in the aftermath of what police say was a murder-suicide by the attorney who invested the money, according to a source with direct knowledge of deceased lawyer William Parente's financial dealings. Police say Stephanie Parente's father killed his family and himself in a Baltimore hotel Monday. Some investors fear their entire life savings have been wiped out, said the source, who based the $20 million amount on knowledge of Parente's finances. Some other investors are missing what could amount to another $7 million, CNN has learned, so the total of missing money tied to Parente could be upwards of $27 million. Baltimore County, Maryland, police say Parente, 59, killed his family before committing suicide. The bodies of Parente, his wife and their two daughters were found in a hotel room in Towson, Maryland, on Monday. The source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive financial information involved, said one investor had been involved with Parente for more than 15 years, receiving regular monthly payments from Parente until April 16, four days before the bodies were found. The source said Parente solicited personal loans from clients at high interest, promising to use the money for bridge financing of real estate projects such as shopping centers. The source did not know whether Parente, of Garden City, New York, had actually used the money for any legitimate investments. The source, who knew Parente for more than 15 years, described him as ""serious, somber and conservative."" Parente told investors he was generating returns of more than 13 percent even in down markets, according to the source. Investors were not given investment statements and were not charged a management fee, but Parente did provide notices informing investors that he owed them money, according to the source. In other developments Friday, police said Parente bought a set of knives from a Crate and Barrel store in Towson, and one of the knives is believed to be the one Parente later used to take his own life. Baltimore County police said that knife is being tested as evidence in the murder/suicide case. Investigators say they found a receipt for the knife in the hotel room where the deaths took place, and the time stamped on the receipt was 5:25 p.m. Sunday. Police have said Parente's wife, Betty, 58, and daughters Catherine, 11, and Stephanie, 19, were killed by asphyxiation and blunt force trauma Sunday afternoon. Authorities said Parente took a call about midnight Sunday from his elder daughter's college roommate asking whether she was returning to her dormitory. Police believe Parente's daughter was already dead. He told the roommate his daughter was spending the night at the hotel with the family. Also Friday, other details emerged about some of Parente's other clients. One of Parente's investors was Queens lawyer Bruce Montague, and Montague's office has heard from 10 Parente clients whose investments are unaccounted for. Together, those clients had invested about $7 million. Through a law partner, Craig Gardy, Montague said he is missing $450,000. The clients are from New York, New Jersey, California and Florida, according to Montague's office. The office has referred those clients to the FBI. Gardy said Montague, who considered Parente to be a personal friend, remains too devastated about the deaths to provide details himself, but he authorized his partners to speak on his behalf. The scenario as given by his partners was that after the Bernard Madoff scandal broke last fall, Montague got ""cold feet"" and repeatedly asked Parente for his investment money back. On April 16, Montague tried to deposit a check from Parente for $245,000. On Tuesday, April 21, when Montague's bank notified him the check did not clear, he called Chase bank, where Parente's funds were held. Montague was told Parente's account was empty, according to Gardy, and it would be useless to deposit other checks received from Parente. Then Montague called the New York attorney general's office. He called the attorney general's office again after he learned about Parente's murder/suicide. Gardy said Montague believed he was investing in real estate notes -- short-term, high-interest loans made to developers, for example, who wanted to circumvent conventional bank loans. Montague did not receive monthly or quarterly statements. Gardy said Montague believed he was making money on interest from those loans and would sometimes get a check when the note was paid off. The FBI is continuing its investigation. Spokesman James Margolin said a number of banks are being contacted. He would not identify them. Funerals for Parente's wife and daughters are scheduled for Tuesday at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Garden City, New York. The funeral home handling arrangements said a separate, private service will be held for William Parente.","Police say William Parente killed wife, 2 daughters and himself .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The federal judge whose husband and mother were slain in their family home in Chicago, Illinois, four years ago was honored Monday by U.S. marshals charged with combating a growing number of threats to the judiciary. Judge Joan Lefkow has advocated improving judicial security since her husband and mother were killed. Judge Joan Lefkow, who eventually returned to the bench, credited the marshals who protect federal judges at work and at home with major improvements in judicial security in the years since her family tragedy. ""It's now four years later, and I do see dawn has broken,"" Lefkow told a crowd of friends and federal officials gathered at the Marshals Service headquarters across the Potomac River from Washington. The improved security -- including home intrusion security systems and coordinated intelligence and threat analysis -- was badly needed, according to both judges and the Marshals Service. The number of threats has increased each year, and is expected to exceed 1,500 this year, up from 1,278 last year. ""We've already had 600 inappropriate communications reported in the first months of this year,"" said Marshals Service spokesman Dave Turner. Whether real threats or hoaxes, every e-mail, phone call, written note and letter -- including some with white powder -- is investigated. The scope and seriousness of the protective effort increased sharply after the Lefkow tragedy. On Tuesday, the Marshals Service dedicated the ""Joan Lefkow Conference Room"" in the new Threat Management Center to the memory of her slain husband, Michael Lefkow, and mother, Donna Humphrey. Judge Lefkow returned home on February 28, 2005, to find them shot to death. The man authorities said was their killer committed suicide 10 days later when he was stopped by police in Wisconsin. The killer was angry that Judge Lefkow had dismissed his medical malpractice case and he sought revenge, police concluded. U.S. Marshals Director John Clark credits Lefkow's advocacy for better security as the catalyst for dramatic changes. ""Because of her courage to speak out and her advocacy for reform in the protection of judges, things started to happen,"" Clark said. He cited congressional funding for home-intrusion alarms in every judge's residence and a sharp increase in funding to hire more threat investigators, protections specialists, analysts and trainers. The threat management center has been open for more than a year. Deputy marshals in the judicial protection effort attribute a growing number of the threats to disgruntled members of what is known as the sovereign citizenship movement. The movement is a loosely organized network of individuals and groups claiming not to be accountable to the federal government. The movement includes tax protesters, white separatists, zealots of fringe religious groups and desperate individuals lashing out at bankruptcy courts or judges who had wronged them. As a result, some judges have been given around-the-clock protective details by deputy marshals. ""While steady progress has been made, we must be ever vigilant and progressive in order to ensure we are providing the best possible protection to our nation's judiciary,"" Clark said.","U.S. Marshals honor federal judge whose husband and mother were killed .

"HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) -- On the tape, Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan appears to burn with rage. Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan, pictured here, allegedly tortured a business associate on videotape. Believing he was cheated in a business deal, the member of the United Arab Emirates ruling family was trying to extract a confession from an Afghan grain dealer. With a private security officer assisting, Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan is seen stuffing sand in the Afghan's mouth. As the grain dealer pleads and whimpers, he is beaten with a nailed board, burned in the genitals with a cigarette lighter, shocked with a cattle prod, and led to believe he would be shot. Salt is poured on his wounds. In the end, the victim can muster up only weak moans as an SUV is repeatedly driven over him. The 45 minutes of torture appears on a nearly three-hour-long videotape shot in late 2004 in the desert outside Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf region. It was made at the direction of the sheikh himself. The tape has been viewed by CNN. Now the tape has surfaced as a piece of evidence in a federal civil suit filed in Houston, Texas, against the sheikh by his former business partner, Bassam Nabulsi. As media, U.S. governmental and human rights questions and concerns emerged, Abu Dhabi's government on Tuesday issued a statement saying it deplored the contents of the video and plans an immediate and comprehensive review of it. Nabulsi, a Lebanese-born U.S. citizen living in Houston, says he met Sheikh Issa when the royal came to Houston for medical care in 1994.   Watch portions of the tape and Nabulsi tell his story » . According to Nabulsi, the men became friends and business partners, and Sheikh Issa eventually recruited Nabulsi to move to Abu Dhabi to work for him. ""We were buddies,"" said Nabulsi, who met with CNN journalists in Houston. ""He gave me his personal vow. He swore to look after my family in case something happened to me."" The sheikh, who holds no official government position, is the half-brother of the country's ruler. In the lawsuit, Nabulsi says was disturbed by the sheikh's ""increasingly bizarre behavior"" after the November 2004 death of his father, UAE ruler Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan. Nabulsi's lawsuit says that Sheikh Issa's father ""kept tight control over Sheikh Issa"" but after the father's death, he ""apparently no longer felt constrained."" Nabulsi claims he confronted his business partner about the Afghan's treatment, telling him that to do such a thing he ""must not be a God-fearing person."" Nabulsi says his boldness prompted the sheikh to turn on him. Later, Nabulsi was arrested on drug charges. Security officers working for the sheikh ransacked his home and demanded the torture video, Nabulsi claimed. By this point, the tape -- shot by Nabulsi's brother at the order of the sheikh -- had been smuggled out of the country. According to an affidavit, Nabulsi's brother worked for Sheikh Issa as a personal assistant. In 2005, Nabulsi was arrested, jailed and ultimately convicted on drug charges. And, he said, he was tortured and humiliated by UAE police, who demanded he return the tape. ""It was a lot of humiliation,"" Nabulsi told CNN. ""And I really don't like to talk about it."" Nabulsi was fined and deported. Darryl Bristow, the sheikh's Houston attorney, argued in court papers that American courts have no jurisdiction over his client. In a statement to CNN, Bristow said Nabulsi is using the videotape of a third party, Nabulsi's brother, to influence the court over a business dispute. ""The public should know that the man behind the camera was Bassam Nabulsi's brother and that Bassam Nabulsi kept the video from the media while his lawyer was asking for money. What do you call that where you come from?"" Bristow asked. Nabulsi's attorney denied wrongdoing. The Houston case languished in the U.S. court system after it was filed in 2006 but it eventually moved forward when the sheikh's personal assistant was served with court papers last year. Nabulsi's attorney, Anthony Buzbee, said he has deposed the sheikh, but the deposition is under seal. The case was filed in Houston because the Sheikh Issa-Nabulsi business partnership was formed and focused in Texas and ""claims at issue in this case arose out of contacts within Texas."" Nabulsi claims breaches of contract and fiduciary duty. He wants $80 million he says is owed to him from their business relationship. He also wants to be awarded punitive damages for torture, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and malicious prosecution. Initially, the UAE Interior Ministry said Sheikh Issa ""does not hold any official position"" in the government and that Nabulsi's lawsuit is ""a private dispute."" Asked about the torture allegations, the UAE said it investigated and found ""...all rules, policies and procedures were followed correctly by the police department. The review also concluded that the incidents depicted in the videotapes were not part of a pattern of behavior."" The shocking case has made waves recently as news organizations asked about the tape. U.S. senior officials familiar with the case say the administration is holding off sending a nuclear deal with the United Arab Emirates to Congress for ratification because they fear a fallout from the torture story. Congress has to ratify the civil nuclear agreement signed in January between the Bush administration and the UAE. Those senior U.S. officials said the agreement was supposed to be sent to the Senate, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held off doing so because of the story's sensitivity. One American lawmaker, Rep. James McGovern, D-Massachusetts, asked Clinton to investigate and that all ""expenditures of funds, training, sales or transfers of equipment or technology, including nuclear"" to the UAE be put on hold until the matter is reviewed. He also wants the United States to deny any visas for travel by Sheikh Issa or his immediate family. ""I think we have an obligation to say we want to step back a bit and look at this a little more closely,"" said McGovern, co-chairman of the congressional human rights commission. He promised hearings on the issue, probing the case and how the U.S. Embassy in the UAE handled it. ""I am not going to let it go away,"" McGovern said. Human Rights Watch, the humanitarian watchdog group, is calling for the United Arab Emirates to ""investigate and prosecute"" the grain dealer's torture. With media questions about the tape mounting, Abu Dhabi said on Wednesday it decided to renew its inquiries -- more than four years after the incident. As for the grain dealer, UAE officials say he survived the ordeal, and said the sheikh and the grain dealer settled the matter privately by agreeing not to bring formal charges against the other. How much money was the grain dealer accused of stealing from the sheikh? ""It's nothing,"" Nabulsi said. ""No more than about $5,000."" CNN's Scott Bronstein, Drew Griffin, Stan Grant, Elise Labott, Octavia Nasr, and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Former business partner of Sheikh Issa of Abu Dhabi suing royal .

"(CNN) -- Paul Goydos pulled ahead of overnight co-leader Justin Leonard to move into a three-stroke lead at the halfway point of the Valero Texas Open. Goydos posted six birdies to hold a three-stroke lead after 36 holes of the Texas Open. The American had begun the day tied on seven-under-par with former Open champion Leonard, a Texas native, who started early at the par-70, 6,896-yard Resort Course at La Cantera and followed his first-round 63 with a two-under 68 to move to nine-under. Goydos set off in pursuit later in the day and got off to a bad start with a bogey on his first hole at the par-four 10th. But it was to be the only blemish on his card as the 2008 Players Championship runner-up knocked off six birdies for a five-under 65 to get to 12- under-par. ""Another good day,"" Goydos told reporters afterwards. ""Really only had one mediocre shot all day, and that was on the first hole. I made bogey, and after that I played reasonably well."" Mathias Gronberg led a Swedish charge in San Antonio, opening the day on four-under and going one better with a second-round 65 to take a share of the clubhouse lead with Leonard on nine-under. American Ted Purdy improved by three strokes with a 67 while his compatriots John Mallinger, with a 64, and Scott Sterling, who posted a 63, made it a five-way tie overnight for second place.","Paul Goydos leads by three strokes after the second round of the Texas Open .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- A Thai judge fined dozens of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges of illegal entry after escaping from their own country a month ago -- amid allegations that other Rohingya have been dumped at sea by the Thai army. Male refugees show scars they say were caused by beatings at the hands of the Myanmar navy. The Ranong Provincial Court judge ordered each of the 66 ethnic Muslim refugees to pay 1,000 Thai baht (less than $30). He imposed the fines via a closed-circuit television link to Ranong Provincial Prison, where the refugees will continue to be held until they can pay the court. Twelve additional refugees, all teenagers, were being detained at a police station and are exempt from prosecution. The 78 refugees will be handed over on January 31 to immigration police, who will deport them. It is unclear where they will be sent. The refugees arrived by boat on the Thai shore, and Thai police said many had severe burns from a fire that broke out on board their craft after it left neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma. Members of Myanmar's Rohingya minority have been fleeing the country for years, saying they are persecuted by its military government. One refugee, who called himself Mohamed, told CNN that their boat had been at sea for a month, and that Myanmar's military had detained and attacked them before setting their boat on fire. The refugees are unwelcome in Thailand, where authorities say about 20,000 have settled illegally. Other boatloads of Rohingya have allegedly been set adrift after being towed out to sea by Thai authorities. A recent CNN investigation found evidence of such activity. Photos obtained by CNN include one that shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees.  Watch Dan Rivers' BackStory on the investigation » . CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few who had survived after a group of six rickety boats was towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities earlier this month. The Thai government has launched an inquiry. The Thai army has denied the allegations. But after extensive questioning by CNN, one source in the Thai military confirmed that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. The source defended it, saying that each boatload of refugees is given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source said Thai villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and they had accused the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. The Thai government has said that ""there is no reasonable ground to believe"" that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar because of persecution. ""Their profile and their seasonal travel further support the picture that they are illegal migrants, and not those requiring international protection,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Tuesday. One of the refugees who came ashore Tuesday said they will be killed if returned to Myanmar because of their minority status. He said the Rohingya are stateless because they lack bribe money to obtain identification cards in Myanmar. In Tuesday's statement, the Thai government said it deals with all illegal migrants in accordance with its laws and international guidelines. It said ""basic humanitarian needs"" such as food and water are met among the migrants before they are returned home. Their boats also are fixed, officials said. The Thai government said that ""accepting those arriving in an irregular manner would simply encourage new arrivals."" The government denied media reports alleging that Thai authorities mistreat the illegal migrants and intentionally damage their boats.

"MEMPHIS, Tennessee (CNN) -- When James Earl Ray bought a white Mustang in the summer of 1967, he stood on a streetcorner in downtown Birmingham, Alabama, and pulled the cash out of his shirt pocket, $2,000 in all. James Earl Ray paid $2,000 cash for a white Mustang, similar to this one, the seller told the FBI. ""Mostly twenties, with some $100 bills,"" the seller would later tell the FBI about the sale to Ray, later convicted of assassinating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""He must have had a roll of twenties, if he paid that guy $2,000 in twenties, that'd be a lot of money,"" said Jerry Ray, James Earl Ray's brother. Police Capt. John Light, who was chief of detectives that year in Ray's hometown of Alton, Illinois, suspects the wad of money came from a still-unsolved bank robbery. While Ray was on the run as a prison escapee from Missouri that summer, two men walked into the Bank of Alton with a pistol and a sawed-off shotgun. Both wore stocking masks. The leaner man went behind the counter, scooped up the cash and fled with close to $30,000.  Ray, King crossed paths before shooting »  Within a day or two of that robbery, Ray would leave the area and head to Canada -- just as he did almost a year later when he fled the scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after King's murder. Light told CNN the stolen bank money consisted mainly of $20 bills. The partially burned shotgun and the stocking masks were found abandoned in a wooded area near a cemetery where Ray's mother is buried. Ray returned from Canada and bought the Mustang after seeing a classified ad in Birmingham the month after the robbery. In the months to come, Ray would keep spending $20 bills. When Ray underwent plastic surgery in Los Angeles 30 days before King's death, he paid in cash -- denomination unknown. When he drove back to Birmingham six days before the murder to buy a .30-06 high-powered hunting rifle for just under $250, the gun store salesman later told investigators, ""I remember he paid for the gun with $20 bills, paid cash."" On April 4, 1968, only hours before King would die, the landlady at the boarding house where Ray rented a room told police, ""He gave me a $20 bill"" when he paid for a week's rent just across the street from the Lorraine Motel. In the sporting goods store where Ray went to buy binoculars, the salesman told police, ""He gave me two twenties; I think he had two twenties left... The bills came out of his right pocket, neatly folded, and nothing but bills."" For Light, the bank holdup is the most likely answer to the question of where Ray got the money to travel as a fugitive to Canada and Mexico, then to flee again to Canada and finally London, England, after King's murder. ""Thirty-thousand dollars back in 1967 was a lot of money,"" Light said. In London, Ray ran short of money. Four days before he was caught, he robbed a bank. His thumbprint was found on the holdup note. He got little more than $200 -- enough to buy an airline ticket to Brussels, Belgium, where he hoped to join mercenaries fighting to keep white rule in southern Africa. He was stopped at a London airport when a police sergeant spotted his phony Canadian passport. Ray lived very cheaply on the run. He got change back for his $20 bill at the Memphis boarding house -- a week's rent there was $8.50. The original prosecutors in the Memphis case decided it would not have cost that much for all of Ray's travels. ""He was living on a dollar to two dollars a day,"" said current prosecutor John Campbell. ""He was even darning his own socks to be able to save money.""","Police: James Earl Ray's money came from a bank robbery in his hometown .

"(CNN) -- Now it's the Republicans' turn. Charlie Daniels will headline a concert Wednesday in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. The Democrats turned out the star power for its convention in Denver, Colorado, right up to the final night, when the 80,000-strong crowd attending Sen. Barack Obama's closing speech at Invesco Field was serenaded by Sheryl Crow and Stevie Wonder, among others. The Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, may not have the same oomph, but it won't lack for well-known visitors. After mixing and mingling in Denver with Democrats, the nonpartisan Creative Coalition is scheduled to join the festivities in the Twin Cities. The organization is devoted to arts advocacy as well as issues such as health care and affordable housing. Its spokespeople include Warren Beatty, Dana Delany, Tim Daly, Giancarlo Esposito and Matthew Modine. The group is showing a film, ""14 Women,"" about the 14 female senators of the 109th Congress. Creative Coalition Executive Director Robin Bronk told The Hollywood Reporter that the organization was determined to present some steak with its celebrity sizzle. iReport.com: Share your photos, videos from around the Republican Convention . ""We have a great track record of bringing substance with splash,"" she said. The group is sponsoring a Charlie Daniels Band concert on Wednesday. The Black Eyed Peas played the group's Denver show. Retail chain Target is co-sponsor of both shows. Also in Minneapolis: a show titled ""The Songwriters Circle: The Songs We Love,"" which will feature performances by Brett James (who wrote ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"") and Greg Laswell (""What a Day""), according to RollingStone.com. The show is sponsored the The Recording Academy and its GRAMMY Foundation. Among other celebrities expected to be present are the Beach Boys -- who will be headlining a concert of their own Monday -- Gretchen Wilson and Sammy Hagar. However, one of the GOP's biggest celebrity names, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, may not make the trip. Schwarzenegger has said that state business may keep him in Sacramento. Not every event will be sanctioned by the convention, of course. The politically active band Rage Against the Machine, which played a free show in Denver, has scheduled a Minneapolis concert, though it's far from free: Tickets are $60 for the show at the Target Center on Wednesday. Rage guitarist Tom Morello is also teaming with Steve Earle for a union rally on Labor Day. There are also several arts-related events in a lower key. According to The New York Times, artists will be coming to Minneapolis-St. Paul to mount various forms of political theater, from creating ice sculptures to inviting the public to perform karaoke versions of convention speeches. Though some of the exhibits will be politically pointed, organizers are careful to characterize them as nonpartisan -- and expect some unusual discourse. ""You expect people to respond by organizing a protest and throwing their fists in the air, and you also expect people to respond by flying 1,000 American flags,"" Sarah Peters of Minneapolis' Walker Art Center, which is taking part in that city's ""UnConvention,"" told the Times. ""And those are two legitimate ways to respond to politics, but there is a whole in-between area that doesn't get talked about.""","GOP convention to include celebrities, some performing, others visiting .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Actor, author and Parkinson's disease activist Michael J. Fox spoke with CNN's ""Larry King Live"" to be aired Thursday. Michael J. Fox: ""I still travel with my kids, and I'm with them part of the day, every day."" In the interview, Fox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 1991, talks about his new book, which he describes as ""a memoir of the last 10 years."" In it, he explores the nature of optimism. He also talked about his family, a new approach to acting and President Obama's lifting of a ban on stem cell research, among other things. Here are some excerpts from the show. Larry King: He's founder of The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. He's a best-selling author -- the new book is ""Always Looking Up."" By the way, he has got an ABC special, ""Michael J. Fox: Adventures of an Incurable Optimist."" It airs on May 7. You remain -- is it easy to be an optimist? Michael J. Fox: Well, for me it's second nature. It's just the way I look at life. And it's certainly a challenge now for most people to be optimistic, obviously, with all of the troubles we have and the problems that the country is facing. But I think it's exactly in those times when our optimism kicks in highest gear. I think -- there's an expression that I like that I always use: ""Don't wish for a lighter load, wish for broader shoulders."" And I think that people are really -- I see a lot of broader shoulders these days, people are really working on the delts, you know? King: What was it like when you were diagnosed? Fox: Well, you know, it's hard to describe it, because I was so young, I was 29 years old. And so Parkinson's is not what you expect to hear. I had a twitch in my pinky and I figured it was some kind of nerve damage or I'd done something probably athletic. ... But then I got this diagnosis, and I thought the guy was kidding. And then it was shock, and then I had a certain amount of fear and I started to react to it in certain ways. I started drinking more heavily as a way of self-medicating it. And it took me -- you know, it's funny, because I sit and talk about ""Always Looking Up"" and being optimistic, and accept the losses and move on or find new gains, but it took me about seven years, I think, to really get to the point where I could tell people about it. ... I was diagnosed in '91, and it wasn't until '98 that I admitted publicly that it was a situation I was facing. King: It is not life-threatening, is it? Fox: No. And I would say you don't die from it, but you -- up to now, you'll definitely die with it if you have it. ... King: Why did you write the book? Fox: The book was -- I wrote the first book because I had to, I think I had to kind of tell that story just for myself, just kind of to acknowledge all of the work that I had done on getting through that journey. And then this book was -- I thought about writing another, and I thought about people responding so positively to the optimism in the first book. And so many people wanted to talk to me about that. So I thought, well, optimism: What is optimism? And so I started to think about it more kind of empirically, writing a book about optimism as a subject, and interviewing researchers about it and talking to people who are optimistic and traveling to places where people are optimistic and all of this stuff. ... So I had to kind of tell it -- I couldn't tell, talk about optimism without -- and separate it from my experience. I had to make it part of my experience. So then, having done that, and written this book, which is really a memoir of the last 10 years, I still have these questions about optimism. So I went to ABC and I said, 'There was a thing I was going to do a book on, but I'd like to do a documentary special on.' And they said, great. And so we've been traveling around, talking to optimists. We went to Bhutan, which is a country in the Himalayas that actually measures its gross national happiness along with its GDP. King: Really? Fox: Yes. And it makes decisions on its development as a country based on how to affect the happiness of the people. And the people are uniformly happy. It's amazing. ... King: Speaking of optimism, in March, President Obama lifted the ban on federal financing for embryonic stem cell research. You've long fought for that. You've got to feel like a -- it has come true. ...  Watch Fox's talk about the lifting of the ban » . King: When you act, is it hard? Fox: Oh, yes. I don't have any access to the same tool kit that I always had. But it's like anything. It's like, you find new ways of doing things. And in those new ways, you maybe are able to do things you couldn't do before in ways you might not have approached before. And that's my whole kind of philosophy of life is -- in dealing with Parkinson's or any kind of setback or loss, is that if you avoid it or it creates a hole that you try to fill up with other stuff, with your ego and your needs and your wants and your control issues, then you're just going to dig deeper in a hole. But if you just recognize, 'look, it is what it is' -- now what's around it? I mean, the only thing that I don't have a choice about is whether I have Parkinson's. Everything else I have a choice about. ... Fox explains how he handles the bad days » . King: Parts of your book are a love letter to your wife, Tracy. Without being saccharine, how important has she been? Fox: I couldn't have made the journey that I've made without her. And certainly I wouldn't have this family that I have. And three-quarters of our children were born after the diagnosis. And we knew what we were facing, what we were dealing with, and had some sense of what the prospects were, although they've turned out a lot better than we could have imagined. I mean, I'm 20 years after diagnosis, and there's very little that I don't do now that I used to do. I still travel with my kids, and I'm with them part of the day, every day. King: How old are they now? Fox: My oldest is 19 -- he'll be 20 next month. And the twins are going into high school next year; they are 14. And then I have a 7-year-old.","Fox gratified Obama lifted ban on federal money for embryonic stem cell research .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Ethiopian immigrant with a history of mental health problems is in custody after being accused of mailing a letter with HIV-tainted blood to Barack Obama when he was president-elect, according to court records. Police say blood-stained letters were addressed to President Obama and top aide Rahm Emanuel. Saad Bedrie Hussein told investigators that he is an admirer of Obama and that the letter -- containing his photo, an admission ticket to Obama's election night victory party in Chicago's Grant Park and six index cards containing writing and reddish stains -- was his way of seeking government help and tickets to Obama's inauguration. Hussein, who has HIV, said he ""purposely cut one of his fingers with a razor so he could bleed on the letter,"" according to an affidavit by Terry L. Cullivan, an investigator with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The letter, postmarked December 27 and written in an Ethiopian language, was addressed to Obama at the Illinois Department on Aging in Springfield, Illinois. When the letter was opened two days later, it was found to contain an orange powder, Cullivan said. A state employee then took the letter to another state office, resulting in a two-hour lockdown of the building, affecting more than 300 people, the affidavit says. During an interview, Hussein was unable to remember what the orange powder was, but tests revealed it to be a drink-mix powder, the affidavit says. According to the affidavit, during a December 29 interview, Hussein denied mailing any additional letters. But, the affidavit said, two days later, the Illinois Department of Revenue notified him it had received two similar letters, both with Hussein's return address. One was addressed to the Illinois Department on Aging, and the second to ""Emanuel,"" which investigators believe was intended for Obama aide Rahm Emanuel. Both letters contained what appeared to be dried blood and an orange powder. The criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Illinois alleges that Hussein ""knowingly mailed"" the letters containing HIV-infected blood ""with the intent to kill or injure another."" In January, a federal judge ordered a mental evaluation of Hussein, saying ""there is reasonable cause to believe [Hussein] may ... be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent [and] unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him."" According to court records, Hussein was arrested March 29, 2006, by Chicago police after setting a fire in the middle of a Chicago intersection, waving a Quran in the air and yelling ""Allah[u] Akbar"" -- Allah is great -- and other words. Hussein ""created a standstill in the traffic and refused to comply"" with police commands, Cullivan's affidavit says. Hussein's attorney, public defender Robert J. Scherschlight, could not immediately be reached for comment. U.S. Postal Service Inspector Peter Rendina said this is the second known case in which a person is alleged to have sent HIV-tainted blood through the mail for malicious reasons. In the other case, which is ongoing, a man sent blood to a person he thought was a business associate.","Affidavit: HIV-positive man ""cut one of his fingers ... so he could bleed on the letter""

"(CNN) -- This holiday season, it's still shoes off and liquids out at airport security, but changes may be on the way to part of this routine, and agents will be watching much more than the contents of your carry-on. Passengers prepare for a security screening at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. In the coming months, the government expects to revisit its rule for the amount of liquids that may be brought aboard planes, while boosting the number of behavior detection officers deployed at checkpoints across the country. More than 2,000 are already on the job, and the program is growing every day, said Christopher White, a spokesman for the Transportation Security Administration. ""What the officers are looking for are physiological signs that cannot be manipulated that indicate stress, fear or deception,"" White said. ""We find bad people everyday with behavior detection officers."" The specially trained agents, who work in teams, establish a baseline of behavior and then search for people who rise above that level, he added. The TSA has been taking steps to reduce stress for all travelers at security, such as adding special family lanes, to make it easier for the officers to spot passengers who are acting suspiciously. ""By calming the checkpoint down, it makes people with potential hostile intent really stand out,"" White said. ""If there's a shark fin in a rough sea, it's impossible to see. If there's a shark fin in a lake, it's very easy to see."" The word on liquids . Meanwhile, new technology may help change a familiar part of the security screening process. By now, most air travelers know the government's 3-1-1 rule for liquids and gels: Containers no larger than 3 ounces are allowed in carry-on luggage, provided they are packed into one quart-size clear plastic zip-top bag, with one bag allowed per person. Those restrictions could be eased next year with the help of advanced X-ray machines that can be upgraded with software, like computers, White said. ""Scientists at the national labs have been working to develop an algorithm to plug into the machines that would allow us to tell the difference between a bottle of Coke and a bottle of liquid explosives,"" he said. The TSA is planning to have 600 of the machines installed at airports across the country by the end of this year and may look at changes to the 3-1-1 rule in fall 2009, White added. Coming much sooner: the expansion of the family lane program to every airport in the country starting Thursday.  See where the nation's busiest airports are » . The special lanes are designed to make security screening as smooth as possible for people traveling with children, passengers with special needs or anyone unfamiliar with security procedures, while improving wait times for other travelers. What's not changing for the foreseeable future: taking your shoes off at security. Running them through the X-ray machine is simply the fastest way of ensuring there's nothing hidden inside, White said. Preparation and planning . If you are flying this Thanksgiving, expect lots of company but fewer people than last year. The Air Transport Association of America predicts a 10 percent drop in the number of people traveling on U.S. airlines during the holiday, compared with the same time period in 2007. ""Some of the capacity cuts that carriers put into place have finally taken effect, but also we do think that the economic downturn is finally taking a toll on consumer spending when it comes to travel,"" ATA spokeswoman Elizabeth Merida said. The trade association for U.S. airlines predicts that the busiest travel days of this Thanksgiving holiday will be Wednesday, November 26; Sunday, November 30; and Monday, December 1, with planes 90 percent full on average on those dates. Airports across the country are gearing up for the travel rush. ""We are making a commitment that even during peak periods, the [security] line will not exceed 20 minutes,"" said Ben DeCosta, aviation general manager at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia. The world's busiest airport has spent more than $25 million on improvements, including 10 additional ""high-productivity, speedy"" security lanes for a total of 32, he added. Hartsfield-Jackson also offers a number of queuing options for the more than 40,000 people who line up at its security checkpoints every day. ""Our line management segregates people by expertise and by preference, and it helps to speed everything up and to make people less anxious about the beginning of their trip,"" DeCosta said. Hartsfield-Jackson is also joining the growing number of U.S. airports with whole-body imagers at security checkpoints. The machines offer an alternative to pat-downs by officers. No matter what airport you're passing through, be prepared, White said. ""If you're ready for security with your boarding pass and your ID out, with your shoes and your coat off, and with your liquids out of the carry-on bag, your experience is going to be very good and very pleasant,"" he said. ""For passengers who are not ready, they not only slow down themselves, they slow down the entire checkpoint line.""","Government's 3-1-1 rule for liquids and gels could be eased next year .

"(CNN) -- A diabetes test that measures a person's average blood glucose control over the preceding two to three months is being recommended as the new diagnostic tool for the condition. Diabetics have too much glucose in their blood when the condition is uncontrolled, and must monitor it. A committee of international experts recommended the test, called the the A1C assay, at the American Diabetes Association's 69th Scientific Sessions over the weekend. The report could instigate a change in the way diabetes is diagnosed, the American Diabetes Association said. The A1C assay, which has been used for nearly 30 years to determine how well a patient controls diabetes, is a more stable, reliable diagnostic tool than the techniques currently in use, the authors of the report said. ""This committee that I chaired is recommending that this be used as widely as possible to diagnose diabetes instead of the blood sugar test,"" said Dr. David Nathan, director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and chairman of the committee. The A1C test, which consists of a simple blood test, is also more convenient than the two tests commonly used for diabetes -- the fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test -- the authors said. In the fasting test, the patient does not eat for about 12 to 14 hours before a blood test. In the tolerance test, the patient drinks a sweet solution and has blood drawn two hours later. In addition, Nathan said, ""It probably is better related to the development of eye disease with diabetes, and therefore probably serves as a better diagnostic tool."" The international committee was assembled by the American Diabetes Association, International Diabetes Federation and European Association for the Study of Diabetes, but those organizations have not officially endorsed the report. ""Basically, the American Diabetes Association supports the concept, supports the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes, and just has to look at the implications of it, and the implementation of it,"" said Richard Kahn, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer for the American Diabetes Association, who was part of the committee. Using A1C in diagnosis would be particularly useful for determining whether patients have type 2 diabetes, which is more difficult to diagnose than type 1, said Dr. William Bornstein, assistant professor of endocrinology at Emory University, who was not part of the committee. ""This will be beneficial to the population in terms of helping us more clearly diagnose folks who are at risks for complications and help them manage that earlier,"" Bornstein said. Still, controversy likely will arise over the use of the A1C in diagnostics because of the long, established track record of using the other two methods, Bornstein said. iReport.com: Boxing champ talks about diabetes struggle . How it works . Humans cannot live without having sugar called glucose in their blood. Too much glucose, however, attaches to a variety of proteins in the body and harms them. Uncontrolled diabetes is characterized by too much glucose in the bloodstream. This excess glucose then glycates with -- or sticks to -- a protein called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's cells. The A1C test measures the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood, which is a reflection of average blood glucose control, according to the American Diabetes Association. A1C is a better measure of the problem that diabetes causes than glucose-based tests, at least for monitoring, said David Schoenfeld, professor of biostatistics at Harvard University. He and colleagues, including Nathan and a large group of international researchers, studied the relationship between A1C and average blood glucose. While many diabetics monitor their average blood glucose levels daily, at the doctor's office the patient receives a measurement in terms of hemoglobin A1C, Schoenfeld said. He and researchers created a chart to convert these two measurements, so that patients would not have to interpret two different numbers and feel confused. They concluded in a 2008 paper that, for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, A1C levels can be expressed as average glucose. The international committee concluded that an A1C level of 6.5 percent indicates that a person has diabetes, while values between 6 percent and 6.5 percent are likely to be at highest risk for developing diabetes. Experts note, however, that there is a continuum of risk for complications, and the ""cut-point"" of 6.5 percent should not be considered an absolute dividing line. All adults who are overweight and have additional risk factors, such as family history of diabetes, high blood pressure or abnormal lipid levels, should be screened for diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. Adults aged 45 or older should be tested even if they do not have these risk factors, the association said.","Committee says A1C test is more reliable and convenient than other tests .
Tests in use now are fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance test .
A1C test is currently used for monitoring patients' control of diabetes .
Expert: Report may cause controversy because of track record of using current tests ."
"Editor's Note: Award-winning journalist and best-selling author Carl Bernstein, best known for his reporting work with Bob Woodward about the Watergate scandal, serves as a political analyst for CNN. Most recently, Bernstein wrote ""A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton,"" a detailed portrait of the junior senator from New York and former Democratic presidential candidate. Carl Bernstein says Republicans returned to old themes, including patriotism, to attack Democrats. (CNN) -- Democrats take note: the Republican convention was resolutely on-message Tuesday night, sounding old themes and buzzwords that have worked for the GOP in the past. It's those same themes that John McCain, who once rejected the approach, has now embraced as the only way to the White House. ""The Angry Left,"" ""Liberals,"" ""The Media,"" -- the familiar litany of right-wing Republican demons -- rocked the house in St. Paul, Minnesota. The message: McCain, Sarah Palin and the Republicans are the true party of patriotism, as if the Democrats aren't. In the repetitious theme of the evening, the Republicans would ""Put Country First,"" as if the Democrats wouldn't. The Democrats' first response to the evening, in a statement from the Obama campaign about the GOP's failure to address economic problems in the country, said nothing -- perhaps at its peril -- about the real Republican message. The theme was first sounded by actor Robert Duvall in the short film he narrated; followed by speaker after speaker and later interspersed in filmed tributes to Ronald Reagan and to a Navy Seal hero who died in Iraq. That is the theme invoked as the motif of John McCain's life. Perhaps the most extreme example of the implication that the Republicans have a lock on patriotism and ""Putting Country First"" came in video footage of a first-responder going underwater to rescue occupants of a car that plummeted in the Minneapolis bridge collapse. (No word at the convention about problems of infrastructure in the country -- just people (apparently only Republicans) who would ""Put Country First."" Meanwhile, consistent with the demonizing subtext of this theme, President Bush attacked (rather incongruously, but with plenty of antecedents in Republican history) ""The Angry Left"" -- perhaps an attempt to stigmatize those who would question Sarah Palin's credentials. A quick video tribute to Ronald Reagan referred to ""the media [who] despised him."" Former Sen. Fred Thompson pounded Barack Obama as ""the most liberal"" presidential candidate in history, and brought the convention to its feet. He also warned of losing the Supreme Court to the Democrats and ""liberalism"" (to delirious applause). Thompson said McCain's pick of Palin had thrown the Democrats' ""friends in the media into a state of panic"" (pandemonium in the hall). John McCain, in a different time in his life (i.e. running against George W. Bush for the Republican nomination in 2000), specifically rejected this approach. He courted and charmed the dreaded ""media"" monolith and enunciated a post-partisan vision (yet definitely consistent with conservative orthodoxy on many big questions). McCain also railed against the culture wars that his party and campaign are now intent on stoking as the way to victory. (Remember, only months ago, when the promise of this election was that there were two nominees who understood the enduring damage of the culture wars to the country and its political system?) Will the Republican message on display last night work? It was essential to George W. Bush's defeat of John Kerry and pulled Bush to parity with Al Gore in 2000. George H.W. Bush relied on the approach in 1988. Bill Clinton recognized the strategy, addressed it substantively and forthrightly and buried it. The McCain campaign and the Republican Party of 2008 are betting that Barack Obama won't be nimble enough to repeat Clinton's feat, and that they have found the formula (including putting Palin on the ticket at a moment when the election seemed to be eluding them) to victory. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Tuesday's themes at GOP convention dealt with patriotism, ""Putting Country First""

"(CNN) -- Everything about Jupiter is super-sized, including its colorful, turbulent atmosphere. But there's fresh evidence that one of the planet's most recognizable features, the Great Red Spot, is shrinking. NASA's Cassini spacecraft photographed Jupiter and its Great Red Spot, seen center near the equator, in 2000. The spot, which is actually an ancient monster storm that measures about three Earths across, lost 15 percent of its diameter between 1996 and 2006, scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have found. It shrank by about 1 kilometer (about 0.6 miles) a day during that time period, said Xylar Asay-Davis, a postdoctoral researcher who was part of the study. Astronomers have observed for years that the clouds of the Great Red Spot have been waning, but this newest research focused on the motion of the storm -- a much more reliable way to measure its size, Asay-Davis said. He and fellow Berkeley researchers Philip Marcus, Imke de Pater, Michael Wong and Sushil Shetty developed software that tracked the movement of the spot's cloud patterns over long periods of time. ""It's not just the motion of the spot as a whole object. Within it, it has a very complicated swirl to it -- sort of a thin ring on the outside and then a sort of quiet area in the center -- and that shape of it has been changing over time,"" Asay-Davis said. ""What we actually look at is where the winds are the strongest in the vortex. It's the ring where they're the strongest, and that ring has been shrinking over time."" The findings have been submitted for publication in Icarus, the International Journal of Solar System Studies.  See photos of the other planets and find out what makes them stand out » . What makes it red? The researchers do not know why the storm is shrinking. In fact, little is known about the Great Red Spot at all. Even the exact cause of its distinctive color is a mystery. ""We don't actually know what causes any of the colors on Jupiter,"" said Amy Simon-Miller, chief of the Planetary Systems Lab at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""One of the leading theories is that [the storm] is dredging up stuff from much deeper below in the atmosphere that turns red when it's exposed to sunlight."" The spot isn't always bright red; sometimes it's actually quite pale, Simon-Miller noted. Astronomers have been tracking it since the 1870s, said Glenn Orton, a senior research scientist at NASA'S Jet Propulsion Laboratory who investigates planetary atmospheres. It is possible that the spot may one day disappear, he added. ""It's just a storm that, like many things, has a natural growth and disintegration rate,"" Orton said. Astronomers see a dramatic difference in the spot's shape when comparing photos of Jupiter taken more than a century ago to recent images of the planet. Orton joked that the Great Red Spot used to be so long that its acronym should have stood for the ""Great Red Sausage."" ""I just happened to look at an old picture and said to myself, 'That looks like a breakfast sausage.' It's very long. I mean, if you look at one of those pictures back from then and a picture now, you think, 'My God, this thing is going on a diet,"" Orton said. Now eye-shaped, the spot is expected to become circular by about 2040, he added. Chemical stew . The storm is a fascinating feature on a fascinating planet. It has some of the characteristics of a hurricane on Earth, including a circular motion and strong winds. They're Jupiter-strength inside the spot, with some gusting up to 400 miles per hour, Simon-Miller said. Unlike hurricanes on Earth, which are low-pressure systems, the Great Red Spot is a high-pressure system, so it's more stable -- one of the reasons it has lasted so long, she added. Another factor in its longevity is that there is no land on Jupiter to slow a storm in the way landfalls cause hurricanes to lose steam on Earth. Jupiter's atmosphere of colorful dots, swirls and bands may look like an impressionist painting from above, but it would quickly lose its beauty on closer approach. The clouds visible from space consist of ammonia ice and ammonium hydrosulfide -- a sort of smoggy chemical stew -- and the conditions below are brutal, especially inside the Great Red Spot. ""The winds are so strong, everything would get pulled apart pretty quickly. There's no surface to stand on and look up at it,"" Simon-Miller said. Probes sent by NASA towards the interior of the planet have been crushed by the gas giant's enormous atmospheric pressure. Still, the images of Jupiter and its Great Red Spot mesmerize astronomers. ""The pictures are just so beautiful, and they're different every single time we look,"" Simon-Miller said.","Scientists: Great Red Spot lost 15 percent of its diameter between 1996 and 2006 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The bay pilot who steered a container ship into the San Francisco Bay Bridge in 2007, causing a massive oil spill, pleaded guilty Friday to violating misdemeanor pollution laws and faces up to 10 months in prison, federal prosecutors said. The Korean-flagged Cosco Busan rammed into San Francisco's Bay Bridge on November 7, 2007. Prosecutors dropped felony charges against him. John Joseph Cota, 61, pleaded guilty to violating the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, a law enacted in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.   Cota gave orders to officers controlling the Korean-flagged Cosco Busan as the ship was leaving fog-shrouded San Francisco Bay, California, on November 7, 2007. The 901-foot ship struck fenders around the base of a bridge support tower, rupturing two of the ship's fuel tanks and spilling about 53,000 gallons of oil into the bay. At least 2,000 migratory birds were killed. At the time, officials estimated clean-up costs at $60 million. ""Today's guilty plea is a reminder that the Cosco Busan crash was not just an accident, but a criminal act,"" said John C. Cruden, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""John Cota was an experienced ship pilot that was handsomely compensated for his special knowledge of ships and expertise in local waters. His failure to act prudently under the circumstances caused a major environmental disaster that could have been far worse,"" said Joseph Russoniello, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California. Cota has piloted about 4,000 ships in the bay during his 27-year career, said his attorney, Jeffrey Bornstein. Bonstein said Cota is remorseful and accepts responsibility for his part in the accident. But Bornstein also criticized the accident investigation. He said it was unfair and protected others who also bear responsibility. ""Captain Cota has been vilified by the media, lost his job, will now go to jail for at least 60 days, and still suffers under the weight of crushing civil lawsuits,"" Bornstein said. ""He understands and accepts responsibility for his part in the accident and hopes that others will step forward and accept their roles and responsibilities as well."" Cota will be sentenced to 2 to 10 months in prison and be fined between $3,000 and $30,000, if the plea terms are accepted by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston. Sentencing is scheduled for June 19. Prosecutors said the plea included factual admissions by Cota, including an acknowledgment his negligence ""was a proximate cause of the [oil] discharge."" Cota also admitted that he failed to discuss the planned route with the ship's master or crew as required, or to use the ship's radar in the final approach to the bridge. He also failed to recognize two red triangles on the ship's electronic chart system that marked bridge tower buoys. Attorney Bornstein said the ship's master told Cota the red triangles represented the lights on the bridge, ""which in Capt. Cota's knowledge were at the center of the span. He had no reason to think that the master didn't know what he was talking about."" See the path . As part of the plea agreement with Cota, the government agreed to dismiss false statement charges pending against him. Those charges alleged that Cota failed to disclose his medications on required Coast Guard forms. The court ruled those charges would be tried separately. But Cota admitted in the plea papers filed Friday his 2006 physical exam form failed to disclose some of the medications he was prescribed. Among them were two pain medications, three different drugs prescribed as sleeping aids and an antidepressant prescribed for an off-brand purpose. Bornstein said there is no evidence that medication played any role in the accident. At Friday's hearing, Illston set trial for the remaining defendant in the case, the ship's manager, Fleet Management Ltd. (Hong Kong), for Sept. 14. The charges include acting negligently, killing protected migratory birds, obstructing justice and making false statements by falsifying ship records after the incident.","John Joseph Cota pleads guilty to violating misdemeanor pollution laws .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The debate about using technology to help referees has been re-ignited following a number of controversial decisions in the Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Barcelona. The Hawk-Eye system is already widely used in tennis and has transformed the game. Sepp Blatter, president of FIFA, the game's governing body, has consistently opposed the use of in-game video replays, but goal-line technology, to determine if the ball has crossed the goal line, has received more support. The Hawk-Eye system is extensively used in tennis, using cameras to calculate the trajectory of the ball. The system then uses the trajectory data to determine exactly where the ball has hit the ground, making it invaluable for marginal line calls. Using similar technology, Hawk-Eye Innovations, based in England, has developed a football system to determine if a goal has been scored. It again uses cameras to track the ball and computers to calculate its position. If the system detects that the ball has crossed the goal line a central computer transmits a signal to the referee via either a watch or earpiece. The system was tested at Premier League football club Fulham in 2006 and then at Reading's training ground in 2007. It was backed by the British Football Association and funded by the Premier League. Another goal-line technology, a microchipped football, was developed by Adidas and German firm Cairos Technologies. A microchip built into the football detects a magnetic field generated by underground cables in the penalty area. Like the Hawk-Eye system it uses a computer to send a signal to the referee's watch when a goal is scored. The system was tested at the World Under-17 Championships in 2005 and the 2007 World Club Championship in Tokyo. The International Football Association Board (IFAB), which decides the laws of the game, discusses new rules at an annual general meeting consisting of four representatives from FIFA and one each from England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Explaining the IFAB's decision, Blatter said the microchipped ball had failed in one of the seven World Club Championship matches because of interference to the signal sent to the referee and that it would be difficult to implement the chip technology in the many types of football used around the world. He added that it was not possible to ensure that the Hawk-Eye system worked in a crowded goalmouth, where players might block the cameras' view of the ball. ""FIFA are of the opinion that the systems are very costly, would not add anything to the game and would harm the position of the referee,"" the UK's Press Association reported at the time. Do you think goal-line technology should be used? Share your thoughts in the Sound Off box below. But Hawk-Eye managing director Paul Hawkins told CNN that he believes FIFA has decided that it doesn't want technology in football. ""I saw FIFA last week and told them that we can provide a system if they want it, but it's very clear they don't want the system,"" he said. Hawkins said his company cannot develop the technology any further without more testing in real stadiums, but that kind of testing requires FIFA's consent. The idea that football's governing bodies are opposed to more technology in football has been supported by statements from the sport's governing bodies. In March 2009, Blatter said in a statement: ""The IFAB believes that football is a game for human beings and, as such, we should improve the standard of refereeing - and not turn to technology."" Michel Platini, President of UEFA, European Football's governing body, has expressed similar views. Instead of pursuing goal-line technology, the IFAB chose to trial the idea of having two extra match officials, one behind each goal. A FIFA spokesman told CNN that while the use of goal-line technology hasn't been ruled out forever, even after recent refereeing controversies, the IFAB's current position is to continue to experiment with extra officials. The IFAB's decision means there will be no goal-line technology used in the Champions League final on 27 May, which means there is the potential for more refereeing disputes. ""Maybe there will be a controversial goal in the Champions League final and maybe the discussion over the technology will begin again,"" Oliver Braun, marketing and communications director at Cairos Technologies told CNN. Hawkins agrees that it will take a controversial goal-line incident in a big FIFA match to get the IFAB to change their position, saying it took a series of contentious calls at the 2004 US Open for tennis authorities to seriously consider using the Hawk-Eye system. If that is the case, there will be some football fans hoping for plenty of goal-line drama come May 27.","Debate over whether technology should be used to help referees .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- How does a man from an unassuming Dutch village go to being loved in South Korea, adored in Australia, revered in Russia and admired in England? Guus Hiddink, the Russia and Chelsea coach, has had much to smile about in his 22-year managerial career. By being an exceptional football manager, for one. Enjoying success around the world -- at different levels with different players in different cultures -- has made Guus Hiddink one of the most admired bosses around. Born in rural Varsseveld, near the German border, in 1946, Hiddink's early years were unremarkable. While playing semi-professional football, he spent 10 years as a gym teacher at a school for children with learning difficulties. Most of his playing days were in the midfield of De Graafschap, a smallish club with no history of winning silverware. He later spent two years playing in America before returning to retire at De Graafschap. Watch CNN's exclusive interview with Hiddink » . Little, then, to suggest that here was a man who would achieve so much in his later career. But great players seldom become great managers. His first steps in that direction came at De Graafschap, Holland, where he was assistant manager before moving to the same role at Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven.  See key moments from Hiddink's career » . By 1987, at the age of 40, he was in charge of PSV and led them to their 1988 European Cup win, a feat unthinkable today. He almost reached the final again in 2005 during his second spell in Eindhoven. Hiddink's keeper at PSV, Hans van Breukelen, revealed some of the manager's methods. ""He's very interested in people and immediately tries to create a family environment,"" he told Britain's Sun newspaper. ""I can vividly remember him smoking and having a cup of coffee with his players. I don't know if he still smokes, but he was a chain smoker at PSV."" Hiddink's resume includes stints in other high-pressure jobs such as Fenerbahce, Valencia and Real Madrid, but it's on the international scene where his shrewd tactical mind, organizational skills and motivational prowess grabbed attention. Semifinalists with Holland at the 1998 World Cup, he took over South Korea in 2001 and led the co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup to the last four. No Asian country had ever gone as far in a World Cup before and he left the job a national hero. He agreed to coach another underdog in the shape of Australia in 2005 and led them to the 2006 World Cup. There, the Socceroos had eventual winners Italy rattled for much of their second-round match before succumbing to a late, controversial penalty. Hiddink took Russia to Euro 2008, where they were beaten by Spain at the semifinal stage. Naturally his hometown Varsseveld wanted to capitalize on Hiddink's huge global popularity. The ""Guuseum"" was built in his honor, which for a time was particularly popular with South Koreans on a pilgrimage to see from where their idol hailed. Chelsea were in the doldrums when he arrived on a short-term deal in January as a favor to his comrade, Roman Abramovich, the club's billionaire owner. And the Hiddink magic has worked again, giving the Blues direction to a season that was drifting under previous boss Luiz Felipe Scolari. But the straight-speaking Dutchman is loyal to the project he has in charge of the Russian national side and insists he will leave Chelsea at the end of the season regardless. Sure of himself but free of ego, Hiddink knows what he wants. And, as he's repeatedly proved, he knows how to get it too.","Born in 1946, Hiddink has become one of the best managers in the world .

"SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN) -- Walt Peters knows what it's like to fear for his life. He knows how it feels to board a plane, deploying for combat. He knows the feeling of making it home alive. Walt Peters is often among the last people soldiers see as they deploy and the first they see upon their return. That's why the retired Vietnam veteran has stood outside at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, Georgia, for the past four years as a beacon of pride and support, welcoming home returning soldiers and wishing ""Godspeed"" to those deploying. ""To me, if it wasn't for our soldiers and our veterans, we would not have this beautiful country,"" says Peters. ""These guys are our freedom."" Peters, 64, has been one of the last people that about 20,000 soldiers so far have seen before boarding the plane for the war zone -- and one of the first seen upon return. No matter what time the soldiers' flights are arriving or departing -- many take place in the middle of the night -- Peters is there to shake their hands and give them a token of support: a small American flag. Some of those flags, Peters says, have gone to Iraq and back. ""When they touch that flag, we're giving them a piece of our country, saying, 'Thank you.'"" Peters is not the only volunteer showing his support at each flight. But he does all of this nearly blind. He says learned he had chemical diabetes nearly 10 years ago after he was exposed to Agent Orange during his Vietnam tours. He has lost almost all of his sight over the past few years, but that hasn't depleted his dedication to the soldiers. ""When I went to Vietnam on my tours I'd never had this. I had never had nobody say, 'We appreciate your service. We thank you for what you're doing for our freedom,'"" Peters says. ""When they get on that plane, they're gonna know that this old Vietnam vet cares."" Peters first became involved greeting flights through the Savannah Red Cross in 2004 when a friend from his fraternal Moose Lodge brought him to welcome a returning flight. Peters has since become a flight greeting leader, bringing in and training his own volunteers. His crew includes Moose members and Vietnam veterans. So many flights come in, Peters says, that it's impossible to be present for all of them. He's worked as many as three flights in one day, in a 26-hour period.   Watch how Peters sends off and greets deploying and returning U.S. soldiers » . Peters and his volunteers arrive two hours before a flight's arrival or departure to set up their tables and brew coffee. He makes sure he walks around and talks with the troops when they come through for processing. ""I'm a combat veteran; the soldiers know I can relate to them,"" Peters says. ""I tell them, 'It's OK to be scared. You stay scared, you stay alive.'"" Peters also talks to the soldiers about the Adopt-A-Soldier program, asking them to fill out a card so a family can ""adopt"" them and send care packages and necessities to them in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Watch Peters and volunteers interacting with U.S. soldiers before their deployment to Iraq » . Peters says the most important thing is to show the soldiers ""the support and the spirit that they need behind them as they step up to get on that plane.""

"HIGH BRIDGE, New Jersey (CNN) -- ""The thought that I can reach out and permanently improve someone's life for the better is addictive,"" says Dave Schweidenback.

Several times a year, the 55-year-old can be found prepping large shipments of used bicycles bound for a developing country. For Schweidenback, gathering and breaking down these bikes is a labor of love -- one that is helping to keep the bikes out of landfills and give them new life. ""Used bicycles can transform the economic and social condition of families,"" says Schweidenback. ""[They] give people access to jobs, health care and education that is too distant for walking."" Since 1991, Schweidenback's nonprofit Pedals for Progress has collected and shipped more than 115,000 used bicycles to 32 developing countries worldwide, where they are sold at a low cost to local residents like Don Roberto Garcia. ""A used woman's mountain bicycle changed my life,"" says Garcia, 54, a house cleaning supplies salesman in Nicaragua who works six days a week to support his six children and buy medicine for his wife, who suffers from cancer. For 20 years, Garcia walked six to seven hours a day, hauling his merchandise in a wheelbarrow along a 6 mile route. This earned him $2-$3 a day. ""More than anything, I would always return home so tired from the walk,"" Garcia recalls. Little by little, Garcia saved his money and was able to buy a used bicycle six years ago from a Pedals for Progress partner agency in Jinotepe, Nicaragua. ""Because of a bicycle, I now earn about $4 a day,"" says Garcia. ""I sell more and I do my rounds quicker. I tell everyone to go buy a bicycle.""  Watch Garcia explain how a used bicycle has helped him in Nicaragua » . The seeds for Schweidenback's Pedals for Progress were planted years ago while he was volunteering for the Peace Corps from 1977-80 in Ecuador, near the Amazon Basin. ""Besides the bus that comes through town and one guy that owned a pickup truck, everybody walked everywhere all the time,"" he recalls. ""My landlord was the exception because he owned the only bike in a 500-mile radius. He was the most successful man in the region because he could access a job and get wherever he needed to go."" Years later, Schweidenback noticed used bicycles at garage sales and in garbage cans throughout his New Jersey community. ""I remembered how [the need] in developing countries was so great, that I couldn't stop thinking about it,"" he says. Knowing the bikes could be put to better use, Schweidenback asked members of his community to donate 12 used bicycles; he planned to send them to Ecuador. The community brought him 140. Within a year, Schweidenback had created Pedals for Progress and shipped roughly 500 bicycles to developing countries. Today, Schweidenback organizes 140 used bike drives each year and, on average, collects 90 bicycles in three hours. Donors are asked to pay a $10 fee per bike to help cover shipping costs and reduce the cost of the bicycle when it's sold overseas. Each bike is sold for about $15.  Watch how Pedals for Progress bikes get from donors to people in developing countries » . ""There's a bike that's unloved in every garage in this country. Rather than put these old bikes in landfills for no reason, we can use them as economic stimulus to aid our neighbors,"" Schweidenback says. ""This is the transfer of wealth between nations because these have great value overseas. And they give people the ability to hold a job or a child the ability to go to school.""

"(CNN) -- Olafur Ragnar Grimsson is currently enjoying a third term as President of the Republic of Iceland. Since first being elected in 1996, Grimsson has been a passionate advocate of international cooperation in combating climate change. Olafur Ragnar Grimsson . Whilst Iceland still imports oil for its transport, electricity is generated from hydroelectric power. And heating is provided by geothermal power -- an abundant source in energy due to Iceland's geographical position sitting above two continental plates. Iceland is also pioneering the use of hydrogen power with several projects testing the viability of this renewable energy. In his youth, Grimsson studied Economics and Political Science at Manchester University, gaining a B.A. and a Ph.D before returning to Iceland to take up a post as a professor of Political Science at the University of Iceland. He entered Althingi, the Icelandic parliament in 1978, served as minister of finance between 1988 and 1991 and was leader of the Peoples' Alliance from 1987 to 1995. Grimsson promotes the intelligent use of renewable energy resources and is providing world leaders with an invaluable insight into how their own economies might make the switch to more renewable sources of energy.","Olafur Grimsson is Principal Voices' Frontline Pioneer for the Economics of Energy .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The concept may be radical, but it might just have to be if the worst predictions of climate change are realized. The Lilypad as imagined by architect Vincent Callebaut moored off the coast of Monaco. The Lilypad, a floating ecopolis for climatic refugees, is the creation of Belgian architect Vincent Callebaut. ""It is"" he says, ""a true amphibian, half aquatic and half terrestrial city, able to accommodate 50,000 inhabitants and inviting biodiversity"". Callebaut imagines his structure at 250 times the scale of a lilypad, with a skin made of polyester fibres coated in titanium dioxide which would react with ultraviolet light and absorb atmospheric pollution. The Lilypad comprises of three marinas and three mountain regions with streets and structures strewn with foliage. ""The goal is to create a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature,"" said Callebaut. With a central fresh water lagoon acting as ballast, the whole construction would be carbon neutral utilizing solar, thermal, wind, hydraulic, tidal and osmotic energies. With high density populations living in low-lying areas -- The Netherlands, Polynesia, Bangladesh -- the ecopolis, its creator believes, could be the answer to mass human displacement that global warming is predicted to cause. In its most recent 2007 report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted sea levels will rise by 60-90 cm during this century. Some climate scientists like James Hansen think that if greenhouse gas emissions aren't checked then those figures might be much, much worse. In practice, Callebaut envisages the Lilypad sailing the seas, following currents like a futuristic cruise ship. He also thinks that it could ""widen sustainability in offshore territories of the most developed countries such as Monaco"". You can't help thinking that the well-heeled residents of the Principality might have a thing or two to say about 50,000 climatic refugees bobbing around in the harbour, but you cannot fault Callebaut's ambition. His previous creations -- showcased on his website -- reveal an imagination working at full throttle with sustainable design lying at its heart. Anti-Smog -- a prototype of depolluting architecture and Ecomic -- an ecotower rising up from the foundations of Aztec ruins are two further examples of his eco design credentials. The Perfumed Jungle, Fields in Fields and The Fractured Monolith may sound like titles for various genres of novel but are, in fact, names for sustainable projects in Callebaut's growing portfolio. Now all he needs is to find someone brave enough to build on the vision he has created.","Belgian architect imagines climate refugees living on a futuristic Lilypad ecopolis .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The creators are billing it as one of the coolest hostels in the world and it's undoubtedly one of the most novel overnight stays you are ever likely to experience. Welcome to the Jumbo Hostel -- an old Boeing 747 which is being converted into a 25-room hostel at the Stockholm-Arlanda airport. The Jumbo Hostel is currently being refurbished and will open for business in December 2008. The idea is the brainchild of Swedish businessman and entrepreneur Oscar Dios, who has been running hostels in Uppsala, Sweden for the past five years. Renovation work is underway on a plane which used to carry in excess of 350 passengers. Jumbo Hostel is scheduled to open for business in December 2008 and will provide accommodation for up to 85 guests. CNN spoke to Dios about how he got the project off the ground. ""We were looking to expand the business but it was more or less impossible to find reasonably priced housing at the airport. And you cannot build a new house and run a hostel because it is too expensive,"" he said. It was in 2006 that Dios first heard about the Boeing 747, which was for sale. Formerly flown by the now defunct Transjet Airways, the plane was wasting away in a hangar at Arlanda airport and hadn't flown since 2002. ""The plane was in a terrible state when we first saw it,"" he said. ""But we contacted the owners and gave them a fairly good offer, I think."" Although he wasn't prepared to let on exactly how much he paid for the old Boeing, Dios confirmed that the price tag was a six-figure sum (in euros). Dios took possession of the 1976 Boeing 747-200 -- one of 393 built by the company until 1991 -- in June 2007 and by December he had reached agreement with the airport authorities about his unique proposal. In August 2008 the plane was finally moved to its permanent home at Arlanda airport's main entrance, where it will now stay. Apart from the engines being removed from the wings before purchase, the plane, from the outside, looks almost exactly as it did when it was grounded. The interior, for obvious reasons, is a different matter. Dismantling and stripping out all the old equipment and instruments started earlier this year. The final phase of refurbishment is nearing completion and Dios says it complies with the same building regulations required for a house. There will be two types of accommodation. A basic room will be roughly six square meters in size with sleeping space for three adults. It will cost €110 ($150) per night. But if you fancy splashing out, you can book the top deck, complete with the cockpit suite, which comes with a private bathroom and panoramic views of takeoffs and landings. Dios envisages newlyweds taking advantage of this more expensive option, which costs €500 ($700). If you don't want to spend a whole night on board you can hop on and relax in the cafe suite for a couple of hours at a cost of €25 ($35). This will also afford you the opportunity of striding out onto the wing and taking in the views of the bustling airport. While most large commercial planes end up in vast aircraft boneyards, some, like the Jumbo Hostel, find new lives. New York based urban architects Lot-ek plan to create a library in Guadalajara, Mexico, made by recycling 200 Boeing 727 and 737 fuselages. And Californian millionaire Francie Rehwald has started building a house from the parts of another scrapped 747.","Swedish entrepreneur to open a Jumbo Hostel at Arlanda airport in Sweden .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Plans to rejuvenate a dilapidated London icon -- known worldwide to movie and music fans  -- were unveiled last week. The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station includes a new eco-dome and a solar chimney. Battersea Power Station, which has dominated the west London skyline since 1933, will -- subject to planning approval -- undergo an $8 billion redevelopment including shops, homes, a hotel, offices and a striking 300 meter eco-tower.  The building appeared on the cover of the 1977 Pink Floyd album ""Animals,"" complete with a giant pig floating above its four distinctive towers. It has also appeared in numerous movies including sci-fi drama ""The Children of Men"", new Batman feature ""The Dark Knight"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Sabotage."" Real Estate Opportunities Ltd (REO), who currently own the 38 acre site say the defunct and crumbling edifice will be: ""brought back to life in the most spectacular way. It will be a place to live, work and play"". An Irish development company, REO is planning to spend $300 million repairing the old coal-powered station and get it working again -- this time producing energy from biofuels, waste and other renewable energy sources. At the heart of the regeneration stands a vast new chimney and eco-dome, which as well as housing apartments and offices will act as a vast solar ventilation system cutting down the building's energy demand by two thirds. Managing Director of REO's development manager, Treasury Holdings UK, Rob Tincknell describes it as ""a power station for the 21st century...supporting a truly sustainable, zero carbon development"". Uruguayan architect Rafael Vinoly whose daunting job it was to come up with a workable new design for the much loved site describes the old power station as a ""remarkable architectural presence"". In creating a vast transparent chimney Vinoly hopes that it will contrast with what he describes as the ""monumental mass"" of J. Theo Halliday and Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's original design. Of course, we've been here before. Since the turbines were shut down for the final time in 1983 the power station -- situated on the south bank of the river Thames -- has been the subject of several failed redevelopment ventures. In 1983, a scheme proposed by UK businessman John Broome promised to turn the power station into a gigantic theme park. But by the decade's close and despite the enthusiastic backing of UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher his funding package for redevelopment, much like the site itself, were in a ruinous state. In 1996, development company Parkview International headed up by Victor Hwang acquired the freehold for the site. By the time its current owners REO bought the site a decade later another over ambitious redevelopment scheme -- which included a single table restaurant atop one of the four chimneys -- had come and gone. By now the entire site was in a pretty parlous state -- the chimneys being declared beyond repair and threatened with imminent demolition. This new proposal has already provoked a chorus of dissent. Writing in London's Evening Standard newspaper, architecture critic Rowan Moore described the idea as: ""spectacularly, riotously, extravagantly nuts,"" telling the developers and planners to: ""Forget it. Do not try to compromise with a tower two-thirds as high. Do not build a tower. Aim for zero-carbon and beautiful buildings..."". The Guardian's resident architecture expert Jonathan Glancey gave the designs a cool reception describing them as; ""more than a little over the top"". CNN spoke to Keith Garner, an architect and member of the Battersea Power Station Community Group about the new proposals. He didn't mince his words. ""If you take it as a serious proposal, it's immensely harmful,"" he said. ""It is a massive tower -- about the same size as the gherkin. Battersea Power Station is a Grade II* listed building. If you put a tower of that mass next to it, you are going to diminish its significance. ""If you are serious about rescuing this building you would do it in stages. The old turbine halls and the switch houses are easily reusable. A sensible, rational approach to this would involve starting with the power station itself and doing the work in small achievable phases."" Consequently, Garner doesn't believe that the new plans are credible. ""I think the developers have overplayed it. This is a joke and I think it needs to be denounced for what it is -- a ludicrous and unnecessary diversion from the principal task of repairing the building.""

"JOHNSTON, Iowa (CNN) -- Politics meets technology Thursday as a group of undecided Iowa Democrats has allowed themselves to be wired for the debate of Democratic presidential hopefuls. A dial-test graph is displayed over candidate Rudy Giuliani during a recent GOP debate. By the end of the debate, CNN hopes to be able to gauge which debater was the group's favorite and whose popularity fell -- and perhaps -- who may win the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses on January 3. Across town, six Democratic candidates will be facing off for their final scheduled debate in the Hawkeye State before caucus night. The debate is hosted by the Des Moines Register and Iowa Public Television. Each member of the randomly selected group will watch the debate on a large-screen TV while operating special hand-held dial-testing devices which are approximately the size of typical remote-control devices. Viewers will react to the debate as it happens -- second-by-second -- as they move their dials to the right or the left. Dialing right indicates a positive response and dialing left represents a negative response. Southern Methodist University professors Rita Kirk and Dan Schill will track the average response of the group corresponding with each moment of the debate. Responses will be represented by a moving line on a video monitor. The group of Iowans, randomly selected by phone from a list of registered voters, will be recording their impressions of every moment of the debate. The Democratic participants will answer a series of questions both before and after the debate, to determine how the event may change their minds about the candidates. Among the questions to be posed before the face-off: Who do the group members think will perform best in the debate? Afterwards, they'll be asked who they think did the best. They also will be asked who they would vote for if the election were held today and who they think will win the nomination. All participants are planning to attend caucuses, but have yet to pick a candidate. Some are wavering between two candidates while some are considering several. They're hoping to get a better sense of the race from watching this debate, and CNN is hoping to get a better sense of their impressions of the debate by watching them.

"(CNN) -- The September issue of Essence magazine features an interview with Sen. Barack Obama and his family inside their Chicago home. Angela Burt-Murray is editor-in-chief of Essence magazine. Essence editor-in-chief Angela Burt-Murray said it took a year for the magazine to gain access to the Obama's Illinois home for an intimate interview with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, his wife, Michelle, and their daughters, Sasha and Malia. Burt-Murray talked Thursday with CNN ""American Morning"" anchor Kiran Chetry about the interview and the Obama family. Chetry: You are the first African-American media outlet to get this inside look. Did your team get a chance to see the real Obamas? Burt-Murray: I think we did. We went to their home on the South Side of Chicago and it was wonderful to see them as a family interacting with each other, and see the girls skipping around the house, just acting like it's a normal, everyday occurrence to have a camera crew in their home and Secret Service at different points throughout the house and around the yard. But it didn't really seem to impact the girls in any way.  Watch what Essence found inside the Obamas' home » . Chetry: Much was made of an earlier televised interview they with their daughters and they said, looking back, they probably shouldn't have done that. There is so much interest about their family, and yet they want to protect their girls. How do they balance that? Burt-Murray: They try to take a look at who is around the family and make sure they try to keep things as structured as possible. But also, you have instances where magazines like Essence show up to take photographs, but the girls are very relaxed because they're in their home environment. And I think that's the difference between our photo shoot and what you saw on television. Taking the girls outside of their home and putting them in the spotlight is probably a bit more challenging for them as parents. Chetry: They have to deal with completing stereotypes, if you will: They were parodied as these angry black radicals and as these Ivy League elitists. In the magazine, Gwen Ifill wrote, ""The Obamas pride themselves on creating a family picture that is authentically black with shades of Norman Rockwell."" Explain that. How are they getting that image out. Burt-Murray: I think it's the idea that they're just an average American family. They have strong family values, they're deeply rooted in their community and they want to show their girls a great example of achievement. But they also want to be a model for the rest of their community. The Obamas talk about in our story how important it is for them to continue to live in their South Side Chicago neighborhood because it's a neighborhood in transition. So you have children who have the opportunity to see an African-American man run for the highest office in the nation right in their neighborhood. So they're modeling not only for their children but also for the larger community. Chetry: They do live in a gated community, a $1.6 million home, so it's out of reach for a lot of people. Burt-Murray: But it's so accessible. While we were there photographing them for Essence, you could see the cars going by and stopping and people getting out to take photographs. The girls were on the porch and people could see them. There is some normalcy there, but it's also obviously something very special and different. Chetry: They said race had been prominent on the campaign trail. Barack Obama told Gwen Ifill that he thinks race is a national obsession. He thinks the racial divide is not as big an issue in this country as it's made out to be. Burt-Murray: As evidenced by the success that he's had with his campaign, you can certainly see that attitudes are shifting. But there are still challenges, obviously, that need to be addressed. And it keeps coming up throughout the campaign. So it will be interesting to see what happens when the country goes to the polls in November.","Essence magazine interviews senator, wife and children in Chicago home .

"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (CNN)  -- The Taliban in Afghanistan have momentum that makes any effort to negotiate with them difficult, the U.S. defense secretary said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates arrived in Cairo, Egypt, on Monday. He's visiting Afghanistan on Wednesday. Secretary Robert Gates spoke to CNN's Chris Lawrence in an exclusive interview Tuesday evening before leaving for Afghanistan, where he is visiting troops and bases Wednesday. ""The political level of the Taliban probably isn't ready to think about reconciliation or any kind of accommodation at this point,"" Gates said in the interview. ""They probably feel like they have the momentum with them. And until that momentum changes, it will be difficult."" As part of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, the military and Afghanistan government are attempting to reach out to elements of the Taliban who are engaged in the battle for financial gain, rather than ideological gain. ""There are really two groups we're talking about -- the younger, or less committed, who do this mainly to earn a living and put food on the table for their families, and those that are more ideologically committed. The latter are going to be a tougher pull, and we'll probably have to wait awhile before there's an opportunity there."" On Monday, CNN's Nic Robertson interviewed a spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, who said the Taliban will only negotiate with the Afghanistan government when the United States leaves the country. ""Our conditions are clear, we want to negotiate and they [the U.S.] will not interfere in our affairs; secondly, they [the U.S.] will leave the country,"" Mujahid told CNN. Gates said the stance was not surprising. ""Well I don't know what else he'd say. He's leading the opposition, he's leading this insurgency. He's not going to sort of, sort of throw down and say 'We're ready to negotiate, we're about done here,' "" Gates said. The United States is adding 21,000 troops to the Afghanistan battlefield. The majority will be moving to the south to confront the Taliban along the porous Pakistani border. The Taliban have had mostly free rein in that area with few U.S. or coalition forces to confront them until now. Gates admitted moving the battle to the south will mean there is ""a tough fight ahead."" ""I think, certainly, I have been pretty clear. As we move into areas of the south that have not seen any Afghan or coalition forces so far, we're clearly going to be going into areas where the Taliban are very entrenched,"" he said. ""And, sad to say, I expect with the rising level of our activity and operations, there probably will be higher casualties."" In recent weeks, the Pakistani government has seen the Taliban gain control on its side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Privately, Pakistani officials have expressed concern to the United States that the increased fighting in southern Afghanistan will only push the Taliban back to the Pakistani side. ""Well I think it's just the reality that there are extremists on both sides of that border. And they threaten both the elected government of Afghanistan and the elected government of Pakistan. So like it or not, they both have a certain common enemy,"" Gates said. Gates said he is encouraged by recent cooperation efforts between the two countries to deal with the problem, and by Pakistan's recent confrontation with the Taliban in Bunir province, near the capital of Islamabad. ""The signs right now are pretty positive,"" he told CNN.","U.S. defense secretary: Political level not ready for reconciliation, accommodation .

"DAVOS, Switzerland (CNN) -- The worldwide economic recession has exposed a ""crisis of global governance"" that can only be addressed by the radical reform of the United Nations, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday as the World Economic Forum got under way in Switzerland. Kofi Annan says the United Nations needs to be reformed. ""The current architecture of managing global affairs is broken and needs to be fixed,"" Annan said on the opening morning of the five-day annual meeting of global political and business leaders. ""We have major new players coming on the scene and they need to be integrated and given a voice."" Referring to the U.N. Security Council, which gives permanent places and vetoing powers to the U.S., the UK, Russia, China and France, Annan said: ""We cannot continue to run the world based on countries that won a war 60 years ago. It's either destructive competition or cooperation. We live in an interdependent world and the only way to move forward is to cooperate."" Annan is one of six co-chairs at this year's WEF gathering, along with news tycoon Rupert Murdoch, HSBC Chairman Stephen Green, Werner Wenning of the German chemical group Bayer, Indian industrialist Anand G. Mahindra and Maria Ramos, Chief Executive of the South African transport group Transnet. He also urged delegates to address three interconnected challenges: the global recession, energy and security, and climate change. ""It is important leaders work on ways of finding effective, far-reaching policies -- even if they are radical -- that will allow us to create sustainable economic growth and create jobs for those who are out of jobs,"" Annan said. Newscorp. CEO Murdoch said delegates needed to be ""absolutely honest about where the world is at this point,"" warning that the consequences of $50 trillion being wiped off personal fortunes had left people feeling ""depressed and traumatized."" ""We've been living in the Western world way above our means. We've been on a great binge and it's come to an end and we have to live though the correction,"" Murdoch said. But he said the downturn offered a chance to set about tackling issues of energy sufficiency and pollution. ""We must treat this crisis, whether it lasts for a year or five years, as an opportunity to set goals for how we want to come out of it. This is a time to shape the policies to help to solve some of those problems."" HSBC boss Green said the banking industry needed to admit that it had not ""covered itself in glory"" in contributing to the collapse of the financial industry and called for continuing government intervention to ""stop a nasty recession spiraling down into something else."" But he said the major banks could contribute to solving the crisis as well: ""I do not believe for a moment that you can have a successful economy without successful and properly functioning international capital markets."" Wenning said he didn't expect any solutions to emerge from this year's meeting, but hoped delegates could achieve ""a joint understanding of the reasons for the financial crisis"" and called for a return to ""the basics of sustainable behavior."" ""If we are really able to address these mega-challenges of the future then we would be able to restore the trust in leadership -- and I believe the world needs leadership."" Political leaders will join the discussions later Wednesday with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin both due to deliver agenda-setting addresses.","Kofi Annan calls for reform of U.N. at World Economic Forum in Davos .

"(CNN) -- Taliban militants, who implemented Islamic law in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley last week, have now taken control of a neighboring district. Protests in Karachi against the creation of sharia courts in Swat Valley. Here are some answers about the Swat Valley, its history and what's taking place there. What is Swat Valley? Swat Valley is located in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, near the border with Afghanistan and about 185 miles (300 kilometers) from the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. The alpine region once was one of Pakistan's premier tourist destinations, boasting the nation's only ski resort until it was shut down after Taliban militants overran the area. It also was a draw for trout-fishing enthusiasts and those wishing to visit the ancient Buddhist ruins in the area. What's happening in Swat Valley? In recent years Taliban militants unleashed a wave of violence that claimed hundreds of lives in the province. The militants wanted sharia law -- or Islamic law -- imposed in the region. They took over the valley in 2008. The central government of Pakistan, which long exerted little control in the area, launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out the militants. In retaliation, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks and began gaining ground, setting up checkpoints in the area. Has the government intervened? The militants and the Pakistani government reached a peace deal earlier this year, which was recently signed into law by Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. Under the deal, sharia law was imposed in the region. While the peace deal drew criticism for the Pakistani government, some analysts and political observers say the government had little choice but to capitulate, as militants have terrorized the region with beheadings, kidnappings and the destruction of schools. What's happening now? This week, the Taliban moved to seize control of the neighboring Buner district, bringing it closer to Islamabad than it has been since Taliban insurgency began. What is sharia law? Sharia law is Islamic law. While there are different interpretations of it, the Taliban's strict interpretation forbids women from being seen in public without their husbands and fathers, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. Consequences are severe; during the Taliban struggle to impose sharia law, anyone found disobeying was pinned to the ground and lashed. Others were beheaded and hung from poles, with notices attached to their bodies that anyone daring to remove the corpse before 48 hours had passed would also be beheaded and hanged.","Taliban militants in Pakistan's Swat Valley take control of neighboring Buner district .

"BIRMINGHAM, Alabama (CNN) -- If Russell Jackson has his way, any child who needs medical care but lacks the transportation to get there will have a safe and reliable alternative. Russell Jackson started Kid One, which has ferried thousands of children to medical appointments. ""We found that there were 80,000-plus children in Alabama living in a home with no car,"" Jackson says. ""And in the rural areas, there are no cabs, there are no buses, there are no trains. ... Millions of children in our country every day have no access to medical care when they need to reach it."" Jackson is so determined that in 1997 he gave up his career as an Alabama firefighter, moved in with friends and dug into his retirement account to start Kid One Transport, a nonprofit organization that provides rides for needy children in his home state.

""It's not that I had not been exposed to tragedies before, but this one hit me differently."" At the advice of a counselor, Jackson started volunteer work to help him process his grief. A friend suggested Jackson volunteer in the small rural town of Sayre, Alabama. Jackson was stunned by what he saw just 25 minutes from his home.

"DOHA, Qatar (CNN) -- One look outside the window gives a glimpse of the ""economics of energy"" in Doha, Qatar. Cranes dot the tops of half-finished towers, a monumental work in progress; the result of vast energy wealth being pumped out of the ground and poured into project after project. Doha, Qatar: A city skyline awash with cranes and towers powered by abundant oil and gas supplies. It's here that our Principal Voices met for the first of this year's roundtables. Outside Qatar, the economics of energy present a very different picture. Rising fuel costs are pricing power out of the means of some of the world's poorest people. And the environmental cost of continuing to exploit the world's fossil fuel supplies is now almost universally agreed to be so great that society can no longer afford to ignore it. Our Principal Voices come from diverse backgrounds: . The Icelandic President Olafur Grimsson -- the first head of state to sit on a Principal Voices panel -- grew up on a small island in the North Atlantic Ocean and over the past forty years has witnessed the country abandon coal to become the world's first clean economy. Dr Joseph Adelegan from Nigeria has seen poverty first hand in Africa where he worked closely with villagers to convert slaughterhouse waste to gas they use for cooking. And, Qatar-based businessman Hesham Ismail AbdulRahman Al Emadi is leading an ambitious project to create a global network of ""Energy Cities"" to house the oil and gas industry. For an hour and a half they spoke about how to solve what Icelandic President Grimsson called, ""the most fundamental question of the 21st century"": energy and whether there will ever be enough alternative sources of power to satisfy global demand if, and only if, the world manages to shake its addiction to oil and other fossil fuels. They spoke not only about the need to find alternatives to traditional energy sources, but whether there'll ever be a concerted effort in developed countries to conserve rather than consume precious resources. So what is holding us back? ""We are creatures of habit,"" Grimsson offered by way of explanation, adding that ""it usually takes a crisis to bring about change"". He warned that there is one potential disaster looming: the predicted melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas in 30 to 40 years which will cause catastrophic flooding in India and China. ""This is not just a discussion about the rich, about cities or about Europe or America or even China or India, the great economic powerhouses. This is also a question about the poorest of the poor."" In a response to an emailed question about whether the developed world should face sanctions for not meeting any targets set by the international community on climate change, Dr Joseph Adelegan called for aid to help poorer countries --like the ones in Africa -- find alternatives to fossil fuels. The Middle East is facing different challenges. Hesham Al Emadi says energy subsidies in Gulf Cooperation Council countries and ignorance of the issues provide little incentive for residents to conserve energy or find greener alternatives: ""there is lots of ignorance. Awareness is a major issue."" And what of countries like the U.S.? Would higher taxes on fuel be enough to move residents in the right direction? Acknowledging he's an optimist and ""a great friend of America,"" Grimsson said, politically, all the elements are already in place for a big shift in attitudes in the U.S. ""McCain, Hillary and Obama are all on the positive issue, as I call it,"" he said. He also said the world might be wise to look to the Middle East for guidance. ""I believe they are probably more aware than we are that the odds are that oil will run out sooner rather than later,"" Grimsson said, adding ""A visionary leader of a country who wants to create a good living for his or her grandchildren or great grandchildren thinks about these issues.""

"Editor's note: Maury Klein is professor emeritus of history at the University of Rhode Island. He is the author of 15 books, including ""Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929"" and most recently ""The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Made Modern America."" Historian Maury Klein says it's important to remember that psychology plays a huge role in financial markets. (CNN) -- Friday marks the 79th anniversary of the day that launched the stock market crash of 1929. As an unprecedented wave of selling threw the floor of the New York Stock Exchange into pandemonium on a day that became known as Black Thursday, a show of organized support by a coterie of leading bankers halted the panic. But on the following Monday, the market collapsed in a tsunami of selling. Every intense convulsion of the stock market raises primal fears spawned by the Great Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression, which dragged on for a full decade and has haunted Americans ever since. The Panic of 2008 is no exception. In the past year, the market's fall has at times rivaled that of 1929. Are there connections or similarities between those earlier national traumas and our current crisis? First some facts about that earlier experience. The Great Crash and the Great Depression were two separate events. The Crash was a financial panic, the Depression an economic downturn. The one does not necessarily lead to the other; the market has collapsed several times in American history without bringing on a depression. Great Depression holds lessons for surviving a tough economy . The Crash began in October 1929, and the worst of it was over in three weeks; the Depression did not fasten itself on the nation for another year. To this day, the connection between them remains unclear, which makes it difficult to draw lessons or analogies from them. The Dow plunged 39 percent between October 23 and November 13, 1929, but it regained 74 percent of that loss by March 1930. Only when the economy failed to gain momentum in the spring did the market slip back. By fall the country had slipped into a depression, and the market resumed a downward course that did not touch bottom until July 1932. It did not again return to the levels of 1929 until 1954. The Depression did not end until increased military spending revived the economy in the spring of 1940. The bull market of the 1920s was unique in that it marked the first time large numbers of ordinary people participated. The market moved from Wall Street to Main Street and aroused intense interest even among people who were not active in it. The new investors, or ""fish"" as the pros called them, were prone to panic when the market fell sharply. Could it happen again? History never repeats itself, but historical patterns do -- though always in a new context. Here are just a few of the similarities and differences between the earlier crisis and its modern version. During the 1920s, the financial industry underwent a great expansion, bringing into the business many inexperienced people and new investment vehicles -- most notably the investment trust, the forerunner of the modern mutual fund. Nobody knew what impact they would have on the market with their buying and selling on a large scale. The business world hailed the 1920s as the ""New Era,"" one with new rules in which the old pattern of cyclical depressions would no longer occur and prosperity would be continuous. Compare this delusion with the ""New Economy"" of the 1990s. The 1920s marked the beginning of the consumer economy, and with it a broad expansion of credit. Installment buying made its debut on a large scale. Credit also was used to buy stocks on margin, greatly increasing the market's volume and volatility. The banking system was shaky throughout the 1920s, and failures escalated steadily after 1929. The Crash exposed many cases of fraud that led to investigations and passage of the most significant banking reform in American history. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or FDIC, gave rise to the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and separated investment banks from commercial banks. The latter reform was repealed in 1999, giving banks free rein to perform both activities once again. Some differences between the eras are worth noting. Prior to 1933, the federal government played virtually no active role in relieving the banking crisis of the 1920s. The stock market did not have giant institutional buyers moving huge blocks of stock. Nor did it operate on a global scale, though it was deeply influenced by international events. After the crash, the banks had plenty of money to lend but no takers, the opposite of today's situation. Deflation became the mortal enemy as people removed their cash from banks and hoarded it. A familiar pattern emerged from these events. Business and the Republican Party in the 1920s demanded and got a ""free"" market unrestrained by government. Neither Wall Street nor the New York Stock Exchange was regulated by the government. The resulting disaster prompted outraged demands that Washington ""do something."" Regulation was then forthcoming. Later, as prosperity returned and the market began soaring, the restraints were gradually removed and the pattern of excess began anew until it collapsed once again in our own time. With the fall comes renewed pleas for government to ""do something."" Finally, it is important to remember that psychology plays a huge role in financial markets. Every panic has been at bottom a crisis of confidence. So too with the economy. As Frederick Lewis Allen observed, ""Prosperity is more than an economic condition; it is a state of mind."" The trick is always to find out what exactly is needed to restore it. We are still fishing for the answer to that riddle. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maury Klein.","Maury Klein: The 1929 market crash and the Depression were separate events .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease. Two men rest in a cholera rehydration tent on the South Africa-Zimbabwe border in December. Statistics released by the Geneva, Switzerland-based organization WHO on Tuesday show 1,937 people have died in the raging epidemic from the 38,334 who contracted the disease since its outbreak in August. Cholera has spread to neighboring countries South Africa and Botswana. The epidemic comes at a time when President Robert Mugabe's government is facing its worst economic crisis, manifested in shortages of all essentials from food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity and a hyperinflationary economy. Health experts have said Harare's failure to import adequate stocks of water-treating chemicals is the main driver of the disease. Most residents have resorted to rivers and shallow wells for drinking water, because taps are usually dry. On top of that problem, the waste-disposing system has collapsed. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency. Since then, international governments and organizations such as WHO, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, USAID and other U.N. groups have moved in to combat the disease that has engulfed all of Zimbabwe's provinces. But the situation has not immediately improved. Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops. Harare issued a warning Monday that some parts of the country are going to experience floods during rainy season, further compounding the fight against the disease. The season peaks in January or February and ends in late March. Mugabe and rival Morgan Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal in September to run the government after a hotly contested presidential election. It was widely hoped that the deal would be the panacea to the humanitarian and economic problems bewildering the once-prosperous Zimbabwe, but the pact is yet to take effect. The sides continue to debate the sharing of key Cabinet ministries such as information, local government, finance, defense and home affairs.","World Health Organization says 1,937 people have died since outbreak in August .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- One of Chicago's most well-known real estate moguls appears to have shot himself to death, police said. Steven Good was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot Monday, police said. The body of Steven L. Good was found in his Jaguar on Monday. The car was spotted in a parking lot of a wildlife preserve in Kane County, Illinois, just outside Chicago, authorities said. No note was found, and police say they do not know how long the 52-year-old had been in the vehicle. Good was the chairman and chief executive officer of Sheldon Good & Co., a major U.S. real estate auction company. The death comes amid great turmoil in the country's real estate industry. In his role as chairman of the Realtors Commercial Alliance Committee, Good commented on tough conditions last month at a business conference. On a memorial blog set up by the Chicago Association of Realtors, for which Good once served as president, friends and colleagues described him as a gregarious man with a big personality. He was a savvy businessman who built his company into a major national real estate company that did deals with Donald Trump, they said. ""It is testimony to Steve's leadership that Sheldon Good & Co. remains well-positioned for the future,"" said Sheldon Good President Alan R. Kravets. ""The guy was a true blue Realtor,"" said Barbara Matthopoulos, the association's spokeswoman. She was new to real estate when she met Good more than a year ago. He took time to give her advice that has helped her grow to love the business. ""Anybody who knew him would speak to his leadership, his generosity, his attitude. The guy was just very positive, always smiling, always telling you a story. He was engaged. Everyone is really very shocked,"" she said. ""I doubt anyone could help explain why this happened."" Kane County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Pat Gengler said authorities don't have any ""concrete evidence if this had anything to do with his finances."" The company was founded by Good's father, Sheldon Good, in 1965, according to the firm's Web site. Steven Good had ""been involved in the sale of more than $4 billion of real estate, including commercial, office, retail, industrial, residential, and vacant land sites,"" it says. ""Mr. Good is the driving force behind the expansion of the company, which has been ranked as the largest firm in the United States exclusively conducting real estate auctions."" Good, who was also an attorney, wrote a book, ""Churches, Jails and Gold Mines: Mega-Deals From a Real Estate Maverick."" According to Amazon.com, Donald Trump wrote the afterword. The first chapter begins, ""Our auction company is to the real estate business what Sotheby's and Christie's is the fine art and collectibles business."" The book goes to say that as of its 2003 publication, the firm had sold 40,000 properties totaling $8 billion. ""If you lined up 1,000 people and said pick the one that might do this to themselves, he would be the last person I would choose,"" said Wayne Caplan, who worked at Sheldon Good for six years and knew Steven Good personally.

"(CNN) -- Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Thomas Friedman is never short of a word or two. Thomas L. Friedman: ""Incredible opportunities masquerading as insoluble problems."" The celebrated commentator occupies a position in his profession that many of his contemporaries would rival. He gets to go where he wants, when he wants and write about what he thinks, or as he puts it: ""I get to be a tourist with an attitude."" Officially, he's The New York Times'  foreign affairs columnist -- a position he's held since 1995 -- as well as the author of five books. Through his syndicated column his opinion has become a recognizable American voice on the international stage, and with it has come a sense of responsibility. ""I agonize over every column. Precisely because I know it is going to be read by a lot of people and it's going to be in Google forever,"" he told CNN. ""So there is that sense of responsibility, but at the same time you do have to take the attitude of 'This is what I think. This is why I think it.' I'm not in a popularity contest."" Before his current position, Friedman served in various posts at the New York Times, including chief economic correspondent, chief White House correspondent and bureau chief in Beirut and Israel. His reporting from Lebanon in 1983 and work in Israel in 1988 won him Pulitzer Prizes for international reporting. Taking in the world provides never-ending fascination, he says. ""I have the best job in the world, I mean, somebody has to have it."" He's recently trained his eye on how America can reassert itself by leading the way in green technology, encapsulated in his latest book ""Hot, flat and crowded."" As he admits, the environmental aspect is not the point of the book; really it's a treatise on how America ""lost its groove and why we need to get it back by taking the lead in the energy revolution."" One man who will need to take a pivotal role is the incoming U.S. president, Barack Obama, Friedman says. ""I have a lot of high hopes for him. I think we are very lucky to have someone with his raw material as the next president. I think he brings together several things that we haven't had,"" Friedman told CNN. Whether Obama can solve the raft of problems he faces is another matter. ""Is he ready to be as radical as the moment? Really have the courage of our crisis? At the end of the day it's gonna be Barack Obama and (Chinese President) Hu Jintao. We're not going to get out of this without cooperating and working closely with China,"" Friedman said. While presenting a view from the United States, Friedman is still able to do a mea culpa on America's behalf when it comes to the current economic crisis. ""We were in the middle of a huge credit bubble which in its own way was a Ponzi scheme. We gave the world financial SARs. We just spread it around the world."" An optimist by nature -- ""I do live by the motto that pessimists are usually right, but all the great change in history was done by optimists"" -- he's sanguine when it comes to the planet in the current climate of economic depression and environmental urgency. ""What I'm basically arguing is that you can look at the world today that is hot, flat, and crowded and you can have one of two reactions. One reaction is to say 'We're cooked, let's party,'"" he said. ""That's not the way I'd look at it. I'd look at it the way John Gardner, the founder of Common Cause, once described. I look at these problems that come from hot, flat and crowded and what I see are incredible opportunities masquerading as insoluble problems.""","Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and author: ""I'm not in a popularity contest""

"(LifeWire) -- Janice Shih might be the most educated pastry chef you'll ever meet. Janice Shih left her career in medicine at age 38 and became a pastry chef. Shih attended Johns Hopkins University, followed by medical school at George Washington University, then practiced for eight years as an obstetrician/gynecologist before realizing that baking, not medicine, was her calling. ""Everyone would say, 'You're a doctor; it must be so great to be able to save lives,'"" she says. ""But I felt like I was just pushing papers and feeling pressure to see more patients in less time. It was very draining. It just wasn't fun anymore."" So in 2004, at age 38, she swapped her stethoscope for a rolling pin and enrolled in the pastry program at L'Academie de Cuisine in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ""I had always been interested in pastries -- mostly interested in eating them,"" she says with a laugh. Shih now owns Tenzo Artisan, a bakery and catering company in Baltimore that specializes in pastries for people with food allergies -- it's rewarding, she says, to make birthday cakes for people whose dietary sensitivities had forbidden such treats. She's one of thousands of career changers who have left their cubicles for culinary school. Enrollment has risen 40 percent since 2000 at the Culinary Institute of America, and it's up 15 percent this year at The Art Institutes, which operates 30 culinary programs across the country. The trend is helped by a growing cultural interest in gourmet food and a proliferation of cooking-themed TV shows like the Food Network's ""Ace of Cakes"" and Bravo's ""Top Chef."" Plenty of possibilities . Students attending the grueling programs, which can last six to 38 months, can dole out as much as $30,000 to $40,000 for the diploma. And then the real work begins. Neil Robertson, 44, was technical director at a graphic design firm in 2003 and felt like he no longer fit the mold. He quit his 18-year career and attended the French Pastry School in Chicago. ""I've always loved to bake,"" he says. ""But baking in a professional kitchen? I wasn't sure that I could handle it."" In his first professional experience after pastry school, he found out how tough it can be: ""I came very close to tears."" Yet he persevered, and five years later became head pastry chef at Seattle's Canlis restaurant. ""You're not a chef as soon as you finish culinary school,"" says Michael Ruhlman, author of ""The Making of a Chef,"" an inside look at life at the Culinary Institute. ""You're a chef only after spending several years further honing your craft and learning the ropes. To say otherwise would be like saying grads of medical school could instantly be called pediatric neurosurgeons the day after graduation."" And becoming a chef isn't the only option. ""There are so many possibilities today,"" says Culinary Institute President Tim Ryan. ""Catering, sales, manufacturing -- we even have graduates who have launched clothing companies (or) become food scientists."" Jen Beltz, 38, and Thom Householder, 40, testify to that. In 2004, they quit their jobs at AARP and followed their palates to Italy. Using the proceeds of their house sale, the couple attended a five-month culinary program in Florence, then a nine-month course in Canada. All the while, they had no idea where their gastronomic education would take them. ""Some of our friends and family seemed to think we were a bit insane,"" Beltz recalls. But with their newfound culinary know-how, Beltz and Householder launched Front Burner PR, a boutique public-relations and marketing firm in Portland, Maine, that focuses on restaurants, hotels and other food-related clients. Don't quit your day job just yet . Think carefully before writing your resignation letter -- culinary school is no cakewalk, says Robertson. ""It's hot. It's fast. It's high-stress. It's a pressure cooker."" Ruhlman agrees. ""I can't even tell you how many people have read my book and thanked me for saving them from going to culinary school,"" he says, ""because they had no idea how hard it really is."" Before taking the plunge, Robertson and Ruhlman suggest getting a feel for the job via a culinary vacation, like those offered through gourmetontour.com and foodvacation.com, or by shadowing a chef. For the second option, ""go to a restaurant that you like and respect and ask if you can spend a day in the kitchen,"" suggests Ruhlman. It's called trailing, and some restaurants are open to it. If you have some food experience, you might be able to stage (pronounced stauge), which entails working in a kitchen alongside a chef, without pay, for a day or two. ""You get to see what life is really like in a professional kitchen,"" he says, ""and it will really open your eyes."" Looking back, Robertson says leaving his job for the culinary world was a bold move, but worth every deflated soufflé along the way: . ""I'm much more excited about what I'm doing now.""

"(CNN) -- Gunpowder, fireworks and attention-grabbing installations mark Cai Guo-Qiang as one of the world's biggest and brightest artists. Cai's fireworks will be seen by millions during the Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. The Chinese artist is about to show the world what he can do with a spectacular pyrotechnics display at the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing. Despite not having lived in China since 1986, Cai has been selected to be the Director of Visual and Special Effects for both the opening and closing ceremonies at the Games. For the 51-year-old contemporary artist, whose work has previously caused controversy in China, the politics that have been swirling around the Games are secondary to the event itself. ""In any country, in any city, there will be political influence on what is said, what kind of images are to be projected and, yes, of course artists can be and are influenced by politicians,"" he told CNN. ""But what I also think is that our leaders at the very highest level want artists to be able to be free, to be creative and to show this other side of China that is vibrant."" While some of his art is politically charged, Cai has established his reputation as much as a director of the spectacular, with his work often providing a visceral and visual bang. He studied stage design at the Shanghai Drama Institute between 1981 and 1985 before moving to Japan a year after graduation. Now residing in New York, he gained wide-spread international recognition at the Venice Biennale in 1999, winning the Golden Lion prize. However, the work he displayed -- Rent Collection Courtyard, a replica of famous Chinese socialist-realist sculpture -- upset artists of the original piece in Shanghai who believed it diminished the sentiment behind the original work. Born in Fujian in 1957, Cai's father was also an artist, but had a much more traditional outlook than the one Cai developed. ""He and his friends always lamented about the good days and, that there's no vitality in today's art and culture. So, I really rebelled against that. I felt that what they were talking about had very little to do with how our lives were like at that moment,"" he said. Cai began using gunpowder in his work after moving to Japan. Detonating large trails of it on his two-dimensional pieces, creating small mushroom-clouds, or lighting enormous firework displays, explosions have been a continuous theme of his work. ""I have always been a coward as a child. I am not very brave. I am very aware of the fact that I am not very gutsy. So, I am always trying to do things to kind of boost my own sense of courage a bit. So maybe that is why I use gunpowder,"" he told CNN. Cai has proffered different explanations for different projects that feature the same motifs. Perhaps that is not surprising when his influences come from a myriad of sources that include Taoism, Buddhist philosophy and UFO-observations. Recently exhibited at New York's Guggenheim Museum, ""Inopportune: Stage One"" is a set of 9 cars suspended above each other with illuminated shards shooting out. Cai has previously said it denotes Chinese craftiness in stealing western technology, while arrows piercing the life-sized stuffed tigers of ""Inopportune: Stage 2"" are also about the aesthetics of pain. ""For me cars are tigers, they are all bodies of the human form and it is a human form I am working with through this medium. For the cars the energy goes inward out and for the tiger piece the energy flows in,"" he told CNN. Meanings and interpretations then can be fluid, but as well as the explosions and visual excitement, there is a common social theme in his work. The most connected to this ethos is ""Reflection-A Gift from Iwaki 2004."" The skeleton of a wooden boat found off the coast of Iwaki, Japan, that spills delicate pieces of porcelain from its hull is recreated piece by piece by the people who helped excavate it. ""This work and the history of this work belongs to the people of Iwaki and me. It is a shared experience, a shared history,"" he said. ""Some works of art have material other works have form, but this piece has something additional, it has a narrative, it has a story that is just as important as the material and form itself."" Ultimately the most unifying and social part of his work is the spectacle of it all. Everyone loves fireworks, and if Cai's own careful planning and that of the Games organizers come together, he should provide a fitting opening and finale to the world's biggest spectacle.","Chinese artist will curate Olympic Games' opening ceremony pyrotechnic display .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- For Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, the last two months have been a whirlwind. ""Full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life,"" says the 24-year-old Olympic swimmer. Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer. ""Getting to the Olympics was, has always been, my swimming dream since I was 8 or 9 years old. You know, right after I started swimming it was, 'I want to make an Olympic team. That's where I want to be'."" In June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer. ""My initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else,"" he says. ""I'm used to being in control of everything. I'm in control of how I train, how I race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough."" After weeks of tests to determine the ""stage"" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment. Though putting off the surgery was controversial to some, Eric says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations. ""I hope people understand that if I was in a different position with my test results, then I wouldn't have put off having surgery.""  Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports from Eric Shanteau's surgery » . He swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke. He did not qualify for the finals. Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition. He put everything he had into that heat. ""Leave it all in the pool, and I don't look back and regret anything as far as how I raced."" Once back from Beijing, Shanteau invited CNN to spend time with him the night before his surgery in Atlanta, Georgia. Though admittedly a little scared, he spent the evening relaxing with his family, cooking dinner, walking the dog. A source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer. ""They send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing I am all over the world,"" says Shanteau. ""They all affect me in a different way and it's been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people."" Testicular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer for 15- to 34-year-olds. It is also one of the most curable if discovered early. Nearly 140,000 men in the United States are testicular cancer survivors. Shanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance. ""I've been in a Speedo half my life,"" he says. ""So I am really comfortable with my body. One day I just felt something that wasn't suppose to be there. I decided to go and get it checked out."" He adds that although he had the ""greatest excuse in the world"" -- an Olympic dream -- to ignore the lump, he understood the importance of early detection. Shanteau's father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment. ""A lot of guys, if they hear a rattle in their car, they're at the mechanic the next day,"" he says. ""But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart. There's really no excuse, because it can save your life."" Fast forward to Shanteau's recent operation at Emory University Hospital. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta was with Shanteau during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon, Dr. Jeff Carney, moments afterward. ""I think the operation went very well,"" Carney said. ""Eric's a very healthy young man, very thin, in excellent shape. That makes my job easy."" Later that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer. ""The majority of it is gone."" he tells CNN. ""There is a small chance it could come back but I shouldn't need chemotherapy at this point, so I am really optimistic."" His treatment plan is to keep a close eye on his health for the next year with regular medical tests. ""Obviously, it would have been nice if the doctor said, 'You're completely in the clear,' but my results are exactly what the doctors expected."" Eric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life. ""I appreciate life much more now,"" he says. ""I don't let myself get upset about the little nitpicky things anymore. Food even seems to taste better. It is really great."" As for Shanteau's swimming career, he plans to compete in the 2009 World Swimming Championship in Rome, Italy. ""2012 [the next Olympics] is a push for me. Right now I'm just kind of taking it year by year and we'll see what happens.""","Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau found out about his cancer in June .

"As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues high-level talks with Mexico's leaders this week, her comments about responsibility in the U.S.-Mexico drug trade have struck a chord with officials familiar with U.S. anti-drug efforts. Mexican federal police have been deployed openly in Ciudad Juarez, which borders El Paso, Texas. Clinton said the United States' ""inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border"" was a major contributor in Mexican violence along the border.  She went on to say that the United States has ""a co-responsibility."" In an interview Wednesday on ""American Morning"" with CNN anchor John Roberts, former Drug Enforcement Agency special agent Robert Strang talked about the three-pronged approach needed to curb drug use in America and the need to bust distribution rings. Strang is also CEO of Investigative Management Group. The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: . John Roberts, CNN anchor: Everybody's blaming Mexico for [the U.S. drug trade], but the secretary of state yesterday said, 'Hey, the United States shares a lot of the blame because of the pent-up demand here, the insatiable demand for drugs.' Do you agree with her?  Watch Clinton say, ""We have to do a better job"" » . Robert Strang, former DEA special agent: Let's face it, the average first drug use is 12 years old in our country. That means kids that are in the sixth grade are trying drugs for the first time. Marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, all these drugs are coming across the border because we demand them. We have the cash to pay for them, and we really are pretty much the No. 1 consumer in the world for these drugs. Roberts: Is the United States doing enough to try to curb demand? The Office of National Drug Control Policy, I don't remember much coming out of it during the Bush administration, and I haven't seen anything come out of it in the Obama administration. Strang: We're trying all the time. I'm on the board for D.A.R.E. America, and that is teaching kids about the dangers of drugs and violence in schools. And constantly, we're trying to get money federally for this program and police officers go into the school. They teach the kids. It's a wonderful program in those trouble years, the fourth, fifth and sixth grade especially, and we need to have a little bit more money in this area. amFIX: React to Strang's comments about U.S. anti-drug effort . There's three things, John: It's treatment, it's enforcement and it's education. And it's like a three-legged stool. If all three things don't work, it's going to fall down. So, we can send all of the agents in the world down to the border. We can seize all the coke, heroin, methamphetamine that we want. If we don't have treatment on demand, and if we're not educating our kids in our country about the dangers of drugs, the problem's going to grow. Roberts: When you see the Department of Homeland Security prepared to spend these hundreds of millions of dollars on border security, what do you think? Strang: I'm happy that they're doing something. This is a small piece of the enforcement operation. The best thing to do is like the case that we saw three weeks ago, when the DEA announced 750 arrests involving 250 cities between Mexico and the United States, mostly in the U.S., this huge distribution network. Because when you dismantle those networks that constantly are putting drugs from the cartels to the street, when you can put those guys in jail, when you take their assets, then you have an impact.  Watch how drugs from Mexico enter U.S. » . Roberts: But would you like to see them take some of that money, and you know, they take, I think, what, $700 million, and they throw it at the border. Would you like to see them take some of that money, maybe even just a fraction of it, and throw it into prevention programs? Strang: Absolutely. Instead of going to some of the financial institutions, I'd like to see it go for the drug problem. I'd like to see enforcement, treatment and prevention. I'd like it to be evenly divided, and I really think we could have an impact on the problem. We've got to look at this a different way. And I think that it's a combination of these things, and we're moving in that direction. Let's hope that we make some headway here.","Robert Strang, former DEA special agent, says drug use starts as early as 12 .
Strang: ""We can send all of the agents in the world,"" but border patrol not enough .
Money aimed at financial institutions should go to prevention programs, Strang says ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Americans have varied feelings about guns. In Focus: Guns in America is a series of stories by CNN photojournalists that looks at the complex views and emotions that surround this controversial subject. In a 5-4 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Washington, D.C.'s, ban on handgun ownership, saying it violates the constitutional right to ""keep and bear arms"" by preventing individuals from having guns in their homes. In this series, Americans tell their stories about guns on a first-hand basis, providing a more intimate look at a topic that is often ignored until gun violence erupts. In one video, 32-year-old Steve Ferguson talks about a shooting in Washington that left him paralyzed, his battle to recover and his views on guns. In another story, Scott Morris shares his passion for his shooting range on a road he named 2nd Amendment Drive. CNN photojournalists also traveled to Massachusetts to play paintball, rural Pennsylvania to hunt turkeys, and to Hollywood to hang out on a movie set. They also meet Dale Tate, who hand-makes guns that he considers works of art, and they learn about new technology for less lethal weapons.","The U.S. Supreme Court rejects Washington, D.C.'s, ban on handgun ownership .

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Palestinian militants fired more rockets into Israel on Friday as a tenuous six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired. Palestinian children look at a blast crater following an Israeli airstrike over southern Gaza on December 18. Two Qassam rockets were fired Friday morning from Gaza into separate Israeli communities, the Israel Defense Forces said. Earlier, Palestinians in Gaza shot at Israeli farmers working in their fields in Kibbutz Nirim, the IDF said. No one was hurt in the attacks and one car was damaged, it added. Islamic Jihad sources claimed responsibility for firing the rockets. Under the Egytian-brokered truce, which began June 19, the Hamas government in Gaza agreed to end militant attacks from Gaza on Israel. The pledge applied to all militant groups in the coastal territory, including Islamic Jihad. In return, Israel agreed to halt raids inside Gaza and ease its blockade. The truce held well for the first four months but began to fall apart in October, when there was a marked increase in the number of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel -- estimated at 200. Israel resumed airstrikes in Gaza as a result.  Watch what may follow the end of the truce » . Israel has said a major military operation in Gaza may be unavoidable if daily rocket fire from the territory continues. However, both sides have expressed a desire not to see the situation worsen. Islamic Jihad said it planned a rally in Gaza City in the afternoon, after Friday prayers, announcing the end of the truce but also calling for a lifting of the Israeli siege. Israel has tightened its restrictions on border crossings and the flow of goods into the impoverished territory, making life extremely difficult for residents. Gaza depends on Israel for 90 percent of its imports, according to the U.N. Development Program. -- CNN's Ben Wedeman and Michal Zippori contributed to this report.","Egyptian-brokered truce, which began June 19, has expired .

"(CNN) -- Two inmates at New Jersey's Union County Jail made a movie-style escape Saturday and remained at large Monday, according to Union County Prosecutor Ted Romankow. Otis Blunt, left, and Jose Espinosa escaped from the Union County Jail Saturday night, officials say. Twenty-year-old Jose Espinosa and 32-year-old Otis Blunt, who are considered armed and dangerous, were discovered missing from their cells at about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, Romankow said. The men left behind dummies in their beds, cinder block dust and a note wishing authorities ""Happy Holidays."" Espinosa, who recently pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter, was to be sentenced on January 25 and faced a minimum of 17 years in prison. Blunt was being held in lieu of $75,000 bond on weapon and robbery charges. Both men were being housed in the high security area of the multilevel jail, Romankow said. Police said Espinosa and Blunt were in adjacent cells and used a long metal wire to scrape away mortar around the cinder block between their cells and the outer wall in Espinosa's cell. Once the cement block between the cells was removed, they smashed the block and hid the pieces in a footlocker. According to police, Blunt, who is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 210 pounds, squeezed into Espinosa's cell through an approximately 16- to 18-inch hole. The two inmates wiggled through another 18-inch hole in the outer wall. From a roof landing, the two men ""took a running jump or they were standing and they jumped approximately 15 feet out and about 30 feet down,"" Romankow said. Then they jumped a razor-wire fence onto a New Jersey transit railroad bed to freedom, police said. Authorities found two sets of footprints in the snow heading in opposite directions. At a news conference Monday, Romankow read the note that was found in Espinosa's cell, saying it represented the ""arrogance of these two men."" ""Thank you officer -------- for the tools needed, you're a real pal, Happy Holidays,"" the note read, with a smiley face drawn next to it. Authorities are investigating the note's claims about the guard, the Associated Press reported. The guard has not turned in a report and disciplinary action has not been taken, Romankow said, according to AP. To delay discovery of the escape, Espinosa and Blunt used dummies made of sheets and pillows in their beds. They also hung photographs of bikini-clad women to hide the holes in the walls, a move reminiscent of a scene in the Hollywood hit ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Romankow played down the comparison. ""I think this is a very serious situation you saw,"" he said. ""I really prefer not to compare with any movie, although I can understand why you might because it does look certainly very similar to some of them. Except in 'The Shawshank Redemption' they had a better poster on the wall."" According to police, Blunt tried to escape in September using similar methods. There is an $8,000 reward for the men's capture. Romankow said a statewide hunt is under way, with several agencies involved. E-mail to a friend .

"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely on current events. Julian E. Zelizer says Democrats should be questioning themselves on several key points. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- This week, Jews will conclude the eight-day celebration of Passover, a holiday that has often found its way into the political realm. Civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. frequently invoked the story of the liberation of the Jewish people from the Egyptians in his struggle against white oppression. President Obama made headlines last week when he hosted a Passover Seder in the White House. Today, Democrats can draw an important lesson from Passover, this time not so much from the story that is retold during the holiday but through the rituals that are the focus of the week. Last Wednesday and Thursday evenings, Jews gathered with families, friends and other groups to have a Seder. These meals are not just about eating and talking, but also about learning and debating the stories of the holiday contained in a book called the Haggadah. There is no right answer to many of the questions that are raised, and discussions change over time as the life experiences of the participants bring new perspectives to the table. The highlight of the Seder is when the youngest child asks the Four Questions, asking the adults what makes these nights different from the others and then offering some possible answers. Politicians could learn a lot from the Seder, particularly when one party controls both the executive and the legislative branch, and the temptation is to act in lock-step. Republicans did not have enough moments of questioning and reflection between 2002 and 2006, which many observers agree was not just damaging to the country but to the party as well. While there was strong private, internal disagreement among Republicans over how to conduct the war on terror, over whether the war in Iraq was a wise move and over the basic contours of economic policy, most Republicans stayed silent in public. Even when they gathered in the private corridors of the White House, according to memoirs that have been published by former officials such as Scott McClellan, Republicans tended to remain deferential to President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. Historically, vigorous internal party debate has had the ability to strengthen a party politically. The fight that took place between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries, where Reagan pushed President Ford to be more responsive to the growing conservative movement and avoid making all his decisions from inside the beltway, created a GOP that in the 1980s was a formidable political force. Bill Clinton's insistence that Democrats needed to rethink some of their conventional wisdom from the New Deal and Great Society periods, with his preference being to move toward the center, opened up a healthy debate about what Democrats should stand for that helped result in Barack Obama's victory in 2008. Thus far, Democrats have been more comfortable openly criticizing each other. Princeton economist Paul Krugman has emerged as the leading liberal critic of the administration by arguing that President Obama is not spending enough to stimulate the economy and that his financial bailout plan will only provide Band-Aid solutions that place all the risk on taxpayers. But Democrats will feel less comfortable having internal debates as the elections of 2010 and 2012 get closer, as the pressures of re-election intensify and as Republicans become more aggressive and more coherent in their attacks. To get the conversation started, it would be worth thinking about the four questions that Democrats should keep asking when they get together in the next few years. The first is: What are the issues on which Democrats are willing to compromise with Republicans, if any? The compromises will not be easy given that Republicans have refused to endorse Democratic proposals in the first few months of Obama's presidency. However, if the popularity of the GOP continues to erode and Obama's stays strong, there might be an opportunity for the president to act. Compromises means giving something up, so Democrats will have to talk among themselves about what that might be. The second question is: Where are Democrats willing to renege on campaign promises? Since November, Democrats have already backed off some very big promises. Though Obama ran as a candidate who promised to change the way that government worked, government reform has quickly dropped off the agenda. Nor has the White House been fully compliant with its promise to end the secrecy practiced by the Bush administration. It is natural that a party won't be able to do everything it said in a campaign, but Democrats need to think about which issues they are willing to let go and which they are determined to fulfill. The third question is: What is the foreign policy agenda of the current administration? This has been the murkiest part of the First 100 Days. When Barack Obama ran for president, it was clear what kind of foreign policy he opposed. His campaign took aim at the unilateralism, militarism and pre-emptive strategy of the Bush administration. Yet it is easier to be against something than for something. Now the burden is on President Obama to define what he will be about in the next four years and what he hopes to pursue. This agenda will be dynamic and unfold as international crises occur. But Democrats need to keep coming back to the questions and keep forcing the president to articulate what his goals are in this arena. The final question is: What are the policy priorities of the Democratic Party? This is always one of the most difficult questions for any party given that events move politics in unexpected directions. This White House has naturally been consumed by the economic freefall and the effort to stabilize economic conditions. With his budget, Obama has highlighted two priorities from the campaign -- health care and the environment, though some will get traded away in upcoming negotiations. Another issue that the White House may make a priority is immigration reform. Whereas the campaign established a certain framework for thinking about priorities, that framework fades as the election moves farther away. Democrats must keep getting together, asking their own version of the four questions and insisting on internal debates. Although the discussions can become uncomfortable (as most Jews will recall from their Seders), this is a formula for making the strongest party possible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Passover Seders involve four questions asked by youngest .

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Ahri's chin quivers, and his large dark eyes fill with tears the 11-year-old can't control. Holding Eka Jaya, Nuraini leads son Ahri, 11, to the orphanage with dad Joni Lubis and brother Mohammed. ""Be tough. I am sorry you have to go,"" his grandmother whispers while hugging him. His parents are taking Ahri to live in an orphanage. They swear they are not abandoning their son. ""I am not throwing my child away,"" says his mother, Nuraini, wiping away tears. ""I just want him to get a proper education. I hope that one day he'll do something useful for this country and help his brothers, because we are living in poverty."" The family lives crammed into a home that's 17 feet by 17 feet in a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Jakarta. Nuraini runs a small shop the family opened to try to make ends meet. Ahri's father, Joni Lubis, collects bottles from the streets, selling them to plastic and glass factories.  Watch Ahri say goodbye » . Ahri's parents make $2 to $3 a day, with about half of that going toward their daily rent. With the increased cost of living, what's left just isn't enough to send Ahri to school and to feed him and his two brothers, 3-year-old Mohammed and 7-month-old Eka Jaya. ""I never imagined it would come to this,"" Nuraini admits. But for many Indonesians, it has. More than 80 percent of children in child care institutions have both their parents, according to the most recent survey conducted in 2006 by the Indonesian government. A recent study by Save the Children, UNICEF and the government says Indonesia -- the world's fourth most populous nation -- has more orphanages than any other country. This year, orphanages are reporting even higher number of parents giving up their children because they can no longer afford to feed them or send them to school. In the past year, the cost of living increased beyond many people's reach. In May, a 30 percent fuel hike set off countrywide protests. Ahri peers intently as his mother signs off custody of him to the orphanage. The other children cram their faces up against the window to see the new arrival. At least half of them at the Putra Utama 1 orphanage have been through this before as well. ""The prices have gone up. [Families] can't balance their income with the prices,"" orphanage staffer Utari says. ""By putting their children here, they are hoping that their children's education will improve."" It doesn't take long for Ahri to make new friends. Soon, he's stuffing rice into his mouth and chatting with the other boys. His parents stand against the doorway and watch their son playing soccer. Here at least, there's enough space to do so. ""If my son can adapt, then I am happy,"" says Ahri's father, Joni Lubis. ""I can see that it's calm and peaceful here. That makes me happy. So does the school -- my son can be educated."" Nuraini adds, ""There has to be a better chance for my two other sons."" It's all they can hope for: that economic pressures will ease so they won't have to face such a decision again.","Mother of three insists she is not ""throwing away"" her first-born child .

"(CNN) -- Taliban advances in Pakistan are raising concerns in Islamabad and capitals as far away as Washington. CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson looks at how the Taliban spread and what could be done to help Pakistan. Students in burqas in Buner district . How is the Taliban extending its influence in Pakistan? It has extended its influence considerably over the last few years moving northwards along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, from South Waziristan to North Waziristan to Bajur and across now to Swat and Buner. But the Taliban has also extended its influence because it is now involved with several Punjab terrorist groups that have affiliated themselves with the border Taliban and have helped commit some attacks such as one on a police station in Lahore. The Pakistan government has been cutting deals with the different elements that were Taliban or became Taliban since 2004-2005. Those deals have enabled the Taliban to extend themselves. Is Pakistan going to fall or fail? The overall answer to that is no. But the Taliban is further destabilizing an incredibly unstable situation. There is a weak government that faces challenges, not only from the Taliban but also from almost every political party in the country. It faces challenges from across the border with its old enemy India, which means a large percentage of the Pakistan army is tied up on that border rather than fighting terrorism. The Taliban is not going to take Islamabad, but its attacks and advances are going to weaken an already unstable government and make an already dangerous situation even more volatile... and that will mean the Taliban will be able to wield more influence in the future than they do today. What options are open to the Pakistan government and other countries? Pakistan could form a broad-based government of national unity and appeal for more international support in terms of encouraging financial aid and having trade restrictions lifted so they can improve the economy. The international community could help Pakistan resolve issues with India. It would help the economy and help the government focus on its own internal problems and better influence the situation in Afghanistan. What the Pakistan government would also need to do is convince its people that outside support and help is in their best interests to deal with terrorism and stabilize the country. To do that the government would also have to win the support of its large Pashtun minority, from whom the Taliban draws a lot of its support ... and that is difficult particularly as the U.S. -- which would need to be a principle supporter of Pakistan -- continues to bomb targets in Pashtun areas leading to civilian casualties.","Taliban influences in Pakistan has developed over years .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Obama administration is giving General Motors 60 days worth of financing for restructuring, according to senior administration officials. General Motors' Rick Wagoner, CEO of the company since 2000, is on his way out, sources say. Chrysler will receive as much as $6 billion and 30 days to complete an agreement with Italian automaker Fiat, the officials said. Meanwhile, White House and GM sources told CNN Sunday that GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner will resign as part of the federal government's bailout strategy for the troubled automaker. Wagoner's departure comes as President Obama is expected to announce Monday the latest details of the government's plans for restructuring GM and Chrysler LLC, which have been pushed to the brink by huge losses and a sharp decline in sales. Fritz Henderson, GM's chief operating officer, is expected to be named GM's interim CEO, according to two GM sources. A GM spokesman declined to comment on reports of Wagoner's resignation. A company statement said: ""We are anticipating an announcement soon from the administration regarding the restructuring of the U.S. auto industry."" GM and Chrysler face a Tuesday deadline to prove to the Treasury Department that they can be viable in the long term. Without such a finding, the government can recall the $13.4 billion it already loaned to GM and the $4 billion it loaned to Chrysler. Wagoner, a 32-year company veteran, has been CEO of General Motors since 2000. Before becoming CEO, he was chief operating officer and led the company's North American operations. He also served as chief financial officer from 1992 to 1994. A senior GM official official told CNN that the White House and its auto task force had ""sent very clear signals"" that the key to more help was ""new leadership"" and something that would help the administration see real change. General Motors has been hit hard as auto sales have plummeted. Sales have continued to tumble through the early months of this year, falling 40 percent across the industry and about 50 percent at GM and Chrysler. The companies and industry analysts have slashed their sales estimates for the year, and that has heightened the need for more loans to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. Last month, the two companies filed reports on their restructuring efforts. GM said it needed up to $16.6 billion more in loans. Chrysler asked for an additional $5 billion, and said it would need the money by the end of March to avoid running out of cash. The Obama administration had been widely expected to approve the requests. Obama has repeatedly spoken about the importance of saving the struggling auto industry, and on March 19, the Treasury Department announced $5 billion in federal help for GM's and Chrysler's auto parts suppliers. CNN's Kate Bolduan and John King contributed to this report.","Departure of General Motors' CEO part of government's bailout strategy, sources say .

"(CNN) -- A thin girl with caramel skin and a yellow silk blouse walks alone through a barren landscape of rubble. Nway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt's garden. Her legs are marked by cuts. Her face is smeared with white streaks of powder. And her eyes are blank as she sifts through the debris of what used to be her home before Cyclone Nargis slammed into Myanmar one night and swept her parents away. Her name is Nway, and that's how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village. She refused to talk about the cyclone, pretending it never took place. She became, according to a CNN story, the ""girl who refuses to remember."" A year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing. She found Nway living in a tidy, bamboo house flanked by palm trees. The 8-year-old greeted her visitor with a big smile. Then she asked whether she could play with her visitor's hair. Pam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country. ""After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl,"" said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group. ""She wasn't shy about reaching out to touch my blonde hair."" The night everything changed . Nway's resilience is shared by many in Myanmar, aid workers say. Last year's cyclone was catastrophic. It killed at least 140,000 people and left at least 2 million people without homes, according to the United Nations World Food Programme. The brunt of the storm hit Myanmar's delta region, the country's bread basket. It wiped out crops, shrimp farms and fish ponds. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say. Yet some sense of normal life is returning, said Mia Marina, a program support manager for World Vision's Nargis response efforts. World Vision is building cyclone-resistant schools and providing supplies to cyclone survivors. ""Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods,"" Marina said. ""Kids are going to school. The markets are open."" The people of Myanmar are also buying planting tools and seed in preparation for the monsoon rains that typically come in May, Sitko said. ""Everyone is hoping that this is the moment that it turns around,"" Sitko said. ""It's an exciting time, a time of hope."" That hope appears to have spread to Nway. She is fortunate to be alive. The cyclone killed her mother and father. The winds were so powerful that they blew away the village buffalo. In Nway's village, 120 people out of a population of 430 people lost their lives. Nway survived because she was staying with her aunt. The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman's house to survive, Sitko said. Nway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later. She would walk away whenever she was asked about that night. Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss. Sitko said Nway shared one memory from the morning after the cyclone while sitting in her aunt's house: . ""When I walked to my aunt's house that day, my legs were scratched, and I passed lots of dead bodies,"" Nway said. ""I wanted to help, because everyone was working, but I was too scared, so I only helped clean up my auntie's yard."" Nway dreams of her future . Nway prefers to talk about other subjects. One is her new job. She helps her aunt sell vegetables from their garden. On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it's used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar). Then she balances a tray of vegetables on her head and walks to a village road to call out to potential customers. Nway told Sitko that she's made ""four new best friends."" They like to memorize new words and play hide and seek after school. ""I'm always the fastest runner,"" she told Sitko. Nway is starting to become aware of life outside her village. ""She was very proud,"" Sitko said. ""She explained that she had recently taken a trip to another village with her aunties, and she wasn't afraid."" Nway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. She'll have to pay to attend school away from her village one day, but her aunt and uncle can't afford the costs. ""She wanted to study and said that she was smart,"" Sitko said. ""She said she would be willing to travel to a school outside of her village if she had to."" Nway has already taken a more difficult journey. The shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said. Now Nway can remember -- and smile again. ""I was expecting a very different girl,"" Sitko said. ""The little girl I met was very confident. I think she's been really transformed by our experience.""","Girl who survives Myanmar cyclone pretends it never happened .

"(CNN) -- Environmentalists are encouraged by President Barack Obama's focus this week on renewable energy and stricter emissions standards, although some economists are skeptical he can pull the country out of the recession while cleaning up the planet. President Barack Obama with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. Obama must strike a careful balance between stimulating the economy in the coming months and investing in the long-term future of the environment, said Raj Chetty, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""If you spend money too quickly, you lose site of the long-term vision,"" Chetty told CNN. ""If you focus too much on the long term, you may not act on spending money."" Framing his remarks with an eye on the recession, the president on Monday announced a plan for ""a new energy economy that will build millions of jobs."" Obama proposes to put 460,000 Americans to work through clean energy investments, increasing fuel efficiency in vehicles and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By 2025, the Obama administration hopes one-fourth of the nation's energy will come from renewable sources. Over the long term, the president hopes to create millions of new jobs by investing $150 billion in taxpayer money to help private companies develop new sources of clean energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power. It's about time, say scientists who often clashed with former President George W. Bush on environmental policy. ""By repowering our nation with clean energy, we will create millions of jobs that can't be sent overseas. By harnessing the energy of the sun and wind, we can refuel our nation and end our addiction to oil,"" said Wesley Warren, director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Environmental scholars, however, say the changes Obama seeks are not easy. ""These technologies are not new. They have been around for 10 to 15 years,"" said Bill Chameides, dean of the Nicholas School of Environment at Duke University. ""Government can push new policies, but it has to prove to be economically competitive or else it will not happen."" ""It is going to require massive investments,"" said Joseph Romm, former acting assistant secretary of energy under the Clinton administration and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ""The only question is, are we going to be the leader and export our technologies or a follower and continue importing our resources?"" Some economists question whether spending government money on new energy technologies is the best way to stimulate the economy in the short term. Opponents of Obama's proposals say renewable energy would be expensive, take up large amounts of land, and might not even be able to generate sufficient energy given the aging infrastructure of the nation's electric grid. ""If the private sector will not invest in these technologies, it will not be efficient,"" said Alan Reynolds, senior fellow at the Cato Institute. ""Creating jobs by switching from one form of energy to another is a bad idea,"" he added. ""You don't need subsidies for anything that is free. Getting a $7,000 rebate on a $100,000 plug-in electrical hybrid that gets its power from a coal plant doesn't make a lot of sense."" Several events in Washington this week underscored the Obama administration's commitment to environmental issues. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday named a special envoy to pursue global agreements combating global warming. On Wednesday, former Vice President Al Gore urged Congress to approve Obama's stimulus package and said the United States needs to join international talks on a climate-change treaty. ""For years our efforts to address the climate crisis have been undermined by the idea that we must chose between our planet and our way of life, between our moral duty and economic well-being these are false choices,"" Gore told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""In fact, the solutions to the climate crisis are the same solutions that will address our economic and national crisis as well."" Obama may have science on his side. By overwhelming consensus, scientists agree that our warming planet poses a greater global threat with every passing day. The replacement of current technology with energy generated from natural resources, such as sunlight and wind, could help reduce CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050, according to the International Energy Agency. ""Frankly the science is screaming at us,"" said Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, at Wednesday's hearing. ""Carbon dioxide emissions grew at a rate of four times faster in the Bush administration than they did in the 1990s."" Even so, experts agree the faltering economy will complicate any discussion about investment in clean energy. ""The country is running two deficits,"" said David Orr, a professor of environmental studies and politics at Oberlin College, ""the economy in the short term, which will take one to five years to figure out [and] the environment in the long term, which if we don't do anything about it will see catastrophic effects.""","Environmentalists are encouraged by President Obama's focus on renewable energy .

"(CNN) -- North Korea vowed Wednesday that it ""will take every necessary measure to protect its sovereignty"" in the midst of 12-day U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises. South Korean soldiers move into a building during a joint military exercise with U.S. troops in Pocheon Tuesday. ""These war exercises were kicked off by the U.S. and the South Korean puppet war-like forces across South Korea at a time when the inter-Korean relations have reached the worst phase and the situation has grown so tense that a war may break out (at) any moment due to the reckless policy of confrontation pursued by the South Korean conservative authorities,"" North Korea's official KCNA news agency said. Referring to ""war maneuvers"" and ""nuclear war exercises,"" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said they were ""designed to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) in terms of their scale and contents from A to Z,"" according to KCNA. South Korea has defended the joint exercises. ""We have said several times that the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are annual defensive exercises,"" said Kim Ho-nyun, a Unification Ministry spokesman, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Monday. ""We again urge North Korea to maintain the agreed stance of mutual respect and to stop its verbal attacks and actions that are raising tensions on the Korean peninsula,"" he said. Tensions have ramped up in recent days, as North Korea threatened retaliation in the event of an interception of its ""satellite"" launch. U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2, under the guise of launching a satellite into space. The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii. On Saturday U.S. envoy Stephen Bosworth said he wanted dialogue with North Korea, but he also spoke against North Korea's move to go forward with a launch, saying it would be ""ill-advised.""","N.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Bush has expressed his ""deep concern"" and regret to Iraq's prime minister over the desecration of a Quran by an American soldier, the White House said Tuesday. President Bush called Nuri al-Maliki over the incident, al-Maliki's office says. The leaders are seen in September. National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Bush spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday in one of their regularly scheduled secure video teleconferences. ""President Bush expressed his deep concern over the incident and told Prime Minister Maliki that the soldier has been reprimanded by his commanders and removed from Iraq,"" Johndroe said. Al-Maliki's office on Tuesday said Bush issued an apology for the action on behalf of the United States and ""promised to present the soldier to the courts."" The office said Bush made the apology in a call to al-Maliki on Tuesday morning. An American staff sergeant -- a sniper section leader -- used a Quran for target practice in Iraq earlier this month. The U.S. commander in Baghdad issued a formal apology Saturday and read a letter of apology by the shooter.  Watch the U.S. military formally apologize » . The sergeant has been relieved of duty as a section leader ""with prejudice,"" officially reprimanded by his commanding general, dismissed from his regiment and redeployed -- reassigned to the United States, the U.S. military said. Reports of the Quran desecration have enraged Muslims in Iraq and elsewhere around the world. The soldier, whose name was not released, shot at a Quran on May 9, villagers said. The Quran used in the incident was discovered two days later, according to the military. A tribal leader said ""the criminal act by U.S. forces"" took place at a shooting range at the Radhwaniya police station on Baghdad's western outskirts. After the shooters left, an Iraqi policeman found a target marked in the middle of the bullet-riddled Quran. Pictures of the Quran show multiple bullet holes and an expletive scrawled on one of its pages. Officials said the soldier asserted he wasn't aware the book was the Quran, but U.S. officials rejected the claim. On Saturday, Maj. Gen. Jeffery Hammond, commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, appeared with leaders from Radhwaniya and apologized. ""I come before you here seeking your forgiveness,"" Hammond said to tribal leaders and others at the ceremony. ""In the most humble manner I look in your eyes today and I say please forgive me and my soldiers."" Hammond also read a letter from the shooter, who called his actions ""shortsighted, very reckless and irresponsible,"" but he insisted he was not being malicious. ""I sincerely hope that my actions have not diminished the partnership that our two nations have developed together,"" the letter said. Hammond said the soldier's actions were tantamount to ""criminal behavior."" ""I've come to this land to protect you, to support you -- not to harm you -- and the behavior of this soldier was nothing short of wrong and unacceptable,"" the general said. Another military official kissed a Quran and presented it as ""a humble gift"" to the tribal leaders. Many Iraqi leaders said the apology alone would not suffice.  Watch villagers protest the desecration » . On Monday, the Iraqi Islamic Party, the movement of Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, condemned what it said was a ""blatant assault on the sanctities of Muslims all over the world."" The party said it reacted to the news ""with deep resentment and indignation"" and wants the ""severest of punishments"" for the action. ""What truly concerns us is the repetition of these crimes that have happened in the past when mosques were destroyed and pages of the holy Quran were torn and used for disgraceful acts by U.S. soldiers,"" al-Hashimi said. ""I have asked that first this apology be officially documented; second a guarantee from the U.S. military to inflict the maximum possible punishment on this soldier so it would be a deterrent for the rest of the soldiers in the future.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The negotiations are over. The treaty has been signed. The skies across the Atlantic are now open for free movement of flights between European and U.S. cities. Now the battle commences between airlines as they prepare for their new-found commercial freedom when the Open Skies agreement comes into action in March 2008. The choice of transatlantic routes is set to increases with the advent of the Open Skies agreement. The main beneficiaries of increased competition between airlines are likely to be business travelers. And while they may not see a dramatic reduction in ticket prices, they can look forward to a greater choice of flights from a greater number of airlines as well as an increase in business-only services. Airlines with the strongest brands and best quality products are likely to lure passengers away from European rivals by launching flights from other major European cities. British Airways has confirmed it will launch its first transatlantic flights from continental European cities once the agreement comes into place next year. And while it is not ready to confirm branding, types of aircraft, or even final routes, a BA spokesperson said likely contenders for new transatlantic routes will be from business destinations such as Paris, Frankfurt, Brussels and Milan. She also confirmed that, contrary to expectations, these flights would not be exclusively business class. Though they will offer premium cabins for business customers. Virgin Atlantic is expecting to place a greater focus on its business customers and has established a team to work towards the launch of business-only flights in 2009. These will fly from airports such as Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Zurich and the airline is currently in discussion with Airbus and Boeing to place orders for between 10 and 15 aircraft. Virgin and BA are both confident they can entice customers away from European national carriers due to the strength of their brands and service offering. As Paul Charles, director of corporate communications at Virgin Atlantic says, ""we are seen as a truly global brand and well-placed to compete with the quality of business services currently coming out of cities such as Paris and Milan."" Open Skies will put an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines to fly transatlantic out of Heathrow. As a result, airlines including BMI, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines are all lined up to launch direct transatlantic flights from Heathrow from next year. But with the airport currently operating at almost-maximum capacity, it is likely that new flights will be limited. Airlines operating from other airports, in particular the new business-only players such as Eos, Silverjet and Maxje, will, however, see an opportunity to expand their own services across the Atlantic. Joshua Marks, executive vice president for planning and development at U.S. business-class airline, Maxjet, says it expects to ""strengthen its position at Stansted"" as a result of the Open Skies agreement. ""With more flights moving from Gatwick to Heathrow, three major airports will become two in London."" As such, he adds, Stansted could become the default airport for travelers coming from and to the east of the city. Now that the U.S. Department of Transport has given approval for Maxjet to launch flights from Stansted to other countries with open skies agreements with the U.S., business travelers in London should also be able to pick up Maxjet flights to destinations such as India. Maxjet has confirmed that it will not fight for slots at Heathrow, which Marks says has become an ""operational nightmare."" Yet, other premium-only services are not ruling out the move. Silverjet, currently operating out of Luton, has been in discussion with (un-named) airlines interested in striking deals to launch flights out of Heathrow. Opportunities have been offered for flights to U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, says Lawrence Hunt, Silverjet's chief executive. ""This is an ongoing dialogue,"" he says. But before they make the move, they would need to see major changes to facilities at Heathrow in order for it to offer the ""personalized, discreet and carefree"" travel experience Silverjet offers customers from Luton. ""Heathrow has become a zoo and the customer experience has become appalling,"" he says. Airline executives agree that growth in transatlantic flights as a result of the Open Skies agreement will be aimed at business customers. As Hunt says, airlines have little else to offer, or gain, in terms of economy long-haul seats. And as Charles at Virgin points out, given the success of the new business-only entrants and the simultaneous ongoing demand for its business class seats, ""there's clearly a market out there for business-only flights."" While there may be some softening of prices from Heathrow as airlines fight for slots, few expect prices for business travelers to drop dramatically as a result of the Open Skies agreement. As BA's spokesperson says, UK to North America is already a very competitive market. ""It is not as if we are moving from a monopoly,"" she says. Despite this, there is still a great deal to offer business customers and those that will make the most of the opportunity, says Anthony Concil, spokesperson from IATA, will be the most innovative. ""We have created a new playing field and it is up to players to make the most of that and for governments to take the agreement forward towards further liberalization.""

"(CNN)  -- The United Nations has sent police and military patrols to a camp in western Sudan after reports fighting there killed civilians, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday. A file photo of refugees queuing for food in the Kalma camp in western Sudan. Aid groups have started evacuating wounded from the Kalma camp, home to 80,000 internally displaced people in the Darfur region of western Sudan. The U.N. said it received reports that Sudanese police vehicles surrounded the camp and that civilians were killed Monday during subsequent attacks inside the camp. The U.N. African Union Mission in Darfur ""is extremely concerned by this serious incident [and the] circumstances will be investigated,"" the mission said in a statement. ""It is closely monitoring the situation and [calls] on all parties to exercise restraint."" A spokesman for the mission, Noureddine Nezni, said Tuesday the Dutch wing of Medecins Sans Frontieres had evacuated 47 wounded people who were being treated at a nearby hospital. Some of them -- mostly young men -- refused to be evacuated for fear of being arrested for having participated in the fighting, Nezni said. Nezni would not say how many people were killed in the Monday attacks. ""There are many figures being thrown around and we hesitate to give any numbers before we are sure,"" he said. ""We are still checking and hopefully we will have the correct figure late today."" The Sudanese government said it entered the camp to look for ""huge quantities of arms and criminals,"" Nezni said. The U.N. African Union Mission in Darfur said it sent police and military patrols to Kalma to confirm the details of the incident and provide assistance. Nezni added that the mission and some aid groups were in talks with refugees at the camp to find a lasting solution to the problems. Fighting has displaced more than two million Sudanese -- and more than 238,000 refugees live in camps across the border in eastern Chad, the U.N. says. They have been displaced by fighting that broke out in 2003, when rebels began an uprising in Darfur and the government launched a brutal counter-insurgency campaign. The Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the U.N., Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength. In the past five years, an estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease, or malnutrition, the U.N. says. Another 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces, and allied Janjaweed militias. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court filed genocide charges against Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir last month for the campaign of violence in Darfur.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- More than 200 people have died of meningitis in the past week alone in Niger and Nigeria, according to the World Health Organization. A health care worker vaccinates a child during an earlier outbreak of meningitis in Niger. The disease is an epidemic in 76 areas of the two countries, the health agency reported Wednesday. A spokesman for W.H.O. in Nigeria, Dr. Olaokun Soyinka, said Saturday that the outbreak is bigger than usual and stretches across the African meningitis belt from east- to west-sub-Saharan Africa. The outbreak began around the start of the year, Soyinka told CNN. It usually peaks in the dry season because of dust, winds and cold nights, before dipping around May when the rains come, he said. A shortage of vaccines means officials are relying on ""effective prevention,"" in which they watch for outbreaks and then vaccinate people in the epicenter and surrounding areas, Soyinka told CNN. There have been nearly 25,000 suspected cases and more than 1,500 deaths in the meningitis belt in the first 11 weeks of the year, W.H.O. reported. More than 85 percent of those cases happened in northern Nigeria and Niger. Nigeria's Ministry of Health has reported 17,462 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 960 deaths, the world health agency said. In the past week, it reported 4,164 suspected cases with 171 deaths. Sixty-six local government areas in Nigeria have crossed the epidemic threshold. Epidemic thresholds are a way the W.H.O. confirms the emergence of an epidemic so it can step up vaccinations and other management measures. Niger's Ministry of Health has reported 4,513 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 169 deaths, since the start of the year. In the past week, 1,071 suspected cases and 30 deaths have been reported, the W.H.O. said. Ten of Niger's 42 districts have crossed the epidemic threshold. By comparison, other countries are reporting fewer than 50 cases a week. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. Several different bacteria can cause meningitis but Neisseria meningitidis -- which is to blame for this outbreak -- is one of the most significant because of its potential to cause epidemics. Health authorities have released 2.3 million doses of vaccine to Nigeria and 1.9 million doses to Niger, the W.H.O. said. CNN's Christian Purefoy in Lagos, Nigeria, contributed to this report.","W.H.O.: Meningitis killed more than 200 people in the past week in Niger and Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people packed a soccer stadium in Cameroon Thursday, including President Paul Biya and his wife, for the first large-scale mass of Pope Benedict XVI's first visit to Africa. Tens of thousands of people gathered at a football stadium in Cameroon to see the pope. Africa is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope. ""He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the (Roman Catholic) Church, as it is for all of Christianity,"" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular."" One in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from less than one in fifty in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database. So Benedict is making the visit although travel ""is not his cup of tea,"" Gibson said. ""John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through.""  Watch the pope at the soccer stadium » . But Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of ""The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World."" Benedict drew cheers at the mass at the 40,000-seat Amadou Ahidjo Stadium when he told worshippers that God had not forgotten orphans, poor and abused children, and those ""forced to join paramilitary forces,"" Cameroon TV reported. He did not mention condoms, a subject which sparked controversy when he reiterated the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Monday while flying to Cameroon. Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it. The pope's mention of birth control may have been an effort to draw attention to the trip, which ""is not getting much of a bounce in the Western media,"" Gibson speculated. ""They are savvy enough to know that if the pope mentions condoms, it is going to be a headline,"" he said of the pontiff's advisers. The issue did not come up by chance, he pointed out. ""These were pre-selected questions for which they had prepared answers,"" he said. The pope also Thursday met local Muslim leaders in Cameroon, a west African country which is just over one-quarter Roman Catholic and just under one-quarter Muslim. Both religions are expanding rapidly in Africa, said Grim, a senior research fellow in religion and world affairs at the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Less than one in ten people in sub-Saharan Africa was Christian in 1900. Today nearly six in ten are, he said. The region was about 14 percent Muslim at the beginning of the 20th century, he said, and about 30 percent Muslim now. Benedict outraged Muslim leaders around the world in 2006 by quoting the 15th-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus when he said, ""Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."" He repeatedly apologized for the citation, which he said did not reflect his own views. ""It was a painful lesson but clearly the pope learned something from that,"" Gibson said. The pope's meeting Muslim leaders in person can help relations between the Church and Islam, the analyst added. Face-to-face encounters make ""the pope a human figure. That's what these trips are really about -- to see that the pope is not the boogeyman, he is someone who is kind and wise and wants to discuss issues. ""It's so easy to see caricatures, so for the pope simply to show up can be an enormously positive development,"" Gibson said. Gibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa. ""Knowing that the pope is older, he cannot travel as much -- he does not like to travel -- makes these trips more poignant. He may never come back to Africa again.""","Tens of thousands of people pack soccer stadium in Cameroon for pope's mass .

Roitfeld is anxious not to create any friction between her and her U.S. counterpart, telling CNN ""I think Anna does a great job... I think she's a great person."" She said she would be honored to be asked to fill Wintour's shoes, but pointed out that ""it's a very different job."" ""I'm very happy at French Vogue to be able to do everything -- almost everything -- I want in the magazine,"" she said. ""It would be too political at American Vogue for me. And I'm not sure I'm talking enough good English to work there."" At Vogue Paris, Roitfeld knows her readers. They are a select group of incredibly stylish and wealthy women who are thrilled rather than alienated by unconventional ideas. The best-selling edition so far, in August 2003, featured French actress Sophie Marceau on the cover smoking a cigarette. At French Vogue, there's less pressure to appeal to the masses. Its circulation of some 139,000 is dwarfed by the million plus readers of American Vogue. Fashion shoots are about fantasy. There's no imperative to make any clothes they feature wearable. If it's unusual and innovative, then it's in. With just 25 staff, Roitfeld describes the team at French Vogue as like a family. And that's how she prefers it. Having said that, she told CNN she wouldn't dismiss any offer out of hand. ""Of course I would consider it because it would be ridiculous not to consider such a huge position -- in terms of money and in terms of power,"" she said. ""But I'm very happy. It's very much a small team (in Paris). America is a huge team. I know because I've worked for them before. I think it's not for me.""","Style icon Anna Wintour is rumored to be leaving American Vogue in 2009 .

"(CNN)  -- Seven members of a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping patrol have been killed by a heavily armed militia group in Sudan's Darfur region, the U.N. said. Peacekeepers drive into a Sudanese refugee camp near Farchana, east of Chad. Five of those killed were Rwandan, a U.N. peacekeeping official said, and the other two were a Ugandan and a Ghanaian. Twenty-two others were wounded in the attack, which was immediately condemned by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""The attackers used heavy weapons and engaged the UNAMID convoy in an exchange of fire for more than two hours,"" according to the statement released by Ban's spokesman. UNAMID is the acronym for the U.N.-AU mission in Darfur. The peacekeepers are allowed to used force when fired upon directly. ""The secretary-general condemns in the strongest possible terms this unacceptable act of extreme violence against AU-U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur and calls on the government of Sudan to do its utmost to ensure that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice,"" the statement said. ""The secretary-general expresses his deepest condolences to the families of the peacekeepers who lost their lives, and reiterates his appreciation for their service, valor and commitment to the search for peace in Darfur."" The ambush happened around 2:45 p.m. (1145 GMT) in northern Darfur. The rescue mission did not take place until after dark, she said. The peacekeepers who were attacked operated out of Shangil Tobayi -- a base to the west of El Fasher. In five years of war the U.N. says more than four million people have been affected: Two-and-a-half million people forced from their homes and more than 300,000 killed. Sudanese officials dispute those numbers claiming only 10,000 have died -- a number they say is normal for five years of war. U.S. President George W. Bush calls the killings genocide and has put sanctions on Sudan. The U.N. says Sudan's government is guilty of crimes against humanity and of violating international human rights laws every bit as heinous and serious they say as genocide. In February 2008, a fresh wave of killing forced 58,000 people to flee their homes as government troops and Janjaweed militiamen retaliated against rebels. A U.N. report said Sudan broke international law as 115 innocent civilians were killed using tactics similar to those employed in 2003, 2004, the worst years of the war. Peacekeepers are frequently targeted by militias in Darfur, where they are trying to protect civilians from ""janjaweed"" militias -- nomadic Arab militias, supported by Sudan's government, which target pastoral black Africans. Ten African Union peacekeepers were killed in October in an ambush on their peacekeeping base -- the deadliest single attack on AU peacekeepers since they began their mission in late 2004. A U.N. commission concluded in 2005 that the Sudanese government and militias ""conducted indiscriminate attacks, including killing of civilians, torture, enforced disappearances, destruction of villages, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillaging and forced displacement"" in Darfur. In 2006, the U.N. Security Council authorized the creation of the joint AU/U.N. hybrid force of peacekeepers to protect civilians in Darfur. That hybrid force formally took over peacekeeping duties late last year from the force composed solely of members of the African Union. Yet the force is under-manned as a result of the Sudanese government's opposition to a U.N. presence, with just over 9,500 troops of an authorized strength of 26,000.","U.N.: Seven peacekeepers, including five Rwandans, killed and 22 wounded .

"(CNN) -- Prince William has spoken in depth publicly for the first time about death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, 12 years ago, saying ""mummy"" is now a hollow word ""evoking only memories."" Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a Paris car crash 12 years ago. Prince William was only 15 and his brother Prince Harry 12 when Diana died in a Paris car crash along with Dodi Fayed in 1997. The Prince made the comment Thursday during a speech to mark his new role as patron of Britain's Child Bereavement Charity -- a group his mother was once involved with. The British Press Association reported that he told the launch of the charity's Mother's Day campaign: ""My mother Diana was present at your launch 15 years ago, and I am incredibly proud to be able to continue her support for your fantastic charity, by becoming your royal patron. ""What my mother recognized then -- and what I understand now -- is that losing a close family member is one of the hardest experiences that anyone can ever endure. ""Never being able to say the word 'Mummy' again in your life sounds like a small thing. Tell us what you think about Prince William's moving comments . ""However, for many, including me, it's now really just a word -- hollow and evoking only memories. ""I can therefore wholeheartedly relate to the Mother's Day campaign as I too have felt -- and still feel -- the emptiness on such a day as Mother's Day."" Listen to Prince William discuss his mother. » . The charity wants to raise awareness of the problems suffered by mothers bereaved of a child or children bereaved of their mother. Based in Buckinghamshire, a region west of London, it educates professionals and supports families after a death. Writing in Britain's Daily Mail newspaper about his new role, the Prince said the reality of losing a child or parent was ""awful."" ""Initially, there is a sense of profound shock and disbelief that this could ever happen to you. Real grief often does not hit home until much later. ""For many it is a grief never entirely lost. Life is altered as you know it, and not a day goes past without you thinking about the one you have lost."" Mother's Day in the UK always falls on the fourth weekend of Lent, and this year is on March 22. Earlier this week France's leading society magazine, Point de Vue, reported that the Prince would marry his long-term girlfriend, Kate Middleton, this summer. The magazine claimed an official announcement was ""imminent.""","Prince William says he feels ""emptiness"" every Mother's Day .

"(CNN)  -- The future of Detroit is electric cars, the governor of Michigan declared in an opinion piece on Newsweek's Web site. The Chevy Volt is one of the electric cars being developed by Michigan's auto industry. ""In Michigan, we are doing everything we can to become the home of this new electric auto industry -- and to the jobs this industry will create,"" wrote Gov. Jennifer Granholm. ""Again, the road to a stronger future for our country will begin in Michigan."" She said that for automakers, replacing the 100-year-old internal-combustion engine is both ""revolutionary and daunting."" Ann Marie Sastry, director of the energy systems engineering program at the University of Michigan, said the industry will have to take risks and government support will be essential. ""Gov. Granholm is doing exactly what we all hope our elected officials will do -- she is supporting partnerships and growth in critical economic areas,"" Sastry said. ""She's enunciated a vision for clean vehicles that builds our regional economy and provides global, sustainable transportation solutions. ""We understand that these investments will take time to reach profitability, but these are hard problems, and they are worth investment and risk. The risk of doing nothing is much, much greater. I'm glad she is making the case for Michigan."" Granholm said all of Detroit's Big Three automakers -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- are working on electric vehicles. ""General Motors plans to make lithium-ion battery packs to power the Chevy Volt, which is expected to earn a fuel-economy rating of more than 100 mpg,"" she wrote. ""... As Ford celebrates the sale of the 100,000th hybrid Escape, it is preparing for the introduction of a full line of new hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Chrysler, too, is electrifying its product lines."" Sastry said she couldn't be more delighted with GM's plans for the Volt as a ""truly mass-marketed electrified drive train using electric technology."" In 2008, GM sold 14,439 hybrid vehicles, according to a statement from the company. ""These companies are serious about transforming themselves and transforming us into a nation less reliant on foreign oil,"" Granholm wrote. Sastry said public opinion toward energy conservation is a major factor in the companies being willing to take the risk of creating the new types of cars. ""These very large companies are placing a bet on the future in no small measure because of the American public's change in attitude toward it,"" she said. In her commentary, Granholm referred to President Barack Obama's plan, announced in February, to direct $2 billion from the economic stimulus package into technology aimed at putting 1 million American-made, plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by 2015. Sastry said it's hard to predict when something of that scale will happen -- many industry experts disagree on an exact time -- but it will happen. ""Keep in mind, several industries have to work together to make this happen,"" she said.","Gov. Jennifer Granholm says auto industry's future is electric .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A well-known Iranian filmmaker has written an open letter calling for the release of journalist Roxana Saberi. In a letter, Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi blames himself for urging Roxana Saberi to stay in Iran. Bahman Ghobadi said he kept quiet about the arrest and conviction of the Iranian-American journalist at the request of her family. After Saberi was convicted last weekend and sentenced to an eight-year prison sentence, he said he felt he had to do something. He told CNN that Saberi, whom he described as his fiancee, is caught in a ""game of politics."" In his letter, which has been posted by the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, Ghobadi blames himself for urging Saberi to stay in Iran despite her desire to leave. Also, he writes, ""My letter is a desperate call to all statesmen ... and to all those who can do something to help."" ""From the other side of the ocean, the Americans have protested against her imprisonment, because she is an American citizen,"" he writes. ""But I say no, she is Iranian, and she loves Iran. I beg you, let her go! I beg you not to throw her in the midst of your political games! She is too weak and too pure to take part in your games. Let me be present at her trial, sit next to her wise father and gentle mother, and testify she is without guilt or reproach."" The 40-year-old filmmaker said that Saberi was planning to leave the country, but he kept her from leaving until his latest film -- which will be shown at this year's Cannes film festival -- was completed. Ghobadi won the 2000 Golden Camera award at the Cannes festival for his feature film, ""A Time for Drunken Horses."" Saberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public. The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials. Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage. Saberi's lawyer has said he will appeal the verdict. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi has ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair. Ghobadi wrote that he is ""optimistic about her release, and I firmly hope the verdict will be canceled in the next stage of the trial."" ""My Iranian girl with Japanese eyes and an American ID, is in jail. Shame on me! Shame on us!""

"Tokyo is a huge and often confusing city for travelers, but with these tips you needn't be daunted by the Japanese capital. 100 Yen shops are great value for money. Subway Tokyo has an incredibly efficient subway, but the 13 lines are run by two different companies, Toei Subways and Tokyo Metro, meaning a bewildering variety of day passes are available. A good bet is the Toei and Tokyo Metro One-Day Economy Pass, which costs ¥1,000 and gives you a day of unlimited travel on all subway lines. During rush-hour the subway becomes an unbearable crush. All social niceties go out the window in a free for all that's best avoided completely. Taxis During the day traffic can be gridlocked, but in the evening, when traffic is lighter, taxis are reasonably alternative to the subway. Enter and exit taxis by the back left-hand door. Don't make the novice's error of trying to open or close the door -- your white-gloved driver will do that from the front seat. Ideally, have a map of your destination, or at least an address written in Japanese. Tipping is not expected. ATMs Although Tokyo is ultra-modern, you may have to revert to carrying travelers' checks for the duration of your stay. Few ATMs accept foreign cards, although you should have more luck at post offices and branches of Citibank. ATMs in busy areas stay open until 9 p.m. and most are closed at weekends, although Citibank has 24-hour ATMs. Credit cards are still not accepted as widely as you might expect, so travelers' checks are your best bet -- and make sure you're carrying cash if you're planning a night out away from the city center. What's on The best way to keep up with events and entertainment is with one of Tokyo's English language magazines. Metropolis and Tokyo Notice Board are two of the best -- and they're both free. 100 Yen shops These bargain stores are hugely popular in Tokyo, selling everything from food to toiletries for ¥100 plus ¥5 tax -- about $1. They are also a great place to pick up an inexpensive, kitschy souvenir. Daiso 100-Yen Shop in Takeshita-dori (Village 107 Building, 1-19-24 Jingumae, Shibuya-ku) has four floors of cheap thrills. Etiquette As a foreigner, having a generally courteous demeanor will cover a multitude of sins, but there are a few rules you should try to remember: . - Never use your chopsticks to take food from someone else's and don't stick your chopsticks upright in your food when you've finished -- both of these denote funerary customs. - If you're eating with other people, don't pour your own drink. Fill your neighbor's glass and wait for them to reciprocate. - The Japanese don't pour sauces onto their rice. Leave any sauces in their serving dish and dip your food in lightly. - It's a faux pas be seen eating in public -- especially on a train.

"ROCKVILLE, Maryland (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced it is blocking the import from China of five species of seafood until their importers can prove they are not contaminated. About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the U.S. comes from China, according to the National Fisheries Institute. ""FDA is initiating an import alert against several species of imported Chinese farmed seafood because of numerous cases of contamination with drugs and unsafe food additives,"" said Dr. David Acheson, the agency's assistant commissioner for food protection, in a conference call with reporters. The species cited are catfish, eel, shrimp, basa and dace, he said. Basa is similar to catfish; dace is similar to carp. The medications cited include the antimicrobials nitrofuran, malachite green, gentian violet and fluoroquinolones. Nitrofuran, malachite green, and gentian violet have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Use of fluoroquinolones in food-producing animals can result in antibiotic resistance. None of them is approved for use in farmed seafood in the United States and some of them have been shown to cause cancer when fed to laboratory animals for ""prolonged periods of time,"" Acheson said. Alerts have been issued in the past, but Thursday's announcement is the largest. The food will not be allowed into the United States until the importer can prove it is free from harmful contaminants, Acheson said. He said the agency decided to broaden its previous alerts for products from individual companies to a countrywide alert after tests showed that 15 percent of those species of seafood produced by 18 companies in China contained traces of one or more of the contaminants. ""FDA is taking this action to protect the public health of the American people,"" he said. Watch more on the FDA's import alert on five kinds of fish from China. » . The products ""could cause serious health problems if consumed over a long period of time,"" he said. Still, Acheson added, the low levels of contaminants means that there is ""no imminent threat"" to the public health. China is the world's largest producer of farmed fish, accounting for 70 percent of the total produced, he said. It is the third-largest exporter of farmed fish to the United States. The action is an import alert, which means that these products from Chinese processors ""will be detained and refused entry into the United States until the importer can demonstrate that the product is safe and in compliance with applicable regulations,"" said Margaret O' K. Glavin, FDA's associate commissioner for regulatory affairs. Last year, the FDA slapped a countrywide alert on all Chinese eel after tests showed residues of an antimicrobial agent, she said. Since then, and ""despite extensive communications between FDA and appropriate Chinese authorities to correct the problem, we have continued to find residues of certain veterinary drugs or food additives that are not permitted for use in the United States,"" she added. Glavin said the FDA inspects 5 percent of seafood from China. The first alert on Chinese seafood occurred before 2001, she said. ""We're not asking for this product to be withdrawn from the market or for people to take this out of their freezers and throw it away,"" Acheson said. ""This is a long-term health concern; it is not an acute health concern."" China is not the sole offender, Glavin said. Import alerts have been ordered for firms in the Philippines, Mexico ""and several others,"" though this is the first countrywide import alert, she said. More than 80 percent of shrimp eaten in the United States is imported, including 7 percent from China, according to the National Fisheries Institute. About 10 percent of catfish eaten in the United States comes from China, the seafood industry advocacy group said. Last year, the United States imported 590,299 metric tons of shrimp from abroad; 68,150 metric tons of which came from China, according to the Department of Commerce. The United States imported $1.2 billion of fish from China in 2004, according to H. M. Johson & Associates, a seafood industry research group.

"(CNN) -- Tokyo was known as Edo until 1868, but it's hard to imagine that this high-rise, high-tech metropolis could possibly have existed in a time before electricity and concrete. Tokyo isn't just a futuristic city; it's the place that has shaped our vision of what the future will look like. In Tokyo, the future is a long-standing tradition. There's a sci-fi familiarity to areas like Shibuya, Shinjuku and Akihabara; the skyscrapers glowing with illuminated signs, subway stops inside shopping malls and taxis with automated doors could be straight out of ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Fifth Element."" But the space-age topography of Tokyo has been shaped by a history of catastrophe. In the 20th century alone Tokyo suffered earthquakes, fires and devastating bombing. The result is a city that has repeatedly been forced to rebuild, shedding its past with each successive redevelopment. In Tokyo, the future is a long-standing tradition. After centuries of expansion, Tokyo has grown vertically to accommodate its 12 million residents. Perhaps the inevitability of another catastrophic earthquake accounts for the lack of emotional attachment to the city's architecture; buildings are continuously being pulled down and replaced, creating the sensation that Tokyo's skyline is a permanent work in progress. While it can seem that the city is intent on stream rolling over its past, you can still see traces of old Edo. The Meiji Jingu Shrine tells of the city's Shinto heritage and there's something timeless about the charming chaos of Tsukiji Fish Market. Even the enduring formalities of Tokyo's social etiquette and the joy with which Tokyoites greet the coming of the cherry blossom are signs that the city maintains a lingering affection for its traditions. At first glance, Tokyoites may seem sober and industrious, efficiently going about the business of making their city a world capital of techno commerce, but shops filled with manga comics and anime DVDs hint at a desire to escape the obligations of real life. That appetite for escapism is most colorfully expressed in the phenomenon of ""cosplay"", which sees teenagers dress as characters from cartoons and comic strips, or in the outlandish uniforms of various distinctive subcultures. In the 80s, Japan's bubble economy created unsustainable growth in Tokyo and property prices in the capital went through the roof. When the bubble burst in the early 90s, Tokyo was hit particularly hard but, after years of recession, Tokyo has the buzz of a city regaining its confidence. For this endlessly fascinating city, it's back to business -- and back to the future.","Known as Edo until 1868, Tokyo has been shaped by a history of disasters .

"(CNN) -- Danielle Dayton and Patrick Murray received the call Saturday afternoon: Their 4-pound son, Brayden Murray, was shipping out. Patrick Murray and Danielle Dayton say their tiny son's evacuation went smoothly. As coastal hospitals prepared for Gustav, tiny babies in the Newborn Intensive Care Units were among the first to be evacuated. ""The NICU babies are our first priority when it comes to evacuation,"" said Keith Darcey, a spokesman for East Jefferson General Hospital in Metairie, Louisiana, where Brayden was a patient before being evacuated to Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge, Lousiana. Woman's Hospital started receiving phone calls Wednesday from coastal-area hospitals inquiring whether there was room in their NICU, spokeswoman Jodi Conachen said. By Sunday evening, the hospital was taking care of 32 evacuated babies. ""The hospitals started preparing early this time,"" she said. ""They learned their lesson from Katrina."" The babies have done well since arriving in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Darcy Gann, director of the NICU at Woman's Hospital. ""They act like they were barely affected by the transfer."" The babies arrived by ambulance without their parents. Dayton and Murray drove to Baton Rouge to join their son after dropping off their 7-year-old daughter, Breanne, to stay with relatives far from the storm. While the couple took care of their children, they had a friend board up their business in Metairie. ""You have to deal with it the best you can. You can't panic, because it doesn't do anyone any good,"" Murray said. ""You do what's best for the baby."" Although Murray said Brayden's evacuation went smoothly, one hospital administrator said the patient evacuation process had been ""incredibly frustrating.""  Watch part of the NICU evacuation » . ""There was at least a six- to eight-hour delay in evacuating the babies,"" said Dr. Kevin Jordan, chief medical officer of Touro Infirmary in New Orleans, which sent seven NICU babies to Woman's Hospital. ""It was very, very, very disorganized."" Jordan blamed the state office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. He said Touro is still waiting to evacuate four critically ill adult patients on ventilators. ""It's been incredibly frustrating,"" he said. The secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said each hospital is responsible for evacuating its own patients, adding that Touro asked for assistance Sunday morning, days after other hospitals had asked for help. ""It's never a perfect process,"" he said. ""It's never easy to evacuate thousands of people in 48 hours."" Touro, which usually has between 215 and 245 patients, has evacuated all but around 65 to 70, he added. ""The sickest of the sick patients we're keeping and sheltering in place,"" Jordan said. ""We're concerned that evacuating them could do significant harm."" Other hospitals took a different approach. East Jefferson evacuated only its three NICU babies, keeping its 210 adult patients in the hospital. ""We survived Katrina quite well and learned a lot from the experience,"" Darcey said, adding that since Katrina, the exterior of the hospital has been fortified. ""But you don't want to take any chances with the little babies,"" he added. ""Their temperatures have to be very carefully regulated, and if the air conditioning goes out, that could have a detrimental effect on their health.""","Sick newborn babies among first evacuate area, as Gustav approaches .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of refugees on Wednesday blocked a main road in northwest Pakistan, to protest living conditions for some of the 1.5 million Pakistanis forced to flee their homes in the past three weeks. The refugee situation in Pakistan could be a bigger threat than fighting with Taliban, U.N. says. ""The government has been making big promises, but none of those were ever fulfilled,"" said Hazrat Bilal, a protester and refugee whose family has taken up temporary residence in a primary school. The refugees had blocked the main road in Pakistan's Mardan district since 8 a.m. Wednesday, Bilal said by telephone. The demonstrators were demanding food, water and other government services, he said. Mardan is a main transit point for the large numbers of Pakistanis fleeing the Swat Valley, the site of fierce fighting between Taliban militants and Pakistani soldiers.  The first pictures from the fighting » . The refugee crisis could pose a bigger threat to stability in Pakistan than the war itself, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres told CNN while touring a refugee camp in the nearby Swabi district last week. The Pakistani government has been working with international aid agencies to establish camps for refugees, where tents, food, water and basic medical services are provided. But the scale and speed of the displacement -- said to be the worst since the Rwandan genocide in 1994 -- have overwhelmed aid workers, Guterres said. ""The scale of the problem is such that all our resources combined cannot cope with it. And it's very important for this population not to feel abandoned,"" Guterres said. ""Without massive support of the international community for the Pakistani people, this will become a very dramatic problem, and not only a humanitarian problem."" On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced $110 million in humanitarian aid for Pakistani refugees. She also unveiled a system that lets Americans donate to the U.N. refugee effort, by sending a text message on mobile phone, including the word ""Swat."" Meanwhile, Pakistan's military said it was continuing the assault on Taliban militants. Pakistani forces have targeted regional Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah and Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan, but have ""no information about whether we have been successful,"" said the spokesman, Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. He said 80 ""terrorists"" were killed Tuesday night in ""intense fighting"" in the town of Sultanwas, located in Buner district.

"(CNN) -- Rick Warren, founder and pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, is one of America's most influential authors and religious leaders. In August, he moderated a discussion on key issues between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. Rick Warren says no matter what problem you have, there's a purpose behind it. His latest book is ""The Purpose of Christmas."" He was interviewed by Kiran Chetry on ""American Morning"" on Friday. Here is an edited version of the exchange: . Chetry: We always say we don't want Christmas to be commercialized. It seems that at the end of the year, we end up in the same position, worried about buying presents, worried about spending money, worried about holiday cards, and how do you get back to the real meaning? Rick Warren: A lot of people are really hurting because of the economy and because of the fears about what's going to happen, and really those same problems are the problems that Mary and Joseph went through. Housing, no room at the inn, travel, economic unrest, things like that. So I wrote this book really to focus us on what is the true meaning of Christmas. It's a book of hope, and the big idea behind it is that no matter what problem you're going through, there's a purpose behind it. God has a purpose, and that purpose can help you make it through even the stressful times when we decide to write a note to everybody, buy a gift for everybody, redecorate our house, have five or six meals and go to eight or nine parties.  Rick Warren: Shop more or pray more? » . Chetry: Exactly, because that's usually what ends up happening, and sometimes the spirit of giving and fellowship is lost in that. You also write in the book, remember that God loves you, but for somebody who is facing foreclosure -- let's say you lost a loved one or your job or dealing with an illness -- it can sound pat in a way. What do you say to people who say, pastor, I don't feel that God loves me or I wouldn't be going through this . Warren: Actually, sometimes what we think is a problem is actually a protection. For instance, last month my daughter-in-law, who is 25 years old, went through a brain tumor. She had her first child premature, about six weeks early, and when she had that baby early, it was breech. The cord was wrapped around its neck and it stopped breathing and they actually had to do an emergency C-section and resuscitate the child and save the baby's life and save her life. We looked at that and we thought, boy, that's a pretty tough problem, but we now know that she had a three-inch brain tumor at the base of her brainstem, and if she had pushed, it would have killed her. And so actually, seven weeks later, when she should have been delivering the baby, we discovered the brain tumor, and she would have been trying to have brain surgery, three surgeries, one was 20 hours long, at the same time as having a baby. So what we thought was a problem was actually a protection saving her life. And sometimes, we look at a tapestry, and from the top down, you can see the picture. From the bottom up, it's all of these different colors of threads. It makes no sense. It's all jumbled. When God looks down, he sees what he's doing. When we look up, we just see the jumble. Chetry: And she's OK? Warren: She's OK. Chetry: Thank goodness. I want to turn to politics now and ask you about the summit you hosted for both of the candidates. Great provocative questions and interesting answers we weren't hearing on the campaign trail. Now that the campaign is over, what is your reaction to the outcome and to President-elect Barack Obama? Warren: Well, there's no doubt about it, we need to be praying for our president. I don't think any president has come into a crisis so quickly as President-elect Obama has, and no president has come in with probably as high expectations as President-elect Obama. So we need to pray for him. We need to support him where we can, and we need -- we want the best for America. Chetry: Religion factored heavily into some of the back-and-forth in the campaign season. Many people believed [incorrectly] that Barack Obama wasn't really Christian, that he was Muslim, and, of course, the Jeremiah Wright thing. Religion ended up, unfortunately, being a divisive issue at times as opposed to one that was a uniting issue. How do you change that? Warren: Part of it is we have to end the caricaturization of the candidates. I know all of the candidates on both sides, and none of them were exactly as they were portrayed. We tend to overportray them whether it's Sarah Palin or Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John McCain. They're not anything like the caricaturization that we often hear. We tend to push to extremes. They are a lot more practical and pragmatic, I think, than we want to give them credit for, and every president, when he becomes president, has to let go of some ideology and become more of a pragmatist because there's so many issues that you don't probably understand until you actually hold the office.","Pastor Rick Warren: Problems we face similar to those of Mary and Joseph .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The children in their party outfits on the red carpet were in full agreement with the woman in the middle of the slum: ""It's unbelievable!"" Azharuddin Ismail and Rubina Ali got to leave their homes in Mumbai to go to Hollywood for the Oscars. Nine-year-old Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail, 10, were living a very different life and apparently loving every minute of it. The two, some of the child stars of the Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" movie, know the Indian slum well. It's where they've grown up, and it's where they will return at the end of their Hollywood dream trip. But before that, there was the red carpet and an interview with E! host Ryan Seacrest, where they grinned and repeated their disbelief at what was happening to them. ""Unbelievable. I never thought it would be an Oscar, this movie,"" said another of the children, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar. Then it was to the awards show itself, where their movie won first for its cinematography, script and music. Toward the end of the evening, Danny Boyle picked up best director, and then Rubina, Azharuddin and many of the movie's other stars got to storm the stage with producer Christian Colson to collect the best picture award. By that time, it was late morning in the children's home city of Mumbai, where family, friends and many fellow residents of the slum watched the results from Hollywood.  Watch how Mumbai celebrated » . ""I don't really know what the Oscars are,"" Rubina's mom said. ""I'm just glad my daughter looks happy, though she told me she misses Indian food."" The Oscar success of ""Slumdog"" distracted some from the drudgery of their daily lives. But the poverty and lack of opportunity that's a central theme of the film is always all around. ""Our children lead a dog's life,"" Rubina's mother said, pointing out garbage everywhere, the open drains and the lack of education opportunities. That at least may change for Rubina and Azharuddin. In a few days they will be back in Mumbai and back in the slums that are their home.  Watch how 'Slumdog Millionaire' dominated at the Academy Awards » . But, according to media reports, Boyle has promised to help the children he plucked from the obscurity of the slum and see that they will now get to go to a proper school.","Two child stars of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" come from the slum featured in the movie .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi police and soldiers on Saturday launched major raids in a once-notorious insurgent stronghold west of Baghdad. Saturday's raids in Falluja by Iraqi forces were similar to U.S.-led sweeps in the city in 2004, shown here. A police official in the Anbar province city of Falluja told CNN that a large number of security forces were scouring its Sinaie district for an array of weapons -- machine guns, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. The Sinaie area, in Falluja's southeastern section, is an industrial district with factories, scrap yards and large, abandoned yards. The area used to be a stronghold of the insurgency in Falluja until the militants were driven out in major military operations five years ago. At that time, the U.S.-led offensive was largely in response to the brutal ambush, killing and mutilation of four U.S. security contractors. Their charred bodies were left dangling from a bridge over the Euphrates River in spring 2004. In November of that year, U.S. and Iraqi forces attacked insurgents in Falluja, killing about 1,200 militants. Eight Iraqi soldiers and 51 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, died in urban combat, according to the Pentagon. About 95 percent of Falluja's population was displaced. Falluja is about 37 miles, or 60 kilometers, west of Baghdad . After the city was pacified, the United States committed more than $200 million to reconstruction projects there, and changes became evident. Small cafes and grocery stores lined the streets once dusty and abandoned. Iraqis in Falluja got back to the rhythms of everyday life: They worked, shopped -- and rebuilt. As fragile security gains took root, American military officials marveled at the resurgent city of several hundred thousand. On Saturday, a police official denied reports that armed groups were trying to re-establish a foothold in the area. The U.S. military said Marines and police in the nearby town of Karma were also participating in a combined cache sweep. Violence has dropped in Iraq, and President Obama's administration has been gearing up to withdraw U.S. troops. The U.S. military continues to be on guard for flare-ups in violence and insurgent activity. The vast and predominantly Sunni Arab Anbar province was a battleground between the U.S. military and al Qaeda in Iraq during the earlier years of the Iraq war. But the insurgents eventually lost ground when a grass-roots movement called ""the awakening"" emerged. The tribe-based awakening forces rejected al Qaeda in Iraq and turned their allegiances toward the U.S. and Iraqi government. While the awakening doesn't have clout in Falluja, there are pockets of support just outside the city, as well as in the rest of the province. Al Qaeda in Iraq's strongest presence in the country is now in the Mosul area, in Nineveh province, north of Baghdad.","Iraqi police official says security forces were scouring Sinaie district of Falluja .

"SINGAPORE (CNN) -- Hundreds of customers flocked to the Singapore office of troubled insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG) on Wednesday, many hoping to pull their investments and policies from the company. People in Singapore queue outside the office of  AIA, a subsidiary of AIG. The crowd formed just hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend $85 billion to a crumbling AIG. In return, the federal government will receive a nearly 80 percent stake in the company. One person who lined up in Singapore, retired teacher Wong Yoke Inn, said she was going to pull her investments from AIA even though it would cost her about $3,000 -- the equivalent of about $2,000 in the United States. She joined an orderly crowd whose members were each given a number and a time to return to meet with a representative of AIA Singapore -- AIG's division in the island nation. AIA tried to allay investors concerns in a statement distributed outside the Singapore office and posted on the company's Web site. ""AIA Singapore has more than sufficient capital and reserves ... to meet our obligations to policyholders,"" the statement said. ""The funds maintained in Singapore are segregated from American International Group, Inc. (AIG) and are held specifically for the purpose of meeting our obligations to policyholders."" The U.S. government announced Tuesday night that it would act to save America's largest insurer from filing for bankruptcy. Such a move almost certainly would have further roiled world markets already reeling from the bankruptcy filling of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. AIG has $1.1 trillion in assets and 74 million clients in 130 countries.","Hundreds queue outside AIG subsidiary in Singapore following news of U.S. bailout .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The New York Times endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination over Rudy Giuliani and the rest of the GOP field, strongly criticizing the former mayor of its home city. Sens. John McCain, left, and Rudy Giuliani took part in a debate in Florida on Thursday. In endorsements posted on its Web site for Friday's editions, the Times also endorsed New York Sen. Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. ""Senator John McCain of Arizona is the only Republican who promises to end the George Bush style of governing from and on behalf of a small, angry fringe,"" the paper's editorial board wrote. ""With a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation, he would offer a choice to a broader range of Americans than the rest of the Republican field."" The endorsement anticipated readers asking how the New York paper could reject Giuliani, a man it endorsed for re-election in 1997 and praised for his work cleaning up crime in the city and during the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks. ""That man is not running for president,"" the paper wrote. ""The Rudolph Giuliani of 2008 first shamelessly turned the horror of 9/11 into a lucrative business, with a secret client list, then exploited his city's and the country's nightmare to promote his presidential campaign,"" the paper writes, describing Giuliani as ""a narrow, obsessively secretive, vindictive man."" Giuliani played down the harsh words, suggesting that the Times has a liberal editorial staff that often disapproved of him. ""I probably never did anything the New York Times suggested I do in eight years as mayor of New York City, and if I did, I wouldn't be considered a conservative Republican,"" Giuliani said during a Republican debate Thursday night hosted by MSNBC in Boca Raton, Florida. ""I changed welfare, I changed quality of life, I took on homelessness -- I did all the things that they think makes you mean and I believe show true compassion and true love for people."" His wasn't the only Republican campaign taking that tack. An e-mail from the campaign of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sarcastically noted that McCain had been endorsed by ""[t]hat bastion of conservative advocacy."" The editorial was hardly full of praise for McCain, despite calling him a ""genuine war hero"" and a ""staunch advocate of campaign finance reform."" ""Mr. McCain was one of the first prominent Republicans to point out how badly the war in Iraq was being managed. We wish he could now see as clearly past the temporary victories produced by Mr. Bush's unsustainable escalation, which have not led to any change in Iraq's murderous political calculus,"" it reads. ""At the least, he owes Americans a real idea of how he would win this war, which he says he can do."" The paper praised Clinton's chief rival, Sen. Barack Obama, but called Clinton more qualified for the job. ""It is unfair, especially after seven years of Mr. Bush's inept leadership, but any Democrat will face tougher questioning about his or her fitness to be commander in chief,"" it reads. ""Mrs. Clinton has more than cleared that bar, using her years in the Senate well to immerse herself in national security issues, and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the American military."" The Democratic editorial contrasts Clinton and Obama -- calling her ""the brilliant if at times harsh-sounding senator from New York"" and him ""the incandescent if still undefined senator from Illinois."" The paper says Clinton ""sometimes overstates the importance of [her] resume,"" but that upon hearing ""her policies and answers for America's big problems, we are hugely impressed by the depth of her knowledge, by the force of her intellect and by the breadth of, yes, her experience."" New York is one of a host of states that will vote during the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Rev. Martin Luther King is looking down on the United States, smiling, Otis Sutton said Wednesday. Otis Sutton, 78, recalls how times have changed since he grew up in the segregated South. ""That's what he wanted. He'd been preaching that all along,"" Sutton, 78, said of the nation electing its first African-American president. Sutton, who has worked on and off at the historic Busy Bee Cafe in Atlanta, Georgia, since it opened in 1947, was baptized by the civil rights icon's father, King Sr. He remembers playing pick-up football games in a dirt lot with King Jr. when they were both youngsters in Atlanta. Asked if King Jr. was any good at football, Sutton chuckled. ""He liked to read and study,"" he said with a reverence that prohibited him from disparaging King Jr. in any way, ""but he loved the game."" Walk around Atlanta and you'll find plenty of African-Americans who hope Sen. Barack Obama will inspire young people to reach for a book rather than a football. ""As young, black Americans our society and our communities had told us that the only way we could make it out is if we entertain,"" said Cortez Tarver, 28, who cuts hair at the University Barbershop, just down the street from the historically black Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University.  Hear Tarver talk about Obama's win » . ""They want us to be funny. They want us to cook their food, entertain them and play their sports -- and we do all that, we're just going to fit in."" The media reinforce the erroneous notion that successful black men exist only in the realms of hip hop, football and basketball, Tarver said. The result is that fewer and fewer African-American children aspire to occupations like doctor and lawyer, he said. All that changed after Obama locked up the Electoral College vote on Tuesday night. ""Now, they can say they want to be president,"" Tarver said of young blacks. ""This shows us, hey, if we go to college, we study hard, we help out our communities, we can become president, we can become something great -- other than shucking and jiving, other than putting on a show."" Sutton likens Obama's rise through the political ranks to Tiger Woods' rise through professional golf. Until about 12 years ago, when Woods turned pro, it was rare to find black youngsters swinging clubs at their local links. Even if they had the natural skills, they did not believe the game belonged to them, he said. ""You never seen black children playing golf till [Woods] started playing,"" said Sutton, explaining that even his 7-year-old grandson, Josh, now enjoys playing golf. What Woods did for golf, Sutton said, Obama has done for politics. Children across the nation were told Tuesday night that they, too, can aspire to the highest office in the land. ""If he can do it, they believe they can do it,"" Sutton said. Back at University Barbershop, Tarver's colleague, Spot Jackson, 28, said the only thing keeping him awake was some Burger King coffee and a few doughnuts after staying up until 6 a.m. watching election news. Like Tarver and Sutton, Jackson said he believes Obama shattered the ceiling for black men and women. He joked that Obama's victory made him want to start a foundation. Its mission would be simple, he said. ""We're going to eradicate the word 'can't.' We're going to try to get it out of every dictionary known to man,"" he said. ""There's nothing you can honestly say you can't do anymore; it just changes your perception as far as what you think is possible in this country."" Jackson dismissed a question about whether the change was made possible by Obama's skin color, saying it was more about the man's character and platform. ""He could've been green and if the message was the same and it resonated the same way it did, then he still would've gotten the same support,"" he said. Jackson said he saw television footage of people in Indonesia celebrating the U.S. presidential election, something he's never seen in the 10 years he's been voting. Morgan Blanchard, 20, a junior at Clark Atlanta, said she also was impressed to see international footage from Italy and Australia of people celebrating the election. It shows Obama has broad appeal, which speaks more to his honesty and principles than to his skin color, she said. ""Oh gosh, it's not even that he's African-American,"" she said, noting with a sly smile that Obama's mother was white. ""It's the way he carries himself, the way he puts himself out there. I don't think race has anything to do with it."" Her sentiments were echoed by fellow Clark Atlanta student Ashante Smith, 18. A sophomore studying music, Smith said many African-Americans voted for Obama because of his race, but she pointed out that he also snared millions of votes in white and Latino communities. ""I think he was just really committed to all communities,"" she said. And while she thinks Obama can help improve education, unemployment and the economy in general, she concurs with many who say he can hearten generations of African-Americans to reach higher in life. ""It just inspires me to go for what I want,"" she said. ""It's like we can do anything.""","African-Americans in Martin Luther King Jr.'s hometown say Obama shattered ceiling .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A Taliban leader has instructed fighters in Afghanistan to target U.S. and other coalition troops in response to the United States sending more troops into the war. U.S. Army soldiers, right, watch two Afghan soldiers at ISAF's Camp Bostick in the eastern Kunar province. A two-page statement sent to CNN instructs fighters to start new attacks against coalition troops and Afghan parliament members, and urges suicide bombers to strike. The statement was written by Mula Birather, a Taliban chief of at least 12 military groups in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed to CNN that the statement came from Birather. The statement also warned Afghans to not get ""near U.S. troops anywhere because we will target them any where they are and if anybody is killed in a attack on them we will not be responsible for their death."" The statement comes as U.S. troops begin increased deployments in Afghanistan. President Barack Obama approved sending 4,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March and pledged to send 17,000 more. Col. Greg Julian, a spokesman for U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, responded to the statement. ""The Taliban extremists are promising to bring more death and destruction to Afghanistan and limit the freedom of movement of all Afghans,"" Julian said. ""They offer no hope for the future, and only seek to kill... We will continue working side-by-side with our Afghan partners to improve security and demonstrate to these ruthless murders and criminals that they will not stop progress in Afghanistan."" Meanwhile across the border in Pakistan, the country's military intensified its drive against the Taliban in the country's restive tribal regions, reclaiming a key town in the northwest district of Buner. CNN's Nic Robertson and Atia Abawi contributed to this report.","Taliban leader instructs fighters in Afghanistan to target U.S., coalition troops .

"Editor's Note: Republican strategist Alex Castellanos was a campaign consultant for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and has worked on more than half a dozen presidential campaigns. Castellanos is a partner in National Media Inc., a political and public affairs consulting firm that specializes in advertising. Alex Castellanos says stimulus bill is a cover for a bold plan for government to rule key parts of private sector. (CNN) -- Two Congressmen walk into a bar to watch President Obama's first prime-time press conference. The Democrat says to the Republican.... D: Just watch the president tonight and you'll see how to get this economy back on track. Monopolies. R: Monopolies? D: Monopolies so big they will shame Parker Brothers and make them put the board game in a bigger box. Monopolies so huge, they'll make railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt look like a push-cart operator. R: Why monopolies? D: In these desperate times, we can't afford to let Americans choose inefficient cars or wasteful health care. We can't let innovation run wild on Wall Street or Main Street. We have to make sure Americans are secure in their health care and jobs, their incomes and energy. To serve the greater good, we have to organize America's economy so it achieves the best possible ends for all Americans. We can't leave that to chance. Who knows what might happen if individual Americans make those choices in a free market and organize themselves? R: A little less freedom, a lot more organization, all for the collective good? D: My friend, we need a directed economy, where we limit people's choices to those that serve the best social ends. Our nation's development is best controlled by monopolies, not some atomistic economy where Americans are free to make almost any choice and organize bottom-up, according to their own whims. That means, big, honking, all-powerful monopolies. R: But during the campaign, Obama talked about change, fueling ""bottom-up prosperity."" This sounds like the same old, top-down, industrial-age stuff Democrats have been pitching for years. D: You betcha! Bottom-up campaign rhetoric just ran into the top-down Democratic establishment from Washington. Guess who won. We're going to create monopolies in the biggest sectors of the economy, starting with banking and financial services. Even after the meltdown, that's still the largest stock market sector, 16 percent of the S&P. R: Follow the money. D: Exactly. With massive regulation, caps on pay and restrictions on risk and competition, we can turn the entire financial sector into a cross between a public utility and the DMV. R: And then? D: We'll create an energy monopoly that would make J. D. Rockefeller look like a gas station attendant. If it has anything to do with energy, we will control it, plan it and direct it. You are going to love your windmill. R: I'm not feeling so good. D: That's next. A health care monopoly alone will organize another 16 percent of the economy. Choice and diversity are great, but not so much in health care. We'll throw in $20 billion at the start for paperless health records. Data, my friend, is power. You know where we will go: Cost controls. Restricted formularies. Nancy Pelosi can be your doctor. You don't need a lot of choice. Just a good choice. Or a good-enough choice. Cough for me. R: Watch that. I'm leaving. D: Now that you mention it, we can't forget the good old American auto industry. To borrow from Henry Ford, consumers can pick any color car they want, as long as it is green. R: Who are you going to get to run these monopolies? You are dealing with increasingly complex economic networks. How are you going to coordinate the sophisticated relationships, the subtle interests and ever-changing needs of millions of American consumers? Americans have traditionally done that themselves, in a natural and organic way, one to another, through the market. Who is smart enough to replace all that? D: Congress. R: You are making this stuff up. The president isn't talking about huge government-run monopolies. All he's talking about is the stimulus bill. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the stimulus package . D: Of course. That's the beauty of the thing. As long as we call it ""stimulus,"" we can pass almost anything that expands the power of government to command people's lives. Why do you think Newsweek's cover says, ""We Are All Socialists Now?"" R: I need a drink. Don't they serve Congressmen in this bar? D: No. But you can buy one from a lobbyist.

"(CNN) -- My eyes stung, I was coughing, my nose was running. Along with cameraman David Hawley and freelance producer Kareem Khadder, I had just been tear-gassed -- not for the first time last Friday -- during a day-long clash between Palestinian kids and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Na'alin, on the West Bank. An Israeli soldier confronts Palestinian protesters during a demonstration Friday in the West Bank village of Jayyus. We had gone there to gauge the Palestinian view of Tuesday's Israeli elections. Na'alin, and many other towns and villages like it in the West Bank, are in the forefront of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Here, it all comes down to the most basic element in the century-old conflict: control of the land. Na'alin is an old town, with factories and workshops, surrounded by olive groves. But in recent years neighboring Israeli settlements, built since the June 1967 war, have increasingly encroached on Na'alin's farmland, and Israel, on grounds of security, has built its security barrier around the town. As a result, Na'alin residents say they have lost access to much of their land, their water sources, in short their livelihood. Beginning two years ago, every Friday they hold protests against Israel's settlement expansion and barrier building. Most Na'alin residents are not ideological hotheads; before the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in September 2000, many worked in Israel. Most are still fluent in Hebrew and do business with Israelis looking for a good deal on car repairs and other services. For that reason I thought Na'alin would be a good place to see what Palestinians were thinking. What I heard was universal pessimism. No one I spoke with expressed the slightest hope that any of the leading candidates --Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, Kadima's Tzipi Livni, Israel Beitenu's Avigdor Lieberman and Labour's Ehud Barak -- would do anything to remove the settlements that are slowly closing in on Na'alin. As we sheltered from the tear gas behind a house, Na'alin resident Hani Khawaja told me, ""I don't expect anything to come out of the elections that will please the Palestinians. Just killings, expulsions and land confiscations."" Another man, Ayub Srour, had a slightly different approach. He prefers Israeli leaders to be honest about their intentions, and not raise hopes only to dash them later. He wants Likud leader and long-time hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu to win. ""At least he's honest. He says he'll expel us, and he will expel us. He says he's slaughter us, and he will slaughter us."" I've covered almost every Israeli election since 1996. With each election, the Palestinian feeling of despair and hopelessness only deepens. Since the last election in the spring of 2006, Palestinians have seen Israel and Hezbollah go to war, West Bank settlements continue to expand, Hamas and Fatah fight it out in Gaza with Hamas taking control in June 2007. They've also seen a series of Israeli incursions into Gaza, culminating recently in the 22-day Israeli offensive that left large parts of the strip in ruins. Meanwhile many Palestinians say their leadership -- often described as moderate and pro-western -- in Ramallah is incapable of reversing the trend of settlement expansion. The same leadership has been unable to convince Israel to remove few of the hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints that make travelling around the West Bank a test of patience and endurance. In short, when Palestinians look back over the last 15 years since the Oslo Accords were signed, they've seen their lot only go from bad to worse. As a result, more and more Palestinians are convinced the only way to beat the Israelis is to join them, to discard failed attempts at creating a Palestinian state in an ever smaller, ever more economically unviable territory, and go for what is known as the one-state solution. That would mean Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza relinquishing their dream of an independent Palestinian state, and instead insisting on equal rights in the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean, an area that is, for all intents and purposes, under Israel's control anyway. The one-state solution is an anathema to many Israelis, who are well aware that, with their higher birth-rate, Palestinians (those living within Israel proper, plus Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza) could well become a majority within a generation. Israelis increasingly worry the national struggle between Israel and the Palestinians will be transformed into an internal struggle, for equal rights for all those living within historic Palestine. Those fears prompted Israel's current caretaker prime minister, Ehud Olmert, to warn as far back as November 2007 that if Israel doesn't move quickly to achieve a two-state solution, it will be in a position not unlike South Africa during the apartheid area, whereby a minority -- in this case Israeli Jews -- rules over a restive majority -- the Palestinians -- by means of force, repression and discriminatory laws. Many Palestinians argue that is already the case, citing Israeli restrictions on movement, residence, and work. The bedrock of Israeli antipathy toward the Palestinians is part of the reason for the growing strength of the Israel Beiteinu (Israel is Our Home) Party, led by Avigdor Leiberman. He argues that Israel's Palestinian minority (they make up about 20 percent of the population) as a potential fifth column working against the aims of the Jewish majority. Leiberman has focused much of his fire on Palestinian Knesset members such as Ahmed Tibi, accusing him and others of sympathising with Israel's enemies, Hamas and Hizballah. His solution is to compel all of Knesset members -- and possibly all Israeli citizens -- to take an oath of loyalty to the state. Another of Leiberman's proposals is to redraw Israel's boundaries to exclude as many of its Palestinians as possible. Tibi responds that Leiberman's growing clout is symptomatic of ""an obvious fascist phenomena invading Israeli society. During the last years, racism became mainstream."" Back in the town of Na'alin, the kids throwing stones at Israeli troops do have some odd companions. Young Israelis, some of them self-described anarchists, also take part in the protests. They don't throw stones, but they do offer useful advice. ""Laththam! Laththam!"" one Israeli with black tattoos on his arms tells a young boy, no older than 12, hurling rocks with a home-made sling. ""Laththam"" is Arabic for ""cover your face,"" the advice imparted because if Israeli troops can identify stone throwers, they arrest them. There still is cooperation of sorts between Palestinians and Israelis, but it's an increasingly rare commodity. And this election probably won't do anything to bridge the growing gap between the two -- the curious friendship in Na'alin notwithstanding.","CNN correspondent finds moods of universal pessimism in West Bank town .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that House committees will begin action on President-elect Barack Obama's proposed economic recovery package in the next couple of weeks, with a vote in the full House slated for the week after Obama's inauguration. Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will not go on a break until an economic recovery package is passed. Obama will take office January 20. If that schedule slips, Pelosi, D-California, pledged to cancel the House's planned weeklong break in mid-February for Presidents Day. ""We are not going home without an economic recovery package,"" Pelosi said. Pelosi said Obama's plan has broad public support ""almost sight unseen,"" citing a poll from Politico that says 79 percent of Americans support the president-elect's plan. A senior Pelosi aide said discussions about the details are ongoing between the Obama transition team and key leaders. The Ways and Means Committee will focus on the tax piece, approximately $300 billion in tax cuts. Obama transition aides met with Democrats on that committee Wednesday morning to discuss various proposals, according to another Democratic aide. The Appropriations Committee is tasked with drafting details on spending hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure projects, food stamps and other aid to states. Sidestepping a question on possible roadblocks for the bill, Pelosi instead touted the new muscle of the expanded Democratic majority. ""We have been so used to an uphill fight, but now we have arrived. We have a big, strong, something like an 80-vote majority in the Congress, in the House, with a Democratic president in the White House,"" she said. In a speech Thursday, Obama said it was imperative that Congress move quickly to pass the stimulus package once he takes office, warning that a failure to do so would have devastating long-term consequences to the nation's economy. ""We start 2009 in the midst of a crisis unlike any we have seen in our lifetime, a crisis that has only deepened over the last few weeks,"" Obama said at George Mason University in Virginia.  Watch Obama call for ""dramatic action"" on the economy » . ""I don't believe it's too late to change course, but it will be if we don't take dramatic action as soon as possible,"" Obama continued. ""If nothing is done, this recession could linger for years."" Key members of Obama's own party, however, said they opposed central tax measures of the president-elect's proposals after emerging from a closed-door meeting of the Senate Finance Committee.  Watch Obama explain his tax proposals » . In particular, they do not think that giving employers a $3,000 tax credit for each worker they hired would work. ""I'm not that excited about that,"" said Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. ""Having a tax credit for hiring is not going to change that dynamic; creating a direct job will. So I'd rather spend the money on the infrastructure, on direct investment, on energy conversion and other kinds of things, much more directly and much more rapidly and much more certainly create a real job."" Sen. Kent Conrad agreed. ""I think it's unlikely to be effective,"" the North Dakota senator said. ""If you think about it, businesspeople are not going to hire people to produce products that are not selling. Who is going to hire in the auto industry if you give them a $3,000 credit to make cars that people are not buying?"" A second Obama tax proposal that several Democrats were down on is payroll tax credits, amounting to about $20 per paycheck and totaling $500 per person and $1,000 for couples earning less than $200,000 a year. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said he doubted that proposal would do much to stimulate the economy. ""We have an example from the first stimulus that indicates just giving people $500 to $600, while certainly welcome when there's this much economic hurt, may not be the best use of stimulus,"" Wyden said. Instead, Wyden said, pumping more money into infrastructure spending would be more effective in creating jobs. Conrad agreed with Wyden. ""Twenty dollars a week? I don't think that will be effective, either. That is in terms of economic impact. We have got to focus on what is actually going to lift the economy,"" Conrad said. None of the senators CNN spoke with after the meeting said they thought the opposition to these provisions would derail the bill but suggested that many meetings would be needed with the Obama team to hammer out an agreement. First votes in the Finance Committee, which must approve the tax components of the stimulus plan, could come in the next two weeks, senators and aides said.

"(CNN) -- The stock market crashed. Wall Street panicked. People stashed silver and gold under mattresses while businesses shut doors across America. People in Detroit, Michigan, line up for food at the Capuchin Soup Kitchen. We're talking, of course, about the Great Depression ... of 1873. That's the event that Scott Reynolds Nelson cites when asked to give an historical perspective on today's sputtering economy. The historian says the economic panic of 1873 started with the same toxic mix as today's crisis: risky mortgages, a stock market dive and the use of complex financial instruments that few understood. ""Until 1929, when people used the word[s] Great Depression they referred to 1873,"" says Nelson, a professor of history at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. ""That was a worldwide international depression that started with the banks. That's what we're seeing now. This looks like 1873."" The nation's economic crisis is not only causing people to look more closely at their 401(k) account statements. They're also turning to their history books. Politicians and commentators routinely invoke the Great Depression and other historical events to describe today's economic crisis.  Watch the debate over 'Depression' talk » . But how fair is that historical analogy? Why Great Depression comparisons may be unfair . James Kolari, an economist at Texas A&M University, says the nation experienced two ""rough"" recessions in the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. A recession is generally defined as a decline in the Gross Domestic Product for two or more consecutive quarters. He says it's not fair to compare the current economic crisis to the Great Depression, because the federal government was far more passive in the 1920s. ""We let 15,000 out of 30,000 banks fail,"" he says. ""Government efforts to jump-start the economy were slow and relatively weak until President [Franklin] Roosevelt came along with the New Deal."" Kolari says people can learn more by looking at Japan. He says the U.S. economy is facing the same crisis as Japan in the 1990s when the Japanese economy collapsed from a real estate bubble and never fully recovered. ""The Japanese government moved too slowly and not aggressively enough,"" he says. ""The problems festered."" David George, a professor of economics at La Salle University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, says the federal government better protects ordinary people from financial ruin today than during the first stages of the Great Depression. Today we reap the benefits of policies created during that era, George says. Roosevelt helped create New Deal legislation to insure bank deposits and enacted other modern relief efforts like unemployment compensation to help those in distress. ""By any measure, incomes were lower then than now, and the worst imaginable loss of output today would still keep the nation well above where we were back then,"" George says. Marjorye Heeney is not an economist, but she definitely knows something about the Great Depression. Heeney, 83, grew up on an Oklahoma farm during the Great Depression and lived through the 1930s Dust Bowl storms. For much of that decade, ""black blizzards"" -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged the southern Plains. Heeney, who now lives in Topeka, Kansas, snorted when told that today's conditions remind some of the Great Depression. During the Depression, crops failed, and few had a job, car or clothes, she says. ""Everyone had one nail for themselves in the clothes closet,"" Henney says. Henney says the Great Depression toughened people up. People grew and canned their own food, sewed their own clothes and learned how to make possessions last. ""No one really came from wealth, and nothing was easy,"" she says. ""But people got by because they had a wonderful spirit of survival. We're not as gutsy. I don't know if we have that today."" Why this economic period is still frightening . Victor Matheson, an economist at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, says the nation's most recent recession was the dot-com bust, which hit around March of 2001. ""This recession has already eclipsed the dot-com bust in every fashion,"" he says. ""During that time, the GDP did not fall much, and unemployment did not rise much."" Matheson offers one bit of good news, though. He says today's unemployment rate is not as bad as in previous eras. The unemployment rate reached 10.8 percent during the early 1980s and 25 percent during the Great Depression, he says. Yet Matheson says there is an ominous feature to the current situation: The Federal Reserve has already lowered interest rates as far as they can go, to around zero percent, but the recession marches on. The current recession is so ""scary"" that Matheson says he has reversed his attitude on Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan. He once opposed it but now supports it because he can't think of anything that might work better. He says the economy will not bounce back on its own anytime soon . ""You gotta go with what you got,"" he says. ""The Federal Reserve has loosed all of its cannons, and it has nothing left. Now we're down to fiscal policy."" Nelson, the historian who has studied the panic of 1873, says today's economy might even be worse than the American economy in 1873. ""This is a perfect storm: banks failing, stock markets declining and commodity prices dropping,"" Nelson says. Nelson says it took America four years to recover from the 1873 panic. Tens of thousands of workers -- many Civil War veterans -- became homeless. Thousands lined up for food and shelter in major cities. The Gilded Age, where wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few ""robber barons like John D. Rockefeller,"" followed the panic. America, of course, pulled out of the panic. Nelson is just not quite sure how the nation is going to do it now. His ultimate assessment of today's economy is blunt: . ""It looks grim.""","Is it fair to invoke Great Depression?
Some economists say comparison overblown .
Nation had another Great Depression few remember, scholar says .

"Editor's note: CNN agreed not to use the full names of the family members in this article due to concern for their safety. Youssif and his surgeon, Dr. Peter Grossman, shake hands at the end of their Wednesday visit. SHERMAN OAKS, California (CNN)  -- Youssif nervously scanned the doctor's examining room, his dark brown eyes darting around, from the floor to the wall to the ceiling. His mother stroked his hair and then his forehead to put him at ease before the doctor walked in to the room. A day earlier, the badly burned 5-year-old Iraqi boy had boarded a plane in Amman, Jordan, with his family, their first trip on an airplane. Now, more than 7,500 miles later, his mom, dad and 14-month-old sister were with him at the Grossman Burn Center in the heart of sunny Southern California. Dr. Peter Grossman strode into the room, a warm smile across his face. He held Youssif's hand. The boy turned shyly around and buried his face into his father's leg. ""This is not unusual,"" said Grossman, a plastic surgeon with more than 12 years of experience, including helping one young girl whose face had melted to her shoulder after a horrific accident.  Watch Youssif show his scars to Grossman for the first time » . A father of two children, Grossman spoke softly and reassured Youssif that they would soon be friends. ""We're going to do everything we can to make him better,"" he told Youssif's parents. Perhaps haunted by the pain he suffered in Baghdad's hospitals, Youssif hiccupped back sobs as his father lifted him onto the examination table. But the boy put on a brave face after his father told him to let the doctor do his job. ""Who's the brave one? Youssif,"" his father whispered reassuringly. ""He's not going to hurt you, I promise."" Grossman pulled out measuring tape and took measurements of scars under the boy's chin and around his nose. One swollen scar around his chin measured nearly 3 inches. He also examined burns on Youssif's hands, forehead and right ear. At one point, Youssif thrust his head back and opened his mouth as best he could for the doctor. But his lips barely separated, their movement hampered by the swollen, hardened flesh. ""What we want to eventually do is be able to get him to open his mouth as wide as he can,"" Grossman said. Youssif faces eight to 10 operations, possibly more, over the next six to eight months. He also will undergo psychological therapy to help him better adapt to all that has happened to him.  See photos of the boy's arrival in the U.S. » . On January 15, masked men grabbed Youssif outside his central Baghdad home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. Grossman won't be able to make all the scars go away, he said, but he's confident that ""we can make him significantly better."" ""We're going to do everything we can to move forward and to do a good job,"" he said. The boy's mother nodded solemnly. ""I just want my son's smile back,"" she told the doctor. Watch how masked men stole a boy's smile . Youssif was introduced to his other doctors, a pediatrician and anesthesiologist. The boy cuddled into the warm confines of his father's chest. His dark eyes kept a keen watch on all those around him. His first operation could come as early as next week and involve multiple procedures. Grossman will cut away scar tissue around his nose and put temporary skin from a cadaver over it. ""We're also going to stick a balloon underneath the good skin under his neck and on his face,"" the doctor said. ""The purpose of that is over time we will stretch the good skin, so that in about three months he will be able to go back to surgery, remove the scar tissue and pull up the stretched out good tissues."" Grossman eventually will work to repair Youssif's upper lip. ""We're going to make you a lot better,"" he said. With that, the doctor brought this introductory session to a close. The two shook hands. He also tried teaching Youssif an American guy classic: hitting your fists together in cool approval. Youssif watched and listened. He stretched his fist out, then pulled it back. He looked up at his father and then slammed his fist with his father's -- the only man this wounded boy trusts right now. His father caressed his son's hair and planted a soft kiss on his head. He risked so much for this moment for his son. This was more than just a journey from Iraq to America. ""I'm emotionally exhausted,"" Youssif's dad said. ""We went from death to a new life."" E-mail to a friend .","Burned Iraqi boy will undergo eight to 10 surgeries in coming months .

"KARACHI, Pakistan (CNN) -- Some of the toughest criticism of Pakistan's pro-democracy movement comes from an unlikely source: the 25-year-old niece of Benazir Bhutto, who says Pakistani party politics do nothing but support military rule. It's an environment, she said, her late aunt is partly responsible for. Fatima Bhutto says she's not interested in ""perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics ... because of my name."" ""At this stage, we are in a state in Pakistan where so-called democratic forces are only interested in coming into office. So ultimately, they only prop up dictatorships,"" she told CNN from her home in Karachi. She raised her voice as she described what she feels is the core of Pakistan's political problems: the lack of a true democratic culture. Instead, she said, the country is run by power grabbers. ""Ultimately to them, it's a game of revolving chairs. As long as they get to be in one, they don't care who's in the other one."" Fatima Bhutto said her aunt played this ""game of revolving chairs"" at huge costs to the Bhutto family, shattering the clan's unity. In 1996, Fatima Bhutto's father, Murtaza Bhutto, was gunned down by Pakistani security forces in front of the family compound. His sister, Benazir, was prime minister at the time. His widow blames her sister-in-law for the killing, because Murtaza had become a political rival.  Watch Fatima Bhutto say she's not ""interested in being a symbol"" » . ""We have to seriously look at her political legacy, which is deeply flawed,"" Fatima Bhutto said. ""Both her governments were known for widespread corruption, for an abuse of human rights, and for an excess of police violence."" Fatima Bhutto was estranged from her aunt and had not spoken to her since Benazir Bhutto returned to the nation for Pakistani elections. Benazir Bhutto was killed in a bloody December 27 attack. Her niece says now that Benazir Bhutto has herself been killed, she does not look back in anger.  Watch a struggle over the Bhutto legacy » . ""We also have to take into account that Benazir Bhutto died bravely and that the attack on her is ultimately an attack on her country,"" she said. She added that she did attend her aunt's funeral. Some here in Pakistan believe Fatima Bhutto -- and not Benazir Bhutto's 19-year-old son, Bilawal -- is the true heir to the Bhutto political dynasty. Fatima Bhutto said she's a political person and does campaign for a splinter group of the Pakistan Peoples Party. That group is now run by her mother following the death of her father. She said her main political goal is to empower Pakistan's largely disenfranchised masses and end what she calls the perpetual cycle of ""dynastic"" cronyism. What her role would be in making that happen remains the great unknown. ""What I think we need to do is open the field,"" said Fatima Bhutto, who went to college in the United States and graduate school in England. ""It has to stop being this autocratic, dynastic environment. ... When that day comes and this happens -- that we have an open field -- if there's a way for me to serve this country, then I would be proud to."" Until then, she said, she exerts her power from her writing. Fatima Bhutto is a successful columnist, author and poet; a staunch critic of Pervez Musharraf's government. And though her name would probably propel her to the highest levels of Pakistani politics almost instantly, she said that won't happen anytime soon. ""I'm not interested in being a symbol for anyone,"" she said emphatically. ""And I'm not interested in perpetuating a really ineffectual form of politics simply because of my name."" She added, ""I have never believed in dynastic politics, or the politics of birthright. ... I think that's dangerous to the cause of democracy in Pakistan, and ultimately doesn't serve the people.""

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy has spoken for the first time about the reasons her divorce in an interview with a French newspaper. The announcement ended weeks of speculation over their marriage. Cecilia Sarkozy told L'Est Republicain on Friday that the couple's relationship had not been able to survive the glare of the media spotlight following a highly public separation in 2005. The Sarkozys announced on Thursday they were divorcing by mutual consent after 11 years of marriage. A former model, Cecilia Sarkozy said that she was not comfortable with her position as first lady. ""I am someone who likes the shadows, serenity, tranquility. I had a husband who was a public man, I always knew that, I accompanied him for 20 years. But me, I think that is not my place. It is no longer my place,"" she was quoted as saying. The couple has been dogged by persistent rumors of infidelities, which Cecilia Sarkozy seemed to confirm in her newspaper interview. Explaining the events that led to the couple separating in 2005, she said: ""Two years ago an event happened of which unfortunately the whole of France is aware. In 2005, I met someone, I fell in love and I left."" The French president, in Portugal for an EU summit, has declined to comment on his marriage breakdown. His divorce comes as he deals with crippling public sector strikes at home that have shut down much of France's transit system. Cecilia Sarkozy was a smiling figure at her husband's inauguration in May as she stood with the couple's five children. But she said recently she didn't see herself as having any role at all as the president's wife. For the French public, news of the divorce is unlikely to come as a shock. French presidents and their spouses have a long tradition of leading separate lives, even while carrying on the functions of state. Former President Francois Mitterrand not only lived apart from his wife, Danielle, but he maintained a secret second family that turned up in public only at his funeral. Jacques Chirac, who stepped down when Sarkozy was elected this year, hinted at a number of affairs. He and his wife lived largely separate lives, appearing together only at presidential functions. Nicolas Sarkozy said at the start of his term that he had no worries as president, except for his wife.

"(CNN) -- Katy Brown is an Internet-savvy college freshman with conservative perspectives who worries about the future of the Republican Party. Katy Brown, Kevin Neugebauer, Barbara Rademacher and Chuck Burkhard discuss the future of the GOP. Brown, a student at Kent State University in Ohio, joined other Republicans and conservative independent iReporters in an online roundtable discussion. The Republican National Committee selected Michael Steele to become its chairman Friday during its annual winter meeting after the decisive victory of President Obama in November. Over the next four years, Republicans must regroup and establish a strategy, and the new GOP leader must navigate a political landscape where the Democrats control the White House and both houses of Congress.

The fourth panel participant, Barbara Rademacher, said she had a difficult time making her decision during the 2008 election. She finally settled on McCain but says she is very much an independent voter. Social issues such as abortion are what swung her to the right, but she said the party focused too much on attacks. ""I hate the Republican Party the way it is right now. I hated the way they acted during the election and some of the ideas they came up with as election strategies,"" she said.

""I think he may be the only hope for the Republican Party,"" she said. Burkhard, Brown and Neugebauer all agreed that Huckabee would be a good presidential candidate. Neugebauer said he also likes former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and advocated for a return to strong Republican politics. ""I just think what we need to do is, we need to concentrate on the core values that the Republican Party was started on,"" he said. ""There's too many fence-huggers.

"(CNN) -- The last eight years In the United States have included momentous events including the September 11 attacks, the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and an economic recession. Ted Stanke of New York created a symbolic map of the United States out of toy soldiers to protest the Iraq war. Historic moments defined President Bush's time in office, and now the world must wait to see how history will define him. Just 27 percent of the respondents to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll said they approved of Bush's handling of his job as president. Respondents also indicated they didn't want him to have future influence, with 66 percent saying they didn't want to see the president return to public life. We asked readers to share their views on Bush's legacy on iReport.com. The majority of the responses expressed disappointment with the president's performance. Many readers with whom we spoke said they were deeply frustrated with the way Bush handled issues such as the Iraq war, the economy and Hurricane Katrina.  Watch Bush discuss handling of Katrina » . Cathy Cott, 49, of Tahlequah, Oklahoma, vented her ""boiling anger"" on iReport.com.

She says she is now a registered Democrat who voted for Barack Obama. iReport.com: Bubbling over . ""I guess the simplest reason for my boiling anger is I have three kids and they will spend their lives paying for Bush's policies, wars, economic disasters and the general mess he is leaving behind both monetarily and in their general quality of life,"" Cott said.

He can scarcely remember the Bush presidency before 9/11 and expects phrases such as ""weapons of mass destruction,"" ""Axis of Evil"" and ""You're either with us or against us"" to be associated permanently with him. He hopes for a brighter future with President-elect Barack Obama. ""History will likely be kinder to Bush than his contemporaries are, but a Washington, Lincoln or Roosevelt he will not become,"" Molisani said. ""What is interesting to note is that some of the worst presidents in history have been followed by the best presidents. Perhaps we will have a bright future to look forward to.""

John McCain's example and make a gracious speech after the inauguration. ""Speak to the American people passionately and gracefully about Obama taking the presidency,"" Davis said. ""That would probably help people."" His presidency wasn't all bad, she said. ""Well, he was good for 9/11, and he caught Saddam [Hussein], but he ran the country into the ground with unneeded funding for an unneeded war in Iraq,"" she wrote.

""It's hell, it's absolutely hell,"" she said. ""I really hope Obama can fix the economy so we can have our lives again and live the American dream."" The desire to dream again was a common theme, and many iReporters said they yearn for more hopeful times.

""I am afraid that George Bush will be judged harshly by history,"" Finney said. ""I am also afraid that judgment will be deserved."" But critics should be careful about taking aim at Bush, warns David P. Kronmiller of Burbank, California. ""I do not think we should be blaming him for the misery of the last eight years.

"Editor's note: CNN agreed not to use the full names of the family in this article due to concern for their safety. Youssif is able to smile again, and his scars are healing well. Doctors are monitoring the swelling on his right ear. WOODLAND HILLS, California (CNN) -- Youssif happily pulls off his plastic face mask and pats his cheeks, which were once covered by horrific burns. ""No hurt,"" the 5-year-old Iraqi boy says in English. ""No hurt."" He then shows off his right hand. It too had been marred by hardened scar tissue after he was attacked by masked men outside his central Baghdad home January 15, 2007. Now, his hand is smooth.   Youssif flashes a proud grin. A few moments later, he darts off and comes back toting his kindergarten portfolio. In less than a month of schooling, he's now writing the alphabet in upper- and lowercase.  See photos of a transformed Youssif » . He reads a book, repeating each word after the narrator. When he gets to the word ""you,"" he gets tickled. He points at the name ""Youssif"" and then covers the final four letters. ""You,"" he says. Youssif began attending an American school just last month, one year to the day after he was so savagely attacked in Baghdad. In a recent letter to those who have helped his son, Youssif's father described the anniversary as a ""very hard day"" to endure but one that also brought joy. ""But this year, it was the day for another miracle, Youssif's first day of kindergarten. It was a very happy day,"" Youssif's father said. Youssif begins each day with his father strapping him into a bike trailer. Dad then pedals him to school. On one recent outing, his dad's mobile phone blared Arabic music as Youssif quietly sat in the back, a helmet securely strapped to his head, the wind whirling past. As soon as they reached the school, Youssif's slow walk away from his father, his head held down, quickly changed into a sprint toward his classroom, and all you could see was the big red ""S"" on his Superman backpack flying away. ""Harry,"" Youssif says in a small, muffled tone, reading the writing on the dry-erase board after receiving a little help from some classmates seated on the rug.  Watch Youssif-inspired music video » . He then receives a congratulatory high-five from one of his kindergarten teachers. Youssif is adjusting well to school, able to write out the alphabet and count to 12 without hesitation. He always finishes with an accomplished sigh, wide eyes and a smile so big, it's as if he is making up for the 10 months he was not able to smile. He is quick to show the pencil box on his desk, pointing to his name written on it and then pointing to himself with the same tiny finger and nodding his head, letting you know that it is his. ""The kids love Youssif. They get more excited than he does when he learns a new word in English, and they brag about it for hours,"" the mother of a classmate says. Youssif is attending the school thanks to help from the Children's Burn Foundation, the Grossman Burn Center and hundreds of thousands of dollars donated by you, the CNN.com user, to help bring him and his family to the United States for treatment. Youssif has undergone more than half a dozen surgeries. One removed the most massive scarring, which stretched about half a foot, from one of his ears to below his chin.  See how doctors removed Youssif's scars » . He could undergo as many as 12 more procedures, his doctors say, mostly to tweak scars. His right ear has swelled, and doctors are monitoring it to figure out the best way to keep it in check. He wears a clear plastic face mask for much of the day to keep his skin tight and to allow it to heal correctly. But the young boy's transformation -- both in looks and in spirit -- is nothing short of remarkable. Back at his apartment, Youssif peels a clementine. He uses exaggerated motions as he plops each section in his mouth. At one point, he places his hand on his hip and taps his foot, waiting for an acknowledgment of this feat. When he came to America in September, he couldn't eat -- or at least not like this. He smiles again. ""Now, Youssif eats anything he wants, because he can open and close his mouth,"" his father said in the letter. ""I have begun to see my son's lively spirit return. The surgeries have removed more than just external scars, they are also beginning to remove his internal scars. ""A few weeks ago we went to the park and Youssif rode on the merry-go-round. Every time he passed by, he shrieked and laughed and waved wildly to me. I thought my heart would burst with happiness.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Despite the rain, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" shone brightly at the British Academy Awards Sunday, scooping a clutch of honors. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" director Danny Boyle shields composer A.R. Rahman from the rain as they arrive Sunday at the BAFTA awards in London. Not even the drizzle could dampen Danny Boyle's spirits as ""Slumdog,"" his Mumbai-set rags to riches movie phenomenon won a remarkable seven awards at the glitziest night in the UK film calendar. ""You make a film like this and you just hope and pray it will be seen by a few people,"" the British director told CNN. ""And the journey it's been on, the reception it's had around the world, has just been extraordinary."" Watch Danny Boyle, Dev Patel and Freida Pinto talking about ""Slumdog"" on the red carpet. As was widely expected, following its haul of four Golden Globes last month including Best Motion Picture, ""Slumdog"" took the Best Film award. ""I'd like to acknowledge the blood, sweat and tears of our cast,"" said the film's producer, Christian Colson who accepted the award. ""The film you saw is the film Danny Boyle imagined and it's very rare you can say that. He dreamed the dream, 24-hours a day, seven days a week for two and a half years."" Boyle's labors were recognized by the Academy, handing him the Director award, which he can add to the BAFTA he won for debut feature ""Shallow Grave"" in 1995. ""Slumdog"" has touched audiences and critics alike. Boyle thinks the film's extraordinary effect is down to its universal message of hope. ""It's the contrast I think between where the kid comes from and what he achieves,"" said Boyle. ""And he achieves everything on his own terms, and that gives you a kind of hope, really, which we all, no matter how romantic it is, we all need that."" Watch Bollywood legend and ""Slumdog"" star Anil Kapoor talking about the ""Slumdog"" phenomenon. ""Slumdog"" also won the Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay, Music, Sound and Editing awards. Closest rival David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" which was up for 11 awards, bagged only three. These included a richly-deserved Make Up & Hair award for the feat of transforming Brad Pitt into an octogenarian baby to tell the curious story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he ages. Actress Kate Winslet also continued her success streak, scoring the Leading Actress honor for her powerful portrayal of a former-Nazi concentration camp guard in Stephen Daldry's ""The Reader."" Conversely, Winslet both won and lost the award having been nominated twice in the same category, which included Meryl Streep for ""Doubt,"" and Kristin Scott Thomas for ""I've Loved You So Long."" But most eyes were on the actress to see if there would be a repeat performance of the breathlessly incoherent acceptance speech she made at the Golden Globes last month after winning two awards. ""These are really special moments. And I don't want to waste them,"" Winslet told CNN on the red carpet before going on to accept her award with no tears or obvious emotion. Instead she simply thanked her parents and the late Anthony Minghella and the late Sydney Pollack, two of the film's producers. Watch Kate Winslet talking about her ""amazing year"" on the red carpet. Reformed Hollywood badboy Mickey Rourke provided the only mild controversy of the night with a few expletives in his acceptance speech for the Best Actor award. ""Thank you Darren Aronofsky who gave me a second chance after I'd f***ed up my career for 15 years. Such a pleasure to be here, and be out of the darkness,"" he told the audience. Earlier, the actor told CNN how things have changed for him since the accolades started pouring in for his extraordinary performance in Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler."" ""I got a whole bunchy of new friends that I don't need,"" Rourke said. ""But I've also heard from some people that I'd worked with years ago that I'd burned bridges with that have come around. ""It's taken me a long time to change and come back and do things the right way. I'm just grateful for the second chance."" There were also gongs for Spain's Penelope Cruz, who took home Supporting Actress for her fiery scene-stealing performance as an unhinged artist in Woody Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" and the late Heath Ledger whose chilling reinvention of the Joker in Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" was recognized with the Supporting Actor award. Now, as attention turns to the upcoming Oscars, ""Slumdog's"" BAFTA wins will only increase the momentum behind the Best Picture nominee. After success at both the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, Kate Winslet could also be justified in looking forward to the Oscars with confidence.","""Slumdog Millionaire"" wins seven prizes at British film awards .

"CAMEMBERT, France (CNN) -- We're up in the north central part of France -- Normandy -- to see what's happening with French cheese. Cheese lovers will be happy to know, just about nothing, at least as far as the traditional cheeses are concerned. Cheese from the Camembert region now carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. But for the milk industry in general, it's another story. It has now a larger annual turnover than the steel industry in France (which admittedly is in decline.) Somehow the French have figured a way to export dairy products to people who already have cows and their own dairy industries-- to the tune of nearly €4 billion ($6 billion) per year. CNN spoke to a few of the people who do just that everyday and who are part of the changing face of France. Philippe Meslon, the mayor of Saint-Loup de Fribois and the administrator of the Saint-Loup cheese works says: ""A camembert not made out of raw milk is like making love without sex. ""A Frenchman is someone who cultivates with modern evolution his past. It's someone who protects moral values, cultural values and artistic values, and when I say cultural values I would include camembert."" Meslon and small cheese makers like Francois Durand, who has 40 cows, have struggled and won the right to an Appelation d'Origine Controllee -- the mark AOC for their ""Camembert de Normandie"" which carries the same cachet as a chateau label for wine. For Durand making cheese is about not cutting corners. ""You have to have the passion,"" he says.  ""Yes it's difficult because it means a lot of work. We make it all by hand. I do believe it is important because the cheese is an emblem of France. It is a gastronomic emblem."" Still some small cheesemakers have been driven out of business and the taste and smell of their particular cheeses are lost to the world forever. For Michel Delorme it was a combination of new, more stringent rules and his age that led him to quit producing his handmade Camemberts. Michel Delorme: ""It's more and more complicated for those who stay in the business. They must hold out! Yes I miss the cheese a little. That's true. But I've kept my souvenirs, you see I've kept my old milk cans so I can stay in the spirit of Camembert!"" Despite those who've quit, the actual number of the variety of cheeses in France is growing. At the last cheese census more than 1,000 different kinds of cheeses were made here. The milk industry is no small cheese in France, thanks to the efforts of people like Philippe Jachnik who travels the world endlessly promoting milk products, which these days include protein supplements and milk derivatives that can go into all sorts of processed food. Jachnik, who works for the milk marketing consortium, says: ""I really would say I am selling the French approach to milk. We EAT a lot of milk. We DRINK a lot of water, wine, beer and coffee. But drinking milk is not a big business here. ""France has developed technological and marketing knowledge about adding value to a raw material-- milk. I have been traveling for 40 years all around the world and I feel so welcome. When you are French and you demonstrate that being French you can listen to others, people are interested in knowing about this country, about its people, about the way of life here."" Jachnik must be doing a good job as it's not just abroad that the French are selling more milk products-- cheese consumption in France has doubled from 12 to 24 kilos per person per year. It seems there's no curding their enthusiasm ...  E-mail to a friend .","Milk industry is booming in France, now has larger turnover than steel industry .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a lifetime of playing characters past-their-prime, Clint Eastwood appears to still be enjoying his own. Clint Eastwood stars as inspector Harry Callahan in ""Dirty Harry"" (1971). Just last week the 78-year-old actor, best-known for his portrayal of ""tough guys"" like ""Dirty Harry,"" was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival. The American film-maker accepted the Palme d'Or (only the second they've ever given for lifetime achievement), while he was in town promoting his new film ""Gran Torino."" What is your favorite Clint Eastwood movie? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. Eastwood both directs and co-stars in ""Gran Torino,"" as a prejudiced Korean war veteran who comes to the rescue of troubled Asian teens who live next door. For Eastwood the honor caps a 40 year career acting, directing, producing and composing. During this time, he has won five Academy Awards, five Golden Globes and received many more nominations. The Hollywood veteran earned perhaps most acclaim for two films: ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). For each of these films he was awarded both Best Director and Best Picture Oscars, as well as being nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Eastwood got his break in 1959, landing the role of Rowdy Yates in the television series ""Rawhide."" A successful seven-year run helped turn Eastwood into a household name and landed him several other roles in so-called Spaghetti Western films, including the hit ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" (1964), directed by Sergio Leone. Leone then re-hired Eastwood for two more successful films: ""For a Few More Dollars"" (1965) and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966). The trilogy earned Eastwood greater fame and a reputation for playing tough-guy, gun-slinging cowboys. Eastwood found another friend in director Don Siegel who gave him perhaps his most iconic role, starring in ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) as no-nonsense, ""loose-cannon"" cop Harry Callahan. The film was such a hit that it four spin off sequels were made: ""Magnum Force"" (1973), ""The Enforcer"" (1976), ""Sudden Impact"" (1983) (the highest grossing film of the series), and ""The Dead Pool"" (1988). In the 1990s Eastwood returned to westerns -- this time as director as well as star -- earning critical acclaim and a monumental nine Oscar nominations for ""Unforgiven"" (1992). Throughout the decade he also had considerable success helming blockbuster projects, like ""In the Line of Fire"" (1993), ""Bridges of Madison County"" (1995) and ""True Crime"" (1999). In 2000 Eastwood co-starred in the box-office hit ""Space Cowboys."" In 2004, he put employed his entire array of movie skills directing, producing, scoring and co-starring alongside Hillary Swank in boxing drama ""Million Dollar Baby."" Until his most recent return to the screen in ""Gran Torino,"" Eastwood had been concentrating on directing, releasing two films about World War II in 2006, ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and directing Angelina Jolie to BAFTA, Golden Globe and Oscar nominations this year in ""Changeling."" Swedish director Ingmar Bergman is the only other film-maker to have received the Palme d'Or for lifetime achievement from the Cannes Film Festival.","Clint Eastwood wins a Palme d'Or for lifetime achievement .

"LONDON, England -- A yellow smiley-face badge, smeared with blood, has become the trademark for ""Watchmen,"" the most critically revered of all comic-books -- but it could also represent its troubled journey from page to big screen. ""Watchmen"" opens with the unexplained murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Note smiley badge. The subject of fervent debate in the geekosphere for more than two decades, ""Watchmen,"" finally rolls out in the U.S. and other territories from the first week of March onward. But it's not as well known to wider audiences, who may puzzle at all this heat about a superhero movie with no A-list star attached. Instead, they may simply ask: ""Watch-what?"" Are you looking forward to ""Watchmen?"" Or think it's just hype? Tell us your views . ""Watchmen,"" created by the UK comic-book team of writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, surfaced in 1986 as a monthly 12-issue series published by DC Comics (part of Time-Warner, which owns CNN parent company Turner Broadcasting). It was a defining year for the medium: aside from ""Watchmen,"" '86 also saw Pulitzer-prize winning holocaust drama ""Maus,"" from The New Yorker contributor Art Spielgeman; and Frank Miller's hyperviolent Batman reworking ""The Dark Knight Returns."" ""Watchmen,"" set in 1985, sets up a parallel world in which America never lost Vietnam, Russia is about to invade Afghanistan and Nixon still holds power (Bernstein and Woodward were murdered). Meanwhile a superhero team -- only one of whom has special powers -- reforms after a fellow operative is mysteriously slain. So far, so what. But what lifts ""Watchmen"" is a complex, multi-layered narrative and depth of characterization that ensured it was the only comic-book to make Time's 100 best novels since 1923. A dark, downbeat work with a heady 11th-hour twist, it puts as much store on subsidiary characters like a newspaper seller as its does blue-skinned man-god Dr Manhattan.  Watch ""Watchmen"" trailer. » . Perfect fodder, one might think, for the multiplex -- but ""Watchmen"" has been lodged in Development Hell for the best part of two decades. At various times Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vin Diesel were mooted to play Manhattan; Mickey Rourke and Ed Norton suggested for right-wing vigilante Rorschach. Directors set to shoot have included Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, Paul Greengrass and David Hayter (whose script has been retained for much of the final film). Several planned shoots failed to materialize due to studio fears about the budget (locations include Antarctica and Mars as well as New York) and how the ending might be perceived in a post-9/11 world.  But film-makers such as Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro also believed that the complex material would be better treated as a TV mini-series (as the ""Pan's Labyrinth"" film-maker told IGN: ""I just couldn't get my head around 'Watchmen' being two or three hours long."") Whoever made ""Watchmen"" would also do so without Moore's blessing. Still resident in his hometown of Northampton, central England, Moore cuts an imposing figure. At least six-and-a-half feet tall, with chest-length beard and hair, talon-like rings on his fingers and the skull of a centuries-old Buddhist monk in his study, he resembles Doctor Who as reimagined by Edgar Allan Poe. (In person he's gracious and affable, as this writer will attest from a few years back). Moore has had a mixed relationship with both the mainstream comic-book industry (which he accuses of over-commercialization and exploiting creators' rights) and Hollywood. The comic-book series ""From Hell,"" in which Moore uses the Jack the Ripper killings as a precursor to 20th-century violence, runs to about 500 pages, including 40-plus pages of footnotes. On film it became a melodramatic pad around Victorian London, gamely carried by a pre-""Pirates"" Johnny Depp. Two other Moore adaptations also failed to translate. Stephen Norrington's ""The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003) was widely derided and the subject of a court case into which Moore was dragged; by the time of James McTeigue's better judged ""V For Vendetta"" (2005), Moore had asked his name be taken off any movie adaptations and refused to take royalties. Enter Zack Snyder. In 2004, Snyder came to the attention of mainstream cinemagoers with his well-regarded remake of George A Romero's zombie flick ""Dawn of The Dead."" Following the $450m-plus taken worldwide by Snyder's ""300"" (2006)  -- a hyper-stylized take on Frank Miller's ancient Greek suicide-mission -- it was announced that ""Watchmen"" would be his next project with Warner Bros. Paramount, which abandoned plans for the movie in 2005, took international rights. The $150-million feature went into production in Vancouver in mid-2007, wrapping in early 2008, and with a cast including Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley. Snyder has retained ""Watchmen's"" 1980s setting and also recruited original artist Gibbons -- who still retains friendship with Moore -- to advise on production design. Mindful that a narrative so complex could never work as a movie, Snyder has jettisoned several parallel subplots, which will surface as DVD extras and in director's cuts. Word is that the ending has also been changed. But wary of over-tweaking, Snyder told Entertainment Weekly last year: ""You can't make it into something else, you really can't. It's not 'Fantastic Four,' it's got to be hard R [cinema rating], it's got to challenge everyone's ideas."" Meanwhile Moore, who sometimes mentions that he worships a Roman snake-god, hinted in the LA Times that he had cursed the feature. ""I can tell you that I will also be spitting venom all over it for months to come,"" he added. So was it Moore who saw ""Watchmen"" end up in the courts for a case that risked scuppering its release? Last year Twentieth Century Fox claimed it still retained rights through an earlier deal with producer Lawrence Gordon in the 1980s; Warners Bros disagreed but a judge decided there was a case to answer. A settlement was eventually  thrashed out last month, only weeks ahead of release. And so ""Watchmen"" ticks toward early March and a rollout in spring, the now-traditional season for edgier comic-book adaptations like ""300"" and ""Sin City."" Trailers and early footage have drawn praise, with several scenes playing like detailed frames from the original artwork. But key will be whether Snyder can match ""Watchmen's"" dramatic beats against its green-screen chicanery for more than two hours (IMDB lists the running time at 163 minutes). After all, successfully mixing pyrotechnics and narrative is how the most satisfying genre features of recent years -- such as Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy and Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" -- have found artistic, as well as commercial, favor. Should Snyder pull it off then will he earn the gratitude of fan boys everywhere, as well as no small thanks from a fair few movie executives. What Alan Moore might think is another issue.","Comic-book movie, directed by Zack Snyder, took two decades to reach cinemas .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The designers behind a ""thinking"" yacht are hoping to break a world record by sending it across the Atlantic Ocean without any human assistance. The autonomous yacht Avalon is hoisted to have her keel put in place before launching . The four-meter boat, ""Avalon"", was designed and built by an eight-strong team of third-year engineering students at Swiss science university ETH Zurich. The students are planning to take the boat to a robotic sailing regatta in July, before launching it into the Microtransat Transatlantic challenge in early September. Using sensors to detect the speed and direction of the wind, the boat is programmed to reach a given co-ordinate and will attain it by automatically adapting to the changing conditions. One of the ""Students Sailing Autonomously"" (SSA) team's project managers, Hendrik Erckens, told CNN that if the Atlantic crossing succeeds it will be a world record as an unmanned boat has not previously made the voyage. It is planned the crossing will begin from the west coast of Ireland and finish in the Caribbean. ""For us the Microtransat challenge is the big goal. I'm pretty confident we can do it. This week in testing it is pretty much doing what it's supposed to do. And it is water tight. ""Over the last couple of days we tried some autonomous tacks and jibes and now we are testing the navigation,"" he said. See photos of the autonomous yacht from construction to launch » . The team has been working on the project since September 2008, and are currently at the on-water testing stage, having designed and built the boat. While the team will be able to track the boat through an onboard global positioning system (GPS) during the transatlantic voyage, Erckens said as long as the challenge is active they won't have any control over the vessel. ""We will set it out and it will be completely autonomous. There are solar cells on the back for power and extra power supplies on board. ""There is a satellite communication system on board and the boat can download weather information by itself so it can calculate the best route to travel,"" he said. Erckens said the team is positive that the carbon-fibre boat will survive the rough Atlantic seas -- an issue that has stopped many manned crossings before -- including Richard Branson's attempt at the fastest transatlantic crossing aboard the 99-foot Virgin Money last fall. ""We feel our advantage over other teams is that we are mechanical engineers. We have designed this boat ourselves and exactly for this purpose."" Erckens said the idea could one day offer a new autopilot option for large yachts. ""The idea came as there are autopilots for boats out there, but currently the commercially available autopilots only steer the rudder. We are looking to control the sails as well.""","University students at ETH Zurich have designed and built a robotic boat .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama won a battle against Somali pirates. But does he really want to go to war? The USS Bainbridge tows a lifeboat in which the captain of the Maersk Alabama was held hostage. You may have seen the headlines in the last few days: a Somali pirate attack and hostage-taking ended with a precision operation by U.S. snipers and a successful rescue. Somali pirates have been the scourge of the Horn of Africa for years. They've attacked dozens of ships and taken hundreds of hostages from several countries. The attack on the Maersk Alabama was the first on an American ship. But when it was over, Obama made a particularly broad pledge. ""We are resolved to halt the rise of piracy in that region,"" Obama said. ""We're going to have to continue to work with our partners to prevent future attacks. We have to continue to be prepared to confront them when they arise.""  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . Experts say that means addressing the anarchy ashore which allows the pirates to operate. Somalia is a failed state, where lawlessness is a license for every kind of criminal enterprise. James Christodoulou of Industrial Shipping Enterprises Corporation told CNN that if the US wants to do something about piracy, it has to ""go to Somalia and deal with the cause there. Whether it's with bullets or butter, the solution lies on land not at sea."" The U.S. tried once before to impose order in Somalia, with disastrous results. It led a humanitarian mission to oversee the delivery of food aid that turned into an armed operation against local warlords. More than 40 U.S. personnel were killed before U.S. forces withdrew. That's the challenge facing the leader of every nation whose ships have fallen prey to the pirates. An international effort has been underway to patrol the troubled waters. The French navy has been particularly active. But no one has rushed onto Somali soil. The Obama administration is already managing wars in two countries. Wait and see whether it's really willing to risk a third.","President Barack Obama says U.S. is committed to tackling piracy off Somalia .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation. Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles. Cole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was ""responding well and recuperating"" Thursday, her publicist said. Cole had been on what she called ""a very long list"" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match. It was a ""directed donation"" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone. ""Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,"" Mone said. Directed organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said. The donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said. Cole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on March 31. ""I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,"" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. ""I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body."" Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue. Cole won six Grammys for her 1991 critically acclaimed album ""Unforgettable: With Love,"" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album ""Still Unforgettable"" and another Grammy for her work on another album. Cole was still able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment. She canceled a planned show last week in South Korea because of her illness, which meant she was in Los Angeles when the organ became available. ""I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's -- it's amazing,"" Cole said. During King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated. King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole. ""These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,"" King said. Cole stared at the papers for a moment. ""There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say,"" Cole said. Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A process that started months ago among White House lawyers to compile a list of possible Supreme Court picks has accelerated with word Justice David Souter plans to step down from the bench in June. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the only female high court justice. Women likely will be high on the Souter successor list. The nominee would give President Obama an immediate opportunity to place his stamp on the nation's highest court, and perhaps to begin cementing his legacy with a lifetime appointment to that bench. Obama on Friday said he will seek ""somebody with a sharp, independent mind and a record of excellence and integrity."" That person must honor traditions, respect the judicial process and share Obama's grasp of constitutional values, he said. The president said he intends to consult with people in both political parties as he makes his choice to replace Souter. Legal sources say Obama's legal team will begin refocusing what had been an aggressive effort to fill federal vacancies on lower federal court seats. Now their attention will be directed into a search for Souter's replacement. Administration officials have been working closely with key senators and Democratic legal advisers on possible choices. ""The [Obama] White House and the Justice Department certainly have people there already thinking about the issues, compiling lists, starting to vet the backgrounds of those candidates,"" said Edward Lazarus, a Supreme Court legal expert and a legal adviser during the Obama transition. A mix of federal judges and political allies are among the names the administration is said to be informally considering, said legal and political sources. Among them are federal appeals court judges Sonia Sotomayor, 55, of New York; Diane Wood, 59, of Chicago; and Solicitor General Elena Kagan. Those sources say women candidates will be at or near the top of the list of finalists. ""The president has long recognized the need for more gender diversity on the high court,"" said one source who asked not to be identified. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 76, is the only woman on the high court. Sotomayor is near the top of the list of many sources consulted by CNN. She is a Hispanic-American named a federal trial judge by President Bush in 1992 and elevated to her seat in 1996. Her supporters call her a moderate who would enjoy bipartisan support in the Senate. But conservative legal blogs in recent weeks have been sharply questioning her judicial philosophy, perhaps anticipating a high court vacancy. Fights over judicial nominees have grown increasingly partisan and nasty in recent years, sparked by the confirmation fights over Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court. Bork was rejected by lawmakers, while Thomas sits on the high court. Many of President George W. Bush's judicial choices were blocked by Democratic senators, and his two Supreme Court picks were the subject of massive ad campaigns launched by advocacy groups on both sides of the political debate. Conservatives have vowed to give Obama the same treatment over his choices. Most of Bush's lower court choices were not named until August 2001, seven months into his first term. The political and practical stakes are high. Sources have said privately the president is not interested in choosing ""extreme"" liberals to the bench, an idea echoed by some legal analysts.  Watch CNN's Bill Schneider examine Obama's options » . ""I don't expect to see President Obama naming some real firebrands, the kind that might be real lightning-rods for controversial confirmation hearings,"" said Lazarus. Conservatives ""are assuming that in his heart of hearts, Obama is an activist, old-fashioned, liberal firebrand on judicial issues, and, at least if one goes by what President Obama has written on the subject, he's not."" Obama, a Harvard Law School graduate, has taught constitutional law in Chicago. Republicans have warned the White House not to shut them out of the overall judicial selection process. In a March 2 letter, 41 GOP senators urged Obama ""to consult with us as it considers possible nominations to the federal courts from our states."" If not consulted, they said, ""The Republican Conference will be unable to support moving forward on that nominee.""  Watch CNN's Dana Bash report on how Republicans might respond » . Translation, say liberal groups: filibusters and obstructionist tactics. ""Republican senators fought hard against some of President Clinton's candidates,"" said Nan Aron, who heads the the Alliance for Justice. ""I think we saw it during Eric Holder's hearing [for attorney general]. Republican senators were testing out messages, not designed to deny confirmation to Eric Holder but to test them to see whether those tactics would work with some of Obama's judicial nominees,"" Aron said. ""That's going to happen. There's no question about it."" The fight over Souter's seat could be just the opening act to perhaps two more high court vacancies under Obama. Bush burnished his conservative credentials by naming Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito to the high court, and helped increase the overall conservative bent of most federal courts. Republicans have controlled the White House -- and thereby court nominations -- in 28 of the last 40 years. Seven of the nine high court members were named by GOP presidents. Obama has said Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- liberals named by President Clinton -- are his kind of judges, but Obama has spoken only in general terms about the type of person he would nominate. ""I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through,"" he said at the October 15 presidential debate.","President Obama has chance to place his stamp on the Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- The question is starting to feel a little old: Whom will Barack Obama pick as his vice president? Sen. Barack Obama has a big event scheduled Saturday. Will his No. 2 man (or woman) be by his side? With the clock ticking (the Democratic VP candidate delivers a big speech next Wednesday) the announcement is at most days and at least a few hours away. Everyday seems to be ""the day,"" the day the guessing game will finally end. In a poke at all of the VP buzz, the Obama campaign sent an e-mail to reporters Wednesday with the subject line ""Vice presidential ..."" The first line of the e-mail: ""Just kidding."" The e-mail contained details about Obama's schedule with no mention of any of the potential vice presidential candidates. But if the top contenders have any inside information, they're doing a good job of keeping quiet. Sen. Joe Biden told reporters camped outside his Delaware home Tuesday that it's not him. ""You got better things to do, guys; I'm not the guy,"" he said. Asked where he would be Saturday -- when Obama is reportedly scheduled to hold a campaign event in Springfield, Illinois, that may feature his new running mate -- Biden replied, ""here,"" pointing to his driveway. He softened up a little later that night, telling reporters, ""I promise you, I don't know anything."" Along with Biden, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine are considered to be among the top tier of VP contenders.  Watch the latest on Obama's VP selection » . Bayh has managed to stay out of the spotlight this week. Does that mean he's dodging the question? He hit the Sunday talk show circuit this weekend and tried out the attack dog role, criticizing Republican John McCain for his stance on Georgia, Iraq and national security. When asked about the veepstakes, the former governor said he had ""nothing to report today."" Kaine, on the other hand, seems to have no qualms about taking the main stage this week. A relative newcomer to national politics, Kaine is scheduled to appear alongside Obama on Thursday as the presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns in central Virginia. Could he be introduced as Obama's No. 2 man? The pair will host an invitation-only town hall meeting Thursday in Chesterfield County, a suburb of Richmond. Kaine's sturdy performance in the traditionally conservative Richmond suburbs helped vault him to the governorship in 2005. Obama has stops scheduled in Virginia on Wednesday and Thursday before returning home to Illinois for the Springfield event, which takes place where he first kicked off his presidential run. The event marks the beginning of a tour of battleground states leading into next week's convention in Denver, Colorado. The Obama campaign has kept the details on both the timing and selection of the running mate under wraps. They would neither confirm or deny whether Obama would appear with his VP candidate this weekend. iReport.com: Whom do you think Obama should pick? Although the focus in recent days has been on Bayh, Biden and Kaine, there are quite a few other serious contenders, and a curveball pick could always be in the works. Other big names thought to be in the running include retired Gen. Wesley Clark, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, Texas Rep. Chet Edwards, Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine, former Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Obama's campaign says that when he makes up his mind, he'll send a text message and e-mail to his supporters to let them know who his sidekick will be.","Democratic VP candidate gives big speech next Wednesday at convention .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Walking through a maze of narrow streets south of Tiananmen Square, Nick Frisch appeared unfazed by the sight of drastic changes -- traditional courtyard houses that once lined up these hutongs, or alleys, now in different stages of being knocked down. Nick Frisch's underground exploration in Beijing has attracted the attention of a Singapore TV crew. While the Qianmen area is going through an extreme makeover -- a restoration of its Qing dynasty flavor ahead of the Olympics -- Frisch's destination is safe from the city's ubiquitous wrecking balls. Upon reaching the entrance to the Underground City, however, he was told it was closed for ""renovation,"" just like the surrounding neighborhood. ""It's like they're trying to literally bury this place before the Games,"" said Frisch, a recent graduate of Columbia University in the United States, with a major in history and Chinese language. This place is a vast network of tunnels built beneath Beijing's city center during the 1970s in anticipation of a nuclear war with the Soviets. Covering an area of 85 square kilometers and containing 1,000 anti-air raid structures, the subterranean complex was said to have been mostly hand-dug by 300,000 local residents. ""The plan was to move half of Beijing's population underground and the other half to western hills in the event of a nuclear attack,"" Frisch explained. The 22-year-old New York native has lived in China on and off for a year and is fascinated by the bomb shelter and its history. After the authorities opened part of the Underground City as a tourist attraction to woo foreigners, he turned a routine visit to an adventure in 2006. Armed with a flashlight, Frisch veered off from the mandatory guided tour. Moving sandbags and unchaining doors, he explored the off-limit area and found rooms with bunk beds and decayed cardboard boxes of water purifiers. ""It's more than just propaganda posters down there -- it really is a parallel universe, with street signs stenciled on the wall,"" Frisch said. Since then, Frisch has discovered other shelters linked to the network -- many of them turned to cheap hostels -- on busy streets. Not surprisingly, the time-warped part of the Underground City remains his favorite. ""I sometimes wish I was born earlier to witness the Cold War unfold -- and the tunnels have given me a unique vantage point to look into that period of history,"" Frisch said. ""While Beijing is transforming itself for the Olympics, it's just amazing to see this space in such a sharp contrast to the city aboveground."" E-mail to a friend .

"COPENHAGEN, Denamrk (CNN) -- Actress Connie Nielsen hit the big time when she starred in ""Gladiator"" as Lucilla, sister of the deranged Emperor Commodus. Since then she has appeared in hit movies including ""One Hour Photo"" and ""The Hunted"". Connie Nielsen has always refused to play the Hollywood fame game. But Nielsen has refused to play the Hollywood fame game and seems drawn to challenging roles in controversial movies, including ""The Situation"", about the current Iraq war, and ""Battle in Seattle"", about the anti-globalization riots that took place in Seattle in 1999. Nielsen now lives in the US and returns to Copenhagen every year. She talks to My City, My Life about what makes the city, and its people, so special. CNN: How do you define yourself? Connie Nielsen: I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business. I refuse even the money side of my business. I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth. That's what I want from my art, that's what I aspire to. I try to combine my work with my family, that's what I aspire to. I don't say that's the only thing. It's not all work and family, because otherwise you would be saying no to the many other things in life and there are many other things. CNN: The people here are supposed to be incredibly happy -- what do you think? Connie Nielsen: I think it's funny in a way because when I grew up here it was very unusual to hear the word ""happiness"". If you asked somebody, ""what do you wish for in life?"" they wouldn't say ""happiness."" I would have answered ""excitement, knowledge,"" God knows -- I mean, many, many different things, but certainly not ""happiness"". It seemed like a foreign concept to wish for something that specific and that singular. And I think that a lot of Danes kind of feel like that about being the happiest people in the world. CNN: Is there anything you'd like to change about the city? Connie Nielsen: Anywhere there are social buildings that stuff people into boxes, concentrate poor people there. It's specific to any big city. There was an effort to create buildings that concentrate these people very closely, and their social problems. They are still around in New York, Paris, London and here too. So if I could change anything about Copenhagen, or any other major big city, I would change the way we build buildings or housing for lower income people. I don't think people who are already burdened with social, economic, psychological situations, dysfunctional families, need to be burdened with other people with the same problems. CNN: Is the city politically driven? Connie Nielsen: I don't think I can remember a moment in my life where people didn't discuss politics. People discuss politics at the table. I think some of the first information I received was politically charged (laughs). It was at a time when girls were being told, ""Why don't you go and learn how to repair machines rather than learn to repair your jumper? Why don't you learn to cut wood rather than learn to keep a house clean?"" in school. It was to make us conscious of what we were, how we defined ourselves and why you would accept one concept of yourself rather than another. Have you searched through the truth of that concept? Have you deconstructed? Have you made sure that its foundations are valid? That's how I grew up and I think it was wonderful. CNN: How would you describe the city architecturally? Connie Nielsen: It's everything here from very late renaissance to this 19th century golden age we had here. It's that, intermixed with pure Danish modernism. I love the juxtaposition of it all. I love when we bring in metaphors for our past as well. CNN: A lot of the places you have taken us to have been very romantic, do you think there is a fairy tale quality to Copenhagen? Connie Nielsen: An alternative society ... yes I do, I do feel that. I do feel that most things are possible here. I can dream here. I can imagine. CNN: What is it about the city that makes people creative? Connie Nielsen: Well, we have a very, very long winter and it gets a little boring, so you better think of something to do! It can get deathly boring, so you start using your imagination. Sometimes it's necessity that produces it, because you need to do something. CNN: Is there something about the people here that want to change things for the better? Connie Nielsen: I think so -- I think we're an idealistic people. I think there are disillusioned people everywhere, there are doubters everywhere, but I do think there are constructive people here; I do think that people believe in people. CNN: Do you take any inspiration from the city? Connie Nielsen: Yes, yes I do. Whenever I come back here I remember that I want to write poetry (laughs). I want to take more time to sit and paint some more. I want to do so many more things whenever I come back -- I'm always reminded of that when I come here. CNN: You've lived in lots of cities all over the world and still do. Why is Copenhagen special to you? Connie Nielsen: I was born here and it's the capital of my home country. It's also immensely beautiful. Many of my friends live here and much of my partner's family lives here too and so we bring our kids back here every year. It holds all the museums that hold our history, our culture, and I take our children there and I go there for my own pleasure all the time. I love going to museums. I love this city and I love cities that are on the water. I love the water element, specifically the sea. I grew up on the sea and I grew up sailing -- I love sailing -- and the presence of the sea gives the air and the light a very special quality that I absolutely adore. CNN: It seems that for a small place it has a lot of cultural influence. Connie Nielsen: Yes, it's sort of a little pearl in the middle of the seas. There's a lot of traffic through this place, from the east, west, north and south. And we are the southern part of the north, so everything from the south comes up here on its way towards the north, and the opposite. And it has left its mark. We are definitely some kind of place where culture is being deposited over and over and over again, but it also springs from here. It's the kind of place that attracts creative people and so it springs from here too. CNN: If Copenhagen was a person, how would you describe it? Connie Nielsen: If Copenhagen were a person, that person would be generous, beautiful, elderly, but with a flair. A human being that has certain propensities for quarrelling, filled with imagination and with appetite for the new and with respect for the old -- somebody who takes good care of things and of people.","Connie Nielsen says she refuses the fame and money side of acting .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A construction company and three supervisors were indicted Monday on manslaughter and related charges in the deaths of two firefighters battling a 2007 blaze at the Deutsche Bank building in lower Manhattan. Firefighters Joseph Graffagnino, left, and Robert Beddia died in the Deutsche Bank building blaze. Prosecutors also reached an agreement with the city of New York requiring the implementation of new fire safety measures. ""Our goal is to put in place procedures which will prevent a disaster of the magnitude of the Deutsche Bank fire and to make sure that firefighters are never again exposed to the risks they faced in that fire,"" Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said. The indictments against the John Galt Corp., Jeffrey Melofchik, Mitchel Alvo and Salvatore DePaola also allege negligent homicide and reckless endangerment. The indictment is the result of an investigation into an August 18, 2007, blaze that consumed nine floors of the Deutsche Bank building. The building had been scheduled for demolition after being contaminated by debris, asbestos and other hazardous substances after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center buildings. The two firefighters killed in the blaze -- Robert Beddia, 53, and Joseph Graffagnino, 33 -- were caught in a smoke-filled stairwell that prosecutors say was improperly blocked off by barriers erected to seal off floors being stripped of contaminants. In addition to the deaths of Beddia and Graffagnino, 105 other firefighters were injured combating the blaze. The agreement with the city of New York mandates the creation of a new civilian inspection unit at the city's fire department, the sole purpose of which will be to perform inspections at construction sites throughout the city. ""The regulatory measures we have put in place and the additional reforms set out today are designed to prevent any firefighter again confronting the conditions that firefighters faced at the Deutsche Bank building that tragic day,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a written statement. The father of one of the firefighters killed in the blaze, Joseph Graffagnino Sr., said the indictments did not go far enough. ""I don't understand if the [city] agency can't be indicted, why can't individuals be indicted who we already know should have been responsible for doing their jobs and did not do their jobs,"" he said to reporters. Graffagnino was referencing the lack of criminal charges brought against employees of the city fire department, the city's department of buildings and the building's landlord, the Lower Manhattan Development Corp.","John Galt Corp., three supervisors indicted; city to change procedures .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Doing it nature's way has the potential to change the way we grow food, make materials, harness energy, heal ourselves, store information, and conduct business."" Janine Benyus . When self-confessed ""nature nerd"" Janine Benyus coined the term ""biomimicry"" in a book she published a decade ago, little did she know it would make her into an household name, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood stars. Janine is a  champion of the biomimicry movement and helps companies to improve designs by turning to Nature. The natural sciences writer now gives talks on the subject to riveted crowds and is a consultant to some of world's biggest  companies. In her capacity as  ""biologist at the design table,"" Janine helps companies like Nike and Hewlett Packard to innovate and improve their designs by using what already exists in nature. She also appeared as a consultant in the apocalyptic environmental documentary ""11th Hour,"" produced by Leonardo DiCaprio last year. Janine coined the term ""biomimicry"" from the Greek ""bios,"" meaning ""life,"" and ""mimesis,"" meaning ""imitate."" ""It was a surprise to me when the phone started ringing after my book came out in 1997,"" she told CNN. ""It was companies and individual inventors, companies that were inventing everyday and they had problems to solve. They said, 'gee the book is fabulous, it's about all this science that's happening in early stage research. But we're doing innovation in real time. Can you come and be a biologist at the design table?"" So far, using nature's design genius has led to the creation of bat-inspired ultrasonic canes for the blind, synthetic sheets that collect water from mist and fog as desert beetles do, and paint that self-cleans like a lotus leaf. Scientists are also working on making solar cells like leaves and supertough ceramics that resemble the inner shells of abalone, which is twice as durable as the ceramics used in jet engines. Before Janine wrote her book, there wasn't even a word to describe the work of a few scattered scientists looking for inspiration through nature in different corners of the world. History is, of course, littered with examples of humans copying nature's design. One of the most notable was invented by the Swiss engineer George de Mestral. Whilst out walking his dog one day de Mestral became annoyed by the burrs catching and sticking to his clothes and in his dog's fur. He decided to study them under a microscope. The magnification revealed a network of tiny hooks. The product of his labors was Velcro, which was patented in 1951. At the core of Janine's beliefs is that nature has already spent 3.8 billion years on research and development. Its failures are now fossils. She believes its successes contain strategies the human race can copy in its quest for a sustainable future. Janine has cultivated a deep knowledge of the natural world, beginning with direct observation in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, continuing in habitats from Maine to West Virginia where she worked as a backcountry guide, and now, in her home wilds of Montana. She graduated summa cum laude from Rutgers University, New Jersey, with two degrees in Natural Resource Management and English Literature/Writing. Named by Time magazine as an environmental hero of 2007, she's now writing the sequel book, ""Nature's 100 Best Technologies,"" and also consults through her firm The Biomimicry Guild, which came about following the massive demand for her knowledge. ""From interiors, manufacturing everything from apparel to transportation to bath and kitchen and carpets and furniture and sneakers, and even cities,"" she told CNN. ""I'd be talking to groups of mayors and talking to the European parliament, policy makers and they all wanted to know how can we learn from nature how to design a more sustainable world."" ""They want to know if there are blue prints, and of course there are. And they said 'great, bring over your biologists."" One of the companies that Janine has worked with is Interface, Inc, the world's largest commercial carpet manufacturer . The process is particularly hard on the environment as it uses petrochemicals in every step and consumes vast amounts of energy, and produces tons of waste. But after working with Janine and the Guild, Interface  introduced Entropy, a carpet inspired by random pattern formation in nature. It was a greener product that gave customers more flexibility as they could replace individual tiles instead of the whole carpet. Entropy quickly rose to become Interface's top-selling line of carpet and still represents 40 percent of their carpet tile sales. With results like that, it seems, you can't argue with Mother Nature.","Janine Benyus coined the term ""biomimicry"" in her influential 1997 book .

"(CNN) -- Deepa, 40, was born in Mumbai, where she is now a banking technology consultant, as well as running a company that offers ""offbeat sightseeing tours"" of six Indian cities, including Mumbai, Delhi and Jaipur. Deepa Krishnan: ""When you live in Mumbai you feel like you're in the nerve center of the country."" Deepa's Mumbai tours take in the city's bazaars, backstreets and culture and her blog, Mumbai Magic, is a personal view of life in the city. CNN: How does Mumbai compare to those other cities your company offers tour of? Deepa: Mumbai is a very young city by Indian standards, only 500 years old, whereas a city like Delhi is really ancient. Mumbai used to be a fishing hamlet and it grew after the British arrived. So it's a young city and one that has been formed by migrants. Almost everyone in Mumbai has arrived here in the course of the last few generations, and so the city has a vibrancy and cosmopolitanism that is different from other cities. CNN: What makes Mumbai special to you? Deepa: The fact that I am so grounded here -- I was born here and four generations of my family live here. But also, Mumbai is on the move, it's vibrant, it's accepting of change and it's got a very active citizenry. It's the one place where you can make a mark, where you can make a difference. When you live in Mumbai you feel like you're in the nerve center of the country. You feel like all the big events are near you and you're connected to everything. In other cities I tend to feel more remote. If there's a new play it premieres in Mumbai, if there's a new band they play in Mumbai -- everything happens here. We're close to the center of commerce and I would rather be close to the center of commerce than the center of politics! What makes Mumbai special to you? Let us know . CNN: What are your favorite parts of the city? Deepa: I think my favorite is a place called Bhuleshwar. It's the ""native"" bazaar area that sprang up outside the old British fort. It's got a certain colorful energy and retains its 18th Century-feel to some extent. Everything under the sun can be bought there; it's got a spice market, a jewelry market. It's a busy, bustling area where a lot of trade happens, so I love it. CNN: Where do people go if they want to escape Mumbai's bustle? Deepa: We head out of the city -- we run for the hills! We go to the Western Ghats, which is a mountain range that runs parallel to the coast, barely a two-hour drive from where I live. ""There's climbing and a whole bunch of very interesting mountain forts to explore; there's whitewater rafting, paragliding, cycling. Ecologically, it's a very bio-diverse area so it attracts photography enthusiasts and bird watchers. We're very lucky that we're so close to it. We also have a lot of beaches just outside the city and they are popular as well. Within the city there are little enclaves of peace -- even in Bhuleshwar market there are temple complexes where there's a surprising silence compared to the bustle of the streets. We also have our seaside promenades where we love to hang out. The young, who have no other place to go, find romance on Marine Drive and Bandra Bandstand. It's Mumbai's version of Lovers Lane -- except the lane is wide open! CNN: What's a typical weekend in Mumbai? Deepa: We party quite hard, so Saturday and Sunday evenings are days when you go out with friends and family. There are a huge number of restaurants with all sorts of cuisines on offer. There are some great clubs -- my favorite right now is a place called The Blue Frog -- and there's an active cultural scene. Alongside all the partying we're all in a mad race to lose weight and look good. Bollywood is helping men wake up to the fact that there's nothing wrong with a well-toned physique. In all the suburbs of Mumbai there's a mushrooming of places where young guys are pumping iron and trying to be 'he-men.' CNN: Do you think the city's changed since the terrorist attacks last November? Deepa: Yes, I think there's a hardening of stances and an unwillingness to accept platitudes. I also think there is increased uneasiness between communities. CNN: Has tourism been affected by the attacks? Deepa: My own business went bust for two weeks. For two weeks I had nothing but cancellations in Mumbai and I was only saved by the fact that I was doing business in other cities. But then business picked up again. My first clients after the attacks were a Jewish American couple and I was heartened by the faith and support they showed for Mumbai. Mumbai also gets big tour groups that arrive by bus and I think that kind of group tour has lessened, but my business gets more independent travelers and they are still coming. People choose to respond to crises more positively than we think they will and I'm seeing very strong individual responses. CNN: If Mumbai was a person what would he or she be like? Deepa: This is a city which is strangely beautiful and strangely warty. At its heart this city is about money, it's a city of exchange and commerce, so it would be a trader or a wheeler dealer -- someone who's on the move, making deals and making money!","Deepa lives in Mumbai, where her company runs ""offbeat sightseeing tours""

A grand jury indicted Ralph Nicoletti, 18, Michael Contreras, 18, and Brian Carranza, 21, on charges of conspiracy to interfere with voting rights. All three pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday afternoon. According to the indictment, the three ""knowingly and intentionally"" conspired to intimidate African-Americans ""in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right ... and because of having so exercised that right, to wit, the right to vote."" Nicoletti and Carranza are white, and Contreras is Latino. They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. At the arraignment, Nicoletti and Contreras were ordered held without bail, while Carranza was released on a $200,000 bond but ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device. Contreras' attorney, public defender Len Kamdang, could not be reached for comment. Nicoletti's attorney, Bob LaRusso, had no comment. Prosecutors said in court filings that on the night of November 4, the defendants were at a ""makeshift outdoor clubhouse"" in the Rosebank section of Staten Island when they learned of Obama's victory. At that point, prosecutors said, Nicoletti drove Contreras, Carranza and another friend to the predominantly African-American Park Hill neighborhood in Staten Island. Their purpose, prosecutors said, was to assault African-Americans because of Obama's win. Their first victim, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office, was 17-year-old Ali Kamara, whom they beat with a metal pipe and a collapsible police baton. Kamara escaped after suffering a concussion and injuries to his legs. ""The first swing that swung -- it hit my head. It cut my head,"" Kamara told CNN affiliate WABC. ""I got staples on my head now."" Kamara said he hid in a neighbor's backyard until the boys moved on. Continuing to the Port Richmond section of Staten Island, the group assaulted a second African-American man, pushing him down, the federal prosecutors alleged. They then allegedly accosted a Latino man, demanding to know how he voted, and shouted profanities about Obama at a group of African-Americans at a hair salon. Next, prosecutors said, the group targeted Ronald Forte, a man they mistakenly believed to be African-American who was walking along Blackford Avenue in predominantly African-American Port Richmond. Forte is white, but because he was wearing a hoodie, the men were unable to identify his race and assumed that he was African-American. According to the indictment, the men decided to assault Forte with the police baton as they drove by, but at the last moment, Nicoletti swerved the vehicle directly into the 38-year-old man instead. Forte was thrown onto the hood of the car, shattering the front windshield. According to Staten Island Real Time News (silive.com), Forte was in a coma for 45 days, returning to his family's home in New Jersey in mid-December, said his mother, Eileen. She added that her son now has serious brain damage and motor control problems. ""He's not good. He's never going to be good,"" she said. ""Every day, I just see something different, and it's so scary."" U.S. Attorney Benton J. Campbell decried the attacks. ""Violence and intimidation aimed at interfering with the constitutional rights of every citizen, including the right to vote, will not be tolerated,"" he said in a written statement. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Nicoletti has an extensive history of violent criminal activity including burglary, car break-ins, firebombing, assault, and marijuana and cocaine distribution. He is also a member of the ""Rosebank Crew"" (RBK) founded by his now-incarcerated younger brother, Anthony Nicoletti. Investigators found a cache of weapons and police batons stolen from vehicles owned by police, as well as letters from Nicoletti's brother urging Ralph to maintain RBK loyalty and not cooperate with authorities. Nicoletti and three others approached Contreras three weeks ago at his house, believing he was cooperating with authorities, according to a filing with the U.S. Attorney's Office. They allegedly attacked him and called him a snitch, according to a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorneys Pamela Chen and Margo Brodie to the judge in the case. The letter petitions for home confinement, drug testing and other pretrial release conditions for Nicoletti and Carranza. The judge has not responded to the request.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In 1981, Dr Mohga Kamal-Yanni was preparing to leave Egypt for a clinical attachment in England when her father had a heart attack. He fell in the street, and was taken to a public hospital, where Dr Kamal-Yanni kept vigil at his bedside until he regained his strength. A doctor at a hospital in India where health indicators have showed no significant improvement  in seven years. During his stay in the hospital, she was appalled at the low level of healthcare available to him. ""It was awful. There was no medicine,"" she told CNN. As a doctor, Kamal-Yanni was able to watch over her father's progress. Her professional opinion on his recovery was striking. ""My father survived that heart attack for two reasons,"" she said. ""One, because of God's will, and two, because he had a strong will. It was nothing to do with the health service."" The following year, Kamal-Yanni came to England to do a clinical attachment. She found herself deeply affected by the stark contrast between the healthcare available in Britain, on the publicly funded National Health Service, and the healthcare available at home in Egypt. She found herself slipping into depression. ""I couldn't talk to the patients; I couldn't talk to the doctors. I just couldn't cope with it,"" she revealed to CNN. ""I couldn't understand why every time I saw a monitor next to a patient I was so upset."" It dawned on her that the gulf in care was troubling her. ""I kept thinking why on earth my dad didn't have that. The only reason was that he happened to be born in Egypt and these people had the luck to be born [in England]."" Kamal-Yanni is now a senior health & HIV policy advisor at third-world charity Oxfam. Her first-hand experience of the divide between the healthcare available in richer countries, and that on offer in poorer ones, has given her the impetus to try and narrow the gap. While Western countries are pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, discovering the potential of nanotechnology and other high-tech solutions to the developed world's diseases, like diabetes, cancer and obesity, poor countries are struggling to combat health problems such as HIV, malaria and TB. Lack of infrastructure . And it's not as simple as shipping medicines and supplies in bulk quantities. Oxfam's ""Paying for People"" report, published in February this year, said that poor countries are suffering because they lack the infrastructure of a health service. The WHO's 2006 ""World Health Report"" also indicates that 4.25 million doctors, nurses and health workers are needed across 57 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has 600,000 health workers: one million more are required. Without these key workers, it is questionable whether healthcare in poor countries can be improved. Nicky Wimble, a spokesperson for Oxfam, told CNN, ""There is money coming in for drugs now, but there's no commitment to long-term aid."" Governments are unable to give healthcare workers with job security and doctors and nurses, where they do exist, are largely poorly paid: so people choose other careers. ""They're either becoming taxi drivers, or working for private businesses,"" Wimble says. This double brain-drain (one internal, one external as those who do train are tempted away by higher salaries and brighter futures in developed countries) means that even if drugs make it to poorer areas, there can be no one to administer them. ""Drugs are sitting in cupboards,"" Wimble told CNN. ""Or they're available in cities but people in rural areas don't have the bus fares to get to them."" Vulnerable to disease . Dr Kamal-Yanni backs this up. She told CNN, ""There is no public investment in health systems so people have to pay for it. If you're poor you can't buy your healthcare and if you're a woman who happens to be poor you might as well forget it."" And in countries where no healthcare system exists, people are extremely vulnerable to diseases, which can spread rampantly and unchecked through communities. Dr Kamal-Yanni paints a worrying picture. ""Particularly in Africa, they're not equipped to face anything -- not HIV, let alone avian flu. If something like avian flu hit Africa with no health system, no health workers and no money, it would spread. We can't contain it in Africa. The world would wake up and realize that, but in the meantime, it would have wiped out goodness knows how many millions of people."" It's not just in Africa. HIV is a known crisis there, but it is anticipated that more people will be infected in India than anywhere else, as the disease spreads quickly through its billion-strong population. Increasingly, countries like these are having to deal with a boom in incommunicable diseases, like diabetes and cancer. Chronic diseases like diabetes have the additional problem that they require long-term care, and therefore long-term funding. Dr Kamal-Yanni explained the difficulties of that situation. ""You buy the pills today, but maybe tomorrow you don't have enough money so you're never cured and develop complications."" What lies ahead? Dr Kamal-Yanni sees three possible outcomes for health in poor countries. The first, as she explained, is bleak. She told CNN, ""If things continue as they are, with rising infection, increasing resistance to drugs, HIV and malaria run unchecked, chronic and non-communicable diseases are ignored and no money is spent on a health system, then the gap will just increase and the situation will get worse and worse."" Dr Kamal-Yanni is hopeful, however, that the situation will improve somewhat. She explained a second scenario, the one she feels is most likely to happen. ""If the international community invests a little bit, things will be slightly better,"" she told CNN. ""More people with HIV will get treatment, as will people with TB and malaria. But non-communicable chronic diseases [like diabetes] will be ignored."" But large-scale epidemics like avian flu or SARS would still remain a huge threat in this scenario, as would diseases like cancer. ""Who's going to pay for medicine for cancer, which is increasing like anything in developing countries?"" asks Dr Kamal-Yanni. ""Nobody."" Hope for the future . But there is a third scenario, which holds out more hope for people in developing countries. Dr Kamal-Yanni says, ""If public pressure is high, southern governments, donors and the international community will decide that health is really a priority. We'll put our money where our mouth is and we'll fulfil the commitments that we've made before."" She says that in the first instance, African countries need to be encouraged to divert 16 percent of their budget to health. (Currently, nearly a third allocate less than five percent.) ""Then they will realize that this is not enough, so they'll put in more,"" she continues. If this money were to be added to the $50 billion promised by G8, the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations, in Gleneagles in 2005, it would have a huge impact on health and education, particularly in Africa. And education is the key, Dr Kamal-Yanni believes. She explained, ""You can't separate health and education because unless you educate doctors and nurses, and midwives and pharmacists, you can't run a health service."" Working together . It's also important for donors and governments to work together to provide a cohesive service, she says. ""They really need to start coordinating their work so it's not a series of vertical programs that don't relate to each other and waste resources."" Oxfam's Nicky Wimble agrees. She told CNN, ""Over the last 100 years, countries like France, Britain and America have developed by giving their people free education and healthcare. It's a major way to bring people out of poverty."" Wimble cites the example of education, where the number of children not in school worldwide has fallen from around 120 million to around 80 million. ""The key is getting governments to commit to it as a part of their aid package, and monitoring the aid package so that the money is tracked to ensure that it gets to where it's intended,"" she said. ""It's working for education, and they think it'll work for healthcare too, but it needs committed investment."" And in the meantime, people like Mohga Kamal-Yanni will continue their work to pressure governments to encourage positive change. She says, ""That's my motivation to do this work. It's not for me; it's a life thing. My dream in life is for everybody in Africa to have access to a publicly financed, publicly run healthcare service with strong regulation, quality, care and equity.""

"(CNN) -- Botswana has been hailed as one of Africa's success stories and a beacon for democracy on the continent. It's home to Africa's longest continuous multi-party democracy and has remained politically stable since gaining independence in 1966. President Ian Khama took office in April 2008 promising steady progress. At its helm is President Ian Khama, the country's former vice president and son of Botswana's founding president. The diamond trade and disciplined government have helped to transform Botswana from one of the world's poorest nations to a middle-income country. But there are still large problem facing the country, including the world's second high level of HIV infections, according to the World Bank, and a slowing of the countries economic growth. The 56-year-old Khama took over office in April 2008, succeeding Festus Mogae who had been in power for 10 years, promising no radical departure from his predecessor's policies. Khama was born in southern England and trained at the UK's Sandhurst Military Academy before returning to Botswana and later becoming the commander of the Botswana Defence Force. He left the military in 1998 to take up the position of vice president. As the son of Botswana's most popular former president, political analysts inside the country have expected Khama to unite the factions in the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and continue steady economic and political progress. While Khama has only been in power for 11 months, there has been some criticism that his style is too authoritarian. Citing Afrobarometer, an independent research group, Botswana's newspaper Sunday Standard recently wrote that there was a growing public perception that Khama has issued more directives compared to his predecessors. One area in which he has taken a definite line is on his policy towards neighboring Zimbabwe, publicly opposing the government of President Robert Mugabe and declaring it illegitimate. A general election is set for October 2009, with the BDP expected to win. No other political party has held power in Botswana and some commentators fear the emergence of a political dynasty that would affect Botswana's democracy.","Botswana's President Ian Khama talks to CNN on 'African Voices'

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Police raided an Islamic school and arrested seven students hours after a blast in a mosque in northern Pakistan left at least 50 dead and dozens injured, according to an Associated Press report. A man, right, mourns the death of his two sons in a suicide attack near Peshawar that killed at least 50. A bomb, packed with ball-bearings and nails, tore through Eid prayers at a mosque packed with hundreds of worshippers northeast of Peshawar on Friday, targeting Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, former Pakistani interior minister, local police told CNN. The blast left blood-stained clothes, hats and shoes as well as body parts and pieces of flesh scattered across the mosque, according to reports. The attack is the most recent in a series of attacks in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and occurred near Sherpao's residence in Charsadda -- an area approximately 28 miles (45 kilometers) northeast of the city of Peshawar.  Watch what's known about the blast » . Police investigators say Taliban or al Qaeda elements could have been involved and they believe the former minister was targeted over his supervision of operations against militants in Pakistan's tribal areas including the restive NWFP. This attack is the deadliest in Pakistan since 136 people were killed in the southern port city of Karachi on October 18 in a suicide bombing targeting the convoy of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister.  See photos from the blast's aftermath » . Bhutto returned to the country after eight years in self-imposed exile ahead of January parliamentary elections. The attack comes in the midst of continued operations by the Pakistani army to rout out militants in the swat valley in the north of the country, an area the government considers a front-line in the so-called global war on terror. A former tourist destination about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from Islamabad, The Swat Valley has been plagued by violence and has become a hotbed for militants. Earlier this month, the army said it has retaken towns seized by militants over the summer, killing 290 and capturing 140. The attack also comes less than a week after President Pervez Musharraf lifted a six-week-old state of emergency he said was necessary to ensure the country's stability but that critics said was a move to stifle the country's judiciary, curb the media and secure more power. While Musharraf has promised free and fair parliamentary elections, continued instability in the tribal areas and the threat of attack on large crowds has kept people from attending political rallies and dampened the country's political process. Campaigners from various political parties say fewer people are coming out to show their support. The president -- who survived two assassination attempts in December 2003 -- denounced Friday's attack, speaking out against what he said was a small number of Muslim extremists who would carry out such an act, according to a report from the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan. He ordered security and intelligence agencies to find those responsible. A spokesperson for the U.N. said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemns the attack and he ""urges all political forces in Pakistan to unite against the scourge of terrorism and to act together to create a peaceful environment ahead of the Parliamentary elections."" This is the second attempt on Sherpao's life since April, when a suicide bomber blew himself up just a few feet from Sherpao during a political rally, injuring him and killing at least 28 people. The APP reported that the blast was caused by a suicide bomber inside the mosque, as people were gathering for religious observances of Eid al-Adha, the Muslim celebration of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. ""We were saying prayers when this huge explosion occurred,"" said Shaukat Ali, a 26-year-old survivor of the blast whose white cloak and pants were torn and spattered with blood, an AP report said. Despite security measures at the mosque, the bomber was praying in a row of worshippers when he detonated the explosive, provincial police chief Sharif Virk said, the report added. A Peshawar hospital was wracked with chaos as the injured arrived in pickup trucks, ambulance sirens wailed and the wounded screamed for help, the report said. The bomb contained between 13-17 pounds of explosives and was filled with nails and ball bearings to maximize casualties, said the head of the bomb unit at the scene, who declined to give his name. Sherpao and his two sons were in the first row of the mosque, the APP report said. Mustafa Khan Sherpao had leg injuries while Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao ""escaped unhurt."" Sherpao was Pakistan's interior minister -- the country's top civilian security official -- before Musharraf announced a caretaker government in November ahead of elections. He heads the breakaway political group Pakistan People's Party-Sherpao, is a vocal critic of religious extremism, pro-Musharraf and a candidate in upcoming elections. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A former prison secretary has been sentenced to six months in federal prison for having sex with an inmate she was supposed to be supervising, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in the District of Colorado said Friday. Janine Sligar, 47, of Wray, Colorado, was sentenced Thursday for sexual abuse of a ward. After serving her sentence, she will serve five years of supervised release and must register as a sex offender, spokesman Jeff Dorschner said in a news release. Sligar, who must surrender to a facility designated by the Bureau of Prisons on March 2, did not respond to a telephone call to her home for comment. She was indicted in July by a federal grand jury in Denver and pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in October. According to the plea agreement, Sligar, a 14-year Bureau of Prisons veteran, said she and inmate Eric McClain met in February 2007, when he was assigned to clean her office. ""They began to have conversations and realized they had similar interests,"" the plea agreement said. That summer, they initiated a sexual relationship that included 10 to 20 sessions of oral sex and sexual intercourse, ending in October 2007, it said. The liaisons primarily occurred in a staff restroom in the housing unit at the Federal Prison Camp in Florence, Colorado, according to the agreement. Sligar, who acknowledged having detailed her activities in a journal, said she obtained a cell phone with a non-local phone number so McClain could call her without raising suspicion and admitted she gave him contraband that included photographs with explicit sexual poses, the plea agreement added. ""Defendant also admitted using her cell phone camera to take graphic pictures of a sexual nature which depict defendant and this inmate,"" it said. Authorities began investigating the incident after receiving a tip about the inappropriate relationship. They then learned that Sligar had changed the primary beneficiary on an insurance policy from her children to McClain. A subsequent search of her home turned up the journal and photographs.","Former prison secretary Janine Sligar had sex with inmate .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- At 80, Maya Angelou says her ""knees are not all that swift and my lungs need some extra help but other than that, my desire to learn and to share, that has not abated."" Maya Angelou urges politicians to ""aim for the high ground"" in her new book, ""Letter to My Daughter."" She shares what she's learned in an eventful life in her best-selling new book, ""Letter to My Daughter."" Angelou achieved fame for her autobiographical writing, including ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" and her poetry. She read her poem ""On the Pulse of Morning"" at President Clinton's first inauguration. She was only the second poet invited to read at the swearing in of a new president. But her career has had many facets -- Angelou has been a singer, dancer, playwright, director and teacher. In 166 pages, ""Letter to My Daughter"" distills stories from Angelou's life into universal lessons. She writes about birth, life and death, about the ways people misunderstand each other and then transcend their conflict. She calls on national leaders to raise the country's spirit and on Americans to remember that this is the nation that defeated the Nazis and expanded people's freedom through the civil rights movement. ""Politicians must set their aims for the high ground and according to our various leanings, Democratic, Republican, Independent, we will follow,"" she writes. ""Politicians must be told if they continue to sink into the mud of obscenity, they will proceed alone."" In an interview last week in her 1881 brownstone in Harlem, decorated in vibrant, bright colors, Angelou sat at the round table in her dining room, sipping coffee, as she talked about the election and her work. She supported Sen. Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic nomination and then backed Sen. Barack Obama once the primaries were over. CNN: In the chapter called ""National Spirit,"" you call on political leaders to raise the level of discussion. Could you elaborate on that? Maya Angelou: What I've encouraged voters to do is to vote for the person I am extolling, and also don't expect that if your man or woman gets in, that all things will be rectified immediately. It's taken us a long time to come to this place of weariness and almost hopelessness. So because Obama gets in or McCain gets in, it's not going to be repaired overnight. The economy is not going to be repaired, the schools -- the disaster in our schools -- will not be repaired overnight. Nor will the social conversation be repaired overnight. However, I would encourage every voter to say to his or her candidate, go in and do it, and you will not do it alone. I will help. You have to get up off that sofa or off that couch and give something to the country -- even if it's one hour every other week to an old people's home -- I will read, go into the children's ward and read, or give to your church or your synagogue or your mosque. ... Offer something to the country. So you don't just sit there. CNN: What does it say about the country that Barack Obama is a candidate to be president? Angelou: The country is growing up and confessing to something we've known all along. What prevented us from admitting that we knew that? And I was taken back to slavery. If you will have a person enslaved, the first thing you must do is convince yourself that the person is subhuman. The second thing you have to do is convince your allies so you'll have some help, and the third and probably unkindest cut of all is to convince that person that he or she is subhuman and deserves it. Well, such a job has been done on all of us that people found it very difficult to admit that human beings are more alike than we are unalike. We've known it. But to admit it, you have to stop saying because this guy speaks another language, because their eyes are shaped differently from mine, because they're first-generation Americans from Eastern Europe, then they don't count, I don't have to consider them. With this, the country is finally able to see through complexion and see community. CNN: You've known and worked with people like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Could you imagine what their reaction would be to this? Angelou: I think everybody would be weeping tears of joy really. I think of my grandmother who raised me. She was a daughter of a former slave. She knew this was going to happen. You know that when I was young, I was physically abused and so I stopped talking. I thought that my voice had killed the criminal. ... The man had been found dead. Police said he had been beaten to death. So I knew, because I told [people] that he did it, that my voice could just go out and kill people. So after a few months, my mother's people sent me and my brother back to this little village in Arkansas to my grandmother, my father's mother who was raising me, and she used to braid my hair. My hair was huge and very curly, black. And my grandmother put her hand behind my neck and held it so she wouldn't break my neck by accident. And she would start to brush my hair and she would say, ""Sister, Mama don't care what these people say about you, that you must be an idiot, you must be a moron because you can't talk. Mama know when you and the good Lord get ready, you're going to teach all over this world. You're going to be a mighty teacher."" I didn't speak for six years. She said that to me all the time, in this little village in Arkansas. [Now] I teach all over the world, I teach in French and Spanish, so when I stand up on a stage or see a book of mine gets accolades or a piece of music I've written, I think about my Mama, and she died before I really came of age, and I just think she knew it. CNN: She was prophetic about you, but beyond that? Angelou: Yes, [she believed] it will get better. And you have to continue to prepare yourself, continue to build yourself, continue to elevate yourself and be a benefit, be a blessing rather than a curse, and things will get better. And they have, so when I think of Dr. King and Malcolm, Fannie Lou Hamer, Medgar Evers, I also think of Chief Albert Luthuli, one of the first Africans to earn the Nobel Prize. I mean that after Chief Luthuli, apartheid was so rigid, unbreakable that men had to carry their IDs on plastic cards that were too large for any suit, so they flapped, reminding them constantly who they were. It was my blessing to meet Nelson Mandela before he went into prison and I've seen him many times since. He knew this day would come, and to be able to stay in prison for 27 years, knowing that the day would come. CNN: What gave you the inspiration to call the book, ""Letter to My Daughter,"" even though you don't have a daughter? [Angelou has a son, the writer Guy Johnson.] . Angelou: There was an African-American poet, her name was Anne Spencer; she wrote a poem called ""Letter to My Sister,"" around the turn of the 20th Century. ... I started making notes to Oprah [Winfrey] about 20 years ago. She really became a daughter to me. So there were things I wanted to talk to her about; I made notes, copious notes, and about a year and a half ago, I got out that box called WIP, works in progress, and I started going through two or three lines and I said, ""Hmmm, there's an essay in here."" So it is a letter to all my daughters, to those who don't know they are. It is my intent to say you may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. You will be changed, events will change you, but you have to decide not to be reduced. CNN: Have you been in touch with Oprah lately about the election? Angelou: I spoke to her about a week ago ... [During the primaries], a newspaper reporter said this proves that Oprah Winfrey doesn't listen to everything Maya Angelou says, because she was supporting Sen. Obama and I was supporting Sen. Clinton. And when I was asked by the reporter, ""What do you say to Oprah?"" my answer was, ""I say nothing, she's a woman who thinks carefully and profoundly and she has courage. So she's chosen the person she thinks would be the best person for our country. I do the same."" The primaries proved that Oprah had selected the one that most people wanted, so I went to Sen. Obama right after that. Hillary Clinton ... telephoned me and thanked me for my unwavering support, and then asked me to please put that same energy behind Mr. Obama. CNN: Another theme in the book is to believe in yourself, to have faith in yourself. Why is that important? Angelou: You need to know that you can go somewhere. You're not just like grass growing on the street. You're like trees, you have roots, and they've done wonderful things, and you need to know that, and by knowing that, you see how outfitted you are for these times. And that you really owe it to those who went before so that you can add to them for those who are yet to come. You need to know that you are in a continuum, and if you understand that, you realize that you are worthwhile. This continuum would be broken without me.","Maya Angelou: No matter who wins, don't expect an overnight turnaround .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Mike Mette has been a Chicago police officer for almost four years. But now, as a result of a fistfight one night in Dubuque, Iowa, he is a convicted felon. Mike Mette, a Chicago police officer, says he acted in self-defense when he punched Jake Gotthard, a student at the University of Dubuque. Mette has been sentenced to almost five years in prison after Dubuque County Judge Monica Ackley found him guilty of assault causing serious injury. Mette says he's been wronged. ""I was arrested for self-defense ... I was defending myself,"" he said. Mette's saga started in October 2005 after a night of drinking in Dubuque, where he was visiting his brother Mark. After the bars closed, Mette and his crew made their way to an after-hours party thrown by Jake Gotthard, a student at the University of Dubuque. According to court documents, Mette and his friends entered the house party, but decided to leave without paying the required $5 entry fee when they saw the room was mostly empty. Gotthard became angry, and with the help of his roommate, began chasing Mette down the street. Gotthard claims someone in Mette's group had stolen his cell phone and he wanted it back. Exactly what happened to the cell phone is still unclear. The altercation continued a block and a half down the street and eventually ended up in front of the house of Mette's brother.  Fight could land cop in prison » . ""That's when Mr. Gotthard hit me. He hit me with two fists like this, straight into the chest,"" Mette said. ""He was yelling about his cell phone, telling me if he didn't get his cell phone back he was going to beat the crap out of me. He hit me several more times and then I pushed him away from me. It wasn't until after the third time is when he came back at me again and that is when I struck him."" When police arrived, they found Gotthard lying on the ground with bruises and lacerations on his face, cheek, nose, chin and forehead. Mette, who had blood on his shirt and whose knuckle was bruised and cut, was arrested and charged with a felony. ""[Gotthard] had bruises on the side of his neck, his arms, his elbow, his shoulders, on his back, that were simply not consistent with Mr. Mette's version that he only struck him once,"" said Assistant County Attorney Tim Gallagher. Dubuque doctors testified the injuries were consistent with someone who had been stomped and kicked. But a doctor testifying for Mette's defense rejected the Dubuque findings. He said all those injuries could have come from Mette's single punch and the impact from falling on the sidewalk. Gallagher said the decision to prosecute Mette was a tough one. ""It's never an easy situation when someone is sentenced to prison, particularly when it's a police officer that we have to rely on,"" he said. ""But we can't allow individuals to be given certain privileges because of their occupation."" The case spawned a battle between newspaper columnists in Chicago and Dubuque. ""Mette played baseball in college. But what's happening to him isn't about Iowa baseball mythology. It doesn't smell of corn. It stinks of the pig barn,"" wrote Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass. He chalks the judge's decision up to small town politics. In a reply, a columnist for the Dubuque Telegraph Herald wrote that Kass is a ""legendary muckraker"" who is ""training his scorn"" on Ackley, the judge. Mette is currently on unpaid leave from the Chicago Police Department and is appealing his case. He will begin serving his five-year sentence in November.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- Prosecutors in Florida are taking a new look at the 2007 death of Anna Nicole Smith to see if recent evidence that California investigators gathered might cause them to open an inquiry. Prosecutors in Florida are reviewing evidence gathered in California for a probe into Anna Nicole Smith's death. Howard K. Stern -- Smith's longtime partner and attorney -- and two doctors were charged this month in California with conspiring to furnish drugs to Smith before her fatal overdose. ""Our prosecutors have met with representatives of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and the California Department of Justice and discussed the evidence they have turned up in their investigation,"" said Ron Ishoy, a spokesman for Broward County State Attorney Michael Satz. ""We are now examining that evidence to see where it might lead in relation to Ms. Smith's death here in Broward County in 2007."" The Broward County state attorney's office never opened a probe into Smith's death but assisted the Seminole police in its investigation in the days afterward. Smith, 39, was pronounced dead February 8, 2007, after being discovered unconscious in her hotel room at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino near Hollywood, Florida. A coroner said she died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Officials said both prescription and over-the-counter drugs were found in Smith's system, including three anti-depressant or anti-anxiety drugs. Human growth hormone and chloral hydrate, a sleep medication, also were found in toxicology tests, officials said. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were charged in California with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007 -- only weeks before Smith's death. Kapoor and Eroshevich also were charged with obtaining a prescription for opiates by ""fraud, deceit or misrepresentation."" And each was charged with one count of obtaining a prescription for opiates by giving a false name or address, prosecutors said. ""Anna was the center of a cruel tabloid feeding frenzy,"" Eroshevich's attorney, Adam Braun, told CNN in a statement after his client was charged. ""In the face of this, Dr. Eroshevich did her best to help the patient while protecting what little privacy Anna had left. Any actions were done with the patient's well-being in mind and were certainly not criminal.""  Watch allegations over photos and the doctor » . California Attorney General Jerry Brown said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed ""thousands of pills."" The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star was drugged ""almost to the point of stupefaction,"" Brown said. ""The quantity of the drugs, the variety of the drugs, the combination at any given point, and her continuing to use that -- that, to a professional, is clear evidence of addiction,"" Brown said Friday. ""These cocktails of methadone and anti-depressants and sleeping pills and Xanax, you put all that into a cocktail, it explodes and can cause death, injury and permanent morbidity and disability.""","Broward County, Florida, prosecutors taking new look at death of Anna Nicole Smith .

"(CNN) -- Saudi King Abdullah has pardoned a rape victim who had been sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison in a case that sparked international attention, a Saudi newspaper has reported. The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia's strict Islamic law. Al-Jazirah newspaper quoted a Saudi Justice Ministry official saying King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, begins in Saudi Arabia. The victim's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon, but considers it to be legitimate since it was announced in an official Saudi newspaper. He thanked King Abdullah for the pardon, saying: ""This fatherly care and noble gesture will help (in) lifting the emotional and psychological stress and suffering that our family has been enduring."" ""This is not something new because we know that the King was always generous in dealing with his people and the entire world,"" the husband said. ""This week, we have two holidays to celebrate; the Eid and this great news of the pardon."" Saudi sources told CNN that the king's pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid al-Adha festival that follows, which is normally when the Saudi monarch issues amnesty for prisoners. Watch how Arab media is reporting the story. » . Saudi Arabia's Justice Minister Abdullah Bin Mohammad al-Sheikh told al-Jazirah newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Saudi people, and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system. The White House welcomed King Abdullah's decision, but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe stressed that ""this is obviously a matter for the Saudi Arabians and King Abdullah."" A Saudi court ruled the 19-year-old had an ""illegitimate relationship"" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a ""compromising situation, her clothes on the ground."" The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married. The case has drawn international attention, provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under strict Islamic law in Saudi Arabia. The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March. Seven men, convicted of abducting the pair and raping her, were sentenced from two to nine years in prison. Abdul Rahman al-Lahim, the lawyer who represented the woman, faced a disciplinary hearing for ""insulting the Supreme Judicial Council and disobeying the rules and regulations"" of the judiciary.  The hearing has been postponed. The woman's husband has been outspoken in his support for his wife. He called a Lebanese TV show to defend her, when a former Saudi judge claimed on the program that she ""spoil(ed) their marital bed"" by meeting an unrelated male ""in secret"" and admitted her guilt. Al-Lahim has said he hopes the case changes the Saudi justice system. ""We want to highlight the rape crimes in Saudi Arabia and the way they are handled and sentenced in court,"" he added. ""This is a new era for all of us."" He said that the rape case had elicited a fierce response, including calls for his beheading. U.S. President George W. Bush said last week that King Abdullah ""knows our position loud and clear"" on the case. Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery.

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain has inched ahead of Sen. Barack Obama in national polls, but the Democratic candidate holds a steady lead in the most recent Electoral College estimates. John McCain and Sarah Palin are campaigning hard in battleground states. In national surveys, McCain leads by 2 points, 47 percent to 45 percent, according to CNN's poll of polls released Monday night. In the Electoral College standings, the most recent survey shows 243 electoral votes either safely in Obama's column or leaning his way. At this point, McCain can claim only 189. Many of the state polls used to determine the Electoral College standings, however, were conducted before the conventions. Monday marked the first time McCain passed Obama in CNN's poll of polls.  Watch how the race has tightened » . On Saturday, Obama was up by 3 in the poll of polls. That lead shrank to just 1 point Sunday before disappearing Monday. In the most recent survey, 8 percent of respondents said they were still unsure about who they were going to vote for. The poll of polls is an average of five surveys: CNN (September 5-7), ABC/Washington Post (September 5-7), CBS (September 5-7), Gallup (September 5-7) and Diageo/Hotline (September 5-7). The poll of polls does not have a sampling error. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Monday shows McCain and Obama tied at 48 percent. The poll, which was conducted Friday through Sunday, carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It was based on 1,022 telephone interviews. Republicans are hoping that if McCain can close the popular vote gap, he can also make gains in the electoral gap. The Electoral College will ultimately decide who takes over the White House.  Watch what the different standings mean » . Although polls across the country are open on one day, the election is not a national poll but a series of 51 state-level elections that decide the members of the Electoral College. Technically, voters aren't choosing a candidate but a slate of electors who have pledged to vote for that candidate when the Electoral College meets. With 538 electors up for grabs, the candidate with more than half -- 270 -- wins the presidency. The number of electors from each state equals the number of senators and representatives the state sends to Congress . Both candidates are turning their focus to battleground areas as they try to stack the states in their column. According to CNN's electoral map, the states that could go either way are Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia. McCain and his running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, are campaigning Tuesday in Lebanon, Ohio, just 30 miles from Obama, who is in Riverside. No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio. Obama's running mate, Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, is campaigning in Missouri. Both parties are putting a lot of emphasis on Missouri. For the past century, the state has voted for the winning presidential candidate in every election except one. (Missouri picked Adlai Stevenson over Dwight Eisenhower in 1956.) McCain and Palin campaigned there Monday. They're hoping the state's landscape will help them take its 11 electoral votes. The state has the 13th oldest population in the country, and Obama has struggled with older voters. Also, 37 percent of Missourians are evangelical Christians, according to the Pew Forum. That's substantially higher than the 26 percent nationally. If McCain can take Missouri and tilt the toss-up states of Florida and Ohio, which also have older populations, he will pull ahead of Obama. CNN's Tom Foreman contributed to this report.","CNN's poll of polls shows John McCain leading Barack Obama, 47-45 percent .

"YUSUFIYAH, Iraq (CNN) -- Until recently, Yusufiyah was among the most dangerous places in Iraq. U.S. Col. Michael Kershaw meets with Sunni leaders in Yusufiyah, formerly a hot spot for insurgent activity. Located in the so-called ""triangle of death,"" a violent area south of Baghdad, it was the site of frequent clashes between coalition forces and Sunni fighters. In May, two U.S. soldiers went missing in Yusufiyah and were never found, despite a massive search. But today, Sunni tribal leaders in this town cooperate with U.S. forces in their battle against foreign fighters and al Qaeda in Iraq. ""It's all the roll of the dice. It's people and politics all intertwined down here,"" said Col. Michael Kershaw, commander of the Second Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Kershaw now greets his former enemies with kisses, hears their grievances, spends time in their homes and even shares meals with them. He is surprised at how far relations have progressed. ""Our hope a year ago was to establish very basic inroads down here,"" Kershaw said. ""We thought the insurgency was far too deep for us to be able to effectively root it out and develop the relationship with the locals."" As happened in Anbar province to the west, local Sunni leaders from this town south of Baghdad finally turned on the al Qaeda extremists in their midst when the death and destruction became too much to bear. ""Killing people, stealing goats, everything, you name it,"" said Sheik Hamid Karbouli, when asked why he and his men now oppose al Qaeda. Karbouli has recruited some 150 volunteers to man checkpoints and carry guns.  Sunni sheik lists grievances against al Qaeda » . The U.S. military calls the men concerned local citizens. ""I haven't had more than one IED destroy a vehicle in an area where concerned citizens were located ... in the past two months,"" Kershaw said. To further encourage local tribesmen to turn against al Qaeda, the U.S. military pays local sheiks to provide security in their area; they receive up to $10 per man. It's a controversial policy, but one that has helped the U.S. military identify and stop insurgents, Kershaw said. ""In the three months since this has started, we have gathered more insurgents up, more terrorists, than we did in the preceding nine months. And that's because they have pointed out to us these people within their own ranks,"" Kershaw said. The next step is to have these young Sunnis join the Iraqi police. For that to happen, the U.S. military needs the cooperation of the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. Cooperation, however, is slow in coming. Iraq's central government is concerned these gunmen might turn into armed militias if the U.S. pulls out and civil war erupts. To assuage these concerns, Kershaw is registering as many of the local volunteers as possible, taking photographs and retinal scans, hoping leaders in Baghdad will agree to hire them as Iraqi police. ""What we see as being the end state down here is these tribes being brought back full into the government process,"" Kershaw said. The Second Brigade has lost 53 men in Iraq. Their photos are proudly displayed in the brigade's headquarters. Some of the U.S. soldiers here have a hard time forgiving the Sunnis for what they might have done in the insurgency. ""Were some of these people part of the insurgency? Sure they were,"" Kershaw said. ""Our job over here isn't to do what's comfortable for us, and it isn't to do what we want,"" he said. ""Our job is to do the nation's bidding. If this gets our nation closer to a solution for this country ... then that's what we're gonna do.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's rundown housing estates and deprived inner cities will be the setting for a new project that aims to use classical music to lift children out of the poverty trap. Simon Bolivar Youth Symphony Orchestra rehearse ahead of a performance at New York's Carnegie Hall in November last year. Organizers are modeling the plan on a hugely successful scheme already in place in Venezuela that gives free instruments and training to children from poor and vulnerable backgrounds. They are hoping that lessons learned in the slums of Caracas can be made to work in Britain. Internationally renowned cellist Julian Lloyd Webber is spearheading the initiative he hopes will give ""a sense of purpose"" to the lives of the most in need. Under the government-backed project, children as young as three will be taught to play classical instruments by trained musicians. ""We're really trying to go to the most deprived children, to the most poor areas,"" Lloyd Webber told CNN. ""You're talking about children from a background where classical music has almost certainly played no part."" The inspiration behind the scheme is the El Sistema social program in Venezuela, which has helped improve the lives of thousands of young people since it began over 30 years ago. Many of those youths have gone on to be part of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra, which was created as a result of the program and has performed around the world to rave reviews. The scheme has launched the musical careers of several of its members. One graduate, Gustavo Dudamel, currently conducts the orchestra but has been signed up to take over as musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic next year. The 27-year-old prodigy described by the New York Times as ""classical music's hottest young podium property"" was born to a poor family in the Venezuelan interior and took up the violin aged 10. However for Lloyd Webber, who has worked with a range of top musicians from Yehudi Menuhin to Elton John, the purpose of the UK project is not to create a new batch of professional musicians. ""That's not the way we're looking at it. It's very likely most of those involved will not turn professional but they will hopefully be empowered to make something more of their lives."" The Venezuelan project has grown from around 100 or so members when it started to involve 250,000 children and young people today. In the 1970s, Venezuela had only two professional orchestras mainly composed of immigrants from Eastern Europe and Italy. Thanks to El Sistema that number has expanded to over 110. But will the British version be able to match this astonishing success, given the very different social conditions that exist in the two countries? After all, though there are deprived areas in the UK they can't be compared with the grinding poverty of Venezuela's slums where the incentive to escape to a better life is surely much greater. Lloyd Webber disagrees, insisting that levels of poverty in Britain are far worse than many realize. ""We have many of the same problems here that they've encountered there. We have drug issues, prostitution issues, gang warfare issues. ""The Venezuelan project has been hugely helpful in reducing those kind of problems, and save children who would have possibly died without it."" What about the wide array of distractions on offer in the West such as video games and television, not to mention the low regard many young people have for the world of classical music, which is still considered stuffy and uncool? Again he disagrees, claiming that children in poor areas of Britain often have nothing to distract them, which he says leads to anti-social behavior. ""There are very poor areas in England and for the children who live there, there is often very little to do. That's why you see them out on the streets drinking, bored out of their heads."" Lloyd Webber is charged with chairing the steering group set up to organize the project, which is initially funded to run for the next three years. He says the scheme will focus on three or four specific areas of the country considered to be especially deprived. Charismatic teachers will be recruited to inspire the children. Although the cellist says the experience of performing in an orchestra should serve as a powerful inspiration on its own. ""I grew up performing in youth orchestras,"" says Lloyd Webber, who is the son of the composer William Lloyd Webber and younger brother of Andrew Lloyd Webber, who has written and produced several major West End and Broadway musicals including Phantom of the Opera and Evita. ""It will give them a sense of purpose and a sense of togetherness. It's a wonderful feeling when you've a group of a hundred players wanting to produce something bigger and better than they are. ""It could be that through this some of those involved feel self-worth for the first time in their lives.""","UK project to provide musical instruments and training to children in poor areas .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- She is one of the world's most likeable and photogenic leaders, has her own YouTube channel, and is determined to change the face of learning in the Middle East. Queen Rania's down-to-earth personality has won hearts and minds all over the world. She is also, according to you, the most inspirational leader featured on CNN's ""The Spirit of..."" in 2008. Thousands of CNN Web site users voted to award her the honor for her matchless energy working with Jordan's young people, ahead of luminaries such as peace advocate Kofi Annan, activist Wangari Maathai and environmentalist James Lovelock. This is Queen Rania's second award in as many months. In November, she was presented with the first ever YouTube Visionary Award for her bold use of the video-sharing network to discuss stereotypes about Islam and the Arab world. The channel fielded questions from young people about all aspects of Islamic culture. She could not be present to personally receive the honour at YouTube's Live event in San Francisco, but her pop-culture-savvy pre-recorded acceptance speech showed her to be possibly the coolest queen alive. She delighted viewers with a lighthearted top-ten list of reasons for registering her own YouTube channel, which included, ""Because I didn't have enough friends on Facebook,"" and ""Because anything Queen Elizabeth can do I can do better."" The experimental venture gained her a faithful online following, and since then the channel has become a platform for entertaining, non-hostile debate. It is exactly this willingness to set aside her royal image and interact with the public that her fans say has shown Queen Rania's dedication to bringing about change. She first entered the international spotlight 15 years ago after marrying Abdullah II bin al-Hussein, the then future king of Jordan. In 1999, she was proclaimed Queen, the world's youngest at age 28. She wasted little time in applying herself to various causes, and soon made her name as an engaging advocate for women's rights and moderate Islam, and as a heavy investor in youth. The 38-year-old mother of four has said that she cares about her people as if they were her own children, and wants to ensure as many of them as possible get the most out of school. Queen Rania may be light-hearted in some of her approaches, but she is very serious when it comes to revitalizing education in the Middle East. She has made closing the Middle East's ""knowledge divide"" -- the gap in knowledge that has grown as a result of people in richer countries having more access to computers, the Internet and education than those in poorer countries -- a top priority over the next few years in the hope that it will unlock the economic potential of the region's population. Queen Rania certainly has a challenge on her hands. Earlier this year, the Arab League Educational Cultural and Scientific Organisation revealed that nearly one in three between the ages of 15 and 45 is illiterate. Alongside promoting equal rights for men and women and the importance of literacy, Queen Rania has strived to convince both the education and private sectors that existing education systems need reinvigoration. She has repeatedly called for creative instruction and explorative learning to be embraced in the classroom. In April of this year, Queen Rania launched the Madrasati (""My School"") project, which encourages Jordanians to get their neediest schools back on their feet. Under the program, communities are working with the public and private sectors to raise funds and recruit volunteers to renovate school facilities and provide school supplies and equipment. This is expected to improve the learning environment for children, and ultimately have a ripple effect on the neighborhoods where the schools are located. Queen Rania's campaigns in various areas have helped to inspire other Middle Eastern policy-makers to see globalization in a more positive light -- a truly inspiring leader.","Queen Rania voted ""The Spirit of..."" most inspirational leader of 2008 .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's GDP fell 4 percent last quarter, the fastest pace on record, the government said on Wednesday. A homeless man pulls his cart filled with possessions and goods for recycling on March 18 in Osaka, Japan. The January-March quarter for Japan was 15.4 percent lower than the same time period last year, according to figures released by the Cabinet Office. Exports fell 26 percent on quarter, while imports were down 15 percent. The GDP slide in the world's second-largest economy is the greatest drop among the world's leading economies. By comparison, GDP in the United States fell 6.1 percent on an annual basis. This was the fourth straight quarter the Japanese economy contracted. Analysts say the drop reflects cuts in domestic spending with job cuts, factory closings and less capital spending as a result of spiraling sales abroad. The news punctuates a month of poor economic news out of Japan in recent weeks. Panasonic, one of the world's largest makers of electronic devices, announced it lost nearly $4 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31. Hitachi lost $8 billion in the fiscal year, with consolidated revenues down 11 percent from last year, the largest loss ever recorded by a Japanese manufacturer.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- In sport, being the best is not just about the having the greatest players. Here are five teams that have gone from zeroes to heroes, and in the process left their mark on sporting history. 1. The European Ryder Cup team . The 1980 U.S. hockey team's 'Miracle on Ice' against the Soviet Union. Europe's Ryder Cup team has become renowned for upsetting the form book, frequently triumphing against higher ranked American opposition. Since European players were first allowed to join the British and Irish team for the famous golf tournament (to improve the level of competition) in 1979, the U.S. has won six times; Europe seven; and the teams have tied once. The slight edge enjoyed by Europe, however, belies the lowly status of their players in world golf. For the last tournament two years ago in Ireland, for example, the Americans boasted 68.4 world-ranking points and the top three players, including world number one, Tiger Woods. Compare this with just 47.8 ranking points for the Europeans. Even so Europe went on to achieve a record third consecutive win. The key to this success has been the camaraderie and teamwork exhibited by the Europeans. Their players have consistently rallied around their position as underdog, managing to achieve a level of togetherness made all the more surprising since the team is made up of a collection of nationalities that are better known for falling out with each other. 2. The 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team . A famous victory against a seemingly invincible Soviet Union side propelled this team of college players and amateurs to the level of national heroes. Although the U.S. team went on to win the gold medal by defeating Finland at the Winter Olympics, it was the earlier match against the Soviets that captured the popular imagination. Classed as amateurs, the Soviet players were essentially professional, and were provided with different job titles by the communist government to allow them to compete. Many of their players were considered legends of world ice hockey at the time. The U.S. team coached by Herb Brooks was, by contrast, genuinely amateur and came into the tournament in Lake Placid, New York, as rank outsiders. Their youthfulness and tenacity combined with patriotic home support saw them upset predictions, defeating the Soviets 4-3 in a match that became known as the ""Miracle on Ice."" The win over their Cold War enemies seized the imagination of the U.S. public -- it inspired two films and was voted the greatest sporting moment of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated. Dave Ogrean, former executive director of USA Hockey, called the victory ""the most transcending moment in the history of our sport in this country."" 3. The 'Crazy Gang' defeat Liverpool in the FA Cup . Nobody expected lowly Wimbledon Football Club to do anything other than turn up when they played Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Dubbed the 'Crazy Gang' by British media because of the eccentric antics of their players and staff, who included future film actor Vinnie Jones, the team was outclassed on every front. At the time Liverpool were the dominant force in English football, having won the league title that year for the seventh time in a decade. Managed by former player Kenny Dalglish and boasting a host of stars, the team was expected to cruise past Wimbledon, who had little resources and were considered something of a joke. Under the chairmanship of Lebanese businessman Samir ""Sam"" Hammam, Wimbledon earned a reputation for bizarre behaviour, with players setting fire to new signings football kits, and Hammam once offering to buy a camel for the team's striker if he scored 20 goals in a season. The practical jokes helped to foster an extraordinarily strong team spirit, however, which saw them topple Liverpool 1-0, with Wimbledon captain Dave Beasant the hero of the hour after he saved a penalty. 4. Joe's Jets win the Superbowl . When the New York Jets took on the Baltimore Colts in the 1969 Superbowl, it was the team from Baltimore that was strong favorites. The Colts had stormed the National Football League (NFL) championship, considered at the time a much stronger competition than the American Football League (AFL), headed that year by the Jets. This news, however, seemed to have escaped Joe Namath, the Jets' charismatic quarterback, who gave a ""guarantee"" a few days earlier at a news conference in Miami -- where the Superbowl was being staged -- that his team would win. True to his predictions, the Jets came out on top with Namath taking all the plaudits (Sports Illustrated described him as a ""folk hero of the new generation"") after a blistering performance that saw his team triumph 16-7. 5. The Magical Magyars . The legendary Hungarian national football team of the 1950s is still considered one of the greatest teams in the history of sport. Although many of its players -- most notably striker Ferenc Puskas, who eventually moved to Real Madrid -- went on to play in the West, during its heyday the majority of the team was drawn from the Honved club in Budapest. The Magyars remained unbeaten for an unprecedented 33 consecutive matches (a record that still stands today) finally losing out in the 1954 World Cup Final to Germany. This golden age of Hungarian football was brought to an abrupt end in 1956 by the events of the Hungarian Revolution. Puskas and some of his team mates opted to defect to Western Europe, and never played for their country again.","Europe's Ryder Cup team has often beaten the U.S. despite lower profile players .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Is it possible to have a building that can make you happy, sad, or even angry? The Experience Music Project in Seattle has appeared in the Forbes list of ugly buildings. Does it affect your mood? Alain de Botton thinks it is. The Swiss-born British writer, modern-day philosopher, and author of international bestseller ""The Architecture of Happiness"", believes there is more to buildings and architecture than we may think. Taking on 19th Century French writer Stendhal's motto that ""beauty is the promise of happiness,"" de Botton analyzes human surroundings and considers how our needs and desires are transferred into architecture. He also discusses the amount to which architecture can affect our personal happiness. De Botton told CNN he felt that a beautiful building, or likewise, an ugly structure, could affect how we feel. ""Beauty has a huge role to play in altering our mood. When we call a chair or a house beautiful, really what we're saying is that we like the way of life it's suggesting to us. It has an attitude we're attracted to: if it was magically turned into a person, we'd like who it was. ""It would be convenient if we could remain in much the same mood wherever we happened to be ...but unfortunately we're highly vulnerable to the coded messages that emanate from our surroundings,"" he said. But, how do buildings manage to cast their bricks and mortar over our emotions? ""One might say that architecture suggests a mood to us, which we may be too internally troubled to be able to take up. Its effectiveness could be compared to the weather: a fine day can substantially change our state of mind -- and people may be willing to make great sacrifices to be nearer a sunny climate,"" de Botton said. De Botton believed that structures communicate with us in various ways. ""This book focuses our minds on the idea that buildings speak -- and on topics which can readily be discerned. They speak of democracy or aristocracy, openness or arrogance, welcome or threat, a sympathy for the future or a hankering for the past."" So, indeed your own house could be making you happy or sad, de Botton suggests. ""They (houses) tell us of certain moods that they seek to encourage and sustain in their inhabitants. While keeping us warm and helping us in mechanical ways, they simultaneously hold out an invitation for us to be specific sorts of people. They speak of particular visions of happiness,"" he said. De Botton said there are ""thousands"" of public buildings which are ugly and could possibly force a negative, saddening, or even potential anger-producing mood upon us. What are some examples? De Botton is quick to mention the new Westfield mall opening in Shepherd's Bush, London, which he describes as a ""monument to human idiocy"" which represents a ""large, confused shed, which offers the wider community nothing but a windowless façade clad in nauseating green paneling, with an utter indifference to symmetry, proportion or beauty"". And what other buildings could be considered a structure of sadness? Certainly, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Experience Music Project building in Seattle has to be a nominee -- featuring in the Forbes list of the top ten ugliest buildings in the world. Elsewhere, London's Millennium Dome (or 02 Arena) and Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, are other well-known candidates for buildings that could destroy one's day, after featuring in various ""ugly"" lists. At the other end of the scale, de Botton has some ideas about structures we should cast our eyes upon to make us happy. While all of this is rather subjective, de Botton said there were some aesthetic values that were universally appreciated. He was particularly fond of the highly-detailed yet serene Senate House in Bloomsbury, London, and also the Georgian-style architecture of Bedford Square, also in London. It's fair to say though, that not everyone in the architectural world is as optimistic about the power of architecture over people. In a debate with architect Robert Adam organized by building.co.uk, Adam attacked de Botton's ideas. After questioning de Botton's use of the word ""us"" when presenting some opinions, Adam said he did not believe that people were culturally aware enough to take notice of such details. ""I wouldn't call myself a pessimist because it would mean I feel bad about popular culture, which I don't. What I think we have at the moment is people who are unprepared to take on the language of the greater part of the population,"" he said. We want to know what you think. Do you believe buildings can influence the way we feel?

"(CNN) -- Myanmar is facing a food shortage largely due to last year's deadly Cyclone Nargis, which destroyed nearly all the rice crops in the fertile Ayeyarwaddy delta, the United Nations said Wednesday. A young farmer ploughs a field in preparation to grow rice in Dalla, about 20 kms south of Yangon on July 9, 2008. Rice production in the cyclone-affected areas of Ayeyarwaddy and Yangon, the largest city and former capital of Myanmar, is expected to be 50 percent of last year's, according to the report issued by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP). Rat infestation in western's Myanmar's Chin State has also contributed to the food shortage, the report says. ""Access to food remains the critical challenge for the poorest people and for vulnerable populations in remote areas of Myanmar,"" Chris Kaye, WFP's representative for Myanmar, said in a written statement. ""And for many of those affected by Cyclone Nargis, who are engaged in rebuilding their lives and livelihoods, the limited delta harvest means they will continue to rely on assistance to meet their food needs.""  Watch Paul Risley of the WFP discuss the food crisis » . Although rice production is expected to be adequate this year because of strong crops in other areas of the country, access to food remains a serious challenge to Myanmar's poor, especially in the delta region, the report said. More than 5 million people fall below the food poverty line and emergency food aid is still needed in cyclone-affected areas, the report said. The cyclone also hurt the cattle and fishing industries, contributing to the food crisis. ""Humanitarian assistance has not restored the production capacity of small to medium-sized farms,"" He Changchui, FAO's Asia-Pacific regional chief, said in a written statement. ""Farmers and fishers are unlikely to self-finance their needs this year, thus entering into a spiral of pauperization of the delta.""","Myanmar is facing a food shortage largely due to last year's deadly Cyclone Nargis .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Football fans are set to benefit from the recession as clubs slash season ticket prices to keep supporters coming back. Some Premier League fans will save on season tickets after five clubs cut prices. Price cuts have been announced at five English Premier League clubs. Manchester City, Sunderland, Everton, Portsmouth and Newcastle United have cut prices, while five further clubs announced price freezes on their season tickets. Bolton dropped their season ticket prices last season. Manchester City have taken an average of seven percent off their prices, while at Everton the cheapest adult season ticket will now be £399 ($550). At Sunderland under-16 season passes will be just £1($1.39) per home match for the 19 matches (£19 [$26] total) when purchased with an adult pass. The move comes amid a slight decline in Premiership football crowds this season. The average attendance at Premier League matches is down about 800 per match compared to the 2007/2008 season -- however, on average the stadiums are still at almost 92 percent capacity. Outside the United Kingdom, fans also stand to benefit from lower ticket prices. In the U.S. Major League Soccer side Kansas City Wizards recently announced they would drop ticket prices for the coming season. Wizards president Robb Heinemann was quoted in the Kansas City Star saying; ""We understand these are tough economic times."" Other countries in Europe have maintained lower prices in recent years, with single tickets available for about 10 Euros in club games in Italy and Germany. Tickets in Australia's A-League tended to be cheaper yet, while South America and Africa/Middle East remained the cheapest. In England's League One and League Two competitions crowds had dropped more significantly. Dan Johnson of the Premier League told CNN the clubs cutting ticket prices were simply responding to the financial climate. ""Given the economic situation, there will be pressure on fans' ability to spend and the clubs have acted accordingly. ""It's a very real way that they can help at this time,"" Johnson said. Johnson said the drop in crowds this season was not significant and may be made up towards the end of the season when attendances are traditionally higher. Sport business expert Professor Simon Chadwick, founder of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, told CNN recessions could have a strong impact on football crowds. ""In previous recessions there is evidence to suggest that as unemployment rises, the attendance at football matches decreases,"" he said. However, Chadwick said English football fans shouldn't hope for significant price reductions. ""Some Premier League clubs are running at nearly 100% capacity and there's excess demand ...so in the short-to-medium term they should be able to continue at premium prices,"" Chadwick said.","Football fans to benefit as club teams lower season ticket prices .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If one hardened cockpit door is good, would two barriers be even better? Many airline pilots believe the answer is ""yes,"" and are hoping to reinvigorate efforts to require so-called ""secondary barriers"" on every commercial plane in the country. Pilots praise the hardened cockpit doors mandated after 9/11, saying they have done as much as anything to protect aircraft from terrorist assaults. But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews. Currently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability. ""This is an absolute no-brainer,"" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. ""Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in."" ALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said. Hijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA. The airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights. Hesselbein disagrees. ""You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit. ""But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,"" Hesselbein said. The government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S. In a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier ""appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost."" ""Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,"" the report said. But the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing ""the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit"" aircraft. ""The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation."" The Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done ""in the absence of appropriate risk analysis."" Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he is again introducing a bill to require barriers on passenger planes. ""Everybody recognizes the vulnerability,"" he said. ""The airline industry recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the federal government ought to pay for the secondary barriers. The federal government recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the airline industry should pay. ""Meanwhile, for as long as the debate continues, the flying public is less safe.""

"KHARTOUM, Sudan (CNN) -- (CNN) -- Fighting resumed Tuesday in a disputed oil-rich town in Sudan, threatening to reignite a calamitous civil war which ended three years ago. Fresh fighting in Sudan over an oil-rich town has raised fears civil war could again erupt. Fresh fighting in Sudan over an oil-rich town has raised fears civil war could again erupt. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon deplored the fighting between the Sudanese military and troops with the Sudan People's Liberation Army. The SPLA fought a rebellion against the government for more than 20 years until both sides signed a peace deal in 2005. The deal's Comprehensive Peace Agreement ended a north-south civil war that killed about 2 million people and displaced more than 4 million others. An impasse over the boundaries of the town of Abyei is a major reason the peace agreement has not been fully implemented. Fighting erupted in Abyei on May 13. It resumed Tuesday despite a cease-fire and has ""resulted in the destruction"" of the town ""and the displacement of between 30,000 and 50,000 people,"" the secretary general said in a statement. Don't Miss Sudanese opposition leader arrested Sudan cuts ties with Chad after attack Darfur rebels advance on Sudan capital, their leader says ""If the situation is not urgently addressed, the achievements thus far of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement could be placed at serious risk,"" he said. The civil war in Sudan, which started in 1983, pitted a northern government dominated by Arab Muslims against black Christians and animists in southern Sudan. That conflict was not directly related to ongoing violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan. Human rights groups and United Nations say the Sudanese military armed and trained Arab militias in Darfur after a rebellion erupted in 2003. They say the military and militias have engaged in widespread killing, rape and forced displacements in Darfur as they battle about rebels who have splintered into roughly a dozen groups. One of those groups staged a daring attack this month near the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. The government said it quashed the attack. Nearly 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced in Darfur in the last five years, the UN says.","Fighting in disputed oil-rich Sudan town raises fears of return to civil war .

"(CNN) -- First it was instant messaging during office hours that gave us the thrill of passing notes in class. Then it was ogling ourselves on Web cams, ranting our minds on blogs, uploading our baby photos on Flickr and poking each other on Facebook. These days, as corporate records show, we choose to spend our lunch breaks watching YouTube, if not chatting over Skype. CSL's flagship One2Free shop stands at the corner of Hong Kong's trendy Causeway Bay district. The bad news is the Web 2.0 revolution is over. The good news is now we can take it with us. Over the past two years, well over a dozen startups have sprung into action, bringing everything from IM to VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) to our mobile phones, in a quest to conquer the cellular fourth screen. Winner of Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal's 2007 Emerging Technologies Awards in the category of Social Networking, Mig33 is confident about the viability of its future: ""The next wave of Internet growth is mobile. The number of mobile devices worldwide has exceeded three billion, and the next billion subscribers will have their first Internet experience using a mobile phone."" Like the Rotterdam-based Nimbuzz, Mig33 also offers instant messaging, photo sharing and VoIP for cheaper telephony, in addition to social networking via profiles, chatrooms and, of course, friends. Applications are free to download and communities are free to join, while members are charged only for SMS and VoIP calls, bridging communications between mobile devices and desktop computers. The softwares are fully functional on both 3G and any smart (Internet-enabled) 2.5G phones running such platforms as Java, Symbian, Windows Mobile, Blackberry, S60 and the iPhone OS. Nimbuzz in particular boasts compatibility with Skype, Google Talk, AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Live Messenger, Jabber, MySpace and Facebook. But it is hardly alone in partnering with traditional desktop live chat sites, as well as industry partners around the world. Playfully packaged, internationally-based Fring works with WiFi providers in Europe and Australia as well as SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) providers based in both North and South America, Western and Eastern Europe, South Africa and China, also consolidating all chat buddies into a single mobile contact list. In this context, one way to stand out from the all-encompassing bunch with the global reach is through niche audience focus. MyHappyPlanet, a free online language-exchange network that allows members to create profiles and chat with language partners in real time (text, voice, video), will go mobile in the near future. A2Aworld, an upcoming mobile social networking startup, will focus on connecting social networkers between the world's two largest online communities -- America and Asia -- in terms of communication, information, culture and e-commerce. Furthermore, its business model is based on revenue from emerging online advertising, VoIP calls and premium membership fees, without the mobile ads and viral marketing. Fierce competition . Meanwhile in the mobile marketplace, VoIP competition is getting fierce. While SIPphone's open-source Gizmo Project was heralded by early beta testers as ""the first viable Skype alternative"" in July 2005, it's clear today that Skype itself is the big winner in the VoIP game. Most recently, iSkoot has extended its partnership with Skype, following its collaboration with mobile operator 3 for the global launch of the 3 Skypephone in October 2007, which was the first mass-market Skype-enabled handset as a carrier-integrated solution for mobile-VoIP IM services. But mobile VoIP itself still faces multiple challenges, including fragmented access and distribution. While some applications choose to collaborate with mobile network carriers, others choose to compete with them by using data networks such as WiFi. ""In the near future, there will be a hyper-convergence solution,"" predicts A2Aworld's Michael Liu. ""However, WiFi/WiMax to cell/IMS will be playing a bigger and bigger role. In the long run, there will be all-in-IP IMS solutions."" Insecure communications also pose a new threat to VoIP, as Liu points out: ""In the early days of VoIP, people were mostly concerned with its cost, functionality and reliability. Now that VoIP is gaining wide acceptance and becoming one of the mainstream communication technologies, security has become a major issue."" And to satisfy the YouTube generation, applications such as myZen Mobile encourage the circulation of photos and viral videos optimized for mobile viewing in real time, with an all-in-one interface featuring YouTube, Facebook, Flickr, Yahoo podcast, etc, with the possibility to add other community sites such as ifilm and blogger. Going mobile . Simon Newstead, founder and CEO of Frenzoo, a social-networking site specialized in 3D fashion avatars, is enthusiastic about going mobile. ""We have a roadmap to implement our service on mobile platforms such as iPhone,"" he says. ""Today users are already using 3D in gaming platforms like the wildly successful Nintendo DS Lite, so the logical integration of 3D avatars into the mobile platform will certainly present a great opportunity. ""Technically, new handsets already integrate hardware acceleration for 3G, and battery life is increasing rapidly. Now the only remaining factor is availability or higher-speed affordable mobile bandwidth, which is already emerging in advanced mobile markets such as South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan."" Indeed in Hong Kong, where the mobile-phone penetration rate hovers around 150 percent, mastering the mobile market is becoming increasingly lucrative. Hong Kong's largest mobile network carrier CSL introduced Asia's first 3G video-sharing service in 2005, launched Hong Kong's first 3G interactive mobile TV in 2006, and partnered with blogging site Xanga in early 2008. From the carrier's point of view, people's choice of mobile communication is a question of coverage and user-friendliness -- of ""price, packaging, usability,"" according to CSL's (""Create a Simple Life"") chief marketing officer Christina Teo. ""We try to 'replicate' any desktop experience to the mobile phone. You can call it replicating, extending, adding value,"" continues Teo. ""And with every new partnership, we need to make sure that the application works on each new handset we launch... With mobile phones [as opposed to desktop computers] there is still some concern, stigma, so we need to educate people to get over that hurdle. It's the faster we can get it at the click of a button."" More and more, the mission of the mobile industry is to make seamless that virtual space between desktop and handset. ""It's where we want people to embrace life,"" says Teo. ""It's what we all aim to do. No downtime, no downspace... Over time Xanga will add more features, and we will mobilize as much as possible."" The good news is the Web 3.0 revolution is only beginning. E-mail to a friend .","Startups offer applications to bring social networking sites to mobile platforms .
