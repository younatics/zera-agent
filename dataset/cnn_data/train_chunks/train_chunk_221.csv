"(CNN) -- The Missouri man charged in the death of 12-year-old Adriaunna Horton made his first court appearance Monday to answer charges of murder, forceable rape, statutory rape and child kidnapping. Adriaunna was playing with her sisters in a park in Golden City last Monday when two other children saw her climb into a blue SUV. A state trooper arrested Bobby Bourne at a traffic stop in Golden City that night, driving the same SUV, and arrested him for child kidnapping. Though Bourne initially denied having anything to do with Adriaunna's disappearance, he admitted during questioning that he was the one who picked her up and said he merely asked her about her father, Barton County Deputy Sheriff Vernon Ring said. Bourne said Adriaunna ran away from him, fell down, and died from the fall. He led investigators to a wooded area where they found the girl's body, which had evidence of sexual assault and strangulation, Ring said. CNN affiliate KOLR reported the four charges Bourne now faces and said he attended his arraignment in a bulletproof vest, along with nine guards and a K9 unit. It could not immediately be determined if Bourne was being represented by an attorney. Golden City is in a rural section of southwest Missouri, about 25 miles east of the Kansas border. CNN's Jennifer Feldman and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Adriaunna Horton went missing last Monday after climbing into a blue SUV .

"(CNN) -- French radio journalists Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon have been found dead in northern Mali, the French Foreign Ministry said Saturday. The two Radio France International reporters were kidnapped Saturday morning after conducting interviews with a Tuareg rebel near the northern town of Kidal, a local governor said, according to RFI sister network France Info. Verlon and Dupont ""were abducted by four men aboard a Toyota,"" Kidal Gov. Adama Kamissoko said while in Bamako, according to France Info. Kidal was one of the strongholds of the Islamic militant Tuareg uprising last year that plunged Mali into chaos after a military-led coup. Following the coup, the al Qaeda-linked Tuareg rebels occupied the northern half of the country. Earlier this year, as part of France's intervention to flush out Islamist militants in Mali, the French military secured the area around Kidal, the last major town that was under rebel control in northern Mali. The two reporters were abducted in front of the home a member of the Tuareg rebels' National Movement of a Liberation of Azawad, RFI reported. The two journalists could be heard resisting their abduction, according to their driver, who was forced by the gunmen to lay on the ground, RFI said. French President Francois Hollande condemned the killings, calling them ""despicable,"" according to a statement released by the presidential palace. The kidnapping and deaths come the same week that four long-held French hostages were released. They had been abducted by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in neighboring Niger and had been held since 2010.","NEW: The journalists were abducted after interviewing a rebel, RFI reports .

"(CNN) -- Let's say that you're the Federal Aviation Administration. (Unlikely, granted. But, just for the purpose of this exercise, try to envision yourself as a government agency). You're about to make a decision that will affect millions of travelers. Your decision may please them or it may infuriate them. Most of them have no idea right now that you're contemplating the decision, but as soon as you make it, all of them will become aware, and they will respond, likely in a visceral manner. You're the FAA. What do you do? What the real FAA is pondering concerns expanding the permitted use of tablets, personal communication devices and other electronic gadgets on commercial flights. Last month, The Hill reported, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski wrote in a letter to FAA Acting Administrator Michael Huerta: . ""I write to urge the FAA to enable greater use of tablets, e-readers, and other portable electronic devices during flight, consistent with public safety ... mobile devices are increasingly interwoven in our daily lives. They empower people to stay informed and connected with friends and family, and they enable both large and small businesses to be more productive and efficient, helping drive economic growth and boost U.S. competitiveness."" For many years, passengers have been told that some electronic devices, including cell phones, can interfere with aircraft navigation and communication signals. But as technology advances, ways around this are being developed. Many airlines already sell in-flight Wi-Fi connections for laptop computers and tablets, so the logical next step would be to allow airborne passengers to use their cell phones to connect to the world below. A few thoughts: . In terms of written communication from passengers on the plane to people down below -- e-mail, text messages sent from cell phones, social network posts -- the more the better. Anything the digital traffic will bear. If you've been on flights with Wi-Fi enabled, you may have noticed that the passengers using it seem to be contented, almost docile -- the tension level seems to have been lowered. Like it or not, we've become hooked on being constantly connected, and passengers who are able to maintain that connection while six miles in the air appear to be traveling in a state of something close to silent, electronically-sated, tunnel-vision bliss. But there should be one exception to this: . Technical and connectivity issues aside, the FAA and FCC should never extend their digital-era permission slip to voice calls on cell phones. The result of allowing phone calls in the air would produce the opposite of the tranquilizing effect of permitting other forms of electronic communication. The anger level of travelers who become incensed by the yammering in the next seat would rise to the level of a public safety concern. Passengers would be demanding to be moved, would ask flight attendants to referee disputes, would probably engage in fistfights. Allowing jousting matches or bullfights in airplane aisles wouldn't be much more disruptive than allowing voice calls on planes. (But what about the idea of passengers voluntarily exercising restraint and courtesy in those close quarters, limiting the length and loudness of their calls out of respect for their fellow citizens? All right, stop laughing and rolling around on the floor -- get up. This is the United States in the 21st century. We know that voluntary phone courtesy is not going to happen). You may recall Airfone, the air-to-ground pay phone service that debuted on commercial flights in the 1980s. It required a credit card for each call, and was expensive -- $7.50 in '80s dollars for the first three minutes, when the service was introduced. It never become all that popular, and eventually it faded away. But that was before the advent of personal cell phones. Talking on the phone anywhere, at any time, is today seen not as an exotic and costly luxury but as an entitlement. The FAA is reportedly not considering voice-call permission on flights; if and when that day comes, walking across the country may feel like a more palatable option than flying. There's one decision the FAA is evaluating that probably says more about us than it does about in-flight safety: . Those two brief stretches of time when all electronic devices must be turned off -- after the doors to the plane close until it is at cruising altitude, and then again on approach for landing -- are being questioned. If it can be determined that signals do not interfere with the pilots' transmissions, should passengers now be allowed to use their electronic gadgets even in those few minutes? Some contend that, in those crucial parts of a flight, passengers should not be distracted, and should be alert to instructions from the cabin crew. But reading a magazine or a book can lure a passenger's attention from the crew, and those are not prohibited. So the question would seem to be: . Has the addiction to the gadgets become so powerful that we are unwilling to disconnect and look away even for that paltry handful of minutes? Has the agitation from withdrawal gotten to that level? Because if it has, then this is an issue considerably more profound and far-reaching than anything having to do with the rules of travel. Regardless of what the FAA decides, there is one option for in-flight diversion that will still be available, something ancient kings and monarchs could only dream of: . Looking out the window, high above the clouds. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: FAA looks at letting passengers use gadgets on takeoff, landing .
He says the more texting, e-mailing and surfing are allowed, the better .
Cell phone calls are the opposite, though: They raise anxiety .
Greene: Are we that unwilling to disconnect from our gadgets for a few minutes?"
"(CNN) -- A one-way ticket to Mars. Presuming you get there, who wouldn't want to come back? As it turns out, plenty of people. This spring, the Netherlands-based Mars One Project began accepting applications for that one-way ticket. Between April and early September, more than 165,000 people from around the world tossed their names into the hat. Clearly, the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011 did nothing to diminish the appeal of extraterrestrial adventures. ""Exploration and a sense of discovery are innate in humans, more in some and less in others,"" says Aashima Dogra, editorial manager at Mars One. Even if you're not one of those shopping around for spacesuits, the Final Frontier holds plenty of fascination: Consider how many were enthralled last May by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield's rendition of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity,"" performed and videotaped aboard the International Space Station. So maybe it's time for an Earthbound expedition inspired by the stars. For cautious enthusiasts -- or Mars One applicants waiting to hear back -- here are six space-related destinations on terra firma: . The U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Alabama . If you missed out on Space Camp as a kid, it's not too late to live the dream: The U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama, also offers a 2-day camp for adults, as well as three- and four-day camps for families. Prices for these camps range from $299-$549 per person and give attendees a chance to experience elements of astronaut training, rocket construction and mission control. There are simulations aplenty at the center's museum, too: the G-Force Accelerator, a Space Shot that rockets you 140 feet in 2.5 seconds, and -- a highlight for Mars One aspirants -- a Mars Mission capsule. Follow up the action with downtime in the center's extensive galleries and archives. Open daily, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $20 for children 6-12, $25 if you're over 13. 800-637-7223 . Giant airliners: Does size matter? The Hayden Planetarium, New York City . Why settle for seeing Mars when you can journey far outside our galaxy? At the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan, extraordinary visuals give you the impression of interstellar travel -- and a mind-boggling reminder of the scope of it all. The Digital Universe, a ""3-D atlas of the universe"" developed specially by the planetarium, makes possible fantastic shows like the new ""Dark Universe"" show now in the works, or one-time events like ""Astronomy Live: The Grand Tour"" on October 29. Programs like these take viewers beyond our solar system to explore distant stars and obscure galaxies. Tickets are $15 for adults, $13.50 for children. 212-769-5100 . International UFO Museum and Research Center, New Mexico . While some humans are packing for Mars, others believe the residents of distant planets have been visiting us for years. In 1947, ranchers near Roswell, New Mexico, came upon unusual debris that would form the basis of perhaps the most famous UFO story of all time. The town has memorialized the incident with the International UFO Museum and Research Center, opened in 1996. Memorabilia includes original broadcasts pertaining to the event and models of debris based on eyewitness accounts. There are also photos of possible UFOs from around the world and an extensive library relating to UFOs and crop circles. ""We're not here to convince people one way or the other,"" says executive director Mark Briscoe. ""It's for all individuals to make up their own minds."" Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Admission is $5 adults, $2 children 15 and under. 800-822-3545. Spaceport America, New Mexico . After looking to the past in Roswell, drive west to glimpse the future at Spaceport America in the Jornada del Muerto desert. Though not yet complete, the world's first purpose-built commercial spaceport is welcoming preview bus tours before operations kick into full gear. The spaceport's chief tenant is Virgin Galactic, the space exploration arm of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which has already taken over 600 (refundable) booking deposits for $250,000 seats on future space flights. Tours offer a sneak preview of what's sure to be a headline-grabbing grand opening. The 18,000-acre Spaceport site is home to an airfield, launch facilities, the mission control building and the architecturally arresting terminal hangar. The 3Â½-hour tours also include information on the latest developments in space exploration technology and the new, commercial space race. Reservations are required. Contact tour operator Follow the Sun, Inc. Tours depart twice a day on Fridays and Saturdays, and once on Sundays. Cost is $59 for adults, $49 for children 13-17, and $29 for children 12 and under. 866-428-4786. Spanning the globe for scary bridges . The Kennedy Space Center, Florida . Manned shuttles no longer light up the sky above Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, but the center's visitor complex remains an essential destination for space enthusiasts. The biggest exhibit these days is the Space Shuttle Atlantis attraction, which includes not only the craft itself, but landing and docking simulators. Regular buses run to the Apollo/Saturn V Center, featuring historic vehicles and exhibits relating to the Apollo program and moon landing. Each day, a bona fide astronaut does a presentation on his or her life and experiences. And if you're lucky, you may even catch a rocket launch, which happen roughly every few weeks. The visitor complex is open 365 days a year, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $50 for adults, $40 for children 3-11. Call for reservations: 877-313-2610. (It's still open during the U.S. government shutdown.) Trekcetera Museum, Canada . In the world of pop culture, nothing has inspired more would-be astronauts than ""Star Trek."" The little town of Vulcan in Alberta, Canada, has made the most of its Trekkish name, with a Star-Trek themed tourism office, a replica of the Enterprise, and other memorabilia. This summer it added the Trekcetera Museum, sure to put Vulcan more firmly on the mental map of any thorough Trekkie. Billed as ""Canada's only 'Star Trek' museum,"" its displays feature original costumes and props from both the movies and TV shows. Fall opening hours are 10 a.m. to 5p.m., closed Tuesdays. Tickets cost $12 for adults, $8 for seniors and children.","Experience the G-Force Accelerator rocketing you 140 feet in 2.5 seconds .

"(CNN) -- On Leyte Island, one of the hardest hit areas by Typhoon Haiyan, a man is asked by a television crew if he has a message for relatives living abroad. ""I'm just letting you know, Josie is gone. Please forgive me, I couldn't save her, because we all got separated from each other when the strong waves hit,"" said the man, tears rolling down his face as he spoke to CNN affiliate ABS-CBN about his daughter's death. ""We got separated. ""I couldn't even hold on to my child ... Josie is on the corner. Her body has been there three days,"" he tells the camera. With spotty communications in the wake of one of the largest storms in history, some survivors are reduced to turning to television cameras to tell far-flung family members the worst of news. ""To the mother of my kids, who's currently living in Virginia, I know that you'll watch this: Justin and Ella are gone,"" another unidentified man tells ABS-CBN. ""They are both dead."" The number of Filipinos living abroad -- either permanently or as contracted workers -- was estimated at 10.5 million in 2011, according to the Commission on Filipinos Overseas. The diaspora has Filipinos working in 217 countries around the world, but most work in the United States (3.4 million), followed by Saudi Arabia (1.6 million) and Canada (about 850,000), according to the commission. That has left family members abroad in a desperate search for news of loved ones in the storm's path. In the United Arab Emirates, Naicy Yu Bono is gripped with pain and fear after the storm ravaged her hometown of Tacloban. Among the family members missing are her mother and two daughters, 8-year-old Rheinzi and 22-year-old Reanne. ""My last communication with my eldest (daughter) was Friday 1 a.m.,"" she told CNN's Leone Lakhani. ""She sent me a Whatsapp (text message). She said, 'Mummy I'm so scared because the wind is so strong.'"" Bono has been in the UAE -- the fourth largest home of Filipinos expatriates with about 680,000 migrant workers -- for the past six months working to send cash back to her family at home. Now she is at the Philippine embassy preparing to leave the country. ""I'm going to find my daughters,"" she said. Some relatives abroad have had better luck. From London, iReporter David Armstrong puts out an SOS trying to get in contact with his wife, Ruby, in Ormoc City. Fortunately, he was able to re-establish contact with his wife, but the suffering of his family and other survivors is profound, he said. Four of six homes owned by her family are damaged. ""They have all suffered from upset stomachs as they have had to drink unsuitable water. Their city has had 90% of its buildings damaged, including hospitals, banks and supermarkets,"" he said. ""They are unable to use any ATM to withdraw money to buy any food from the very few street sellers who are selling food. They have had no relief aid whatsoever."" While most of the media coverage has focused on Tacloban -- the largest city hardest hit by the storm -- there are many more towns and cities which have sustained substantial damage, Armstrong notes. He is attempting to travel to Ormoc to get supplies to his family. He said his wife told him that ""they have been told by the electric company that they will be without electricity until January as the typhoon has brought down most of the power lines on the island,"" he said. ""She also told me there is only one supermarket open in the whole city and it's running out of food. There is only one pharmacy open in the whole city but they have very few medicines left and people have had to queue for hours to get any."" In Tacloban, iReporter Leo Udtohan took his camera along the roads of this city of more than 200,000 people, showing dead bodies wrapped in plastic lying along the street. ""Other dead bodies were washed ashore near the Tacloban fish port,"" he reports. ""In some areas, the dead are being buried in mass graves ... I saw some people bury the dead near the highway."" ""There's no clean water, no electricity and very little food,"" he said. ""The communication is still very limited in many areas in southern Leyte, so there is real difficulty if you're asking for some updates on what happened to families or relatives.""","Survivor to family abroad: ""Josie is gone.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A huge explosion rocked the area near the U.S. consulate in Afghanistan's Herat province early Friday during a heavy gunfight between militants and security forces, officials said. The attack occurred just before 6 a.m. local time when attackers sped towards the front gate of the consulate, said Marie Harf, a deputy State Department spokeswoman. The attackers fired assault rifles starting a gun battle with Afghan security forces. During the battle, a truck exploded, Harf said, causing major damage to the front gate of the consulate. American consulate personnel took shelter in safe havens while U.S. security forces responded to the attack, Harf said. There were no U.S. casualties. Seven attackers traveling in two vehicles took part in the assault and all of them were killed, said Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, deputy Afghan Interior Minister. Three people, two local police officers and a local security guard, were killed, police and hospital officials said. Twenty others were injured. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in an e-mail to CNN. U.S. Ambassador James B. Cunningham in a statement condemned the attack and lamented the Afghan citizens who lost their lives. ""Many Afghan civilians were killed in the attack, along with others who work for the Consulate as contractors. We are deeply saddened by this senseless loss of life,"" he said.","There were no U.S. casualties in the attack in Herat province .

"(CNN) -- In the first ruling of its kind in Japan, a court has ordered a kindergarten to pay almost $2 million to the parents of four of five children who were killed after staff put them on a bus that drove straight into the path of an oncoming tsunami. Sendai District Court ordered Hiyori Kindergarten to pay 177 million yen ($1.8M) to the parents of the children killed in the aftermath of the 2011 mega-quake that measured 9.0 on the Richter scale, according to court documents. Chief judge Norio Saiki said in the verdict that staff at the kindergarten in Ishinomaki city, which suffered widespread destruction in the March, 2011, disaster, could have expected a large tsunami from such a powerful quake. He said the staff did not fulfill their duties by collecting sufficient information for the safe evacuation of the children. ""The kindergarten head failed to collect information and sent the bus seaward, which resulted in the loss of the children's lives,"" Saiki was quoted as saying on public broadcaster NHK. In the verdict he said the deaths could have been avoided if staff had kept the children at the school, which stood on higher ground, rather than sending them home and to their deaths. The court heard how staff placed the children on the bus which then sped seaward. Five children and one staff member were killed when the bus, which also caught fire in the accident, was overtaken by the tsunami. The parents had initially sought 267 million yen ($2.7 million) in damages. Local media reports said the decision was the first in Japan that compensated tsunami victims and was expected to affect other similar cases. Ishinomaki was one of the worst-hit cities in the earthquake and tsunami which hit on March 11, 2011, killing 15,883 people.","Kindergarten ordered to pay $1.8 million to parents from four families .

"(CNN) -- Wild horses, raging winds and energy-sapping heat in the land of Genghis Khan; welcome to the Mongolian steppe. This vast expanse of savannah and grassland is the setting for the world's longest horse race -- the Mongol Derby. Equestrian's toughest test is perhaps the last place you'd expect to find a teenager from the English county of Hampshire. But Lara Prior-Palmer isn't like other teenagers. The 19-year-old is the youngest winner -- and first female victor -- in the five-year history of this most arduous of contests. ""It is the most extraordinary and bizarre race, it's like the Tour de France crossed with Snakes and Ladders,"" Palmer told CNN from a victory party in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator. ""It was really dramatic, it would be first-degree heat and the horses would be sweating, then suddenly the air would cool with wind blowing super hard. ""I wanted to do something that was going to put me out of my comfort zone I guess. Mongolia sounded like a really cool country."" The race, officially recognized by the Guinness Book of Records in 2011 as the world's lengthiest, takes its inspiration from the Mongol Empire's pioneering postal service. The fearsome Genghis Khan, leader of the Mongols between 1162 and 1227, established and expanded the ""Ortoo."" It was a messenger system which saw riders travel on horseback between outposts, stopping to either rest, swap horses or pass the message onto another rider. Forty horse stations, ""urtuus"" to use the Mongolian name, line the race's 1000-kilometer route. Not that there is a course set out for the 30 competitors, who use anything from a compass, GPS or good old-fashioned intuition to traverse the landscape between each resting spot. As the race's official website puts it, ""this is no guided tour, or pony trek."" Each urtuus is manned by local nomads and furnished with tents, beds and food for man, woman and horse alike. Riders must change horse at each urtuus. It is the nomadic tribes who provide the horses for the race and equine welfare is one of the organizers' highest priorities. A vet is stationed at each urtuus and if the horse's heart rate is above a certain level, the rider is given a time penalty. There is also extensive medical support for the jockeys, half of whom withdrew from the race before the finish line this year. ""There were 30 at the beginning, but not at the end,"" explains Prior-Palmer. ""My body got really cross with me the day I finished, I slept all day. ""I'm lucky because I'm young. Any problems I had were really painful but didn't get that bad. I got really swollen ankles, chafing, a few other things, blisters and other stuff. ""The worst thing is the exhaustion, sitting on a horse may look easy but you've got to keep them cantering. Thirteen hours a day I was on a horse. At lunchtime you'd want to sleep but you can't because there's another 120 kilometers to go that day."" Prior-Palmer's determination paid off, although her joy came at the expense of another rider's despair. American Devan Horn was the first rider to finish the race, but her horse failed a post-race medical inspection. A two-hour penalty ensued and Prior-Palmer was named as the winner. ""It was a strange way to win and I didn't feel very good about it because the other girl was super upset,"" said Prior-Palmer. ""It's slowly sinking in."" So what next for the teenager who made history? The answer, it would seem, is more history. ""I begin university in September, I'm going to study history in Edinburgh or maybe at Trinity College in Dublin, I haven't decided,"" she said. ""It's a terrible future for me because everything else is really boring. I'll have to knuckle down with some work.""","Briton Lara Prior-Palmer, 19, is youngest winner of Mongol Derby .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The term ""eco community"" might conjure up an image of bearded hippies tending an allotment before sharing a mung bean stew. But as today's urbanites become more concerned about reducing their carbon footprints, some are finding that modern eco communities offer them a way to live sustainably without foregoing their home comforts. The Nubanusit Neighborhood is a cohousing project that emphasizes sustainability. Communities that put an emphasis on green values range from isolated eco villages to sophisticated co-housing projects. Co-housing was dreamed up in Denmark in the idealistic 60s. It allows residents to live in communities where they own their own homes but are actively involved in running their own neighborhoods, which often include a common house where shared dining and other activities are an option. Sarah Berger, from the UK Co-housing Network, told CNN, ""More and more people keep contacting us about getting involved in co-housing communities -- there's an unquenchable thirst for this sort of thing."" As well as co-housing being widespread in Europe, the U.S. Co-housing Association claims there are more than 150 co-housing communities in the U.S. But where co-housing projects were once primarily intended as a return to a more collective, less isolated way of living, new projects often place an emphasis on sustainable living. The Nubanusit Neighborhood and Farm in New Hampshire, U.S., is a new co-housing project designed to the highest green standards, including the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design benchmark. Nubanusit co-founder Shelly Goguen Hulbert says its 29 homes are densely insulated and have triple glazing, meaning they are virtually airtight. A heat recovery system uses warm exhaust air to heat incoming fresh air, minimizing heat loss. Homes are heated by a centralized wood pellet boiler system, with the pellets sourced from a manufacturer based 5 miles away. And the 70-acre site includes a farm, which means the community can grow its own food or have it grown right on their doorstep by professional farmers. All this helps minimize residents' carbon footprint, and that's a big attraction for many. Noel White is an editor and writer who has just moved to the neighborhood with his wife and two children. ""With the home we were living in before it would have been very difficult to do a lot of retro fitting to it or do things to make it more energy efficient,"" he explains . ""But here we're moving to a place where other people have spent a lot of time thinking about these things and have made very good choices about the energy efficiency of the home and its environmental impact. Someone else has taken the time and effort and had the expertise to make those choices carefully and we've taken advantage of it by buying into it."" It's that opportunity to live in purpose-built sustainable homes that attracted another resident, Jeff Drake, a psychotherapist, who moved to the neighborhood with his partner 7 months ago. Like White, he says it would have been exceptionally difficult and expensive to retrofit his previous home to be more energy efficient. Now he gets to live his green dream. Would you like to live in an eco community? ""This summer I can cool off my house by closing it up during the day; I don't need any air con. In the winter the amount of heat I have to use is really small because the insulation is tremendous. It's exciting to live that way,"" says Drake. Although work on Nubanusit Neighborhood won't be completed until the end of the year, over half the homes have been sold and the people choosing to move there are by no means hardcore environmentalists. Of his own family White says, ""I think we have been environmentally conscious for a long time and have tried to be thoughtful about the way we live, but that's the way a lot more people are now anyway."" As ordinary people become more environmentally aware the idea of eco communities is becoming more mainstream. In the UK, Living Villages has won architecture awards for its Wintles development in Shropshire. Its 14 houses use lots of sustainable timber, are highly insulated, and have heat recovery systems and solar panels. Like co-housing developments, Living Villages emphasizes community as much as environmentally sound design, with the Wintles homes facing each other around a village green to encourage social interaction. But this kind of green living doesn't come cheap, with new Wintles homes on the market for up to $900,000, a far cry from the inclusive ideology behind archetypal hippy collectives. And that's the catch -- the more creature comforts and environmentally-friendly features are built into a home, the more expensive, and exclusive, it becomes. Inherent to eco communities is their small scale. Not only does it provide the social glue that holds them together, it allows communal facilities and equipment, such as lawnmowers, to be shared, reducing the community's carbon footprint. But in a crowded world that size restriction limits how widespread these developments can become. While these communities will never be for everyone, Berger maintains co-housing is a model for the future. ""A lot of the basic concepts behind co-housing are applicable to larger housing developments,"" she says. ""Some of the principles could be woven in to conventional developments -- things like having the residential area car free, having a common house where you can eat communally from time to time, hold events, and have a children's room and games room for teenagers. ""Also, having offices for home working means you're meeting government objectives about reducing carbon footprints and living more sustainably.""","More people are choosing to live sustainably in eco communities .

"(CNN) -- A former Libyan military officer who fought against ex-leader Moammar Gadhafi's troops last year was picked to head the country's armed forces, a move that comes as tensions flare among rival militias. The interim National Transitional Council chose Youssef Mangoush to be chief of staff of the country's armed forces Tuesday. Mangoush was a member of Libya's special forces and had been retired for years. He worked as a field commander in the battles against Gadhafi's battalions in February. He was arrested in al-Brega in April by Gadhafi forces. Born in Benghazi in 1950, he enrolled in military school in 1970 and specialized in anti-armor weaponry. He worked in different locations in Libya and fought in Libya's war in Chad, which ended in the 1980s. Mangoush was also a lecturer and instructor in Libya's military school. Dirk Vandewalle, an associate professor of government and an expert on Libya at Dartmouth College, said he believes the government was looking for a top military figure who can ""straddle difficulties"" and 'bridge the gap"" between different groups. ""My hunch is this is a compromise more than anyone else,"" he said. Four people died in clashes Tuesday in Libya's capital between militias from Tripoli and Misrata, officials said. The clashes were over control of a building that previously housed an intelligence center under Gadhafi, said Col. Abdul Monem al-Tunsi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. However, former rebels in Tripoli provided different, and conflicting, accounts of what caused the fighting -- meaning the motivations behind it remain unclear. David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, noted reports that Mangoush has ties to Misrata. Militias have a strong presence in Misrata, where fighting raged during last year's war between Gadhafi forces and rebels. He said Mangoush's appointment ""suggests or confirms just how bad and how dire the critical situation is regarding the militias."" He said the government isn't making headway on disarming militias and it is covering bases geographically to win over the loyalties of militia members and inspire confidence in the central government. ""His selection is reflective of the government's attempt to improve the situation, to encourage a process of disarmament,"" he said about Mangoush. Eric Wiebelhaus-Brahm, a lecturer in international affairs and political science at Florida State University, sees the choice as ""partially an attempt to reduce fighting between militias."" He says it's ""significant"" that he has links to Misrata. ""One could read that as being a sign to appease some of the militias that are from the area,"" Wiebelhaus-Brahm said. ""There is probably a calculation going on that he might be better able to bring some militias into the fold of a national army and reduce the factional fighting going on right now."" It's not the first time rival militias have clashed since the war ended, a possible reflection of mutual distrust that could pose a challenge to the nation's new leadership. In November, dozens of fighters clashed at a Tripoli hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the city since the country was declared liberated. While there were no deaths from gunshots, medical staff said three patients at the hospital died of stress-related causes linked to the fighting. In December, government officials met to discuss the infighting. Residents of many Libyan cities, especially Tripoli, are increasingly frustrated, with their streets awash with weapons and armed men who do not answer to a central command. Former fighters complained to CNN about a lack of jobs and support from the National Transitional Council. Interim government officials have said they will help freedom fighters and incorporate them into the security forces. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Youssef Mangoush had been in the military under Moammar Gadhafi .

"(EW.com ) -- Back in 1977, Ron Howard made his directorial debut with a low-budget, high-octane car-crash comedy called ""Grand Theft Auto."" As first impressions go, it did not signal the second coming of Orson Welles. But the freckle-faced former ""Happy Days"" star radiated an infectious delight in smashing as many roaring muscle cars as he could get away with. Since then, of course, Howard has become one of Hollywood's most consistent and respected filmmakers, crafting well-made crowd-pleasers that tackle more highbrow subjects. But judging from his white-knuckle new film, ""Rush,"" he hasn't outgrown his youthful sweet tooth for four-wheeled mayhem. He still has hot rods and the death-defying men who drive them on his mind. Based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One racing legends James Hunt and Niki Lauda, ""Rush"" is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered-flag goal: winning the 1976 world championship. Chris Hemsworth draws the flashier role in Hunt, a fast-burning British bad boy with flowing blond locks, silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel, and a rakish playboy swagger. On and off the track, he's wild, cocky, and undisciplined — a deadly combination when you're strapped into a coffin on wheels going 170 miles an hour. ''The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel,'' Hemsworth's Hunt says. And it's thanks to the ""Thor"" star's champagne-spraying charisma that he makes risking your neck look like the coolest job on the planet. As Lauda, ""Inglourious Basterds'"" Daniel Brühl buries his boyish good looks behind ratlike prosthetic teeth. With his clipped Austrian accent, everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like a brusque insult. And it usually is. He may not be a particularly likable fellow, but he's a methodical grinder with the unshakable conviction of someone who's calculated the odds on what it takes to win. Pitted against each other, they're like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. It's not just about beating the other guy, it's about humiliating him in the process. EW: 'Rush': Olivia Wilde, Chris Hemsworth in high-octane scene . Howard's film is at its best when the rubber meets the road. ""Rush"" traces the thrilling, neck-and-neck 1976 season from start to finish, hopscotching from Brazil to Monaco to Japan. Even though the film hurtles from one exotic locale to the next, the speedway sequences never feel repetitive — and they never let up on the gas. More than in any racing movie since 1966's ""Grand Prix,"" the action scenes capture the daredevil kick of sitting in the cramped, claustrophobic cockpit of a Ferrari, zipping around hairpin turns as tires squeal and engines roar. Things aren't quite as thrilling off the track. When they're not putting the pedal to the metal, Lauda and Hunt are painted as broad archetypes — the bad and the beautiful. It doesn't help that both men are given a perfunctory love interest (Olivia Wilde for Hemsworth and Alexandra Maria Lara for Brühl), neither of whom feels fleshed out or is given much to do other than look worried. They're as much spectators as the fans in the stands. It's only in the last third of the film that Hunt and Lauda become flesh-and-blood human beings instead of videogame avatars. Jockeying with each other to become the leader in the standings, the two men arrive at Germany's Nürburgring track, where drizzly conditions prove why the harrowing course is called the Graveyard. Lauda, ahead in points, argues that it's too dangerous to race and that the event should be canceled, while Hunt uses his back-slapping charm to get the other drivers to vote Lauda down. Naturally, disaster follows as Lauda, barely able to see through his rain-soaked visor, crashes in a grisly fireball, horrifically burning his face and lungs. As he struggles to recover in the hospital, Hunt closes in on first place, which in turn fuels his enemy to rehabilitate faster and return to battle. The thought of a man covered in monstrous third-degree scars wincing in agony as he pulls his racing helmet over his head so that he can get back behind the wheel may sound insane. But as both Howard and millions of racing fans around the world know, it's also compelling human drama. ""Rush"" hits a few potholes, but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they're cheating death. Grade: B . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner will undergo surgery on Tuesday morning, days after doctors discovered she had a blood clot on the surface of her brain. Over the weekend, doctors diagnosed Fernandez with a subdural hematoma and said she needed to take a month off of work. But the president's medical plan changed after she felt a tingling sensation in her left arm on Sunday and an exam detected that she had lost some muscle strength in the limb, hospital officials said in a statement released by the presidency. That's when doctors at the Favaloro Foundation decided to operate and remove the clot, the statement said. During Fernandez's absence, Vice President Amado Boudou is serving as Argentina's interim president. A subdural hematoma is a blood clot on the brain's surface beneath its outer covering, called the dura. Often, in people over 60, a brain trauma can cause the blood vessels in the brain to tear and blood to clot. In August, Fernandez, 60, suffered a cranial trauma, for which doctors conducted a brain scan and found normal results with no symptoms at the time, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said Saturday. Doctors at the Buenos Aires-based Favaloro Foundation discovered the hematoma on Saturday after a neurological evaluation, he said. According to Argentina's constitution, the vice president would assume the presidency temporarily in the president's absence. But officials have not yet announced whether that will occur. In a televised speech Monday, Vice President Amado Boudou said the situation was similar to the time when Fernandez temporarily handed presidential powers over to him when she underwent surgery in January 2012 to remove her thyroid. ""This phase of 30 days is exactly the same,"" he said. ""There is no question or uncertainty, no strange question. She is taking her rest, a rest that she needs, and also that she deserves. ... And the key is to keep governing. And that is what she has asked of us. And that is what you will find the whole team of the president doing, governing.""

"(CNN) -- Warner Bros.' $100 million Alfonso Cuarón-directed thriller Gravity blasted off on its opening weekend at the box office, scoring a stunning $55.6 million from 3,575 theaters. The sci-fi title, which stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, set a new October opening weekend record, surpassing Paranormal Activity 3's $52.6 million debut in 2011. Gravity also marks the best-ever debut for both of its stars, beating Bullock's $39.1 million start for this summer's The Heat (talk about having a great year at the box office!) and Clooney's $42.9 million debut for Batman & Robin in 1997. And to put a cherry on top of Warner Bros.' incredible weekend, audiences issued Gravity an excellent ""A-"" CinemaScore grade, which will yield great word-of-mouth for weeks to come. The film played to a much broader audience than most young-male-dominated sci-fi films. Crowds were 54 percent male and 46 percent female, and 59 percent were above the age of 35. 3-D showings accounted for a whopping 80 percent of the film's weekend gross (bucking the downward trend 3-D has faced this year and proving that audiences will pay for the format if they feel it's worth it). IMAX tickets made up 20 percent of revenue — because if there's one thing that looks great on a big screen, it's outer space. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 dropped 37 percent in its second weekend to $21.5 million, which gives the animated title a $60.6 million total after 10 days. Sony spent $78 million on the saucy sequel and wisely scheduled it away from other family competition, which should allow it to thrive throughout October. (By comparison, films like Turbo and The Smurfs 2 got choked out this summer while competing with each other and Despicable Me 2 and Monsters University.) The next animated film to arrive in theaters, Free Birds, won't come out until Nov. 1. Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake faltered in third place with their new crime drama Runner Runner, which earned a weak $7.6 million in its first three days. Both stars are hotter than ever: Affleck, after winning an Oscar for Argo and landing the Batman role in Warner Bros.' upcoming Man of Steel sequel, and Timberlake, after hitting No. 1 with his comeback album The 20/20 Experience, the sequel to which is projected to be the No. 1 album this week. But nothing about Runner Runner inspired crowds to check it out in theaters. Audiences issued the poorly reviewed film, which cost Fox about $30 million, a weak ""C"" CinemaScore grade. Prisoners and Rush made up the rest of the Top 5. Prisoners fell 48 percent to $5.7 million, giving the Hugh Jackman vehicle a $47.9 million total against a $46 million budget. The film earned excellent reviews, but has had trouble holding on to audiences due to the arrival of Rush, Don Jon, and Gravity — three well-reviewed dramas attracting attention. Fortunately, Prisoners is holding on better than one of those films, Rush, which fell 56 percent this weekend to $4.4 million. The Formula One racing drama starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by Ron Howard has now earned $18.1 million total and will fall short of its $38 million budget. 1. Gravity -- $55.6 million . 2. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 -- $21.5 million . 3. Runner Runner -- $7.6 million . 4. Prisoners -- $5.7 million . 5. Rush -- $4.4 million .

"(Hong Kong) (CNN) -- Hong Kong authorities confiscated $3.4 million ($26.7 million in Hong Kong currency) worth of ivory found in two shipping containers this week. The illegal goods weighed more than 8,000 pounds, making it one of the biggest seizures of ivory in Hong Kong. The containers arrived from Tanzania and Kenya, according to Hong Kong customs officials. The agency seized a total of 1,209 pieces of ivory tusks and three pounds of ivory ornaments from the two containers. Hong Kong Customs was on alert after a tip-off from Guangdong officials in China. On October 16, Hong Kong officers inspected a container from Tanzania claiming to carry plastic scrap and found $1.7 million worth of ivory. A day later, a second container from Kenya was seized with ivory valued at $1.7 million, according to Hong Kong Customs. Seven people, including one Hong Kong resident, have been arrested by Chinese authorities in connection to the cases, said a customs spokeswoman. Hong Kong is viewed as a transit point for the illegal ivory trade, feeding into increasing demands in China, according to a Time article published this week. Elephants are being killed in Africa at an alarming rate as international demand soars for ivory. Much of the demand comes from increasingly affluent Asian countries, particularly China and Thailand.

"(CNN) -- The 6-year-old boy swallowed whole in an Indiana sand dune over the weekend could make a full recovery, a medical official said Monday. Rescuers dug furiously for three and a half hours to extract little Nathan Woessner, who was recovered unconscious and rushed to the University of Chicago Medicine's Comer Children's Hospital. But Tracy Koogler, medical director at the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit, said doctors are signaling progress and possibly a full recovery. The boy is on a ventilator, she said, and is breathing at the capacity of a moderate intensive-care-unit pneumonia patient. He could have his breathing tube out later this week and could be out of the hospital in 10 days to two weeks with rehabilitation to follow, Koogler said. It's unclear what kind of lasting health issues he may have. Authorities have said they don't believe Nathan suffered brain damage from a lack of oxygen and there were no significant injuries to his eyes. A single air pocket in the dune may have saved his life, officials said. At present, doctors are trying to clear sand from his lungs. A family outing turned nightmare . The boy and his family had gone Friday to Mount Baldy Beach at Indiana Dunes National Park, in the northwestern corner of the state. It was a day meant to be a fun family vacation at the beach on the Lake Michigan shoreline. Pastor Don Reul, Nathan's grandfather, said his daughter and son-in-law went with another couple and their children. The incident occurred after the fathers decided to climb Mount Baldy. Nathan and a friend followed. Then the unexpected happened: sounds of screams and a boy lost in the sand. Nathan had stepped in a sinkhole, and a friend yelled to the fathers that the child was gone, the grandfather said. The fathers frantically tried to dig him out, but the more they dug, the deeper Nathan seemed to sink in the 11-foot mound. A call for help went out immediately. Rescuers stay focused . 911 Operator: 9-1-1. Caller: I'm at the Mount Baldy Beach. And my friend's son, he got stuck in the sand dune, and he's like under the sand and they can't get him out. 911 Operator: OK, can anybody see him or is he completely covered by sand? Caller: Uh, yes. My husband and his dad are trying to dig him out. Dozens of first responders rushed to the scene with shovels in hand. Heavy excavation equipment also was called in. They raced against the clock. ""There was lots and lots of guys hand digging, trying to expose him making sure nobody was going to hurt him or anything with any equipment,"" one of the rescuers, Rich Elm, told CNN affiliate WNDU. An hour went by. Then another. ""We were really losing hope fast, and we tried to just stay focused,"" Michigan City firefighter Brad Kreighbaum told CNN affiliate WSBT. ""The first two hours was complete misery."" More than three and a half hours later, signs of life. Nathan was cold and appeared lifeless but had a heartbeat. He was trapped vertically in the sand. ""One minute you're thinking, 'We don't know what we're going to have,' and you're thinking the worst. Then you're hoping for the best,"" Elm said. ""Once I had a hold of his head,"" Kreighbaum said, ""I was ... just talking to him, you know, just like I would talk to my own son."" 'Never heard of anything like this' Park rangers do not know what caused the hole. Mount Baldy is the tallest moving sand dune in the national lakeshore, according to the National Park Service. Half-buried trees show its shifting nature. ""I've been a park ranger here at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore since 1991, and I've never heard of anything like this here or at other sand dune parks,"" Park Ranger Bruce Rowe told WNDU.

"(CNN) -- Stop stripping. Stop letting yourself be ""pimped."" And for heaven's sake, stop licking sledgehammers, Miley. That's the advice from Irish singer Sinead O'Connor, who's penned a motherly, if expletive-laden open letter to former Disney star Miley Cyrus in the wake of a controversial video music awards show performance and the video for her latest single, ""Wrecking Ball."" ""Nothing but harm will come in the long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited, and it is absolutely NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent,"" the 46-year-old singer says in the letter posted on her official website. Confessions of pop's wildest child . Cyrus, 20, was the subject of widespread scorn in August, when she danced provocatively in a skimpy outfit during MTV's Video Music Awards show. Soon after, she released the video for her latest single, in which she rides a wrecking ball while nude and suggestively licks a sledgehammer. Gauging reaction to Sinead O'Connor's open letter to Miley Cyrus . ""I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any way 'cool' to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos,"" O'Connor wrote. ""It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether it's the music business or yourself doing the pimping."" In a Rolling Stone article, Cyrus compared her look in the ""Wrecking Ball"" video to O'Connor's style in her iconic 1990 video for ""Nothing Compares 2 U."" But O'Connor said she chose the shaved-head look in direct defiance of music industry executives who wanted her to present a sexier appearance. Miley and Liam's engagement is off .

One made apparent references to O'Connor's previous struggles with mental illness, and the other showed a picture of O'Connor tearing up a picture of Pope John Paul II in 1992.

"(CNN) -- Buggy websites, long hold times and other glitches have marred the first two days of the long-awaited rollout of open enrollment for Obamacare health-care coverage. Blame the gawkers, at least in part, health-care experts said Wednesday. ""I think a lot of people trying to get on were just curious, like me,"" said Drexel University health policy expert Robert Field. ""Once that initial curiosity dies down and it's just people who need policies, you'll see much less traffic."" In the 24 hours after its launch, more than 4.7 million people have visited the federal website providing signups in 34 states, Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Tuesday. Government officials haven't said how many have actually signed up. ""We expect to see similar volume as yesterday, and while this overwhelming interest is continuing to cause wait times, there will be continuing improvements in the coming hours and days,"" Peters said. States running their own exchanges reported high traffic volumes as well, suggesting that the problems were related to the intense traffic: Too many people had bellied up to the virtual service counter, and the hardware dedicated to sending webpages to users' computers couldn't make out the questions for all the shouting. The effect is similar to, if less nefarious than, a common attack used by hackers to bring down websites: sending so much traffic its way that servers slow or even shut down. 'Too many people' Such problems do not mean, as some Republican critics of the health plan have said, that Obamacare is already a failure, said Michael Doonan, an assistant professor at Brandeis University and a former program specialist with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services who also served on President Bill Clinton's health-care task force. ""It's a technical problem, too many people coming in,"" he said. The exchanges are complex technological systems that require a lot of interplay between agencies, and there's only so much engineers can do to test a system before opening it to the public, he said. ""You really need to test them in real time and then backfill with some of the things you really need to get them to work,"" Doonan said. Peters said the department is ""working to speed up the process"" and expects enrollment times to drop ""in the coming hours."" Obstructionism? There's no evidence, Field said, that political opposition to the plan has had any negative effect on enrollment. The federal government is operating the exchange in 34 states, many of which refused to participate because of political opposition to the plan. In Georgia, for instance, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens as saying at a private political gathering in July that state leaders were doing ""everything in our power to be an obstructionist."" According to Georgia Health News, the state is one of 15 that passed laws to regulating the work of patient advisers, or navigators, called for in the health-care law. But Field said such efforts, which could hinder efforts to reach people who may not be aware of the program or don't have access to a computer, wouldn't have played any role in the glitches seen by enrollment websites the past two days. And Bill Rencher, who just passed the test to become a navigator in Georgia on Wednesday, said such efforts aren't having any effect on getting word out about the program. He predicted no problems signing up for anyone who wants coverage before the December 15 deadline to get coverage on January 1. Consumers have until March 15 to sign up for coverage beginning in April. Just wait . Federal and many state officials in charge of the plans have suggested that consumers wait until the initial rush dies down before trying to shop for coverage. Meanwhile, Republicans -- locked with congressional Democrats and the president over efforts to eliminate the health reform program -- seized on the glitches as evidence that it has already failed. ""We have been warned time and time again that Obamacare is not ready for prime time. Well, it turns out that is right,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, said Tuesday. But Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said Wednesday that it's only natural to expect ""some bumps in the road, glitches maybe, some problems with the website."" President Barack Obama said as much Tuesday, noting that technology giant Apple had suffered glitches with its new smartphone operating system. ""I don't remember anybody suggesting Apple should stop selling iPhones or iPads,"" he said.","Problems accessing Obamacare insurance exchange sites stem from big demand, experts say .
There's no evidence political opposition to the plan has played any role, they say .
Advocates suggest waiting to apply for insurance .
Republicans say glitches prove health reform isn't ready ."
"(CNN) -- Eight soldiers were killed in an ambush near the Algerian border, Tunisia's president said Monday. The attack took place on Mount Chaambi, some 300 kilometers south of Tunis, the capital, President Moncef Marzouki said in a statement posted to his Facebook page. Later, a security patrol was struck by a landmine in the same area. Three soldiers were injured in that attack. Marzouki blamed Islamic militants and extremists for the violence. He announced three days of mourning for the victims. Last week, a Tunisian opposition leader was fatally shot outside his home, setting off protests in a nation still raw from the February assassination of a different politician who opposed the Islamist-led governing party. The slaying of Mohammed Al-Brahmi and the public's reaction were the latest bout of turmoil striking the North African country that had been seen as a poster child of stability after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.","Attack takes place near the Algerian border .

"(CNN) -- When the time rolls around for Kelly Bleyer's annual mammogram, she hears two voices in her head: her gynecologist, who says she absolutely must have a mammogram every single year, and her father-in-law, who urges her to get a mammogram every other year instead. While most women would listen to their gynecologist, Kelly's father-in-law isn't just anyone: He's the co-author of a new mammography study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and he says he believes passionately that mammograms might be making women sick -- maybe even killing them. ""I really don't know what to do,"" says Bleyer, 50, an anchor and health reporter at KBND radio in Bend, Oregon. ""I feel so conflicted."" 'Mammography is not perfect' Dr. Archie Bleyer knows his advice to his daughter-in-law is controversial, even heretical in a society where pink ribbons on everything from billboards to yogurt containers remind women to get their annual mammograms. Here's his reasoning: His study suggests that nearly one out of every three women diagnosed with breast cancer has a tumor that is so tiny and growing so slowly it would never cause any problems even if it weren't treated. The problem is doctors can't tell in advance whether a tumor will be harmless or deadly, so they have to treat them all, and some of those treatments, such as chemothreapy, can increase a woman's risk for leukemia and other diseases. ""We're mortals, and we're still trying to figure this out,"" says Bleyer, clinical research professor at the department of radiation medicine at the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. The new study also finds that mammograms aren't catching some truly dangerous tumors that later turn out to become advanced cancer. Mammograms are supposed to catch breast cancer early, but after 30 years of aggressive mammography, advanced breast cancer rates haven't gone down at all, according to Bleyer's study. Breast cancer prevention: What every woman should know . ""This study brings to light what we've already known for some time, which is that mammography is not perfect,"" says Chandini Portteus, vice president of research, evaluation and scientific programs at Susan G. Komen for the Cure. Study: More than 1 million women 'overdiagnosed' Bleyer's study, written with Dr. Gilbert Welch at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, examined national data on mammograms from 1976 to 2008. They found that during this time, twice as many cases of early-stage breast cancer were caught -- but they estimate that 31% of those cancers were slow-growing and never would have made the woman sick. Breast cancer was ""overdiagnosed"" in 1.3 million women over the past 30 years -- 70,000 women in 2008 alone, according to the study. ""That's a lot of women, and that's a problem,"" Bleyer says. The study also found that as mammograms grew in popularity, the death rate from breast cancer went down 28% in women over age 40, but the study authors said that was largely due to better treatment, not mammograms. Tough choices in fight against breast cancer gene . The study has already caused controversy. The American College of Radiology issued a statement saying the report was ""deeply flawed and misleading"" -- a claim the study authors refute. Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said while ""overdiagnosis is a matter deserving of attention,"" the study's conclusions ""must be viewed with caution."" What's a woman to do? Given all this, should women have mammograms every year after age 40, as currently recommended by most health organizations, or start having them every other year? Kelly Bleyer said after much thought, she's decided to follow the advice of her gynecologist and not her father-in-law. ""I'll keep having a mammogram every year -- my insurance covers it, and I know how my doctor feels about it,"" she says. ""But I'm open to hearing more about what the science says. I think I could live with having it every other year."" Here are some tips for making your own decision about how often to have mammograms: . 1. Learn the mammogram guidelines . Susan G. Komen for the Cure, the American Cancer Society and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend women get mammograms every year starting at age 40. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advises women to get mammograms every other year starting at 50. 2. Know your family history . Screening recommendations are different for certain groups, such as women with a family history of breast cancer and women who've tested positive for breast cancer genes. See the links above for recommendations. 3. Find out about other screening tools besides mammograms . Ultrasounds, MRIs, breast self-exams and exams performed by your doctor can all be used in addition to mammograms. See the links above. 4. Keep in mind that mammograms miss many cancers . Don't have a false sense of security just because you've had a mammogram. Mammograms miss about one in five breast cancers, according to the American Cancer Society. 5. Realize mammograms catch some cancers that might not ever make you sick . This study found that 31% of newly diagnosed breast cancers never would have caused any harm; other studies say it's more like 10% to 20%. Whatever the real percentage is, when you go in for a mammogram, realize that it might pick up a harmless tumor, but you're going to have to get treatment for it anyway since doctors can't yet discern a harmful from a harmless cancer. ""You should go into this with your eyes open,"" says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and CNN cancer expert.","A new study suggests mammograms find some tumors that wouldn't be a problem .
But those tumors must be treated as doctors don't know which ones are harmless .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Elizabeth Fry's likeness was bumped from the British £5 note in favor of Winston Churchill, it led to a public outcry and the announcement on Wednesday that Jane Austen's likeness would be added to the £10 note. True, the queen, as the country's monarch, appears on British bills. But historical figures have been included on bank notes for decades. The vast majority have been men. In the United States, there is no shortage of notable women, but bank notes haven't been updated since 1929, nine years after women gained the right to vote. All of the paper money in the United States features men -- nine presidents, two former treasury secretaries and one Benjamin Franklin. There's only ever been one woman featured on a piece of paper American money. That was Martha Washington, who appeared on the ""silver certificates"" in 1886, 1891, and 1896, according to Lydia Washington, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Printing and Engraving. There has never been an African American of either gender. Washington explained that U.S. law gives power over the faces on bills to the treasury secretary. That's Jack Lew, whose signature is featured on bank notes. It's official: Jack Lew's new signature . Being dead is the only technical requirement to appear on a bank note, but presidents have taken up most of the real estate, although there are exceptions, like Franklin, the Renaissance man and founding father who appears on the $100 bill. A newly redesigned ""Benjamin"" with enhanced security features, raised printing and additional colors that shift in the light is set to enter circulation in October. But it will keep the portrait of Franklin. Here's more from Washington's explanation of how the current faces got onto American dollars: . ""The figures that currently appear on U.S. currency were chosen in 1929 when the size of currency was reduced and standardized. Prior to the adoption of this smaller sized currency, a special committee was appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to study this aspect of the design. It was determined that portraits of presidents of the United States have a more permanent familiarity in the minds of the public than any others."" ""This decision was somewhat altered by the secretary of the treasury to include Alexander Hamilton, who was the first secretary of the treasury; Salmon P. Chase, who was secretary of the treasury during the Civil War and is credited with promoting our National Banking System; and Benjamin Franklin, who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. ""Records do not indicate the exact reasons why the portraits of these statesmen were chosen in preference to others of equal stature and importance, but all three were well known to the American public. "" Washington didn't have anything to offer in response to the ascendance of Jane Austen to the £10 note. ""In regards to the currency of other countries, we do not comment. Other countries do what they deem appropriate for their regions and social circumstances,"" Washington wrote. Here is more information on currency at Bureau of Printing and Engraving website. Currency, it should be said, is distinguishable from coins, which are produced by the U.S. Mint. Women have a better record when it comes to coins. Helen Keller was put on the Alabama-themed quarter in 2003. Sacagawea, the Native American who guided Lewis and Clark on their cross-country expedition, is on dollar coins produced since 1999. Susan B. Anthony, the suffragette, was on dollar coins produced from 1979 to 1981. Up in Canada, their $100 bill isn't paper, it's some kind of fancy plastic, but it does have a woman on it. She's supposed to be anonymous and represent Canadian medical innovation. But a woman looking into a microscope does bear some resemblance to British scientist Rosalind Franklin, who photographed the DNA double helix. Side note: There was a Rosalind Franklin-themed Google Doodle running on Thursday, her birthday. There doesn't appear to be any sort of national movement to put a woman on a piece of paper money, but if there were, who should it be? Leave your suggestions in the comments below.","Bumping woman from £5 note for Churchill caused outcry, Jane Austen on £10 note as make-good .

"(CNN) -- The federal government has shut down for the first time since 1996 and all eyes are focused on House Speaker John Boehner. Will he continue to insist upon tying a repeal or delay of Obamacare to a funding bill? Or will he bring the Senate-passed funding bill to the House floor and hope that he can convince 17 Republicans to join hands with the chamber's 200 Democrats and vote to re-open the federal government? It all depends on whether he chooses to follow or ignore the Hastert Rule. The choice isn't an easy one, as his speakership quite likely hangs in the balance. The Hastert Rule is named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert, who did not bring bills to the floor unless those bills were supported by a majority of House Republicans. It is not a formal rule, but rather a promise to uphold the will of a majority of the majority. House Republicans expected Boehner to uphold the rule and he pledged to do so. But the shutdown and the upcoming showdown over raising the debt limit underscore Boehner's leadership dilemma -- almost any bill that a majority of House Republicans support is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Fewer laws were passed in the last Congress than in any Congress since 1861, and based on the number of floor votes taken so far this year, the current Congress is on track to be even less productive. It is also the most partisan Congress since the Civil War era. As the shutdown gets under way, many are looking for signs of what kind of leader Boehner will be. Instead, they should consider what kind of leader he can be, given the political hand he's been dealt. Gone are the days of House speakers plying members with promises of pork and campaign money. Earmarks have been banned, most incumbents do their own fundraising, and for many of the chamber's newer members, ideology trumps party loyalty. The electoral landscape doesn't help. In 1995-96, when the federal government last shut down, 34% of House Republicans represented districts that Bill Clinton won in 1992. Today, just 7% of House Republicans come from districts that President Obama won last year. There is almost no electoral incentive for these members to compromise. The bottom line is that Boehner's arsenal is limited. He is hamstrung by the very institution and members he is supposed to lead. So what are Boehner's options at this point? He could, as he has done previously, pass a funding bill on the backs of House Democrats. The 2011 and 2012 omnibus spending bills, the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the 2012 Payroll Tax Bill all passed the House because of Democratic support. And earlier this year, Boehner brought the Violence Against Women Act and the Hurricane Sandy Relief bill to the floor, despite opposition from a majority of House Republicans. These bills had bipartisan support in the Senate, making it difficult for Boehner to dig his heels in and stand behind his conservative majority. Flash forward to now. What is the House speaker's calculus, given that the Senate passed its funding bill on a party-line vote? Absent the pressure to appease Republican senators, Boehner will have a tough time justifying any move to defy the will of his party's majority. Convincing House Republicans to pass the Senate's funding bill and re-open the federal government will require him to lead in a way that may not be possible, should he wish to remain speaker. No House speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party. And no speaker wants to go down in history for presiding over one of the most unproductive Congresses in history. But these are Boehner's choices. While Hastert relied on a majority of the majority, Boehner has had to rely on a minority of the majority, together with a majority of the minority, to pass important legislation. The ""Boehner Rule"" is hardly the stuff to which great leaders aspire. It may, however, prove more productive than following the lead of his majority. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marian Currinder and Josh Huder.","The federal government has shut down for the first time since 1996 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- While many films spend a brief period in the spotlight before fading into obscurity, there are some which seem to grow increasingly powerful over time. Nora Aunor stars in ""Himala"" as Elsa, a young girl who changes everyone's lives when she reveals her connection to the Virgin Mary. Lost Filipino classic ""Himala,"" is one such film that looks set for a revival over two decades after it was first released. Web site users voted to award the late Filipino director Ishmael Bernal's film the top prize in the CNN APSA Viewers Choice Award for Best Asia-Pacific Film of All Time, edging Akira Kurosawa's acknowledged classic ""Seven Samurai"" into second place. This comes as a late but significant accomplishment for the film which was made in 1982. ""Himala"" has won numerous awards in its native Philippines and remains the first and only Filipino film to have been shown in competition at the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival. ""Himala,"" which means ""miracle"" in the Filipino language Tagalog, tells the story of a poor provincial girl named Elsa who claims to have seen the Virgin Mary and then demonstrates the ability to cure the sick. She takes on the persona of a saint, and her sudden fame brings about a rush of changes in her community, for both better and worse. Scriptwriter Ricky Lee, based his story on a real incident on Cabra Island, in Mindoro Occidental, Philippines. In the late 1960s, reports of a young girl who had experienced visions of the Virgin Mary attracted salvation-seeking pilgrims and curious tourists in droves. Lee wanted to create an unflinching depiction of the place of faith and religion in desperate and unforgiving times. Producer Charo Santos-Conci's first impression of the script was that the subject matter hit close to home for the Filipinos, who are mostly Catholic. ""This was a representation of how much faith really runs in the blood of the Filipinos,"" he said, ""We're a very poor country and I think it's such a relief for us to know that this strong faith in each one of us is [what's] guiding us and propelling us to face all the challenges."" Lee and Bernal also collaborated closely, continuing to work on Lee's original script, reworking the film's characters to make them as real as possible. Filming was completed in just a month in the arid, desolate area of Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines, on a meager budget of just over $60,000. Ilocos locals with no acting experience were hired as extras to cut costs, and Lee remembers them as a genuinely wretched bunch who ""knew how it was to suffer"" and ""to pray for a miracle."" Lee had insisted on having actress Nora Aunor, who was 29-years-old at the time, in the lead role. Apart from the rising star's talent, he saw parallels with Elsa in her. ""Her relationship with her fans was almost like the relationship of Elsa with her followers in the film and so I thought that it was a very strange and mysterious,"" says Lee. And to add a supernatural twist to the film's history, Aunor says that she had dreamt of the Virgin Mary on the night before the part of Elsa was offered to her. Since then Aunor has become one of the Philippines' biggest superstars, though ""Himala"" is still considered her finest work. Your say: which classic movies do you think should be resurrected? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. In her character's final speech in ""Himala"", which both Lee and Santos-Conci say is their favorite scene, she resolutely confesses to a motley crowd of worshippers that ""there is no miracle."" After telling the people to seek the truth within themselves, she is assassinated by a faceless follower. ""Long after the film was shown, I would talk to university students and they would always ask, 'So, who killed Elsa?'"" says Lee of the climactic ending, which underwent several on-set rewrites. ""And I always tell them that in the end, we killed her. In the end, we killed Elsa. In the end, people could not bear to hear the truth from her because they wanted to survive."" Lee believes the film's message is still relevant today, particularly for Filipinos, because it confronts how easily people attach their faith to almost anything they think might ease their suffering in times of hardship and despair. Whatever it is that audiences see in ""Himala's"" unique story, it would certainly seem that it is finally gaining the recognition it deserves.","Triumph for film at international awards ceremony after more than two decades .

"(CNN) -- When the average person contemplates the issues surrounding landfills, it's doubtful they give much consideration to the tons of food that fill them. Food biodegrades so where is the problem? The problem, environmentalists say, is just that. When food rots, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says is 20 times more damaging to the environment than carbon dioxide (CO2). Rotting food in a landfill in Canterbury, England. The developed world chucks out a lot of food. Such is the volume that according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), if just 5 percent of Americans' food scraps were recovered it would represent one day's worth of food for 4 million people. The U.N. World Food Programme offers another way of looking at it: It says the total surplus of the U.S. alone could satisfy ""every empty stomach"" in Africa (France's leftovers could feed the Democratic Republic of Congo; and Italy's could feed Ethiopia's undernourished). Proportionately, the UK and Japan have traditionally been among the worst offenders worldwide in recent years when it comes to food waste, discarding between 30 and 40 percent of their food produce annually. The figures for how much the U.S. throws out, however, vary considerably depending on whom you ask. According to the USDA, just over a quarter of the country's food -- about 25.9 million tons -- gets thrown in the garbage can every year. But according to a study conducted by the University of Arizona, that figure could be as high as 50 percent, as the University claims that the country's supermarkets, restaurants and convenience stores alone throw out 27 million tons between them every year (representing $30 billion of wasted food). Either way, it still costs the U.S. around $1 billion every year just to dispose of all its food waste, according to the EPA. But moral and economic issues aside, it is the environmental concerns around food waste that is driving the push for reform on how to treat the problem of leftovers. Methane, the gas food waste produces, traps 23 times as much heat in the atmosphere as the same amount of CO2, the EPA says. And landfills are the place you will find most of it -- they account for 34 percent of all methane emissions in the U.S. The University of Arizona believes that if Americans cut their food waste in half, it would reduce the country's environmental impact by 25 percent. The UK's Waste & Resources Action Program (WRAP) -- which says the entire food supply chain in the UK contributes 20 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions -- believes that if we stopped throwing out edible food, the impact it would have on CO2 emissions would be the equivalent of taking 1 in 5 cars off the road. But ironically, one of the solutions to dealing with food waste actually results in a product that could keep cars on the road: Biogas. Biogas is a by-product of a process called anaerobic digestion (AD). AD is a process where organic matter -- such as food waste -- breaks down in an environment with little or no oxygen, generating a natural gas made up of 60 percent methane and 40 percent CO2. It is the exact process, in fact, which goes on in landfills. But there is a difference. Whereas methane can be harmful to the environment in an open setting, such as a landfill, in controlled and closed settings such as a combined heat and power plant, it can be harnessed and converted into biogas, a renewable energy. And that energy can be used to provide heat, light and fuel. According to a study by the National Society for Clean Air, biogas-fueled cars can reduce CO2 emissions by anything from 75 percent to 200 percent compared to cars powered by fossil fuels. Most organic matter can be processed with AD. In the UK it is already being used to treat sewage, which Friends of the Earth (FOE) says, reduces CO2 emissions by 16 percent compared to traditional sewage treatments. According to the Chartered Institute for Environmental Health, gas from sewage waste and landfills is already being used to provide 650 MW of electricity to the UK's national grid, representing between 60 and 75 percent of the country's green energy (the UK is Europe's biggest producer of biogas). However, while the potential for food waste-as-energy seems big, the practical applications for it are currently very small (only 0.4 percent of the UK's food waste is processed by AD, for example), with critics of AD pointing out that the amount food waste can contribute to the energy supply are negligible to say the least. FOE itself admits that just 0.36 percent of the UK's electricity needs could be met by AD. And, if 5.5 million tons of food waste was treated by AD (the majority of the UK's annual 6.7 million tons of food waste) it could only generate enough electricity to power 164,000 houses. That being said, environmentalists will say, that's much better than getting that electricity from fossil fuels. And there has been a big push, in Europe in particular, to cut back on the amount of biodegradable waste that is being sent to landfills. According to the European Landfill Directive, the amount of biodegradable waste sent to landfills in member countries by 2020 must reach 35 percent of the levels reached in 1995. The country that is leading the way in putting its biodegradable waste mountains to good use -- particularly in the world of biogas-powered cars -- is Sweden. That country -- which plans to eliminate petrol and diesel vehicles from their streets by 2020 -- already has 7,000 biogas cars on the road. It also has 779 biogas buses and the world's first biogas train, which, according to The Ecologist, cost just 1 million euros ($1.4 million) to develop. E-mail to a friend .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- The Kentucky State Fair has its share of eye-popping choices: . *Deep fried Kool-Aid . *The Donut Burger, a heart-stopping marriage of Krispy Kreme and quarter pounder. *And this year, at the 50th annual Farm Bureau Country Ham Breakfast, a have to see it to believe it pairing: former foes Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul side by side, all smiles, eager to prove the Republican establishment and the tea party cannot only coexist, but can be allies. It wasn't too long ago that Paul, a freshman senator, was a thorn in McConnell's side -- defeating the Senate Republican leader's candidate of choice in the 2010 primary season that helped put the tea party on the map. As Paul surged late in that campaign, McConnell cut an ad for his choice, Kentucky's then-secretary of state. ""I know Trey Grayson and trust him. We need Trey's conservative leadership to help turn back the Obama agenda,"" McConnell said in the spot. Fast forward three years, and what you see is an awkward alliance that is in part the product of painful lessons McConnell has learned in recent years as tea party backed insurgents have knocked off GOP establishment figures in primaries, including one of McConnell's best friends in the Senate, Robert Bennett of Utah. At the State Fair event, McConnell delivered a forceful rebuke of President Barack Obama's health care plan. ""The solution to Obamacare is to pull it out root and branch."" McConnell told the breakfast moment's after Kentucky's Democratic governor praised the plan. McConnell, though, opposes a tea party backed plan to risk a government shutdown if that is what it takes to deny the president the funding necessary to implement the health care program. It is one of the issues highlighted by McConnell's tea party backed primary opponent, businessman Matt Bevin. And one of the issues where Team Mitch, as his campaign calls itself, hopes having tea party favorite Paul in his corner helps blunt Bevin's appeal. Bevin lands conservative endorsement . ""I think it is a dumb idea to shut down the government,"" Paul said in response to a question from CNN as he and McConnell met with reporters recently at the fair. The Bevin challenge is a case study in Tea Party 101. The litany of familiar complaints against the establishment rattled off in one early Bevin TV ad: . ""McConnell has voted for higher taxes, bailouts, debt ceiling increases, congressional pay raises, and liberal judges."" Bevin's chances likely depend on some big outside help, and some of the conservative groups who make their names taking on the GOP establishment are dipping their toes into the race now to get a sense of whether McConnell is truly vulnerable. ""Career Washington politician Mitch McConnell claims to be a conservative,"" is the opening line of one recent radio ad paid for by the Madison Project. The Kentucky primary is May 20, and given the early bruising tone, plus McConnell's national profile, there is no doubt this contest will shatter state spending records for Senate races. The matchup here is one of several testing the standing of veteran, establishment Republicans. GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, for example, are bracing for potentially tough challenges. Liz Cheney is running against incumbent GOP Sen. Mike Enzi in Wyoming. McConnell's campaign recently released its own polling showing a more than 40 point lead over Bevin. But he is running as if scared, mindful of the tea party surprises these past two election cycles. McConnell is already spending on TV ads, painting Bevin as a political opportunist. ""Bevins' company failed to pay taxes, then got a taxpayer bailout. Bailout Bevin, not a Kentucky conservative,"" blares one. Another focuses on a Bevin resume that appeared to suggest he graduated from Massachusetts Institute of Technology when, in reality, he participated in a short MIT seminar program for which all recipients received a certificate. ""Newspapers say Bevin was dishonest about his resume -- claiming to graduate from prestigious MIT,"" this McConnell ad declares. ""Not true."" McConnell hits opponent over LinkedIn profile . Some see evidence of McConnell's caution in the Syria debate now front and center in Congress. Of the four top leaders in Congress, McConnell is alone in not supporting the president's call for military strikes: GOP House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid are all on record backing action. McConnell issued a statement Tuesday saying he was still undecided. ""Congress and our constituents would all benefit from knowing more about what it is he thinks needs to be done â€” and can be accomplished â€” in Syria and the region,"" the GOP leader said after a White House meeting with the president. McConnell aides say his caution has nothing to do with the campaign. But Bevin is on record opposing military strikes against Syria, as is Paul -- and to take a position at odds with his primary rival and new ally would instantly make the Syria debate a campaign flashpoint. Paul to Obama: Don't rush into war in Syria . Democrats were already on record promising to make McConnell a top 2014 target, even though Kentucky hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since Wendell Ford won his last six-year term in 1992. Reid predicts McConnell loss . Secretary of State Alison Grimes is well aware of the history, and using her early months of the campaign to try to make the case she would be no rubber stamp for Obama. ""We have had trouble in our state identifying with the national Democratic Party,"" Grimes said in an interview. ""I will tell you I am running as a Kentuckian. ... I have my disagreements with the president."" Chief among them, she says, is an energy policy she called anti-coal. Grimes also favors changes to the health care law, but says it has many admirable pieces that should be kept. She is campaigning, at least for now, as someone who expects McConnell to survive the primary challenge. ""It's about ending the disease of dysfunction that we have seen in Washington, D.C.,"" she says of her campaign. ""And after nearly 30 years, Senator McConnell is at the center of it. He is to blame for the failed leadership."" McConnell's team labels Grimes as too liberal for the state and suggests the president's standing here would be a major drag. But the incumbent himself prefers not to deliver direct blows, just yet, leaving that, for the most part, to his team and TV ads. ""I like a good campaign,"" McConnell said after the fair breakfast. ""We are going to have a lot of fun.""","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces a tea party backed primary opponent in his 2014 reelection bid .

"(CNN) -- When a 324-pound Chelsea Settles moved to Los Angeles, she brought a bikini-clad mannequin along to inspire her to lose weight. Now, as the first season of ""Chelsea Settles"" unfolds on MTV, the mannequin in the 23-year-old reality star's bedroom is nothing more than a functional statement piece. Doubling as a coat rack and guitar stand -- ""It's definitely not what it was when I first started,"" Settles says. And Settles' reality show, originally marketed as a weight loss/transformation series, has progressed right along with her. The pilot, which focused on Settles' measurements and eating habits, gave way to less weight-fixated second and third episodes about a college graduate trying to make it in a new city. So why mention her weight at all? Failing to point out a plus-size character's weight is like -- for lack of a better idiom -- ignoring the elephant in the room, one TV insider said. But once weight is discussed, storylines can unfold naturally, allowing viewers to get to know the person behind the plus-size label. That's certainly been true for CBS's hit show ""Mike & Molly,"" which originally took heat for leaning on fat jokes. Now, in its second season, the sitcom draws laughs with family and relationship humor. ""Weight is so visual, it will always be part of the conversation,"" said Marie Leggette, the editor and founder of The Curvy Fashionista. ""['Chelsea Settles'] is kind of breaking the mold. ... Executives will play the angle they know the best to see the interest. From that feedback, they'll make the new ideas."" So is Hollywood evolving to be more accepting of the overweight? It certainly appears that way. In addition to Settles' show, ""Mike & Molly"" star Melissa McCarthy is enjoying quite the ride. McCarthy not only won an Emmy for her TV role, but she also snagged the hearts of fans with turns in the hit film ""Bridesmaids"" and a hosting gig on ""Saturday Night Live."" She's also sold a script to Paramount and a pilot script to CBS. Not to mention her planned plus-size clothing line. Marshall Eisen, executive producer for ""Chelsea Settles,"" said working on the Pennsylvania native's reality show reinforced the importance of approaching a series with an open mind. ""The project evolved from where we began,"" he said. ""After we started digging into Chelsea, and learning more about her -- her interests and where her story was going -- there was a lot more to talk about than just weight loss."" ""Focusing on who [Settles] really is as a person became the natural thing to do,"" Eisen added. So, despite her tough personal trainer and waning insecurities, Settles isn't the ""Mini Ruby"" people predicted she would be. Rather than letting weight dictate her every move, the series will begin focusing more on her transition into adulthood: Exploring a new city, breaking into a cutthroat industry, meeting new people and growing up. ""A strong segment of our audience is there right now,"" Eisen said of the network's demographic. ""She's struggling to find her way with the same hopes and dreams all of us have."" Sound familiar, Lauren Conrad? Though it wasn't the network's intention to create a more down-to-earth version of ""The Hills,"" Eisen said, ""People are picking up on it now and I totally get it. ... It's just a new way of showing a young woman trying to find her way, and trying to build a career in L.A., in a somewhat similar field."" One viewer who was originally turned off by the pilot episode is The Big Girl Blog's CeCe Olisa. ""She's stuffing her face with fast food in the first five minutes,"" Olisa said. ""Those shots are more appropriate for [a weight loss show]. Those shots don't have a lot to do with fashion."" And to her defense, ""The Hills"" wasn't exactly rife with footage of Conrad eating chicken nuggets outside the drive-thru. But, Olisa said, plus-size TV characters won't always be associated with things like consuming copious amounts of fast food. ""Sometimes people don't give the American public the benefit of the doubt,"" Olisa added, noting, there was a time when people didn't want to see men and women in the same bed. Another new show, ""Big Sexy,"" chronicles the lives of five plus-size women working in the fashion industry. It received mixed reviews when its first three episodes premiered on TLC in August and September. BET was just one outlet to pose the question: ""Is celebrating obesity really empowering or just undermining our health?"" Yet the show provides a more accurate portrayal of curvy women than most weight-loss shows, said Madeline Jones, a former plus-size model and editor of Plus Model Magazine. ""We're going in the right direction with shows like ['Settles'] and 'Big Sexy,'"" Jones said. ""Plus-size women are just like everybody else,"" she added. ""They have sex; they date; they have friends; they're married. ... The media portrays it as we're living this horrible life. We don't wear color; we only go out amongst ourselves."" And Settles is happy to be part of the progression. ""You can't let your weight stop you from living your life,"" she said, adding, ""I probably used to weigh myself every morning when I woke up. After awhile, I realized I was going to crazy town. This is not what it's supposed to be about. It's about personal growth and self-acceptance."" And that's the message she hopes to convey on her show. ""It's important to be healthy, but I also want to be sane.""","Source: ""Weight is so visual, it will always be part of the conversation""

"(CNN) -- You don't need to be a teenage boy to realize how scary girls can be. Girls know it too. Megan Fox plays a demonic cheerleader in ""Jennifer's Body,"" written by Diablo ""Juno"" Cody. Certainly Diablo Cody does. The Academy Award-winning ""Juno"" scribe proves as much in her second screenplay, a horror comedy about BFFs Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried). These bosom buddies have a relationship that stretches back to the sandbox. They're inseparable opposites: Jennifer is a babe, head cheerleader and a bit of a snot. Needy is nerdy, conventional and a soft touch. Except that when we first meet her, she's locked up in the local mental hospital, kicking back at the guards and muttering darkly about the murders that put her here. Looking back, she dates this disastrous turn of events to the day Jennifer talked her into seeing an up-and-coming indie band at the roadhouse. The gig ends in a deadly inferno that claims the lives of several schoolmates, then Jennifer drives off with the band for an al fresco after-party involving satanic rites and virgin sacrifice. She survives on a technicality, but shows up later that night at Needy's place covered in blood, barfing blue goo and craving fresh flesh. In the days after the tragedy the entire school seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress. Only Jennifer seems unfazed by the community's second sucker punch: the gruesome fate of the star quarterback in the woods. What's a girl to do if her best friend turns into a heartless boy-eating demon? Needy cleans up the mess and hopes it's just a phase. The last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was ""Twilight,"" which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller. Directed by Karyn Kusama, who made ""Girlfight"" and ""Aeon Flux,"" ""Jennifer's Body"" isn't anything like that. It's a much edgier, snappier, bloodier film, aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans -- plus anyone else curious to see Megan Fox get nasty. (That's got to include a sizable chunk of the audience, surely?) So smoldering hot that at one point she coolly sets fire to her tongue, Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy -- even Needy is not immune to her charms. Ironically, though, Jennifer is really the needy one here, while her friend eventually finds the self-possession to stand up to her. Similarly, you might come for Fox, but it's Amanda Seyfried's expressive range and toughness that leaves a more lasting impression. The ""Mamma Mia"" starlet is destined for good things. iReport.com: Share your review of ""Jennifer's Body"" The bitingly smart, funny teen-speak is carried over from ""Juno,"" along with sharp pop culture references and a sassy feminist attitude, but the million-dollar question has to be: Is it scary? Only occasionally, I'm afraid. The gore scenes come with weird little flourishes: Jennifer's mounting body count attracts a crowd of curious woodland creatures, sounding a sweetly sick echo of ""Bambi,"" and a climactic showdown is set in a spectacularly fetid abandoned swimming pool (don't they drain those things?). But the jokiness does tend to undercut the terror. I suspect the film will prove too freaky for ""Juno"" boosters, and could have used more straight-ahead scares and sustained suspense to appease the hardcore horror geeks. That said, this entertainingly oddball offering does twist fresh kinks into a genre that's always crying out for new blood. ""Jennifer's Body"" is rated R and runs 102 minutes.","""Jennifer's Body"" is a horror winner with doses of comedy, says Tom Charity .

"(CNN) -- A former Rutgers University student accused of spying on and intimidating his gay roommate by use of a hidden webcam was found guilty Friday of all counts -- including invasion of privacy and the more severe charges of bias intimidation -- in a case that thrust cyberbullying into the national spotlight. Dharun Ravi, 20, was also found guilty of witness tampering, hindering apprehension and tampering with physical evidence, and could now face up to 10 years in jail and deportation to his native India. Sentencing has been set for May 21. The New Jersey jury was confronted with a series of questions on each charge after it asked for clarification on what constituted bias intimidation. Though it found Ravi not guilty on several questions within the verdict sheet, because he was found guilty on at least one question on each main count, Ravi was convicted on all charges and could now face the maximum penalty. His roommate, Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman, killed himself in September 2010 by jumping off the George Washington Bridge and into the Hudson River after learning that Ravi had secretly spied on his sexual encounter with another man. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan called Friday's verdict ""unprecedented,"" adding that it ""sends a message to people across the rest of the country"" about the potential consequences of unauthorized webcam use in an age of expanding social media. ""New Jersey enacted a law that said if you secretly record (someone engaged in an intimate act) with a webcam or any other kind of video and you broadcast that without their permission, that is a crime,"" Callan said. ""Every place else in America up until this law was enacted, you could sue somebody for civil damages for the embarrassment, but you weren't going to go to jail. New Jersey said it's criminal."" And because prosecutors were able to prove that Ravi's actions were born of a gay bias, the possible sentence doubles from up to five years to 10 years behind bars. Clementi's death stirred discussion about bullying, with President Barack Obama releasing a videotaped message condemning it. A few months later, New Jersey legislators enacted stricter laws to protect against bullying in schools. ""This haunting and awful case shows how much society has changed,"" said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin of Friday's verdict. ""Even though he was not charged directly in connection with Clementi's suicide, that tragedy hung over the trial and undoubtedly played a major part in every aspect of the case."" After the verdict, Rutgers University released a statement saying, ""This sad incident should make us all pause to recognize the importance of civility and mutual respect in the way we live, work and communicate with others."" Prosecutors had argued that Ravi, who sat expressionless in the courtroom Friday, had tried to embarrass Clementi because he was gay and that his actions were motivated by a desire to intimidate the Ridgewood, New Jersey, native expressly because of his sexual orientation. ""These acts were purposeful, they were intentional, and they were planned,"" prosecutor Julia L. McClure told the jury on the first day of the trial. Ravi ""was bothered by Tyler Clementi's sexual orientation,"" she later said more bluntly. Ravi's attorneys countered by saying their client acted thoughtlessly, portraying him as an immature college student who made a mistake, and that his actions were not based on homophobia. ""He hasn't lived long enough to have any experience with homosexuality or gays,"" attorney Steven Altman said in closing arguments earlier this week. ""He doesn't know anything about it. He just graduated high school."" After the verdict Friday, Altman said he would ""prepare some type of press release"" next week, but vowed to appeal the ruling. ""Right now I am just dealing with the emotions that everyone involved with the Ravi family and the defense experienced and continue to experience with the verdict,"" he said. Though Ravi and Molly Wei -- a fellow student who admitted to joining Ravi to watch the surreptitious encounter that others were alerted to via social media -- were charged in the wake of Clementi's suicide, they were not charged directly with his death. Facing two counts of invasion of privacy, Wei reached a plea deal in May that required her to testify against her friend and former high school classmate as well as to complete a three-year program on cyberbullying and do 300 hours of community service. Ravi turned down a plea deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors that would have allowed him to avoid jail time in exchange for undergoing counseling, doing 600 hours of community service and disposing of any information that could identify the man who appeared in the Web video with Clementi. Prosecutors also offered to help him avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. Ravi, who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university, did not testify on his own behalf. During the prosecution's phase of the trial, the man whom Clementi was intimate with, identified only as ""M.B.,"" told jurors that he had noticed a Web camera aimed directly at Clementi's bed. The 32-year-old man testified that he met Clementi on a social-networking site for gay men and that they eventually met three times in the student's dorm room. The two conversed online, exchanged text messages and eventually had sex, he said. Wei testified that she watched M.B. and Clementi after Ravi had secretly set up the webcam in his and Clementi's dormitory room. Ravi's attorney, Altman, has argued his client had initially switched on the webcam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate's visitor. In Twitter messages from that day, Ravi wrote that he'd gone into a friend's room, ""turned on my webcam"" and saw his roommate ""making out with a dude."" Then on September 22, 2010, Clementi took a train to New York and posted a mobile status update on his Facebook page that read, ""Jumping off the gw bridge sorry."" Ravi had apparently tried to make amends with his estranged roommate that same night, according to text messages revealed in court. ""I've known you were gay and I have no problem with it,"" Ravi wrote in messages after he apparently learned his roommate had requested a room change. It is not clear whether Clementi ever viewed the messages before committing suicide. InSession's Jim Kyle contributed to this report.","NEW: Dharun Ravi's attorney says he will appeal the decision .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Applebee's . The world's largest casual dining chain celebrated 30 years of eatin' good in the neighborhood in 2010. The original Applebee's, which was named T.J. Applebee's Rx for Edibles & Elixirs, opened in Atlanta in 1980. The founders of the original restaurant, including Bill and T.J. Palmer, wanted to name the restaurant Appleby's, but that spelling had already been registered. Cinnamon's and Peppers, two other names considered, were taken as well. The Palmers settled on T.J. Applebee's, which was just different enough from their first choice. ""Menu items ranging from munchies to steak and quail are served at round, high-topped tables on platforms,"" read one newspaper review from 1981. A second location was opened in Atlanta before T.J. Palmer's ownership group sold the restaurant concept in 1983. The name was changed to Applebee's Neighborhood Bar & Grill in 1986 and became the first casual dining chain to hit 1,000 locations in 1998. 2. Bob Evans . Bob Evans began producing sausage on his farm in 1948 for a 12-stool diner he owned in southeastern Ohio. His patrons raved about the sausage, prompting Evans to enter the sausage-making business on a larger scale. Bob Evans Farms was launched in 1953, and when the number of visitors to his farm began to increase, Evans saw an opportunity. Evans opened a small restaurant called the Sausage Shop in front of his brick farmhouse in Rio Grande, Ohio, in 1962. The Sausage Shop is considered the first of Bob Evans' now-famous chain restaurants. Today, Evans' farmhouse, known as the Homestead, is on the National Register of Historic Places. 3. California Pizza Kitchen . In 1985, federal prosecutors Rick Rosenfield and Larry Flax opened the first California Pizza Kitchen in Beverly Hills. Rosenfield and Flax, who were inspired by Wolfgang Puck's popular Spago restaurant in West Hollywood and hired Puck's original pizza chef at CPK, read Ray Kroc's autobiography prior to starting their business. Today, the chain has grown to more than 250 restaurants. Mental Floss: Why Mr. Rogers was the best neighbor ever . 4. Cheesecake Factory . In 1972, Oscar and Evelyn Overton moved from Detroit to a suburb of Los Angeles to launch a wholesale bakery specializing in cheesecakes. Six years later, the Overton's son, David, opened a salad and sandwich shop in Beverly Hills that featured 10 flavors of his mom's cheesecake. One of the main purposes of the shop was to get local restaurateurs to carry the Overton's cheesecake in their own establishments, but it turned into a booming business of its own. Overton opened a second restaurant in Marina Del Rey in 1983. The rest was history. 5. Cracker Barrel . In 1969, Dan Evins, who worked in his family's gasoline business, opened the first Cracker Barrel Old Country Store off Highway 109 in Lebanon, Tennessee. By 1977, 13 additional Cracker Barrel stores had opened. The goal of the original Cracker Barrel was to provide a place for motorists to fill their tanks and their stomachs, and the inspiration for the concept came from the general stores that Evins frequented as a child. According to the Cracker Barrel website, goods such as crackers were shipped to these stores in barrels, and when the barrels were empty, the base was often used for a checkerboard. The gift shop remains a staple of Cracker Barrels today. 6. Denny's . Harold Butler founded Denny's in Lakewood, Calif., in 1953 as Danny's Donuts. First-year earnings totaled $120,000. Butler opened 20 additional shops and expanded the menu to include sandwiches and other entrees over the next six years before renaming his restaurants Denny's. Butler began franchising Denny's in 1963 and introduced its signature Grand Slam breakfast in Atlanta in 1977. In 2000, Denny's opened a restaurant in Rhode Island, which was the only state without one. Mental Floss: How do you decaffeinate coffee? 7. IHOP . The first IHOP was opened by brothers Al and Jerry Lapin on July 7, 1958, in Toluca Lake, California. Part of the reason the Lapins chose Toluca Lake was to capitalize on the overflow crowd from Bob's Big Boy. Al Lapin had operated a series of coffee carts in Los Angeles when fast-food chains started to take off and saw the potential for a fast-food restaurant that specialized in breakfast. Today, IHOP boasts more than 1,500 restaurants in all 50 states. IHOP purchased Applebee's in 2007. 8. Red Lobster . Bill Darden opened the first Red Lobster in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968. The restaurant, which offered seafood at reasonable prices, was popular from the start and Darden soon opened four additional locations throughout Florida. In 1970, General Mills purchased Darden's chain. The original restaurant was closed in 1997 after Darden determined that Lakeland would be better served by only one location. Red Lobster wasn't the first color/animal restaurant Darden started. Decades earlier, he opened The Green Frog. 9. TGI Friday's . Alan Stillman opened the first T.G.I. Friday's at First Avenue and 63rd St. in New York City in 1965 -- partially as a means of meeting airline stewardesses. ""The other thing is that my timing was exquisite, because I opened T.G.I. Friday's the exact year the pill was invented,"" Stillman told the New City Reader last year. ""I happened to hit the sexual revolution on the head, and the result was that, without really intending it, I became the founder of the first singles bar."" The first Friday's featured Tiffany lamps, sawdust on the floor, and distinctive red and white striped awnings. First year revenues at the original Friday's were $1 million. A second location opened in Memphis in 1970, and within 10 years, eight other T.G.I. Friday's had opened. Stillman eventually sold Friday's and launched Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse in 1977. Mental Floss: Who was the first stewardess? 10. Waffle House . The original Waffle House opened on Labor Day 1955 on East College Avenue in Decatur, Georgia. In 2008, the 13-stool diner that launched more than 1,500 Waffle Houses reopened as a Waffle House museum, with vintage equipment and memorabilia displays of old uniforms and place settings. ""That was the year McDonald's and all the hamburger chains started doing takeout,"" Waffle House co-founder Joe Rogers told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2008 of his idea to open a restaurant with his neighbor, Tom Forkner. ""We wanted to do sit-down, and we knew you couldn't take out a waffle or it'd become flimsy."" For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Washington (CNN) -- The beard that delayed the Fort Hood court martial trial for months is gone. Maj. Nidal Hasan, the former Army psychiatrist convicted of 13 murders and dozens of attempted murders, is clean shaven again. According to an Army statement about Hasan's incarceration at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, ""All inmates must conform to AR 670-1, wear and appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia."" The statement also said, ""In keeping with the provisions"" of the regulations, ""Inmate Hasan has been shaved.""

In June 2012, Hasan first showed up in court with a beard. Hasan said the beard was an expression of his Muslim beliefs. The judge at first refused to allow Hasan in the courtroom during pretrial hearings, instead forcing him to watch on closed-circuit TV from a nearby trailer. Later, the judge, Col. Gregory Gross, found Hasan in contempt of court. Hasan attorneys filed an appeal and the court martial was on hold. Eventually Hasan was allowed to keep the beard during the trial and Gross was replaced for the court martial.

"(CNN) -- ""One of these mothers from Connecticut should do an Emmett Till moment; show the picture of their child dead in the classroom."" That's a text I received earlier this week from my TV One show producer. When I got it, a chill immediately went through my body just thinking about the possibility of seeing the carnage in such a photo. When taping this week's edition of my show, ""Washington Watch,"" Sirius/XM Radio host Joe Madison somberly said the same thing. Joe remarked that Emmett's mother, Mamie, insisted on an open casket for her son so the world could see what was done to him by racists in Mississippi. Many Americans may not even remember Emmett Till, a precocious 14-year-old black teenager from Chicago who went to visit his family in Mississippi. He allegedly flirted with a white woman in a store, and the woman's husband and his brother later went to the home where Till was staying, pulled him out of his bed, took him somewhere and beat him to a pulp, gouged out his eye, blew the back of his head away with a gun, attached a cotton gin with barbed wire around his neck and dumped his body in the Tallahatchie River. When his bloated and disfigured body was recovered, it was unrecognizable. He was identified based on a ring he always wore. When Jet magazine and the Chicago Defender newspaper published his battered face on their covers, it sent shock waves throughout America, and especially in the black community. The brutality of lynchings were talked about and covered, yet for the world to witness with its own eyes the end result of vicious bigotry, it forced the nation to examine its conscience. ""There was just no way I could describe what was in that box,"" Mamie said. ""No way. And I just wanted the world to see."" In the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, mass shooting, we have seen numerous photos of the beautiful, smiling faces of the 20 children and six adults slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. The images we have become accustomed to include them singing at a piano, sporting the gear of a favorite sports team and others. When we think of them being memorialized it's in the context of teddy bears, candles and flowers. Americans want to remember them as vibrant and fun-loving children, but will that actually shake the conscience of America to do something about how they were gunned down in the classroom? What if one of the mothers or fathers of the Newtown 20 demanded that police give them a crime scene photo of their child and they chose to show it to the world? Can you imagine a modern day Mamie Till Mobley, wracked with pain but filled with resolve to show the nation so they could bear witness to what hate did to their child? The great divide: Little common ground with pro- and anti-gun forces . I can tell you that I've talked to numerous black men and women who to this day remember August 28, 1955, the day Till was murdered. The image of his face has been seared into their brain for life as a result of seeing that photo. Is that what Americans need today? Maybe so. For too many of us, we hear about gun violence, we talk about it, we mourn it, but to be honest, we've never witnessed it. Our senses have been dulled to the real world carnage. We demand that news organizations not show American troops, or even the enemy, lying dead in war zones. Even when our troops returned home in flag-draped coffins, the Bush administration forbade it from being covered by the media. The Los Angeles Times was ripped by readers for showing the bloody, lifeless body of Ambassador Christopher Stevens being dragged out of a building in Benghazi, Libya. What does that say about America? Oh, let's talk about tragedy, but please, please, please don't show the real results. We love blood and guts in our movies, preferring exploding heads, chests ripped open by gunfire. We adore the big explosions, bodies flying through the air, buildings tumbling down. We'll drop millions of dollars collectively on movies and video games to see the carnage, but God forbid we are forced to see it in real life. That's America. The land of make believe. Show us the fake stuff, but let's retreat into a fetal position and scream, ""No! No! No!"" when forced to see the real thing. When my producer sent me that text, I recoiled at even the mere mention of seeing with my own eyes the real life results of what a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle could do to a 6-year-old body. But maybe I should see it. Maybe Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association should have to answer to such a photo when he is interviewed. Maybe if a modern day Mamie Till met with members of Congress and forced them to look at a photo of her baby, then we would see some political courage. Maybe if all Americans had to bear witness to such a photo, we would stop ignoring the violence equivalent to the Newtown massacres that is happening in Chicago, New Orleans and other cities across this country. Gun violence is a national epidemic. It affects all ages and races. Maybe it's time for America to see the results of what our gun culture has wrought. Enough with our delicate sensibilities. If we truly want to confront the problem, then we'd better have the guts to see the problem. When we've had such tragedies in the past, there was always an initial outcry, and then we'd settle back into our routines. When that image of Emmett Till was shown to the world, it stirred up such a burning desire for justice inside African-Americans that it was a part of the foundation of the civil rights movement. Just three months later the Montgomery bus boycott began, and many African-Americans will tell you that Till's gruesome lynching was the catalyst. Till's death was the moment that led to a movement, and 57 years later, we still talk about his death, largely because of that photo. Maybe the only way Newtown never leaves our conscience and fades away like Aurora or Columbine is if we have to look at the results of the tragedy to ensure that this moment leads to a transformational movement. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: The cost of gun violence is often hidden away .

"(CNN) -- The family of Zachary Reyna, the 12-year-old Florida boy stricken with a brain-eating parasite, has donated Zachary's organs, according to a Facebook page that's been providing detailed updates from the Reyna family. ""Zac donated all his organs to others that were waiting on a miracle,"" the late Monday night post said. ""Through donating his organs, Zac is living on. His heart will be pumping for someone, his lungs will be taking breaths for someone and all his other organs will change the lives of many."" Funeral arrangements for Zachary have not yet been made, the post said. A previous post indicated that Zachary had passed away on Saturday but was being kept on a ventilator so the boy's organs could be donated, and that family and friends could visit him one last time at Miami Children's Hospital. Doctors had given Zachary an experimental drug to treat a rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri. This same drug was used to treat 12-year-old Kali Hardig recently in Arkansas, after which she became only the third person in the last 50 years known to survive the deadly parasite. Zachary's family told CNN affiliate WBBH that they believe the boy -- who they described as an active seventh-grader -- was infected while kneeboarding with friends in a water-filled ditch by his house on August 3. After he was hospitalized, the boy underwent brain surgery, and doctors diagnosed him with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, according to WBBH. On August 21, the family noted on the Facebook page that antibiotics had defeated Zachary's infection; tests showed no activity from the amoeba in his body. But, the post said, extensive damage had already been done to the 12-year-old's brain. After news emerged regarding Zachary's diagnosis, the Florida Department of Health issued a warning to swimmers that high water temperatures and low water levels provide the perfect breeding ground for this rare amoeba. Between 2001 and 2010, there were only 32 reported cases of people getting Naegleria fowleri in the United States, according to the CDC. Most of the cases have been in the Southeast. Girl battling brain-eating amoeba moves out of ICU . Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater, most often in the southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC said. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the agency website says. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days.""

"(CNN) -- Four continents, 16 cities, 192 ""lost"" wallets. That's the basic formula for a recent sticky fingers experiment by Reader's Digest. Reporters from the magazine dropped wallets in parks, on sidewalks and near shopping malls in international cities from New York to Mumbai and waited to see how people would respond. Each wallet contained the equivalent of $50, a cell phone number, business cards, coupons and a family photo. Bottom line? Nearly half -- 47% -- of the wallets were returned. ""If you find money, you can't assume it belongs to a rich man,"" said Ursula Smist, who returned one of the five wallets recovered in London. ""It might be the last bit of money a mother has to feed her family,"" said Smist, who is originally from Poland. The other seven wallets dropped in London remain at large. Can your cell phone bring down a plane?

"(CNN) -- On August 13, 1963, in a last ditch effort to derail the pending March on Washington, Strom Thurmond took the Senate floor and hurled a series of vicious, personal attacks against the man organizing the largest protest in U.S. history. Thurmond called him a Communist and a draft dodger. He brought up a previous arrest and accused him of being immoral and a pervert. The man Thurmond was attacking was not Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In fact Thurmond used King's own words -- secretly recorded by J.Edgar Hoover -- in his attacks against the march's deputy director. ""I hope Bayard don't take a drink before the march,"" Clarence Jones, King's lawyer and close friend, said in the recording. ""Yes,"" King replied. ""And grab one little brother. 'Cause he will grab one when he has a drink."" ""Bayard"" would be Bayard Rustin, the most important leader of the civil rights movement you probably have never heard of. Opinion: Congress, stand up for civil rights . Rustin was imprisoned for challenging racial segregation in the South before the phrase ""Freedom Rider"" was ever said. He taught a 25-year-old King the true meaning of nonviolent civil disobedience while the great dreamer was still being flanked by armed bodyguards. And before addressing the crowd of 250,000 that gathered at the National Mall nearly five decades ago, famed actor and activist Ossie Davis introduced him ""as the man who organized this whole thing."" No, the reason why you probably have not heard of Bayard Rustin has nothing to do with the significance of his contributions to the March on Washington or the civil rights movement in general. His absence is epitomized by the sentiment woven between the lines of that joke between Jones and Rustin's protege. You see, the organizer of the great march, the man who held a fundraiser at Madison Square Garden to help fund the bus boycott in Montgomery, the intellectual behind the founding of the Southern Christian Leadership Council was also unabashedly gay. And it was the discomfort some had with his sexuality that led to his disappearance in our history books. ""We must look back with sadness at the barriers of bigotry built around his sexuality,"" wrote NAACP chairman emeritus Julian Bond in ""I Must Resist,"" a collection of Rustin letters. ""We are the poorer for it."" As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of arguably the single most important event of the 20th century -- as well as the speech that defined it -- there is a natural inclination to evaluate how close we are to achieving Dr. King's famed dream. Why some movements work and others wilt . With President Obama in office, it is silly to suggest no progress has been made. But considering that the wealth gap between black and white families has nearly tripled over the past 25 years or that a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 40% of white Americans don't have a friend outside of their race, who can view the election of one man as King's dream being fulfilled? Yes, the residue of the Jim Crow era still poisons the air like mold spores after a flood, manifesting in unjust laws such as Stop and Frisk and clusters of failing schools in poor black neighborhoods. But after recently reading the full text of Dr. King's ""I Have A Dream"" speech, it occurred to me that perhaps the reason why we're still divided as a nation is because we haven't figured out what is keeping us apart. Despite being a leading voice for racial equality since the 1940s, Rustin's marginalization is a direct reflection of oppression of a different sort. Thurmond used it as a weapon to attack the March on Washington. Adam Clayton Powell, a black congressman from Harlem, used it to gain power. Other black leaders, like Stokely Carmichael, used it to question his place in the movement. March on Washington: Fast Facts . You see as big and as looming and as destructive as racism has been and continues to be in society, we must remember it is only a branch. The root of the problem, the reason why we continue to struggle with equality, is our pathological intolerance, an intolerance no collective group of people has proven to be immune to. ""I say to you today, my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today, and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'"" Dr. King's dream has not been fulfilled because we began betraying the integrity of his dream the moment we started scrubbing Rustin's life out of Black History Month lessons and civil rights movies. We betray that dream each time a black person claims offense to the notion that gay rights are civil rights, as if the black community is the only community capable of being oppressed. We betray King's dream each time a white elected official is allowed to say things about the gay community in ways that would never be tolerated if directed at the black community. I don't say these things because I view the history and plight of these two minority groups as being exactly the same -- they are not. I say these things because racism and homophobia -- like anti-Semitism, sexism and xenophobia -- all have the same mother. And as long as concessions are made for one, we will never be free from the clutches of the others. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the nation's highest civilian award. It was established by President Kennedy 50 years ago. Considering the anniversary of the march, it is fitting that Rustin is among the 16 being honored with it in November. But like King, he was more than August 28, 1963. He was a giant. And so while the medal is special, the best way to honor him is to talk about him, all of him, both now and in the many years to come. Bayard Rustin spent his life fighting for peace and equality and he did so unashamed of who he was. It's about time history, and the people he helped most, stop being ashamed of him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","Bayard Rustin was a civil rights leader and Martin Luther King's mentor .

"(CNN) -- Smartphones are powerful tools, and with the right apps and accessories, they can become even more so. A California-based tech company has launched a tool that turns a regular iPhone 4 or 4S into a powerful biometrics scanning tool. AOptix has unveiled its app and a wrap-around device for turning the smartphone into a portable iris, face, fingerprint and voice scanner. The hardware and software system, the first of its kind for the iPhone, is called AOptix Stratus, which comprises both the iOS app â€” which will cost $199 â€” and a wrap around device for an iPhone 4 or 4S. The app uses the iPhone camera to snap pictures of faces and record voices, while there's an extra camera that does iris scanning and a small sensor to scan fingerprints. AOptix will also release a software development kit to its customers so they can customize the app to their own needs. In February, the Department of Defense paid AOptix $3 million to develop an enhanced solution using the tool that's being launched today. See also: The ingenious refocusing camera . The idea behind this system is to make biometrics recognition easier and mobile. Think of a border protection agency that could use iris recognition at an airport's customs checkpoint, or a police or law enforcement agency that needs to verify identities on the go and can't afford large, cumbersome hardware to do so. That's where Stratus comes in. Making the system work on an iPhone makes everything easier. ""If you used an iPhone before, you can use this,"" said AOptix's Director of Product Marketing Joey Pritikin. In a teleconference demonstration, Pritikin showed how the system works. The user inserts the iPhone in the device, plugging it in using the 30-pin connector, and then launches the app. The app interface is user-friendly and simple, and lets the user register the biometrics of the person in front of him with relative ease. Using an iPhone also lets the app register GPS coordinates and transmit all the data through the phone's mobile Internet connection. The app is designed to help the user determine the distance at which to stand in front of the other person and automatically takes a picture when the subject is in the right range. This automatic capture works both with the iPhone camera and with the built-in iris scanner. All pictures taken are stored and easily accessible within the app. The app allows the user to create a person's profile including his or her iris, face, voice, fingerprints and biographical information. This trove of data is then accessible with the tap of a finger. See also: $30 gadget lets your eyes take control . Pritikin explained that when they started working on the project, they had to decide whether they wanted to use an off-the-shelf product like the iPhone, or develop their own, perhaps using a platform like Android. But they eventually settled on the iPhone for various reasons. ""It is very secure as a platform, which is, naturally, important to our customers,"" he said. ""[It is] very stable, you can buy the same device globally. They have a very strong ecosystem for supporting accessories like the one we created."" Pritikin declined to say how much the device costs, stressing the fact that it is not a consumer product but, rather, it is intended for companies or government agencies. Stratus could be used at border crossings, during disaster relief operations (when regular infrastructure for identity verification isn't present), for remote mobile banking or even remote healthcare. Countries like India, which is deploying national ID programs to give every citizen a unique number linked to biometric data (PDF), could also be target customers. See also: Print a life-size robot for under $1,000 . Asked if there's any country AOptix would refuse to sell their products to, given that they could be used for surveillance and profiling, Pritikin answered that his company follows the guidelines of the U.S. Department of Commerce and won't export their products to countries like Iran or North Korea. Pritikin declined to identify specific customers who have already bought Stratus, but said that the first shipments will be at the end of April. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Samsung plans to introduce a smartphone with a curved display screen, an executive of the South Korean company said Wednesday. D.J. Lee, Samsung's head of mobile marketing, made the announcement at an event in Seoul to roll out the Galaxy Gear smartwatch and Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. He said the phone would be available in October, presumably with a limited release in South Korea. Unfortunately, that's about all the detail he provided -- no exact release date, no details on the design, no price and no word on where it will be available. Curved screens are a rarity among smartphones, which typically feature flat, rectangular displays. But Samsung has been tinkering with next-generation screens for a while. Early this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the company showed off prototypes of a line of flexible display screens it calls YOUM. ""This new form factor will really begin to change how people interact with their devices and open up new lifestyle possibilities,"" Brian Berkeley, senior vice president of Samsung's display lab, said at the January event. ""And it's only going to get better."" In a video, they teased a smartphone with a bendable screen that opens up into a smallish tablet. Berkeley also demonstrated how a phone display screen that's curved along its edges would open up exponentially more space for viewing content. A bendable, plastic display screen could also be virtually unbreakable, although it's unclear whether the new phone -- which could be a version of the new Galaxy Note 3 -- would be plastic or some sort of step along the way. Samsung has made a Rolls Royce of a television, the $9,000, 55-inch KN55S9C, with a curved screen. And Samsung's Galaxy Nexus smartphone, released in 2011, had a slight curve to its screen. But the new model will presumably take the concept further. ""I'm expecting the company to aim for an even more extreme curve with its next phone,"" Devindra Hardawar wrote for VentureBeat. ""With its large-screen Galaxy Note lineup, Samsung has shown that it isn't afraid to step into slightly oddball territory. The Note also proves those gambles can pay off for Samsung."" A curved screen would also boost Samsung's status as a leader on the mobile innovation front. Samsung Galaxy phones have outsold Apple's iPhone during various periods over the past year, as Apple has been dinged by critics who say the company's phones are no longer breaking new ground. There were similar criticisms of the newly released iPhone 5S, which was viewed by many as a baby step forward, although reviews of the device have been mostly raves, and it sold a record-setting 9 million units in its first weekend on the market.","Samsung to release smartphone with a curved screen in October .

"(CNN) -- A woman accused of scamming nearly half a million dollars from a nonprofit fund benefiting the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings was indicted on Monday, according to a Massachusetts Attorney General. Audrea Gause, 26, was indicted on charges of larceny over $250 and gross fraud by a Suffolk County Grand Jury, according to a statement from the office of Attorney General Martha Coakley. Gause was arrested on July 19 in her hometown of Troy, New York, on a Massachusetts fugitive warrant. She was arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on August 2, where she pleaded not guilty. She is being held on $200,000 cash bail, the statement said. The nonprofit -- The One Fund Boston -- began distributing nearly $61 million to 232 eligible claimants starting June 30, according to a release from the organization. Gause was awarded $480,000 from the fund after claiming she suffered a traumatic brain injury resulting in long-term memory loss, impaired speech and loss of some motor function that would require future surgery as a result of the Boston Marathon bombing, the attorney general's office said. Authorities allege that Gause gave $377,500 of the money she fraudulently obtained from The One Fund to a New York construction company as a down payment on a new home. Investigations also revealed that Gause signed up for a cruise, named the ""Heroes Cruise,"" which was being offered free to victims of the Boston Marathon bombing by a Boston-based travel company, according to the statement. After a tip received by the state attorney general and The One Fund Boston that Gause was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, an official investigation began, Coakley said at a news conference on July 19. That investigation determined that Gause was never a patient at Boston Medical Center for two days or Albany Medical Center for 10 days, as she declared on her notarized claim form, the statement says. ""This defendant allegedly attempted to steal from the real victims of the Marathon bombing and we are pleased that we were able to recover this money for The One Fund Boston,"" Coakley said. The One Fund Boston divided payments between four classifications that were based on the severity of injuries or loss of life, according to the fund's statement. More than 260 people were wounded and three were killed in the double bombings, which took place near the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15. Gause is scheduled to be arraigned in Suffolk Superior Court on October 7. Calls to her attorney, John Hayes, were not immediately returned to CNN on Monday. Coakley's office said two other individuals have been charged with attempted fraud of The One Fund Boston. In August, two brothers from Boston were charged in connection with an attempt to defraud the organization of $2 million after submitting a false claim on behalf of their dead aunt.

"Washington (CNN) -- A little-known provision of the Constitution might provide a little-used way for President Barack Obama to unilaterally get around stalled efforts to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts. It is a legal audible that was considered two years ago in a similar crisis, and ultimately rejected by Obama, a former constitutional scholar. In remarks on Thursday, the president said the stakes were stark, if the debt ceiling were not raised, and the government unable to pay its bills. ""As reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse,"" he said, pointing the finger at Capitol Hill. Congressional Republicans who control the House insist they will not act until the administration commits to delaying implementation of key parts of the healthcare reform law, or to further spending cuts-- ultimatums the White House rejects. The game of political chicken raises the potential of a recession and market meltdown if the Treasury is not replenished by mid-month. Some economists warn the debt ceiling impasse is a far greater threat than the ongoing government shutdown. That's where Section 4 of the 14th Amendment comes in: ""The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law ... shall not be questioned."" Does that mean the president could on own his raise the debt ceiling? Some congressional allies say yes. ""It is an option that should seriously be considered,"" said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said it should have been done in 2011, the last time the two branches went through this. Back then it was former President Clinton who led the rhetorical charge. He said he would have raised the debt ceiling ""without hesitation"" and ""force the courts to stop me."" Then-Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also suggested such a legal right was possible, and plausible. But Obama was not sure. ""I have talked to my lawyers,"" he said at the time. ""They are not persuaded that that is a winning argument,"" suggesting he believed the courts would not accept such a move -- and more importantly, would the nation's creditors. Fast forward to 2013. His spokesman Monday repeated the White House line Congress had the responsibility here. ""The president can't raise it by himself,"" said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ""This administration does not believe that the 14th Amendment gives the power to ignore the debt ceiling. And even if the president could ignore the debt ceiling, the fact that there is significant controversy around the president's authority to act unilaterally means that it would not be a credible alternative to Congress raising the debt ceiling, and would not be taken seriously by the global economy and markets."" Legal and political scholars -- and the federal courts -- have debated just how relevant, and how far Section 4 was designed to go. The amendment was ratified in 1868, to ensure in part, the unified nation's debts from the just-ended Civil War would be honored, and that Confederate claims would not. The unquoted part of the provision specifically mentions the public debt ""incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion."" The U.S. Supreme Court in 1935-- in Perry v. U.S.-- suggested Section 4 could be applied in other circumstances. ""While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government during the Civil War, its language indicates broader connotation,"" said Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes in the opinion, which concluded that voiding a U.S. government debt was beyond the power of Congress. Indeed other better-known parts of the 14th Amendment-- the ""due process,"" ""equal protection,"" and ""privileges or immunities"" citizenship clauses-- have been cited in a sweeping range of litigation beyond its original Reconstruction response to the rights of former slaves. Those cases include abortion, segregation, even the 2000 Bush v. Gore presidential ballot dispute. Despite Mr. Clinton's bold challenge daring the courts to intervene, any unilateral action on the debt ceiling would be sure to prompt immediate lawsuits. Whether an ""aggrieved party"" such as a taxpayer or bondholder, could establish legal ""standing""-- allowing any legal action to proceed-- would be the first legal hurdle, a process that could drag on for months, even years before the Supreme Court would be asked to offer the final word. But some politicians have said a default on the nation's debt would constitute the kind of national emergency requiring of bold presidential action, something that would be politically acceptable to the public. Legal challenges, they say, would wither if the economy rebounds. Obama urged negotiations to continue, but on Thursday said the 2011 debt crisis hurt average Americans, and could do so again. ""Our economy took a bad hit. Our country's credit rating was downgraded for the first time, just like you would be downgraded if you didn't pay your mortgage. This time, they are threatening to actually force the United States to default on its obligations for the very first time in history."" But some Republicans say a constitutional crisis is overblown and so is concern of what will happen if both sides fail to agree in coming days. ""I don't think the credit of the United States is going to be collapsed,"" said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on CNN Thursday. ""I think that all this talk about a default has been a lot of demagoguery, a lot of false demagoguery. We have plenty of money coming in to service the debt. When we stop servicing the debt, that would be default. We're a long, long ways from that."" So the dilemma here for the White House would appear more political, less legal. In invoking executive power to raise the debt ceiling, Obama might earn quick political points, by claiming to put the nation's financial health above congressional inaction. But the risks to a market and credit backlash, global investor unease, and softening public support-- not to mention an eventual Supreme Court showdown-- might urge continued White House caution. After all, the debt ceiling has been raised at least 74 times in the past half century-- 10 times in the past decade-- always through the typical back-and-forth political sparring between the White House and Capitol Hill.","Little known legal provision could again provide opening for President Obama on debt ceiling .

"(CNN) -- They live at the end of a runway at one of the nation's busiest airports, and only now has anyone cared to identify them and even give them a name. They are yellow-bellied legless lizards, and their species name is A. stebbinsi, after 98-year-old herpetologist Robert C. Stebbins. Their home is in the dunes west of Los Angeles International Airport. Stebbins' namesakes, which look like snakes, were discovered and identified by Theodore Papenfuss, a herpetologist with the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, and James Parham of California State University, Fullerton. The pair also reported finding three other new species of legless lizards, all from California, in research published this week in the journal Breviora from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Giant lizard named for Jim Morrison tells tale of climate change . The other legless lizards were found among oil derricks in the San Joaquin Valley, on the edge of the Mojave Desert and in a vacant lot in downtown Bakersfield. ""These are animals that have existed in the San Joaquin Valley, separate from any other species, for millions of years, completely unknown,"" Parham said in a statement from UC Berkeley. Papenfuss said, ""This shows that there is a lot of undocumented biodiversity within California."" Undocumented because it's hard to find, at least in the case of these lizards. They burrow into the loose soil and spend their entire lives in an area measured in square feet. Olinguito the newest rare mammal species discovery . The A. stebbinsi were found under leaf litter. The three other species -- the silver-bellied A. alexanderae, the purple-bellied A. grinnelli and the yellow-bellied A. campi -- were found after researchers left flattened cardboard boxes and pieces of plywood in areas where they suspected the lizards might live, then went back to see if the critters took up residence underneath. And this was no quick study. The specimens were collected over a 14-year period, the researchers said. In fact, the researchers reported that all of the species were actually in collections and stored in alcohol. The alcohol, however, removed coloring so scientists had to do genetic testing to confirm that those specimens were part of the previously unidentified species. 'Chewbacca bat,' other bizarre species found . The four new species bring to five the number of known legless lizard species in California. The previously identified common legless lizard of Northern California looks like the A. stebbinsi, and the two can only be distinguished by genetic testing, the researchers said. There are more than 200 species of legless lizards worldwide, they said. Rocket frog takes a flying leap . And you must be wondering how to tell a legless lizard from a snake.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A police officer removed a sheet covering Whitney Houston's naked corpse and remarked, ""Damn, she's still looking good, huh?"" according to another officer at the scene. The accusation against the Beverly Hills Police detective was revealed in a labor dispute filing made last week by Brian Weir, who was the senior patrol sergeant called to Houston's hotel room after she was found dead in a bathtub on February 11, 2012. Weir claims the Beverly Hills police chief and others retaliated against him when he complained about the alleged actions of Det. Sgt. Terry Nutall at the death scene on the fourth floor of the Beverly Hilton Hotel. ""We will be looking into the allegations made in this claim, but we were not aware of any inappropriate behavior or comments made by any officer at the scene,"" Beverly Hills Police spokesman Lt. Lincoln Hoshino told CNN Wednesday. No formal complaint was ever filed with the police department by Weir or anyone else, Hoshina said. ""How can we retaliate against him for reporting misconduct if we weren't aware of any misconduct?"" he said. Houston drowned face down in a hotel tub of ""extremely hot water"" about 12 inches deep, the final autopsy report on the singer's death said. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Houston's death on the eve of the 2012 Grammy Awards was an accidental drowning with the ""effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use"" as contributing factors. Whitney Houston's storied career: A regal rise, a tragic fall . Weir's complaint, filed on September 11 with California's labor department, said he covered Houston's body with a sheet ""to prevent contamination or potential DNA and other potential evidence on the body"" and to ""preserve the dignity of the remains."" It said that Nutall -- who was assigned to investigate fraud, forgery and auto burglaries -- ""knelt beside and leaned over the decedent, removed the sheet and/or other covering from the body of the decedent to an area below the pubic region of the decedent's body and came in close proximity to touching the body of the decedent while making inappropriate comments to the effect and substance that the decedent 'looked attractive for a woman of her age and current state' and 'Damn, she's still looking good, huh?'"" Nutall ""did properly respond to the scene,"" the police spokesman said. ""It is appropriate for a responding detective sergeant to briefly examine the body upon arriving to a scene like that."" Weir, who had been in the ""coveted positions"" of sergeant with the SWAT and K-9 units, claims he told Beverly Hills officials about the incident, which he said he believed violated state and federal laws. After complaining to his superiors and others in the Beverly Hills government, Weir was removed from his ""coveted positions"" of sergeant with the SWAT and K-9 units, denied promotion to other positions, removed from supervisory duties, denied special pay, denied training, harassed and ostracized, given inappropriate and harassing comments an/or documents, and subjected to conduct undermining his authority as a superior, the filing said. He also lost overtime pay, the filing alleged. Whitney Houston death probe closed; 911 call released . The complaint accuses Police Chief David Snowden, Capt. Tony Lee and Nutall -- who has since been promoted to lieutenant -- of taking ""reprisal actions, including acts of intimidation, restraint, coercion, discrimination, punitive, and/or disciplinary actions"" against Weir. Weir's lawyer Christopher Brizzolara is demanding economic and non-economic damages for his client, who has suffered damage to his law enforcement career and emotional stress. Houston was last seen alive by her personal assistant in her Beverly Hilton room at about 3 p.m. that Saturday, the autopsy report said. The assistant left to run errands after telling Houston to take a bath in preparation for a pre-Grammy Awards party at the hotel that night, it said. When the assistant returned to the locked room at 3:35 p.m., she found Houston ""lying face down in the bathtub filled with water, unresponsive."" ""The assistant called for her bodyguard, and together they pulled the decedent out of the bathtub,"" the report said. When paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, they moved Houston to the living room floor. At 3:55 p.m., 20 minutes after she was found by the assistant, paramedics concluded she was dead, the report said. Houston won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums, singles and videos over her career. In recent years, the singer's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction.

"(CNN) -- Golf returns to Olympics in 2016 after a 112-year hiatus and some of the greatest names in the sport are battling to put their name to the new course on which the event is to be played. 18-time majors winner Jack Nicklaus, South Africa's Gary Player and Australia's Greg Norman are well past their playing primes but the three legends are among eight finalists in the running to design the 18-hole course on which the Olympic golf tournament will be played in Rio de Janeiro in four years time. Gary Player Design, Greg Norman Golf Course Design and Nicklaus Design join Hawtree Ltd., Hanse Golf Design, Renaissance Golf, Robert Trent Jones II and Thomson-Perret Golf Course Architects in the competition to design the course that will be built in the Barra da Tijuca area of Rio, the part of the city that will host the largest number of Olympic venues. The winner was scheduled to be announced by Rio Games organizers Friday. In soliciting bids for the course, Olympic organizers stipulated that it be available as a place for the public to play once the games end. ""After the Games, the course will be managed by a private operator with the chief purpose of promoting golf in Brazil and South America, representing one of the most important Games' legacies for sport development in the country,"" organizers said. For a nation of more than 200 million, Brazil has about 100 golf courses, many of those only nine holes. In contrast, South Carolina has more than four times that many courses with a population that's just 2% of Brazil's. Nicklaus said the Olympic course can build golf in Brazil and across much of the world. ""I think the Olympics is the greatest thing that could happen to golf on an international basis,"" the American said in 2010, because it means governments will support the game by building courses that young people have access to, and some of those young people will turn to golf in search of glory. ""All the other parts of the world, if you look at the kids when they grow up, they don't know about the Masters or the British Open or the PGA. They know about a gold medal. And the gold medal is the best you can get in a sport,"" Nicklaus said. ""We have one chance for golf as an Olympic sport to stay in the Olympics. ... So we've got to put our best foot forward. We've got to get the best golf course."" In an interview with the Golf Channel, Norman emphasized the big responsibility taken on by whoever gets the Rio contract. ""Whoever gets the golf course design job, they have to be the spokesperson for golf in the Olympics, because golf is only in for 2016. It hasn't been voted in for 2020. ""So whoever gets the job has to be beating the drum for the game of golf for the IOC for four years after that. They have to be a staunch proponent of the game of golf,"" Norman said. And Norman echoed Nicklaus on the accessibility of the course. ""It has to be a course built for the general public at the end of the day. It can't be a private golf club,"" Norman said. On his website, Player said he sees the Olympic course as an opportunity to grow the game around the world. ""The Olympics will expose millions of people in non-traditional golf markets to the game, and that is great for the sport,"" Player said. ""This facility can, and should be, a catalyst for golf in Brazil long after the Olympic competition is complete."" Whichever group wins the Olympic bid, Norman says, they won't be doing it to make money. And that's true. Organizers will pay $300,000 for the course design. Golf was last an Olympic event at the 1904 games in St. Louis, with Canada's George Lyon winning the gold medal. Golf was also played at the 1900 Games in Paris. There was no women's competition in golf in those games, but there will be in Rio. When making a pitch to Olympic organizers to include golf for 2016, a younger LPGA star, Hawaii's Michelle Wie, emphasized what it could mean to kids. ""For so many boys and girls around the world, their heroes have been Olympic athletes. Until today, I never thought there was any chance that I could share in that dream,"" Wie said.","Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Gary Player among eight finalists to design Olympic course .

"(CNN) -- It was only a year and a half ago that a phenomenon swept the globe and made basketball fans a little, well, ""Linsane."" Remember that? Back then, Jeremy Lin had a historic run that led the New York Knicks on a winning streak, dubbed ""Linsanity."" Crowds fell for the feel-good story of an overlooked bench-warmer who slept on friends' sofas to take a shot in the NBA. A new documentary takes a look at the life of Jeremy Lin before the madness. ""Linsanity,"" out in select theaters October 4, offers a glimpse of Lin's road to stardom: He was a standout basketball player in summer leagues, competed in a tightly contested high school state championship and faced racial epithets as an Ivy League athlete before landing, undrafted, in the professional league. From the documentary, it's clear the 25-year-old Lin was used to being an underdog, and overcame his share of challenges with a deep faith and persistent spirit. ""I'm always trying to have a good time, joking around, goofy,"" he said. ""I think I try not to take anything really too seriously."" In this edited conversation, CNN spoke to Lin, now with the Houston Rockets, about how his faith sustains him, what he learned from his months in the brightest spotlight and how he responds to racism. CNN: What did you learn from Linsanity? Lin: I learned a lot of things. I learned ... about how fame and success, worldly success, are great, but they are empty in a lot of different ways, and I think I learned that emptiness through Linsanity. I also learned you know, how fun it can be and I remember how fun it was to play basketball and to play at that level and to play with my teammates. That was definitely a lifelong memory as well. CNN: When some think of professional sports, there's obviously the hard work and teamwork, but it also has a reputation for hype and kind of bragging rights. It's a contrast to the characteristics of humility taught in Christianity. How do you balance the two roles as a competitive player, and a faithful Christian? Lin: I think there's definitely a delicate balance that you need to be aware of, but I think at the end of the day, you can be confident in your own abilities and you can understand this is what I'm good at, this is what has gotten me here. But at the same time you can also understand that it's a team game and that no one man is above another person and there's still a way you need to treat your coaches and teammates, your opponents, the fans, the refs: being able to have a humble demeanor and be able to treat everyone with respect. I think there are certain players who, when they become really good, they look down on other people. And there are certain players, when they are really good, they bring and elevate the level of their teammates and their entire team and they bring everybody up with them. CNN: Speaking of building a life God has called you to live, what were some of your go-to scriptures, stories or prayers that helped you through difficult moments? Lin: Through difficult moments I'd say Romans 5:3-5 and Romans 8:28 talk about just being able to deal with really tough situations in life and being able to have peace beyond circumstances. And I think in terms of just playing basketball in my career, I think the story of Peter walking on water really jumps out to me -- how, when his eyes were focused on Jesus, he was able to walk on water, but the minute the waves came and the wind came and he got distracted, he lost his footing. That kind of represents the distractions of the world, and I think the good part of the story is Jesus reaches down and picks him up, and I think that's very indicative of our relationship, and our life on earth. CNN: You've spoke about the racism you faced as a top basketball player being overlooked kind of at every instance of your career. How do you respond to it now, versus when you were younger? Lin: When I was younger, I let it affect me, I let it boil inside of me. And now I just kind of just brush it off. I'm used to it, you know, and when someone's not racist or when I don't have to deal with racism, it's actually a pleasant surprise, I'm like, ""Oh, wow, that's really cool."" So, it's just something that I've learned to embrace -- like this is just the world that we live in, and it's OK. I think everybody has their preconceptions and that's OK. And I think that just as long as we're constantly evolving in terms of our understanding and our perspective, as long as we do that, I think we're on the right path. CNN: What did you think you would do if you didn't play professional basketball? Do you ever think about life after the NBA and what that looks like? Lin: Afterward, I probably want to do some type of Christian ministry, or do some type of nonprofit work. That's probably what I'd be doing if I wasn't playing basketball right now.","The documentary ""Linsanity"" is out in select theaters October 4 .

"(CNN) -- The pugnacious style of Tony Abbott, the winner of Australia's election, has played well with the electorate. He may have run a gaffe-prone campaign against the bookish Kevin Rudd, the incumbent Labor prime minister, but his knockabout style, which harkens back to older, safer times, proved popular with an electorate exhausted by years of Labor infighting. Having successfully deflected accusations of sexism -- dismissing a campaign gaffe in which he lauded a Liberal female candidate for her ""sex appeal"" as a ""dad moment"" -- Abbott has presented himself as an unreconstructed male who loves his sport and beer. In Australia's current social climate, which some have attacked for being increasingly insular, self-absorbed and xenophobic, Abbott's bruising confrontational style has hit a rich seam. Politics might be a tough profession, but in few places is it as bruising as in Australia where mudslinging and name-calling occur on an almost daily basis. Some exchanges in Australian parliament are almost the stuff of folk legend. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating (1991-96), when pressed to name an election date, told the leader of the opposition he wouldn't reveal the date because, ""I want to do you slowly."" More recently, the former Australian leader recently ousted Rudd, Julia Gillard gave the opposition a spirited lecture in sexism that went viral and even drew praise from U.S. President Barack Obama. But not since leader of the Labor opposition Mark Latham broke a taxi driver's arm in a dispute over a cab fare in 2001 have Australians had the chance to elect a real brawler as premier. Latham's bid for prime minister failed, but in Abbott, the leader of the Liberal-National Coalition, the country may have found a natural successor. Combative in debate and with the media, Abbott may have shown little of his predecessors' verbal flair -- recent gaffes had him talking about the ""suppository,"" rather than the repository, ""of all wisdom"" -- but he has displayed the kind of dogged aggression that Australians like to see in their sportsmen. The boxer . A former Rhodes Scholar who won an Oxford Blue in boxing, he allegedly punched the wall either side of the head of a female political rival during his student days in the 1970s. Abbott claims the incident ""never happened."" For one former alumni from his Jesuit secondary school St. Ignatius' College, Riverview, in Sydney, the episode would not have been out of character. ""All I remember is his rictus grin and the rolled-up sleeves of his short-sleeved shirt, giving his biceps something to rub up against,"" the former classmate, who now works in the Hong Kong banking industry, told CNN. ""What struck me was the raw emotion he could elicit just by being him. You could pour an enormous bucket on him, and he was not only impervious in terms of being hurt but would grin back at you and give it back -- with compound interest and probably a compound fracture,"" he added. While Abbott is a polarizing figure to the electorate, the socially conservative politician is known to hold complex views in some areas of policy. READ MORE: Internet, economy and boat people key issues in Australian election . He has been known to defend areas of Medicare -- the country's national health system normally championed by the Labor Party -- and even opposed his own party on industrial relations reform, arguing that it was too harsh on workers. Early beginnings . Born in England in 1957 to an Australian mother and an English-born father, he graduated in economics and law from Sydney University where he became involved in the rough and tumble world of student politics. Avowedly right-wing at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy on campuses was deeply left-wing, Abbott, according to one of his biographers Michael Duffy, was beaten up at a student conference. Briefly training as a Catholic priest before working variously as a concrete contractor and as a journalist for The Australian newspaper, he entered politics in 1994 when he was elected to represent the affluent Warringah district of Sydney. Under former Prime Minister John Howard's government, he served as an employment minister between 1998 and 2001, and as minister for health and aging in 2003. In 2009, he narrowly beat then leader Malcolm Turnbull in a party leadership vote, winning 42 votes to Turnbull's 41. He also polled well in Australia's 2010 general election, which was called following Gillard's ouster of Rudd as prime minister, denying the government a majority and delivering a hung parliament that Gillard's government could only hold together with the support of independents. Labor Party infighting boosted Abbott's standing in the polls and -- under Gillard -- the Labor Party faced certain defeat at elections this year. While the installation of Rudd as prime minister for a second time has clawed back some of the ground Labor lost under Gillard, many analysts say his arrival has come too late to save the Australian Labor Party. Catholic values, populist instincts . Abbott supports lower taxes, smaller government and tough border controls and backs the government's policy of processing asylum seekers -- many of them illegal boat arrivals -- offshore. He recently announced that almost 32,00 asylum seekers who already in Australia will never be granted permanent settlement. He has also pushed a ""tow-back"" policy that would see asylum seekers' boats turned around when it is safe to do so. Dismissing the climate debate as faddish and fashionable, Abbott has vowed to roll back the controversial carbon tax put in place by Gillard, which he has condemned as ""socialism masquerading as environmentalism."" He has pledged to get rid of the 30% mining tax introduced by Labor, saying that it is a serious disincentive to investment in Australia's booming commodities sector. READ MORE: How Australia's prime ministerial candidates view China . On social issues, he has remained true to his Catholic faith, consistently voting against relaxing abortion laws, same-sex marriage and stem cell research. He has stated that he wants abortions to be ""safe, legal and rare."" As health minister in 2005, he opposed the use of the abortion drug RU486, but it was later overturned by parliament. Australian journalist David Marr, author of Abbott's latest biography ""The Making of Tony Abbott,"" says the leading contender to become Australia's next prime minister is nothing if not the sum total of his contradictions. ""He is a highly successful, aggressive, populist politician but all throughout his career he has argued there is another side to him -- that there is a deep commitment to values -- and they are very traditional Catholic values,"" he told ABC's Question Time. However, he added that while his values informed his political views, he was able to shift and adapt them to prevailing political reality. ""There's no occasion in his political career where those values have stood in the way of his politics. When it comes down to it, Tony Abbott is an absolutely secular politician.""","Tony Abbott, next Australian prime minister, is well known for his pugnacious style .

"Seattle (CNN) -- David Wing-Kovarik and his partner, Conrad, were ready to adopt a child. They moved through all their requirements smoothly, even completing an orientation and training course for prospective parents. Then they were confronted with their first real stumbling block. ""Our adoption agent said, 'Well, you both look the same on paper, so who's going to be the parent?'"" Wing-Kovarik recalls. In Arizona, where the couple lived at the time, only individuals and legally married couples may adopt from the U.S. foster care system. But because a same-sex couple cannot legally marry in the state, only one parent can be granted legal rights to the child. ""We saw (it) as a disadvantage to the child,"" said Wing-Kovarik, 47. ""We, frankly, got very angry about it when we thought about everybody else that was in the (training) class. None of them were asked this question. And it came down to the fact that we were a male couple. This was when we first experienced how being that gay couple just adds to the complexity of the whole process. It makes it much harder."" In 18 states and the District of Columbia, same-sex couples can jointly petition to adopt a child. But in the other states, such as Arizona, the law either restricts joint adoption or is unclear. That only adds confusion and frustration to what is already a ""mind-numbing"" adoption process, Wing-Kovarik said. ""It makes your head spin with the questions that are asked of you, with the forms that you have to fill out,"" he said. ""And then you have on top of that the fact that your family might not be that mom-and-dad home. You're that gay or lesbian family ... and the questions begin to change."" Wing-Kovarik and his partner did their homework and were eventually able to adopt two sibling boys after relocating to Seattle for Conrad's new job. But it was a long, arduous and invasive process, one that scares off many other potential parents, Wing-Kovarik said. ""It becomes a daunting experience,"" he said. ""It's why the families don't always come forward, because they think they're going to be rejected."" And to him, that is unacceptable with 107,000 boys and girls waiting for adoption in the United States. ""When you lose that family, you lose an opportunity for a child,"" he said. ""They need help. ... That child sitting in foster care year after year after year is not going to their social worker and saying, 'I only want a mom-and-dad home.' "" Determined to help other families deal with the same obstacles that he had faced, Wing-Kovarik started a nonprofit, Families Like Ours. It began as a simple online resource for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people wanting to foster or adopt. But as word spread about its growing expertise and its success in helping foster placements and adoptions, more diverse people started coming to the group for help. ""It doesn't matter if you're gay, straight, pink, purple, orange, polka-dotted, from Mars, from the moon or any other place,"" Wing-Kovarik said. ""If you think you can make a difference with these kids, you should be stepping forward to do this. ... ""It's unacceptable that families are faced with barriers that are put in their way because of a myth, a misunderstanding, miscommunication ... preventing a child from having a family just because (other people) just don't like what that family looks like."" Wing-Kovarik estimates that his group has helped thousands of families -- both gay and straight -- by offering a range of services such as lawyer referrals, case consultations, special-needs classes and tips on therapists and pediatricians. With the help of a nationwide network of volunteers -- many of whom have benefited from the group in the past -- everything is free. ""Families contact us and say, 'I want to do this, how do I do this?' We do two things: find out the answer and figure out how it really works for their specific situation, because they are never the same,"" Wing-Kovarik said. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . According to the state of Washington, more than 75% of families who have attended a training class through Wing-Kovarik's group have gone on to be placed with a foster child. ""That is much higher than other agencies,"" said Paulette Caswell, adoption and permanency supervisor for the state's Department of Social and Health Services. Wing-Kovarik has also become a preferred trainer of the state, training nearly 250 families a year since 2002. ""He has a unique perspective, and families connect to this,"" Caswell said. ""And (David's work) is done for truly altruistic reasons. There is no cost to the state for it. We have others that support us and do a lot of work, but we tend to pay for that service. Families Like Ours does it through donations and grants, and he hasn't been paid in years. That's pretty extraordinary."" Kevin Broderick, a single, gay man, called Families Like Ours when he encountered difficulty finalizing the adoption of his now 13-year-old son, Michael. ""I am 100% sure that if it weren't for David, I would not have my son,"" Broderick said. ""He understands how things should go, but also when they don't go right, how can we get them back on track? He figured out how to get us over that finish line."" In 2007, the Williams Institute of the UCLA School of Law estimates that there were 65,500 adopted children living with a gay parent in the United States. Wing-Kovarik says these homes are really not all that different from traditional mom-and-dad households. ""We're a two-dad home,"" he said. ""On the surface, does it look different? Sure. But when we're at home, does it look any different than anybody else? No. We argue and fight with the kids to get their homework done and brush their teeth and take a shower and brush their hair. 'Put your shoes on the right feet!' 'Is your backpack packed?' 'Why is your lunch sitting on the floor when the dog is eating it?' Well, that's the same thing everybody else complains about."" Wing-Kovarik has had his two boys, Chris and Shawn, since 2002, and he can't imagine sitting idle while there are so many other foster children who are still stuck in the system. ""Thinking of all of the other Chris and Shawns that are in foster care, and not knowing what's going to happen to them ... I can't just walk away from that. ... ""It's not my job to go in and guarantee what the life of that child's going to be. It's simply my job to make sure that child has some sort of hope. ... We're going to make this match, and we're going to move forward. And that kid's going to have as productive a life as we can help that kid have."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Love him or loathe him, controversial striker Luis Suarez proved just why Liverpool find it hard to live without him. The mercurial Uruguayan returned to reignite Liverpool's Premier League campaign as the Reds moved up to second with a 3-1 victory over Sunderland. Suarez was playing in his first league game since serving a 10 match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic last April. But Sunday was a day of celebrations not recriminations as Suarez dedicated his two goals to his newborn son Benjamin. After collecting Daniel Sturridge's pass across the box to slot in his first goal, Suarez lifted his Liverpool top to reveal a t-shirt dedicated to his wife, daughter and new son ""Benja."" A black vest top bearing the same message was proudly on display when Sturridge and Suarez repeated their feat on the break in the closing stages of the match. Suarez needed just one touch as he stroked in his strike partner's cross in the 88th minute. Sturridge was the first name on the score sheet at the Stadium of Light when he bundled in Steven Gerrard's corner in the first half. The ball glanced off the England striker's arm and into the net but the incident was not deemed to be a deliberate hand ball by the match officials and the goal stood. Sunderland, playing their first match since manager Paolo di Canio was axed seven days ago, may have felt luck was not quite on their side. Italian summer signing Emanuele Giaccherini raced on to a loose ball, scoring early in the second half to give Sunderland hope. The home side pressed on, creating chances, but interim manager Kevin Ball had to watch another defeat from the sidelines for England's rock bottom club. Sunderland continue the season still searching for a first win. In Sunday's first Premier League match, Norwich City earned a 1-0 away win at Stoke City thanks to a solitary goal from Jonathan Howson. The midfielder sent a dipping low drive from 25 yards out past Stoke keeer Asmir Begovic. Stoke had a penalty appeal turned down in the second half when Leroy Fer appeared to pull back Kenwyne Jones inside the area. ""It's a penalty,"" said Stoke manager Mark Hughes after the match. ""But we're not going to hide behind that decision. ""If we're honest, Norwich deserved to win because we didn't do enough."" In Italy, Juventus came out on top in the Turin derby with a slender 1-0 victory over hometown rivals Torino. France midfielder Paul Pogba nodded in a second half header to keep Juve level on points with Serie A leaders Napoli. Inter Milan were on the verge of closing the gap on the league leaders before Radja Nainggolan equalized for Cagliari, meaning Inter had to settle for a 1-1 draw.","Liverpool move up to second in English Premier League with 3-1 win over Sunderland .

"(CNN) -- The hostage standoff between Philippines forces and separatist rebels is over, a military spokesman said Friday. Government forces killed 15 of the rebels and rescued six hostages in fighting that began Thursday and lasted into early Friday, Armed Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Ramon Zagala said. The freed hostages told troops they believe no one else is being held by the separatist group, the Moro National Liberation Front, which took 180 people hostage in the coastal city of Zamboanga more than two weeks ago. Efforts to negotiate the hostages' release failed, resulting in intense bursts of fighting that had left 158 people dead as of Thursday, including 125 members of the MNLF, the government-run Philippines News Agency said. Troops have captured 186 rebels and are now in a clearing operation to sweep the region of any remaining rebels, Zagala said. ""We have severely diminished the numbers of the faction, but we will not rest until we have cleared the area,"" he said. The rebels are part of the MNLF, a separatist movement founded in 1971 by Nur Misuari with the aim of establishing an autonomous region for Muslims in the mainly Catholic Philippines. The MNLF signed a peace deal with the central government in Manila in 1996, but some of its members have broken away to continue a violent campaign. At least 3 dead in Philippines bombing .

"MALE, Maldives (CNN) -- The new president of the Maldives wants to relocate -- his entire country. Much of Male, capital of the Maldives, was flooded following the 2004 tsunami. Mohamed ""Anni"" Nasheed, a former political prisoner, was sworn in Tuesday after he unseated Asia's longest-serving leader in the country's first multi-party elections two weeks ago. He inherits an island nation with several problems. Foremost among them: the very likely possibility that the Maldives will sink under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. The Maldives is an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands located south-southwest of India. Most of the islands lie just 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) above sea level. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches (18 cm) by the end of the century. The island was badly hit by the December 2004 tsunami, which killed an estimated 273,800 people and left thousands missing across Asia and Africa. In the Maldives itself, at least 82 people were killed and 26 unaccounted for from a population just over 270,000, according to the Maldives Disaster Management Center. Sixty-nine islands were completely flooded and a further 30 islands half flooded. The capital of Male was also flooded, although sea walls protected it from further devastation. The government has calculated that creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country would cost too much.  Watch Maldives president vow to save the nation. » . And so the tourist nation, which has white sandy beaches that lure well-heeled Westerners, wants to set aside some of the $1 billion a year it receives from tourism and spend that money on buying a new homeland. ""We will invest in land,"" Nasheed said. ""We do not want to end up in refugee tents if the worst happens."" Nasheed's government has said that it has broached the idea with several countries and found them to be ""receptive."" Lands owned by Sri Lanka and India are possibilities because the countries have similar cultures, cuisine and climate as the Maldives. Australia is also being considered because of the vast unoccupied land it owns. Climate change is not the only challenge the new president will have to tackle, though. Other thorny issues include rising unemployment, corruption and a staggering drug epidemic. By some estimates, one of every three Maldivian youth uses drugs. Maldivians also worry that their tiny secular nation of 370,000 Muslims could fall prey to the reach of Islamic radicals. A bombing in Male, attributed to Islamic extremists, wounded 12 tourists in September 2007. ""We have made many pledges,"" Nasheed said in his inaugural address. ""The citizens gave their majority vote to us to implement these."" Nasheed said he will work to bring affordable housing and medical care for everyone. Twenty-one percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Nasheed, a 41-year-old one-time journalist, was among the fiercest critics of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who came to power in 1978 and ruled the Maldives for 30 years. He won the six previous elections as the only candidate on the ballot. Nasheed contended that Gayoom ruled with an iron fist, crushing dissent, amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives. Gayoom's critics say his government enforced a system of 'apartheid' tourism that banned most Maldivians from nearly 90 luxury resorts. Shortly before election day, an auditors' report said that millions of dollars were improperly accounted for by Gayoom's government. He disputed the findings. Nasheed was arrested several times in the last 15 years and held as a political prisoner. Five candidates challenged Gayoom for the presidency in elections held on October 9. Gayoom said he needed a seventh five-year term to see through the reforms he put in place. But critics said Gayoom instituted democratic reforms -- and legalized political parties -- only after violent protests in 2004 and 2005. Nasheed and Gayoom ended up in a runoff -- with Nasheed winning 54 percent of the votes to Gayoom's 46 percent in the October 28 race. ""No other citizens in the world in modern times have changed a 30-year-old regime so peacefully,"" Nasheed said in address. As the clock struck 12 a.m. Tuesday, Gayoom quietly exited the presidential office. ""I deeply regret any actions on my part ... (that) led to unfair treatment, difficulty or injustice for any Maldivian,"" he said in a farewell speech. ""From anyone who had had to face any such unfair treatment, difficulty or injustice, I sincerely seek forgiveness."" Maldivians took to the streets in a celebration that carried into the wee hours of the morning. Residents danced to the beats of local bands and feasted on rice and mutton. They decked the cobbled roads of Male with the red-and-green flag of the Maldives and the yellow banner of Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party. ""We cannot believe that this is happening. I have spent more than half my life in exile in Sri Lanka,"" said Nasheed's close confidant Mohammed Naseem. Journalist Sumon K. Chakrabarti in Male and CNN's Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Newly sworn-in Maldives president vows to buy land to relocate entire nation .

"Missoula, Montana (CNN) -- The Montana newlywed accused of killing her husband by pushing him off a cliff has traded her bridal gown for an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs. Jordan Linn Graham, who's charged with second-degree murder, broke down in tears when her mom walked into a courtroom on Wednesday, but remained composed for most of the detention hearing. The 22-year-old's attorneys asked a judge to release her from jail and place her under home confinement with electronic monitoring. But prosecutors said she should remain behind bars, arguing that she had lied to authorities, tried to cover up the crime and was at risk of harming herself. The judge said he would rule on the matter by Thursday. Prosecutors say that Graham shoved Cody Johnson face-first off a steep cliff just eight days into their marriage. New details in the case emerged during Wednesday's hearing, including an argument from prosecutors that a fake e-mail account had been created just days after Johnson's death as part of what appeared to be an attempt to cover up the alleged killing. Graham and Johnson had been married just more than a week when an argument in early July allegedly escalated to a case of second-degree murder. If convicted, Graham will face life in prison. According to a criminal complaint, Graham told a friend she was having second thoughts about marrying Johnson. The complaint said the couple argued the night of July 7. Upset, they decided to go hiking in Glacier National Park in Flathead County, Montana, where they continued to fight. Graham told police that her husband grabbed her by the arm. She turned and removed his hand. ""Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,"" the complaint read. His body was discovered several days later. According to the complaint, Graham changed her story about what happened several times. Graham's attorney, Michael Donahoe, declined to comment on the case. ""Any time we asked Cody how the relationship was, he always said it was good,"" friend Cameron Fredrickson said. ""It's a complete shock to me. Cody is one of the greatest guys I've had the opportunity to know."" According to the complaint, Graham reportedly told a friend she planned to talk with Johnson about her reservations on July 7. The same day, Graham sent the friend a text message saying, ""Oh well, I'm about to talk to him."" The friend responded, ""I'll pray for you guys."" Graham wrote back: ""But dead serious if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened.""","NEW: Jordan Linn Graham's attorneys ask a judge to release her .

"(CNN) -- Shiping Bao, the medical examiner who changed his mind on crucial aspects during his testimony at George Zimmerman's trial, has been fired. But he's not going down without a fight. Bao has hired a lawyer and is hinting at a lawsuit. Bao was let go from his job as the associate medical examiner for the Volusia County, Florida, Medical Examiner's Office last week, officials said Wednesday. Authorities provided a copy of his termination letter, but did not specify a reason. The letter says Bao was given a choice to resign. He didn't. So, he was terminated Friday. Bao's lawyer filed a complaint against the county, CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 reported. The letter reads in part: .

"(CNN) -- After two successive defeats, and with his proud unbeaten home English Premier League record at stake, Jose Mourinho was never going to take any chances. The shock losses against Everton and Basel brought a brutal end to the Special One's second honeymoon at the club, and he responded by making the changes he thinks are necessary to overhauling the team's playing style. So neither Juan Mata, the club's two-time player of the year, nor the skilled-but-error-prone defender David Luiz even featured in Saturday's squad to face London rival Fulham. Back came captain John Terry, a defensive stalwart in Mourinho's first Chelsea reign but a peripheral figure last season, along with John Obi Mikel -- a defensive midfielder that the Blues worked so hard to steal from under the nose of Manchester United back in 2006. And those two combined to seal a 2-0 victory that ended a run of four games without a win, which had contributed to Chelsea's worst start to an EPL campaign since Russian owner Roman Abramovich took over in 2003. Terry headed down an 84th-minute corner and Mikel hooked the ball into the net -- the Nigerian's first league goal in 185 games. That relieved the pressure on Mourinho, indeed putting his team top of the table on goal difference ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby and other games involving top-four hopefuls Arsenal and Tottenham. This was Chelsea, which had more than $150 million worth of talent on the substitutes' bench, winning ugly. It came against a struggling Fulham team that has not won since the opening day of this season, and has not beaten Chelsea since March 2006 -- or won at Stamford Bridge since 1979. ""After a bad start that everybody kept telling me is the worst start for about a decade, today I go to bed and look at the table: nobody is in front of us,"" Mourinho said after the match, having extended his unbeaten home record in the EPL to 63 matches. ""I'm in football for a long time and when results are not good I'm not expecting people to speak well about our team. I'm building a different team, the most difficult thing is first to change the philosophy. That takes a little bit of time. ""We are not playing especially well, the results are not especially good, but the beauty of the Premier League is that everybody loses points, so no dramas. I have to say, I never worked so hard as I'm doing this season with this group of players."" Part of Mourinho's problem has been the dilemma of trying to find a place for his wealth of attacking talent. He made it clear before the match that he sees Oscar -- not Mata -- as his No. 10 behind the sole striker, and it was the Brazilian who settled Chelsea's nerves after a poor first half. Oscar netted his second goal this season in the 51st minute, scrambling in from close range after two less-than-convincing parries by visiting goalkeeper David Stockdale -- who, incidentally, was one of the few EPL players this weekend to wear rainbow laces in support of an anti-homophobia campaign. ""I want to play Mata and Oscar, but Juan has to work and adapt to a certain style of play because I'm not ready to change Oscar's position,"" Mourinho said. ""Juan has to learn to play the way I want to play, be more consistent."" With last week's 2-1 Champions League defeat at home to Swiss side Basel echoing the draw with Rosenborg that marked the end of his first Chelsea tenure in 2007, Mourinho has a lot of hard work to return to the glory days of his successive EPL crowns in his first two seasons at the club. ""The result was better than the result against Everton, but I think we played much better against Everton than we did today,"" he conceded. Meanwhile, previous leader Liverpool crashed to a 1-0 defeat at home to Southampton, its first reverse this season. Croatia international defender Dejan Lovren headed home Adam Lallana's corner eight minutes after halftime to clinch the visitors' second win this season, having been the last team to beat Liverpool in the league -- at home back in March. Everton built on the win over Chelsea by coming from behind to win 3-2 at West Ham, scoring twice after home midfielder Mark Noble was sent off to be the EPL's only unbeaten team with two wins and three draws . Noble had put West Ham 2-1 ahead with a penalty, but received a second booking with eight minutes to play -- which allowed England defender Leighton Baines to fire in a second superb free-kick. Two minutes later on-loan Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku headed in the winner, having come on as a halftime replacement, despite a collision with West Ham's Joey O'Brien that left the Belgium international needing lengthy treatment. Promoted Hull moved up to mid-table with a 3-2 win at Newcastle, thanks to a 76th-minute volley from Nigerian forward Sone Aluko. On-loan France striker Loic Remy had twice put Newcastle ahead, but his goals were canceled out by Robert Brady and Ahmed El Mohamady. Sunderland stayed bottom after a third successive defeat, with the club's former striker Stephane Sessegnon scoring West Brom's opening goal in a 3-0 victory. Aston Villa bounced back from three successive defeats by winning 1-0 at Norwich, as new Czech striker Libor Kozak netted the only goal after the home side's Robert Snodgrass missed a penalty.","Oscar and John Obi Mikel score in Chelsea's 2-0 win at home to Fulham .

"(CNN) -- The United States is expelling three Venezuelan diplomats, including the South American country's top envoy in Washington, the State Department said Tuesday night. Calixto Ortega, Venezuela's charge d'affaires in Washington, and two other diplomats have been declared personae non gratae in response to Venezuela's decision Monday to expel three U.S. diplomats, a State Department spokesperson said in a written statement provided to CNN. They have 48 hours to leave the United States. On Monday, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced he was expelling three U.S. diplomats and accused them of conspiring to destabilize his government. The Venezuelan leader accused the group of diplomats of meeting with right-wing political opponents of his government, financing their activities and encouraging them to sabotage the country's electrical system and its economy -- accusations that the State Department has repeatedly denied. ""It is regrettable that the Venezuelan government has again decided to expel U.S. diplomatic officials based on groundless allegations, which require reciprocal action. It is counterproductive to the interests of both our countries and not a serious way for a country to conduct its foreign policy,"" the State Department spokesperson said Tuesday. ""We completely reject the accounts of the Venezuelan government about any participation of the U.S. government in any type of conspiracy to destabilize the Venezuelan government."" In addition to Ortega, Monica Alejandra Sanchez Morales, second secretary at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, and Marisol Gutierrez de Almeida, Venezuelan consul in Houston, were also expelled. The U.S. announcement came hours after Maduro repeated his accusations in a nationally televised broadcast, showing what he said was security camera footage that showed the U.S. diplomats meeting with members of the opposition. As she prepared to leave Caracas on Tuesday, the top U.S. envoy told reporters the meeting was part of the U.S. Embassy's typical approach of talking with officials and members of civil society throughout the country. ""If we are not talking with these people, then we are not doing our jobs,"" said Kelly Keiderling, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Venezuela. ""If the accusation is that we met with Venezuelans, then we are guilty."" In March: U.S. expels 2 Venezuelan diplomats .","The U.S. declares three Venezuelan diplomats personae non gratae .

"London (CNN) -- It's a classic family scene. The proud parents showing off their new baby in the garden. A doting grandpa snapping photographs. Fine for Facebook or Instagram. But when the baby in question is the future British king, and the photos are the first official photos, it doesn't take long for the world to weigh in -- on their quality, no less. Most seem to agree that Michael Middleton, father of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and granddad to Prince George of Cambridge, should leave royal photography to the professionals. ""They are lovely snaps for a grandfather to have taken. But in terms of the quality, they are not really what you want for such a historic picture"" is the verdict of Eddie Mulholland, vice chairman of the British Press Photographers Association and a photographer for the Daily Telegraph. The Daily Mail describes Catherine and Prince William's decision to use ""one of proud grandpa Mike's happy family snaps"" as ""a startling break with tradition."" Most criticism zeroed in on the focus and the lighting -- always a challenge for amateur photographers not equipped with fancy flashes or reflectors. Prince William and Catherine, the latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanket, are posed on the lawn of her parents' home in Berkshire with the sun behind them, a difficult shot to pull off. ""I guess the reason Kate's father chose backlight was to avoid bright sun on little George,"" speculates the Mirror's royal photographer, Kent Gavin. He's happy to share some advice though. ""Back-lighting is always a little tricky for the non-professionals but it does give a nice result. Photographing against the sun needs a fill-in flash. Another option would be to use an area in shade away from harsh light."" His other tip? ""My professional view would be to see more of baby George."" 'Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles' The inclusion of the family pets -- the Cambridges' cocker spaniel Lupo and the Middletons' golden retriever Tilly -- in some of the snaps also gets a mixed reception. A reporter for The Times of London remarked that the official photographs came ""in a choice of formats: with or without dogs."" Mulholland, of the Telegraph, was more scathing. ""The photograph with the dogs is the worst. One of the dogs in the corner looks like a furry rug,"" he wrote. But the pictures got a more favorable write-up from some CNN readers who commented on the story. ""Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles and the world needs more smiles!"" said Earlypro. ""Its nice to see a family snap and not a professional one. Its a special time with a new baby I hope the press backs off and let them enjoy it,"" wrote Ann. The public also weighed in on Twitter. ""Who cares? The photos are beautiful and show a new family! I think it's great that 'Grandad' got to take the photos,"" tweeted MammaMia, a mother of two from the English West Midlands. ""I'm no royal watcher, but love choice new family made to release photos snapped by baby George grampa. Can u blame them?"" posted @MemoryMan Studios, a portrait studio in Dublin, Ireland. No 'feeling of grandeur' However, John Keatley, an editorial and celebrity photographer in Seattle, told CNN that taking such informal pictures jars the royal ""brand."" ""The amateur image that these photos put across certainly doesn't create the most grand or royal image in the viewer's mind,"" he said. ""They're decent photos. They're not terrible. But at the same time, they certainly don't have the same shine and pop and feeling of grandeur that you often see from official royal family photos."" He acknowledged that the family may have been trying to project a casual, informal image. But, he added, ""You can still make it casual. But this is just casual and poor quality. They didn't have to make a bad quality product to put that idea across."" Christopher Barr, a professional photographer in Arizona, agrees. ""It's obvious that a professional didn't take these. It hasn't been color-corrected. Even somebody with a modicum of Photoshop knowledge could improve these pictures immeasurably,"" he said. ""It's not a very good effort. It's a particularly poor effort given that he's taking pictures of such an important thing at such an important time."" But Lana Marks, a friend of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, told CNN's ""AC360"" show that she thinks William's mother would have been delighted by his approach. ""One of the things she told me is that she so much wanted William to have a normal life with his family in the future, with whoever he wed and had children with,"" she said. ""All of her dreams have come true and her legacy's coming true, and all the influences she's had on William, the normalcy, is showing through so greatly now. She would be immensely happy.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong authorities said Friday that they had confiscated $1.4 million worth of ivory that arrived smuggled in a shipping container from Africa, the second large seizure of tusks at the busy port in the past month. Customs officials discovered the 1,330 kilograms (about 2,900 pounds) of illegal ivory Thursday in a container from Tanzania that was marked as carrying sunflower seeds, authorities said. The 569 tusks, worth 10.56 million Hong Kong dollars (about $1.4 million U.S.), were in the back of the container, buried under hundreds of bags of the seeds. The Hong Kong government said customs officials are investigating the case and are still trying to find ""the smuggling syndicate members."" The container had been picked out for inspection based on ""risk assessment,"" authorities said. The seizure follows the roughly $3.4 million worth in ivory found in two shipping containers last month, one of the largest amounts ever seized in Hong Kong. Those containers arrived from Tanzania and Kenya, according to Hong Kong customs officials. The agency seized 1,209 pieces of ivory tusks and 3 pounds of ivory ornaments from the two containers, discovered over a period of two days. In that case, Hong Kong customs officials were on alert after a tip-off from officials in Guangdong, China. Read more: Priest embroiled in ivory smuggling controversy . Seven people, including one Hong Kong resident, were arrested by Chinese officials in connection with the case, authorities said at the time. Hong Kong is viewed as a transit point for the illegal ivory trade, feeding into increasing demands in China, according to a Time article published last month. Elephants are being killed in Africa at an alarming rate as international demand soars for ivory. Much of the demand comes from increasingly affluent Asian countries, particularly China and Thailand. Before this year, the most recent major bust in Hong Kong occurred in 2011, when officials seized a shipment of ivory and rhinoceros horns valued at $2.2 million Hong Kong dollars.

"(CNN) -- Maisah Sobaihi isn't just lifting the veil on the complicated love lives of Saudi Arabian women. She's smashing down the door to their homes and inviting you in for a cup of tea. When the playwright took her one-woman show to the Edinburgh Fringe last month, she became not just the first Saudi Arabian to perform at the prestigious British arts festival, but the first to reveal a mysterious world that isn't as different from the West as you might think. Against the painted backdrop of rambling Middle Eastern streets, Sobaihi takes her audience deep inside the hidden rooms of Saudi Arabian women, playing characters grappling with questions of love, marriage and divorce. It's a rare glimpse into an intensely private world. But since she first started performing ""Head over Heels in Saudi Arabia"" seven years ago, Sobaihi has been touched by the huge number of women telling her how much they associated with her characters -- regardless of whether they were from New York or Jeddah. ""In the beginning I was really surprised to hear that, because I was writing it in Saudi Arabia about myself and other women I knew,"" said Sobaihi. ""But I was also happy because I think at the end of the day the experiences of women are always connected somehow. And one of the objectives of the play is to create that strong dialogue for understanding."" Saudi stereotypes . When I meet Sobaihi in the dimly lit dining room of a stately London hotel, she is as serene as the paintings on the wall, yet with the same huge, mischievous eyes which bring so much life to her characters on stage. Later when I ask her age, she politely laughs off the question -- despite appearing strikingly youthful for a woman with two sons in their 20s. Swathed in ornate fabrics and wearing a simple headscarf, the elegant academic with American accent is anything but the stereotypical image of the hidden Arab woman. ""Saudi Arabia is mysterious to the West because we are very private culture,"" she said. ""And I think it's our responsibility to tell other women outside our world about our experiences, to break this mystery."" A laughing matter? For Sobaihi, the best way to crack open this unknown world is with laughter, using a wry playfulness on stage to explore the most intimate of relationships. In a nation where men can have more than one wife, one character deals with the prospect of her husband taking a second partner, by attempting to dig up dirt on her. Meanwhile, another character turns her back on the traditional notion of love, and a ""Saudi prince galloping in on his horse."" ""I prefer to take serious things and deal with them in a light-hearted way,"" said Sobaihi. ""I've had feedback from people who say it's enlightening. They don't know so much about Arab women in general -- and less so Saudi Arabian women. So it is an eye-opener."" ""But we cannot deny that we are a conservative culture and we are very sensitive to issues that could be viewed as...unconventional, so we tread carefully."" Conservative Culture . Born in Saudi Arabia, Sobaihi spent much of her childhood in California, before studying for a doctorate in English literature at the University of London. Today she is an assistant professor at King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah. But the deeply conservative kingdom isn't always an easy place for a divorced mother-of-two such as Sobaihi. This is a nation where women are banned from driving, and where male guardians grant permission for everything from traveling to opening a bank account. In the 2012 Global Gender Gap Report, Saudi Arabia was ranked fifth worst for equality of the 135 countries rated. However some reforms are on the way, with women allowed to enter parliament earlier this year, and set to get the vote in 2015. Female director Haifaa Al Mansour -- whose film ""Wadjda"" is the country's first nomination at the 2014 Oscars -- is one of an increasing number of ""firsts"" for women in recent years. ""When I was living as a divorcee there it was still hard,"" said Sobaihi. ""You have to deal with what society might think and because men are allowed more than one wife, women might fear you too. ""There is that perception that it is better to be married. But that is less and less now for younger women. There are many who chose to go on scholarships provided by the government -- I think in the U.S. we have 80,000 students studying."" When asked about the significance of her appearance at Edinburgh, Sobaihi remains modest, smiling broadly as she turns the question on me. ""On a personal level I'm lucky to be the first,"" she says. ""But I don't think I'll be the last.""","First Saudi Arabian woman performs at Edinburgh Fringe Festival .

"(CNN) -- Are you ready for some football? Not so fast! The Navy-Air Force and the Boston-Army games are on. But there's no word yet on whether 23 other weekend athletic events at service academies will take place, thanks to the government shutdown. Even the Navy-Air Force game practically became a matter of national security. Though the game was sold out, the two sides had to wait for the Defense Department's greenlight. A senior department official said the game was allowed to go forward because it involved all non-budgeted funds, and thus was not affected by the shutdown. The official said planning and preparation, including broadcast contracts, had already been in place for this week's game. It'll kick off at 11:40 a.m. Saturday at the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis, Maryland, and will be televised by CBS. The United States Naval Academy enters the contest with a 2-1 record, while United States Air Force Academy is 1-4. The winner of the last 13 encounters went on to win the Commander-In-Chief's Trophy. Other games uncertain . The future of other critical matchups this weekend is still up in the air.

"(CNN) -- Exploring the heavens with spaceships and fancy orbiting telescopes like the Hubble is pretty routine stuff for NASA. But the space agency is going low-tech to get a good look at an eagerly anticipated comet. The space agency plans to launch a balloon -- yes, a balloon -- to study Comet ISON, the much-hyped comet that many hope will put on a big sky show in coming months. Astronomers are scrambling to figure out ways to learn more about the comet, and that's where the balloon comes in. This isn't the kind of balloon you buy for kids at a party store, but they do have some things in common. NASA says its scientific balloons are made of polyethylene film like the material in plastic bags, and it will be filled with helium, just like a party balloon. But the NASA balloons can carry a payload weighing 8,000 pounds (3,600 kilograms), or about the weight of three small cars. It has a gondola to carry the instruments. Some similar balloons can fly up to 26 miles high and stay for up to two weeks. The 671-foot-tall balloon that will monitor ISON is called BRRISON, or Balloon Rapid Response for ISON. According to NASA, it will float about 120,000 feet above Earth to observe the comet -- and other science targets -- using a telescope and other instruments. It is expected to stay up from nine to 11 hours. ""By ascending above 99.5% of the Earth's atmosphere, BRRISON will be able to study the materials within the comet,"" Andy Cheng, principal investigator, said on BRISSON's website. ""It's possible that water and organic chemicals on comets may have played an important role in the evolution of life on Earth."" The launch, from NASA's Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, is targeted for 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, weather permitting. Comet ISON is nearing Mars on its way toward the sun and will fly about 730,000 miles above the sun's surface on November 8. If it survives, it could brighten and put on a big show as it passes Earth's orbit on its way back to the outer reaches of the solar system. Comet enthusiasts hope they will be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes. Its closest approach to Earth would be December 26, and it could be visible from the Northern Hemisphere for weeks in early 2014. Things to know about Comet ISON . The comet was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012. It is named after their night-sky survey program, the International Scientific Optical Network, a group of observatories in 10 countries organized to track objects in space. Amateur astronomers already are posting pictures and making calculations about the comet's future. For those who want to try to track Comet ISON themselves, NASA has some tips on its Comet ISON website.","A giant NASA balloon is being used to get a good look at Comet ISON .

The location every ""Pride and Prejudice"" fan wants to visit is, of course, Pemberley -- ""a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills,"" as Austen describes it. Just where to look for the house and grounds (and whether you're also looking for that all important lake, of course) depends which adaptation you favor: The 1995 TV version was filmed at Lyme Park in Cheshire (exterior scenes), and Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire (interior scenes). For many readers and viewers, the house which best corresponds to the Pemberley of their imagination is Chatsworth, in Derbyshire. Pride and Prejudice turns 200 . In the 2005 film, it is Chatsworth Keira Knightley that is referring to when she jokes that her love for Darcy dates from her ""first seeing his grounds at Pemberley,"" but Austen expert Janet Todd, of Cambridge University's Lucy Cavendish College, says this is a mistake. ""The great houses we see in the TV and film versions of 'Pride and Prejudice' are too great,"" she insists, arguing that by imagining the action of Jane Austen's novels taking place in such grand houses, we change their tone. ""Darcy is not the Duke of Devonshire [the owner of Chatsworth]; the owner of Chatsworth would not be seen at the Meryton Ball. Austen's stories are those of the middle class, the gentry, and not the upper class, the aristocracy."" Other locations to feature in the 2005 film include Burgley, and the village of Stamford in Lincolnshire; Haddon Hall in Derbyshire (which also features in three versions of ""Jane Eyre,"" ""The Princess Bride"" and ""The Other Boleyn Girl""); and Groombridge Place in Kent (which also has links to Arthur Conan Doyle, and Sherlock Holmes) which doubles for the Bennets' home, Longbourn. In the 1995 adaptation, the village of Lacock in Wiltshire stands in for Meryton, while nearby Luckington Court, in the Cotswolds, plays the part of Longbourn; scenes at Rosings, the imposing stately home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, were shot at Belton House in Lincolnshire. Bath . Bath is the city perhaps most closely associated with Jane Austen; it features prominently in two of her novels ('Northanger Abbey' and 'Persuasion'), and she lived here with her family from 1801 to 1806. In the Georgian era, it was a fashionable spa town, where the well-to-do came to 'take the waters' -- and to see and be seen, at the Assembly Rooms, the Pump Room, and the theater. Today, much of the city's Georgian architecture remains, making it almost as popular with film and TV crews making costume dramas as it is with tourists. Austen fans can visit the Jane Austen Centre, take the waters -- and then take their taste away with tea at the Pump Room -- and wander the streets that the novelist herself walked down: Royal Crescent, The Circus, Gay Street, Queen Square and Sydney Place, where Austen lived at Number 4. ""Parts of the city look the same as they did in Jane Austen's day,"" explains David Lassman, of the Jane Austen Centre, ""So visitors can see the same buildings she saw, get a sense of what it was like in her day, and walk in her footsteps."" VisitBath, the local tourism office, offers a free audio tour, ""In the footsteps of Jane Austen"" and there is also a Jane Austen Tour of Bath iPhone app, guiding visitors around the city using photos, paintings, Regency music and quotes from her work and letters. Hampshire . Jane Austen was born and brought up in the Hampshire village of Steventon, where her father was the local vicar. Her birthplace, the rectory, no longer exists, but there are several memorials to Austen in St Nicholas' Church, including a weathervane in the shape of a pen. Austen spent the last eight years of her life at Chawton, and it was here, in the red brick cottage where she lived with her mother and sister that she revised her earlier works for publication, and wrote ""Mansfield Park,"" ""Emma"" and ""Persuasion."" The cottage is now a museum of Austen's life and work, home to family portraits, manuscripts, and the table at which she wrote some of her most famous work. In 1817, Austen became ill, and was persuaded to travel to Winchester to be close to her doctor; she stayed in a house in College Street (now marked with a plaque), and died there on July 18, 1817, aged 41. She was buried in the north aisle of Winchester Cathedral; her gravestone makes no mention of her career as a writer, instead reading: ""The benevolence of her heart, the sweetness of her temper and the extraordinary endowments of her mind obtained the regard of all who knew her and the warmest love of her intimate connections."" A brass tablet recognizing her literary talents was added in 1872, and her final resting place was celebrated in a poem by Rudyard Kipling: ""Jane lies in Winchester, blessed be her shade! Praise the Lord for making her, and her for all she made."" Have you visited any of these spots, or do you have any suggestions for must-see Austen locations?

"Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer was robbed last week by an intruder armed with a machete while Breyer was vacationing on the Caribbean island of Nevis, court officials said Monday. Breyer, his wife and two other guests were in the justice's vacation home at the time, but officials said no one was hurt in the incident. The male assailant took $1,000 in cash and fled the scene, according to court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg. The robbery was reported to local authorities shortly after it happened last Thursday night, and local media said no arrests had been made as of Monday. A law enforcement official said the evidence so far indicates the incident was ""a crime of opportunity,"" and that police have seen nothing so far to indicate Breyer was targeted for robbery. The U.S. Marshals Service provides protection for members of the high court when they are traveling, and agency spokesman Jeff Carter said Monday that the marshals service ""is aware of the incident involving Justice Breyer on the Caribbean island of Nevis and is assisting the Supreme Court Police and local law enforcement authorities with the investigation as needed."" He did not elaborate. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said, ""We are assisting the local police with their investigation."" Meanwhile, police on the island were ""actively searching for a known person of interest,"" Commissioner C.G. Walwyn of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force said Monday. ""Our American-trained crime scene investigators and the members of our Criminal Investigators (unit) are working closely with the FBI on this case,"" he added. Breyer had no comment on the matter, and the court would not say if he had returned to the United States. The high court is in recess this week, but the justices have scheduled a closed-door meeting Friday to go over pending court business, and they resume public sessions next week. Nevis is part of the West Indies chain known as the Leeward Islands, located about 350 miles southeast of Puerto Rico. The court does not talk publicly about specific security arrangements for the justices, either when they are at home or on their frequent travels. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg traveled to Egypt and Tunisia last month as part of an outreach program sponsored by the State Department, which provided her security in the volatile region. Attacks on members of the federal judiciary are not new. Then-Justice David Souter was assaulted by a group of young males in 2004 while jogging alone in the evening near his Washington home. Souter suffered some minor bruises and was briefly treated then released from a local hospital. Justice Byron White was attacked in July 1982 while giving a speech in Utah. That incident led to regular protection by U.S. marshals for members of the court when they travel. The 73-year-old Breyer was nominated to the high court in 1994, and is known as one of the most active and engaging members of the court. His wife is Dr. Joanna Breyer, a renowned pediatric psychologist. CNN's Nigel Walwyn and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Police official calls incident ""crime of opportunity""

"Washington (CNN) -- Young illegal immigrants can start applying on August 15 for two-year deferrals from deportation, but will have to pay $465 in fees, a top immigration official announced Friday. The announcement provided the first details of the Obama administration's policy change announced June 15 that provides some illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children a path to an employment authorization card without fear of getting deported. Under the new policy, people younger than 30 who came to the United States before the age of 16, pose no criminal or security threat, and were successful students or served in the military can get a two-year deferral from deportation as well as an employment authorization card. Participants must be able to prove they have lived continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007 -- five years before the change was announced -- and must have entered the country without inspection or had their lawful immigration status expire. Young immigrants prepare for new U.S. deportation policy . Alejandro Mayorkas, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the application process will include providing biometric information and undergoing a background check. Applicants who commit fraud in the application process, pose a security threat or have been convicted of serious crimes will be ineligible and subject to prosecution, he said. In all other cases, according to Mayorkas, information submitted in the application process will not be used for immigration enforcement. A senior administration official told reporters on background that the goal is to maximize participation by eligible young illegal immigrants, so a strong privacy policy is important. Other details announced Friday made clear that while successful applicants would avoid deportation for two years, there is no mechanism involved that would speed up or ease their path to full citizenship. Conservative critics of the new policy said it amounted to a ""backdoor"" amnesty by the Obama administration to appease Hispanic supporters angered by the lack of comprehensive immigration reform since the president took office. The policy change was in essence an administrative step to mimic some provisions of the DREAM Act backed by Obama and Democrats that was blocked by Republicans in Congress. Opinion: Indiana gets real on immigration . In announcing the change on June 15, Obama said it will make immigration policy ""more fair, more efficient and more just."" Noting children of illegal immigrants ""study in our schools, play in our neighborhoods, befriend our kids, pledge allegiance to our flag,"" Obama said that ""it makes no sense to expel talented young people who are, for all intents and purposes, Americans."" However, Obama and other administration officials said Congress still needs to pass the DREAM Act and tackle immigration reform because the policy change in June was designed to address an immediate need, rather than be a permanent solution. The change was part of a Department of Homeland Security effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a serious threat, such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now, officials say. By halting deportations of younger immigrants who pose no threat, the department hopes to unclog a backlog of 300,000 immigration cases. In addition, the election-year move was widely praised by Hispanic-American leaders, many of whom previously criticized Obama for an overall increase in deportations of illegal aliens since he took office. In 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 396,906 illegal immigrants, the largest number in the agency's history. The Hispanic-American vote is vital to Obama's chances for winning re-election in November. In the conference call Friday with reporters, the senior administration official said the fees charged for applications are intended to cover the cost of implementing the policy change. No general fee waiver exists, but an exemption may be granted in exceptional cases, such as homelessness or disabilities, the official said. The official also warned people that applications will only be accepted starting August 15, and warned that anyone who offers to expedite the process or start it earlier would be unauthorized and likely running a scam.

"(CNN) -- The UK government is appealing for a buyer to ensure a rare piece of jewelry that once belonged to the author Jane Austen remains in Britain. The gold and turquoise ring is one of just three pieces of jewelry in existence known to have belonged to Austen, the 19th century author of novels including ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Emma."" American singer Kelly Clarkson bought the ring when it was auctioned last year, Jane Austen's House Museum, in Chawton, southern England, said. Auction house Sotheby's listed the sale price as £152,450 ($231,227). UK Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has placed a temporary export bar on the ring ""on the grounds that it is so closely connected with [Britain's] history and national life that its departure would be a misfortune,"" the Department for Culture said. The temporary bar means Clarkson is unable to take the ring outside the UK. While she is not required to sell the ring, Vaizey could refuse her an export license --making the restriction permanent. Read more: Walking in the footsteps of Jane Austen . A spokesman for the Arts Council -- responsible for developing arts and culture in England -- said: ""The original buyer does not have to sell the ring to an interested UK buyer if one were to make a serious intention to buy, but should they make this choice the Minister will take into consideration any refusal to accept a matching offer when a decision is made as to whether an export license should be granted. The export license would normally be refused."" If an individual were to buy the ring, they would have to put it on public display in a gallery, museum, or archive for a minimum of 100 days each year, he said. ""Jane Austen's modest lifestyle and her early death mean that objects associated with her of any kind are extremely rare, so I hope that a UK buyer comes forward so this simple but elegant ring can be saved for the nation,"" Vaizey said in a statement. Austen died in 1817 at the age of 41. In its July 2012 catalog, Sotheby's said the ring was being sold with notes detailing its provenance, including one written by Jane Austen's sister-in-law, Eleanor Austen, to her niece, Caroline. The note -- dated 1863 -- reads: ""My dear Caroline. The enclosed Ring once belonged to your Aunt Jane. It was given to me by your Aunt Cassandra as soon as she knew that I was engaged to your Uncle. I bequeath it to you. God bless you!"" 'An intimate possession' The Department for Culture said Jane Austen had ""placed great significance on jewellery's link to personal relationships both in her life and in her novels."" Its statement continued: ""It is precisely because Jane Austen understood the social and emotional nuances which could be associated with a piece of jewelry, and because jewelry has such potency as an intimate possession, that the ring aroused huge interest when it was auctioned last year."" The ring's £152,450 sale price was more than five times the estimate placed on it by Sotheby's. The other two items of jewelry known to have belonged to Austen -- a topaz cross and a turquoise and ivory bracelet -- are on display at the Austen museum, in Chawton, southern England, where the author spent the last eight years of her life. Read more: 200 years of 'Pride and Prejudice' Museum spokeswoman Isabel Snowden said Austen's brother Charles had bought her and her sister Cassandra each a topaz cross from Navy prize money he received for work recovering a pirated ship. In Austen's novel ""Mansfield Park,"" heroine Fanny Price is also given a cross by her brother. ""That's the most direct link she's put in her novel,"" Snowden said. ""We'd love the ring to be on display on the museum and it would be fantastic if the funds were able to be raised. ""It's one of the few surviving pieces of jewelry Jane Austen owned. So it's really important."" The decision on the export license will be deferred until September 30 this year and can be extended until December 30 ""if a serious intention to raise funds to purchase the ring"" is made. 'Waverley criteria' Britain's secretary of state for culture -- currently Vaizey -- is advised by a committee of experts on which objects should be refused export licenses, based on the ""Waverley criteria."" The criteria are whether an object is so closely connected with Britain's history that its departure would be a misfortune, whether it is of outstanding aesthetic importance or of outstanding significance for the study or art, learning or history. Fans around the world celebrated the 200th anniversary of one of Austen's most well-known novels -- ""Pride and Prejudice"" -- in January this year, and on July 24 the Bank of England marked Austen's significance in English literary history by revealing that her image would appear on the £10 banknote. Read more: Americans lack a paper money woman . Announcing the decision, Reserve Bank Governor Mark Carney Governor said: ""Jane Austen certainly merits a place in the select group of historical figures to appear on our banknotes. Her novels have an enduring and universal appeal and she is recognized as one of the greatest writers in English literature."" The Department for Culture also announced export bans on three other items in its most recent statement. They are a racing car known as a ""Bentley Blower"" -- worth £5,149,800 -- an archive of letters from British Army officer James Wolfe -- remembered for his victory over the French at the Battle of Quebec -- and a collection of paintings, drawings and other material by Thomas Baines documenting the British exploration of northern Australia.","Jane Austen was an English novelist who wrote in the early 1800s.

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- Brian David Mitchell told Elizabeth Smart he wanted her from the moment he first saw her, Smart told a rapt jury Monday at Mitchell's federal kidnapping trial. He said he planned for months how he would snatch her so she could join him and his wife in a ""celestial"" plural marriage, Smart testified. ""He said they had been preparing for me since he saw me,"" she said. It was the fall of 2001, and he was panhandling outside a mall in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. Smart said she was with her mother and five brothers and sisters, shopping for school clothes. ""My mother gave gave him five bucks,"" Smart told told the jury. Mitchell was hired by her mother to fix a leaky skylight and rake leaves. Smart saw him around the house that fall but never spoke to him, she said. Before dawn on June 2, 2002, she awoke to the sound of a man's voice and a cold sharp blade against her throat. ""I remember him saying, 'I have a knife to your neck. Don't make a sound. Get out of bed and come with me or I will kill you and your family,'"" Smart testified. He led her in her red silk pajamas up a trail into the rugged back country and over a ridge, hiking what she estimated to be three to five hours to a crude campsite. There, she said, he ""sealed"" her to him as his wife and raped her. She said she begged him to stop, pleading, ""I'm just a little girl."" She struggled, but she said at age 14 she was was no match for a grown man. Afterwards, she cried herself to sleep. The next day, as she cried again, he told her she was ""lucky,"" Smart testified. He said he was a prophet and that God had chosen her to be by his side as he prepared for the second coming of Jesus Christ. She said she didn't feel lucky at all. ""I felt like I had a burden the size of a mountain to carry around with me the rest of my life,"" Smart said. Now 23 and living in Paris, France, Smart spent much of the day on the witness stand Monday, beginning a detailed description of her nine months of captivity with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. She spoke of being raped ""daily at the very least,"" tethered between two trees ""like an animal,"" and forced to watch and participate in sex acts she found repugnant. She said she was forced to smoke cigarettes and drink wine and ""hard liquor."" She did not have to face her alleged abductor on Monday. Mitchell, 57, loudly sings hymns whenever he is in court. He had been ejected, as usual, from the courtroom and was watching the trial from another room. He is charged with kidnapping and taking a minor across state lines for sex. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Mitchell's attorneys do not dispute what happened but say their client was insane at the time of the alleged abduction, and therefore not reponsible for his actions. ""You'll have to ferret out not only what happened, but why it happened,"" attorney Parker Douglas told jurors earlier Monday. ""We're asking you to determine what was in someone's mind. This is made difficult with a crazy mind. The easy explanation is not always the correct one."" He described his client as ""a crazy person who comes in the middle of the night"" -- exactly what we are taught to fear as children, he said. Smart told the jury she thought about running away that first morning, despite the threats against her life and her family. ""I didn't want to spend another day with him. I never wanted to see him again,"" she said. ""I'd seen what he had done to me. I'd seen how he had come in and taken me from my the bed, the place I thought was the safest place in the world, in my home, with my sister beside me."" She continued,  ""I felt that because of what he had done to me, I was marked. I wasn't the same. My personal value had dropped. I was nothing. Another person could never love me and and I felt, yeah, I could take the risk of trying to escape and being killed."" Later, after the shock began to wear off, she said she thought about her parents and the life she had before. ""I decided my parents would always love me despite what he did to me,"" she told the jury. ""I hadn't changed. I was still a person of worth ... I decided to live."" After that, she began to go along with what Mitchell told her to do. She was compliant. She listened, and even began to mimic his speech and his ways. As she stepped off the witness stand, Smart walked over to her parents, Ed and Lois, who embraced her. She returns to the witness stand on Tuesday. Earlier Monday, Smart testified about the night of her abduction. ""I thought I was having a nightmare,"" she said of being led away by a bearded man in dark clothing and a stocking cap. ""It was indescribable fear."" Smart's younger sister Mary Katherine, who witnessed the abduction, testified about awakening her parents with the words: ""Elizabeth is gone."" Also testifying Monday was the Smarts' mother, Lois. She spent less than an hour on the witness stand, recalling how the family hired Mitchell -- who then called himself Immanuel -- to do odd jobs. But most of her testimony focused on hearing the news that her daughter had been taken. ""(Mary Katherine) said that a man had taken Elizabeth with a gun and we wouldn't find her,"" Lois Smart testified. ""He took her either for ransom or for a hostage."" As her husband, Ed, searched the house, Lois Smart said, she ran downstairs, turned on the lights, and saw that the kitchen window was open, its screen cut. She testified she had opened the window the previous evening when she burned some potatoes while making dinner. ""My heart sank and I called out to Ed, 'Call 9-1-1,'"" she testified. ""It was utter terror. It was the worst feeling, knowing that I didn't know where my child was. I was helpless."" As her family frantically searched the house, Elizabeth testified, she was being led at knifepoint on the strenuous hours-long hike to a hillside encampment. ""I remember asking him if he realized what he was doing, and he said he did,"" she said. ""And I remember saying that if he let me go right now, we wouldn't press charges on him. And he said he knew exactly what he was doing and he understood the consequences of his actions."" Suddenly, she recognized his face, she testified, and the name Immanuel came to her. She said she asked why he would do this. ""My parents had only tried to help him,"" she said. ""He told me he was going to hold me for ransom, and I told him my parents would pay any amount to have me back."" Smart was found nine months after her abduction, walking on a street in the suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Mitchell and Barzee. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison. She also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap Smart's cousin a month after Smart was kidnapped. She was given a sentence of one to 15 years, to be served concurrently with the federal sentence, and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody. As part of her plea agreement, Barzee agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband.

"(LifeWire) -- Nancy Dunetz, who teaches English as a second language in New York City, sat down in the school staff room to check her e-mail. One of the messages in her inbox was from an acquaintance she'd been corresponding with since their 50th high school reunion last year. In a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person. But this e-mail last June didn't contain chummy banter or reminiscences. It simply included a lewd photo of a partly unclothed young man. The file name of the picture was ""Mid East Hottie."" ""I was shocked!"" says Dunetz, 68. She hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind. Later that day, the sender e-mailed an apology to her and two dozen others who had received the e-mail. He explained he'd been experimenting with his new computer and was trying to figure out how to add attachments to an e-mail, Dunetz says. In doing so, he attached an image from his desktop and tried to send it to himself. Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the ""send"" button. ""I felt terrible for him,"" Dunetz says. ""I could imagine just how mortified he must have been."" With some 55 billion e-mails being sent daily (not including spam), according to e-mail archiving company The Radicati Group, misdirected e-mails have become the online equivalent of a wrong number. They're unavoidable, annoying -- and often embarrassing. The 'uh-oh' e-mail . In a recent online survey conducted by AOL, 32 percent of the 4,000 respondents have at one time or another mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to an unintended recipient. And often, it's something not so nice. Karla Comer, an account executive at an ad agency in Greensboro, North Carolina, knows just how embarrassing that can be. In 2004, Comer met a guy at a concert and went out with him a few times, but ultimately realized she wasn't interested. ""He was just awkward and clumsy. And sometimes I'd catch him staring at me, which really creeped me out,"" she says. She tried to end the relationship by simply not returning his phone calls. ""But then he e-mailed and casually said that he had not heard from me in a while and he hoped everything was fine but just assumed I was busy,"" says Comer, 31. ""Before I returned his e-mail, I sent the message to a close girlfriend with a blurb about what an idiot I thought he was and that dating him was a bad idea because he had no understanding of social cues."" She thought she sent the ""he's an idiot"" e-mail only to her girlfriend. To her horror, Comer says, the spurned beau replied a few minutes later, calling her some not-so-sweet names and suggesting that she ""share THIS e-mail with your friends."" ""I was speechless,"" says Comer, who chose to not respond. ""But eventually I was able to laugh at it."" When errant e-mails are sent at work, however, there's often much more at stake than personal embarrassment. Three years ago, Jamie Diamond, 33, e-mailed his then-boss to ask about a client at the public relations firm where he was working. His boss wrote back, criticizing the client as incompetent and urging Diamond to ""go around him if you want to get anything done."" Unfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client. ""One click, and suddenly we'd lost a $5 million account,"" says Diamond, who is now self-employed as a publicist in Williams, Oregon. Can you turn back time? Short of erasing someone's memory, there is no surefire way to retrieve a missent e-mail. Microsoft Outlook has a ""recall"" function that can erase unread e-mails from the in-box of the recipient -- as long as the recipient is using the same mail client or server as the sender -- as does AOL, but only for messages between AOL users. (Both AOL and CNN are divisions of Time Warner.) Then there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail. But old-fashioned vigilance is probably the best way to avert these snafus in the first place. Roger Matus, CEO of e-mail archiving company InBoxer Inc. and keeper of the blog Death By Email, believes the easiest way to avoid these mistakes is to forget that the ""reply all"" button even exists. ""Simply put, there is rarely a real reason to use it,"" he says. ""Often, when you hit it, you end up e-mailing people who were blind carbon copied without realizing."" Matus offers the following tips on avoiding e-mail embarrassment: . • Type out the person's full name when addressing your e-mail. If you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book, it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it. • Double-check the addresses of your intended recipients before you hit ""send."" Do you really want all the people to get this particular message? • Be sure to notify your company's legal department if there is any chance that governance, compliance or privacy regulations were violated as a result of something you sent by mistake. • Immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and, if possible, ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away.

"(CNN) -- Helene Gayle must be one of the few chief executives who dreams of a world where her job doesn't exist. In fact, the president of one of the biggest poverty charities on the planet -- CARE USA -- would probably prefer it if there was no need for her organization at all. Yet on any given day there will be a humanitarian disaster unfolding across the globe -- from violence in Somalia, to flooding in Pakistan, and chemical warfare in Syria. And all of them need CARE. ""We always say at CARE that we would love to see if we can work ourselves out of business,"" said the 58-year-old. ""If CARE doesn't need to exist as it is 20 years from now, so be it. But I think it's safe to say that there will still be a need for relief in this world -- there will still be an unstable country or a fragile environment."" The business of charity . Since it first began over 60 years ago with American charities sending food packages to World War Two survivors, CARE International -- of which CARE USA is a member -- has become one of the largest aid organizations in the world, with 10,000 staff working in some 80 countries. Last year the charity helped more than 83 million people across the globe -- and was ranked the seventh best NGO on the planet in 2013. It's an enormous operation, and one which Gayle -- one of Forbes magazines' ""100 most powerful women"" -- has led since 2006. ""The more you look into health and health inequalities, you realize that a lot of it is not due to a particular disease -- it's really linked to underlying societal issues such as poverty, inequity, lack of access to safe drinking water and housing,"" she said. ""And these are all the things we focus on at CARE."" Women of the world . When former pediatrician Gayle joined CARE seven years ago, she became not just the first woman to lead the organization, but the first person of color. While being an African-American female in a business environment usually dominated by white men hasn't hindered her career, it's still something she's acutely aware of. ""When I walk into a room that is all white and all male, I'm sitting on the outside of that club. That's sometimes an intimidating experience,"" she said. ""But I think that everywhere that I've gotten is because I've worked hard. I have the experience, I have the credentials -- I continue not to take any of that for granted."" Watch: CEO says 'being fearless fueled my success' It is perhaps unsurprising that Gayle has now made women's rights a big focus at CARE. ""We know that if you educate a girl, as the saying goes, you educate a nation,"" said Gayle. ""That girl will get married later, she will have fewer children, she's more likely to earn an income and that income is more likely to be plowed back into the family so that the family benefits."" Sixties spirit . Growing up in Buffalo, New York, Gayle's own social worker mother was a huge influence in her career. ""I grew up at a time in the sixties where there was a lot of social change going on -- the civil rights movement, women's movement, anti apartheid,"" she said. ""My mother really gave that sense to us of giving back to the community. She'd say 'you've got a good brain, and a big mouth, use it.'"" Gayle didn't disappoint, working for over three decades at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, focusing on HIV/AIDS research. ""Just a few years ago less that 1% of people who needed treatment [for HIV] had access to it and now it's up to 55% and growing,"" she said. ""We are now on the track to absolutely eliminate pediatric HIV infection globally."" Where there is a will . Walk around Gayle's office today it's lined with honorary university degrees and awards from Desmond Tutu and Barack Obama. She points to a photograph of herself with Nelson Mandela during a trip with the former U.S. secretary of health to South Africa -- an experience she describes as ""electric."" But among the high-brow accolades, Gayle remains focused on simple achievements such as education, access to clean drinking water, and shelter. ""We believe that it's possible to eliminate extreme poverty over the next couple of decades. We know what needs to be done and we have the tools,"" she said, adding: ""But do we have the will as a world community to do it?""","Helene Gayle, CEO of CARE USA, talks about the business of charity .

"(CNN) -- U.S. researchers reported a breakthrough Thursday in the search for a vaccine for malaria, the mosquito-borne disease that sickens millions worldwide. More than three dozen volunteers received multiple, intravenous doses of a vaccine produced with a weakened form of the disease, scientists from the National Institutes of Health, the Navy, Army and other organizations reported Thursday. Though the results were promising, more extensive field testing will be required, the researchers wrote. Nevertheless, the it marks the first time any vaccine trial has shown 100% success in protecting subjects from the mosquito-borne tropical disease, which sickens more than 200 million a year and killed about 660,000 in 2010. Dr. William Schaffner, head of the preventive medicine department at Vanderbilt University's medical school, called the results ""a scientific advance"" -- but cautioned that it's ""not ready yet for prime time."" Study: Malaria-infected mosquitoes more attracted to human odor . ""This is not a vaccine that's ready for travelers to the developing world anytime soon,"" Schaffner told CNN. ""However, from the point of view of science dealing with one of the big-three infectious causes of death around the world, it's a notable advance. And everybody will be holding their breath, watching to see whether this next trial works and how well it works."" The findings were published Thursday by the peer-reviewed journal Science. The trials involved 57 subjects, including 40 who received the vaccine, from October 2011 to October 2012. Students invent award-winning soap to tackle malaria . The vaccine being tested was produced by Maryland company Sanaria Inc. and tested by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and the Naval Medical Research Center. Sanaria owns the patent, said Capt. Judith Epstein, the lead researcher for the Naval Medical Research Center. Schaffner said the process of getting the vaccine scientifically proven, approved and distributed could take eight to 10 years. Sanaria and Epstein said they believe the process could be complete within three to four. The vaccine was produced using samples of Plasmodium falciparum, the single-celled parasite that causes the disease. The samples were weakened by radiation and then frozen. The vaccine was ""safe and well-tolerated"" by the volunteers who received it, the study states. Schaffner, who was not part of the study, said previous attempts using injections into skin or muscle didn't work. Multiple, intravenous injections are ""a heck of a way"" to administer a vaccine, but ""desperate times call for desperate measures,"" he said. Researchers reported that the six volunteers who received five intravenous doses of the vaccine did not contract malaria when exposed to the microscopic parasite. Of the nine who received four doses, three contracted the disease. Of 12 who received no vaccine, 11 became infected. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the infectious disease institute, called the results an ""important step forward"" in preventing malaria. ""The global burden of malaria is extraordinary and unacceptable,"" Fauci said in a statement issued by the institute. ""Scientists and health care providers have made significant gains in characterizing, treating and preventing malaria; however, a vaccine has remained an elusive goal."" Another possible vaccine, backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, cut the number of malaria cases in half during a trial conducted among children in seven African countries. In a statement Thursday afternoon, Jessica Milman, a senior program officer for the foundation, said Thursday's published results were promising despite the study's small number of participants. ""The results provide further confirmation that a malaria vaccine is feasible, though this specific construct has hurdles to overcome,"" Millman said. ""More evidence will be required to demonstrate that it could work among people living in malaria-endemic countries. It's also likely that a number of manufacturing and presentation challenges would need to be addressed to ensure that the vaccine could be produced and delivered at scale."" Currently, available drugs can stave off malaria, but must be combined with other protective measures such as insect repellent or nets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. None are 100% effective, the CDC notes. Schaffner said future studies need to involve larger groups in field conditions and examinations of how long the vaccines stave off infection. Using multiple intravenous doses -- a process unlike any other vaccine -- ""requires a great deal of aseptic practice and good training,"" and the risk of infection is a possibility, he said. ""We don't know how long this protection lasts yet. Lots of questions remain. But that should not diminish the fact that this is a scientific advance,"" Schaffner said. Katherine McPhee says 'no more' to malaria . Malaria causes fever and vomiting and can disrupt the blood supply to vital organs if untreated. Symptoms show up 10 to 15 days after being bitten by a mosquito. It's endemic to tropical countries, and the microscopic parasite has become resistant to a number of treatments, according to the World Health Organization. With no effective vaccine, efforts to control the disease have focused on mosquito control and distributing pesticide-laced nets. People visiting the tropics from countries where the disease is not endemic are particularly vulnerable, the WHO says. American troops overseas have suffered extensively from malaria in the past. The Army reported 500,000 cases during World War II, with more than 100,000 among the Navy and Marine Corps. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Gates Foundation says tested vaccine ""has hurdles to overcome""

"Washington (CNN) -- A JPMorgan Chase executive admitted to Congress that the bank did a ""terrible job"" of dealing with military home loans. The bank has admitted to overcharging approximately 4,500 members of the U.S. military on their mortgages and said it accidentally foreclosed on 18 service members' homes. Active duty personnel are covered under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). The law caps interest on debt incurred before service, such as mortgage or credit card debt, at 6% while active, and also prevents foreclosure proceedings from beginning until nine months after the service member returns from active duty. ""I would like to express to the men and women serving our country and to the members of this committee, Chase's deepest regret over the mistakes we've made in applying these protections. I commit to you that we will get this right,"" Stephanie Mudick, an executive vice president in JPMorgan Chase's Office of Consumer Practices, told the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Wednesday. But Mudick's mea culpa was not enough for many on the committee. ""You broke the law, your bank broke the law, shouldn't someone go to jail for that?"" Rep. Bob Filner, D-California, charged. ""Who's responsible? Are you, as the executive VP who was given to us from the bank to answer for this stuff, should you go to jail?"" Mudick said an internal review would be conducted and that JPMorgan Chase would advise the committee on the results of that probe. But Filner said someone must be held responsible. ""You'll take this seriously, if somebody went to jail with a white collar,"" he said. Mudick blamed much of JPMorgan Chase's mistakes on human error, citing the complexity of reading military orders that are needed to prove active duty service, and problems with not coding SCRA cases to reflect their eligibility for the interest cap and foreclosure prevention benefits. ""We were misreading orders and not calculating the period of eligibility correctly. As a result, we were not correctly ascertaining when and how the interest rate adjustment should be made,"" Mudick explained. Rep. Timothy Walz, D-Minnesota, is a veteran of the National Guard. He suggested Mudick's answer was ridiculous. ""That is the weakest answer I have ever heard given in front of this committee, that we couldn't read the military orders, coming from one of the largest financial institutions in the world,"" he said. The congressman pulled up his Chase credit card agreement on his iPad. He pointed out that Chase seemed to have no problem creating a 63-page document ""to calculate interest to the exact penny,"" but then claimed to not be able to understand a military order. ""Are you going to stick to this that you couldn't read this? That is a standard military order... that any 17-year-old kid can read,"" he said. Mudick again acknowledged the bank's failure, but pointed to new safeguards that had been put in place to make sure the mistakes were not repeated. They include a centralized unit set up to specialize in SCRA loans, with employees trained in reading military orders, as well as a new hotline staffed by employees trained specifically on how to answer SCRA borrower questions. JPMorgan Chase will return $2.4 million to the thousands of servicemember borrowers affected, adding 7.25% interest to the refunds owed. Out of the 18 homes wrongfully foreclosed upon, 12 have either been canceled or a settlement with the borrower was reached. The other six are still being worked on. JPMorgan Chase wasn't the only target in the committee hearing. Lawmakers also faulted the Defense Department for not staying on top of the banks with regards to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. ""Did (Defense) Secretary (Robert) Gates say, 'Hey, we've got to protect our people and make sure the banks serve them?' It didn't happen,"" Filner said to Col. Shawn Shumake, who was representing the Defense Department. ""Get the damn presidents of Chase and Bank of America into a room and say 'You have a responsibility here.' Don't send us the 150th ranking executive vice president, but you all take responsibility for this. Bring them into the room."" The committee's concerns that banks are not taking the civil relief act seriously enough were echoed in the testimony of one attorney representing service members in a class action lawsuit against Chase. ""I was a state prosecutor for 12 years in South Carolina. Every person we ever caught breaking the law, taking something that wasn't theirs, was more than willing to give it back, give them mea culpa and be on their way,"" said Richard Harpootlian. Harpootlian is representing Marine Capt. Jonathan Rowles, the first servicemember to sue Chase. The attorney charged that stiffer sanctions should be applied to those who break the law, including upgrading the crime of knowingly not complying with SCRA from a misdemeanor to a felony, removing the one-year sentence cap associated with it, imposing civil fines, and providing for the recovery of attorney fees. Rowles says he spent the last five years dealing with ""harassing"" phone calls from Chase. He agrees that the criminal penalties should be increased and he'd like to see Chase prosecuted. ""It was difficult. Everybody wants to be strong, but when you call your wife at 2 a.m. to see how things are going and you spend 20 minutes discussing how you can send another letter... instead of 'I love you, how are the babies,' it's rough... It's still in the back of your mind,"" said Rowles. A recent Defense Department study showed that service members consider their finances to be the second largest source of stress in their lives, ahead of deployments, health, family and war. Many on the committee worried about the toll this issue is taking. ""Anything that's adding stress to a service member, especially in a combat zone, is incredibly risky behavior, so no stone should go unturned,"" said Walz.","Bank admits faults in military home loans .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods lived up to his star billing at the Turkish Airlines Open with a tournament best 63 Friday to put himself firmly in contention at the halfway stage of the $7 million event. The World No.1 has been followed by sizable and sometimes over enthusiastic galleries in Antalya and was left frustrated by rain delays on the first day. Woods returned early Friday morning to play the final eight holes of this opening round, picking up three birdies before a late bogey left him on two-under 70. But after a short break the 14-time major winner began to justify his appearance fee with stunning iron and approach play. He charged up the leader board to move to 11-under, just one adrift of Race to Dubai leader Henrik Stenson, Ian Poulter, Victor Dubuisson and Justin Walters. ""I'm right there; that's the whole idea,"" he told the European Tour website. ""Got two more days of hopefully making a lot of birdies. ""We know it's going to take something really low. You're going to have to go 20 plus probably to win this tournament,"" he added. Stenson, who formed a star studded trio with Woods and U.S. Open champion Justin Rose, backed up his first round 64 with a 68, despite playing with an injured wrist. ""It's not in a great state. I have inflammation there, and I strained something else yesterday, as well before I teed off. ""So it's not in great shape and I'm just hanging in there day by day and hope it keeps together for another couple of days,"" said the Swede. Poulter, who is chasing Stenson hard in the Race to Dubai, has had a pair of 66s with Frenchman Dubuisson and Walters of South Africa firmly on the hunt on 132. Rose is also in the hunt in a big group at eight under, including fellow Englishman Lee Westwood. But most eyes will be on Woods, who is hunting his first win in a European Tour event for four years to add to his five victories on the PGA Tour this season to take him back to the top of the rankings.","Tiger Woods shoots nine-under 63 at Turkish Airlines Open .

"Cannes (CNN) -- Investigators were at work Tuesday looking into the weekend theft of jewels worth close to $136 million from an exhibition in the French resort city of Cannes, the prosecutor's office in nearby Grasse said. A reformed jewel thief told CNN that the robbery Sunday morning at a jewelry exhibition in the luxury Carlton Hotel -- the third gem theft around the city since May -- had all the hallmarks of a professional job. The robber, whose face was covered by a hat and a scarf, had a semiautomatic pistol and threatened to shoot the exhibitors and guests, according to Philippe Vique, deputy prosecutor for organized crime in the prosecutor's office. Security guards were present but unarmed, he said. No one was injured. ""It was definitely a professional heist, I've been saying that from day one,"" said Larry Lawton, who himself served time for jewelry thefts but is now an author and motivational speaker. He suspects the Cannes thief had an ""inside guy"" who provided information on where to find the jewels. ""It's definitely not a lone man, it was too coordinated,"" he said. ""They went in and within five minutes they knew exactly where to go."" Investigators will likely be studying security footage to identify who may have been ""casing the place"" in the days before the theft, he said. They also will try to identify the getaway vehicle, he said. Lawton said he was surprised the jewels were not fitted with an electronic security device that would have given anyone carrying them beyond a certain distance an electric shock. But he urged against blaming the security guards for the theft. The gems may well already be in the hands of unscrupulous buyers, who probably paid about a fifth of what they're worth, he said. The CGT union, representing workers at the hotel, criticized the management of the Carlton for what it called ""irresponsibility."" Despite the growing number of events showcasing luxury goods, and the resulting insecurity, ""the Carlton management has favored financial operations over the safety of personnel,"" a CGT statement said. The union called on the French government to initiate an investigation into the safety of jewelry exhibitions in hotels. The Nice prosecutor's office told CNN on Monday that the value of the stolen jewels was close to $136 million, more than twice what had previously been stated. The jewels were supposed to have been on display until the end of August but signs advertising the Leviev exhibition have now been taken down from the hotel. A spokesman for Carlton Hotels in Paris said Tuesday that the company had ""no further information or statement"" to give on the incident. The Leviev jewelry firm has flagship boutiques in London, New York, Singapore and Dubai. It boasts of being one of the largest diamond manufacturers in the world, allowing it to offer ""the industry's most extraordinary assortment of large, rare and colored diamonds."" The robbery follows two major jewel heists this year during the Cannes Film Festival in May. A necklace worth $2.6 million was stolen from a hotel party shortly after jewels worth more than $1 million were stolen from a safe in a hotel room. Jeweler de Grisogono said the necklace was part of a collection making its debut. The jewels stolen from a safe were by the Swiss firm Chopard, which was sponsoring the festival. CNN's Alexander Felton reported from Cannes and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne contributed to this report.","NEW: The union representing hotel workers says management put profit before staff safety .

"(CNN) -- At least 37 people, including 26 civilians and some Syrian soldiers, were killed in a car bombing Sunday at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Hama, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and state media said. SANA, a Syrian-run news agency, said the death toll could rise because at least 10 more people were seriously wounded. A suicide bomber detonated more than a ton of explosives in a truck on a busy street near a farm machinery company, SANA said. More than 20 vehicles and some homes and stores were damaged, it reported. Meanwhile, clashes between the Syrian military and rebel brigades continue to rage on the eastern outskirts of the government-held city, the London-based Syrian opposition group said. Lebanese hostages released after 17 months . Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees in Syria, reported at least 15 killings in other parts of the country. Eight people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs, six in Aleppo province and one in Homs province. According to the United Nations, well over 100,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict, which began in March 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby said Sunday in Cairo that peace talks were scheduled for November 23 in Geneva, Switzerland, but the date is not firm. ""There are many arrangements to be made and many difficulties which must be overcome to make this conference possible,"" he said. The proposed conference between Syrian government officials and opposition leaders, intended to broker an end to the country's civil war, has been delayed several times. Syria's deputy prime minister said Thursday that the ""presumed dates"" had been agreed to during a conference in the Russian Foreign Ministry. U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi said Sunday that he plans to meet with Russian and U.S. officials as well other representatives of the U.N. Security Council to finalize details. He also stressed that no meeting could be held without a ""convincing opposition that represents Syria's opposition population."" The U.N. humanitarian chief called on Saturday for a cease-fire in Moadamiyeh in the rural Damascus region so aid workers could evacuate thousands of civilians trapped in the conflict.

"(CNN) -- Two Gonzaga University students are on probation for the rest of their time at the Washington state school for using a gun to scare a man they say was trying to barge into their apartment, their lawyer said Tuesday. Having such a firearm on university-owned property violates Gonzaga policy, a fact that led to the possibility that students Erik Fagan and Daniel McIntosh would be suspended or expelled. That didn't happen. The two were instead placed on probation, according to their lawyer Dean Chuang. Harsher penalties may follow if either is found to have violated university policies in the future. Fagan and McIntosh think being on probation goes too far because the penalty goes on their permanent record and means they aren't ""in good standing"" at private, four-year Catholic university in Spokane, Washington. They are appealing the school's decision, said Chuang. The lawyer also said he's found that Gonzaga does not own the apartment complex where the incident took place; rather, the university has a 99-year lease from the complex's owners and is subleasing units to students. The penalties stem from an incident the night of October 24, when the two students got a knock on their apartment door. Fagan told CNN affiliate KXLY in Spokane that he opened the door, and a stranger, who said he'd just gotten out of jail, asked for $15. Fagan told KXLY he offered the man a blanket and a can of food but ""didn't feel comfortable"" giving the man money because he was a stranger. ""My gut instinct was telling me I wasn't going to be able to get that door closed before he came through,"" Fagan said. As the man started coming through the door, Fagan said, he yelled for McIntosh, his roommate. McIntosh said he came to the door with his pistol drawn, and the students said the man turned and ran away. Both police and campus security responded when Fagan and McIntosh then called 911. According to the Gonzaga's Executive Vice President Earl Martin, all university housing is patrolled at regular intervals by campus security. But this particular apartment complex isn't gated, and secured key cards or codes aren't required for entrance. Shortly after the incident, police captured the man, whom they identified as a six-time convicted felon. At about 2 a.m. the next day, campus security officers returned to Fagan and McIntosh's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment. The gun is owned by Fagan, who uses it to hunt periodically, and McIntosh has a state-issued permit to carry a concealed handgun, Chuang said. In Washington state, gun owners are not required to register their weapons. In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang. The next day, university President Thayne McCulloh said he believes this incident offers ""an opportunity to do some important work, as a community, to objectively re-examine our firearms policy and openly debate perspectives and contextual issues."" Until a change is made, though, the current rules remain in effect. Louisiana kidnap victim's cousin kicks down door, shoots and kills abductor .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- An 11-year-old girl who lost her father made the world cry with her on Tuesday. Paris Katherine Jackson, 11, said goodbye to her father at the close of the memorial service. ""Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine,"" said Paris Katherine Jackson, the second of Michael Jackson's three children, as a massive memorial service for her father neared its end in downtown Los Angeles. ""And I just want to say that I love him so much,"" Paris added, before breaking down in tears and burying herself in the arms of her aunt, Janet Jackson. Her aunts, uncles and two brothers who were on stage at the Staples Center arena reached over to console Paris. Thousands of mourners in the audience dabbed their eyes with tissues. It was the first time they had heard from a girl who, along with her two siblings, have often been hidden by veils or blankets when seen with their father.  Watch Paris Jackson give a tearful goodbye » . ""Everybody just broke down,"" said Tracie Laymon, a filmmaker from Los Angeles, who was in the audience. ""Wow, it was really powerful.""

Aisha Morgan said all the television stations at her workplace in Kingston, Jamaica, were turned to the memorial -- ""from upper management, all the way down."" ""Some persons cried,"" said Morgan, who sent in a photo to CNN's iReport. ""The atmosphere in one department was like a funeral."" Inside the Staples Center, Jackson lay at the foot of the stage in a closed, rose-draped, bronze casket. His brothers, who served as pallbearers, wore single white sequined gloves, a tribute to Jackson's signature look. Singers and sports celebrities took the stage and shared what Jackson meant to them. Between them, the performers have 40 Grammy awards -- a fitting tribute to a man who alone earned 13 in his lifetime. Jackson died on June 25 of cardiac arrest. The exact cause of death is pending toxicology tests, but speculation continues to swirl about the role of prescription drugs. Brother Marlon Jackson was among some who alluded to the controversies that surround the pop icon in death. The world, he said, could not understand what Jackson endured ""being judged and ridiculed."" ""How much pain can one man take?"" Marlon Jackson asked. ""Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone."" Pomp and precaution . The morning began with a half-hour gathering for several hundred family and friends inside a chapel at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery. Jackson's casket -- bronze with 14-karat gold plate handles, a velvet-lined interior and a reported price tag upward of $20,000 -- was then placed in a hearse for the 10-mile trip to the arena. The motorcade of black limousines and sports utility vehicles to the arena was accompanied by police cruisers and motorcycles, which shut down freeway ramps and caused a miles-long traffic backup. Three thousand police officers, almost one-third of the Los Angeles police force, were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell said.  Watch report from CNN.com's Nicole Lapin from L.A. » . In comparison, about 2,000 officers were deployed for the parade and celebration at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the L.A. Lakers' NBA championship victory last month. The mayor's office estimated the cost for security for the Staples ceremony to be between $2 million and $4 million. And the city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans to donate money to help with expenses. Leading into the event, police repeatedly asked fans without tickets to the service to watch from home. And, putting their worst-case scenarios to rest, fans seem to have complied. McDonnell said ticketless fans outside Staples numbered 5,000 or fewer, much lower than what police had anticipated. Inside the arena, Jackson's older brothers carried the coffin to the front of the stage, which was designed to resemble a church sanctuary with a stained-glass backdrop. ""Soon and very soon, we are going to see the King,"" sang the Andrae Crouch Choir. Tears and testimony . Singer Smokey Robinson set the tone for the event when he read a heartfelt letter from Diana Ross. Ross, a long-time friend that Jackson named as alternate guardian to his children in his will, explained in her letter why she was not there: . ""I am trying to find closure. I want you to know that even though I am not there at the Staples Center, I am there in my heart. I have decided to pause and be silent. This feels right for me. Michael was a personal love of mine, a treasured part of my world, part of the fabric of my life in a way that I can't seem to find words to express.""

"(CNN) -- Wei Guoqiang has been following Chinese football for more than 20 years but reasons to celebrate have been few and far between. ""It's like the Chinese saying; 'you always think your children are the most beautiful no matter how ugly they are,'"" the 30-year-old education specialist told CNN in Beijing. Dogged by poor performances on the pitch and corruption scandals off it, the Chinese game has been far from beautiful. But die-hard soccer fans like Wei finally have something to cheer about. Guangzhou Evergrande, a soccer team based in the southern city of Guangzhou, became Asian champions on Saturday, beating South Korea's FC Seoul to claim China's first continental title in 23 years in a stadium packed to capacity with fans wearing the team's blood-red colors. ""They are persistent and never surrender,"" said Wei, who watched the match on television at home. Evergrande will now play in the FIFA Club World Cup in December, pitting the team against the likes of German giants and reigning European champions Bayern Munich. Previous winners of the tournament include Chelsea, Manchester United and Barcelona. China last tasted international success at club level in 1990 when Liaoning lifted the trophy of the now expired Asian Club Championship. Its national team has also punched below the country's weight. Despite being one of the country's most popular sports -- President Xi Jinping is said to be a big fan -- China failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup and did not enter the running for the 2018 tournament. Evergrande's rise to the top of Asian football has been fast and furious and some say it could be Asia's first ""superclub."" In early 2010, the team was bought by Xu Jiayin, the boss of property developer Evergrande Real Estate Group and China's 13th richest man, according to Forbes. He paid 100 million yuan ($16.4 million) for the club, shocking many as the team had recently been relegated to the second division of China's league. In 2011, they won the Chinese Super League and claimed the league title for the third time this year. Dong Jianzheng, an editor at the Chinese-language World Soccer Magazine, credits Xu's deep pockets as the main reason for the team's success. The club has spent at least 1.5 billion yuan ($250 million) in the past three years, according to The China Daily, recruiting domestic stars and foreign players like Brazilian striker Muriqui. The team is led by Marcello Lippi, who coached the Italian team that won the 2006 World Cup. ""The Evergrande model is similar to Chelsea and Manchester, where they win simply because they invest,"" Dong told CNN. ""They have a strong team and a large number of foreign players. They are good because they dare to throw in their money."" But he said Evergrande's success doesn't represent the big picture. A  bribery investigation that led to several players, referees and managers serving jail terms has left many fans disillusioned with the Chinese game. Rowan Simons, the author of ""Bamboo Goalposts: One man's quest to teach the People's Republic of China to love football"", says corruption reaches down to the sport's grassroots, which suffer from a lack of investment. ""Parents will bribe the coach to get (their child) into the team, teams will bribe the referee to win the game,"" said Simons, who has lived and played football in China for more than 20 years. Hopes are high that Evergrande's arrival on the international soccer stage will give a much-needed boost to the country's football system. The president of the Asian Football Confederation, which runs the region's premier tournament, said that Evergrande's win would infuse new life into Chinese football and spread the game to a wider audience. ""I am confident that this will benefit not only the Chinese Super League but also the national team in a big way,"" said Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim. But they will have a hard time convincing fans like Cui, an engineer, who spends his spare time glued to the English Premier League, Europe's UEFA Champions League and Spain's La Liga. He says he won't make the effort to watch Evergrande's FIFA Club World Cup match against Egyptian side Al Ahly in December. ""The time difference is a challenge, but I still choose foreign matches because they are much more professional,"" he told CNN.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama asserted during Monday's presidential debate that it cost the United States less to help oust Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi than it did to run two weeks of the 2003-2011 war in Iraq . Obama, debating former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, made the comment while touting his decision to involve the United States in a NATO no-fly-zone operation that helped rebels overthrow Gadhafi over seven months in 2011. The statement: Obama: ""Keep in mind that I, and Americans, took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to -- without putting troops on the ground, at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq -- liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years. Fact Check: Romney, Obama and Iraq . The facts: We can attempt a comparison by examining the Defense Department's spending on the two operations. The war in Iraq cost the Defense Department tens of billions of dollars a year, reaching a peak in fiscal 2008, when the department's Iraq obligations reached a monthly average of $11.1 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service. That year covered a good portion of the 2007-2008 U.S. troop surge. Obama mentioned the cost at the two-week level. In fiscal 2004 -- the first full fiscal year of the war -- the department's Iraq obligations averaged $2.21 billion every two weeks, according to the CRS. That average rose every year through fiscal 2008, when the average two-week obligation was $5.12 billion. Those are obligations -- basically the amount needed to be paid, and not the actual amount paid to date. We give you the obligations because the CRS says the Pentagon didn't track actual outlays until fiscal 2009. But, the CRS's report says that ""average obligations for a fiscal year are a good indicator of ongoing operational costs."" By fiscal 2011, which ended shortly before all U.S. troops were out of the country, the Pentagon's spending had fallen to an average of $2.8 billion every two weeks, according to data from the CRS. Fact Check: Is al Qaeda's core decimated or growing? The rate of U.S. military spending on the 2011 operation in Libya was significantly less. The multi-country operation to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya began on March 19, 2011, with U.S. aircraft and ships helping to disable Libya's air defense network and airfields. The most expensive phase in Libya for the Pentagon appears to have been in March. The cost of initial operations through March 28, 2011, was estimated at $550 million, according to the CRS. By April, Libya's air defenses were rendered pretty much useless, so the daily expense of the operation declined precipitously. NATO took over the operation in April and maintained leadership through the day of Gadhafi's death in October 2011. The Pentagon said its cost from April 1 through September 30 was about $1.1 billion. That included daily military operations, munitions, the drawdown of supplies and humanitarian assistance. Adding the two figures, you get about $1.65 billion. Vice President Joe Biden told CNN in October 2011 that the operation ""cost us $2 billion."" It's not clear whether he was referring to only Pentagon expenditures. Conclusion: Comparing only Pentagon expenditures, two weeks of military operations in Iraq generally appear to have been more expensive than the U.S. military role in the seven-month Libya operation.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A group of British children and teachers quarantined for nearly a week in China because of swine flu fears were allowed to leave their hotel Tuesday, Britain's Foreign Office said. Two students outside the Yan Xiang Hotel where a group of British children and teachers have been quarantined. A spokesman could not confirm the number of children and teachers released from quarantine, but they were among a group of 111 that was sequestered in a Beijing hotel six days ago. The students and teachers came from various schools in Britain and were all traveling to China together as members of the same British school association, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust. Twelve children were hospitalized and diagnosed with the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu. One child is in the hospital awaiting test results to confirm the virus, the Foreign Office said. The group released from quarantine Tuesday will now be moved to a different hotel, the Foreign Office said. The second group is due to be released from quarantine Wednesday, the Foreign Office said. Olivia Bishop, one of the teachers on the trip, said Chinese authorities pulled three students aside as soon as they landed at the airport because they had high temperatures. Two tested positive for mild symptoms of the virus, she said, and the rest of the group was able to continue with planned sightseeing. ""When we got back to the campus that evening, we were about to have our dinner and we were told to go back to a classroom and wait, and then we were taken to the hotel to be quarantined,"" Bishop told Sky News.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has hailed ending the Champions League reign of Barcelona as the greatest moment of his controversial career, but said he could now never return to his former club. Mourinho has had a fractious relationship with the Spanish champions since ending his four-year tenure on the coaching staff in 2000, and stoked the tensions ahead of Wednesday night's second leg of the semifinal in the Catalan capital. The Portuguese accused Barca of being obsessed with reaching the May 22 final because it will be held at the home of their bitter rivals Real Madrid, and his joyous on-pitch celebrations at the Nou Camp after Inter prevailed 3-2 on aggregate further incensed home fans. ""I'm not stupid enough to think that this hate can be turned into love,"" he told reporters. ""I respect Barca and and I'll never forget what the club gave me in the four years I was here, but something has been created around me that is hard to make positive. ""It is clear that I will end my career without having coached Barca."" Can Mourinho beat Van Gaal to become king of Europe? Mourinho has already won Europe's premier club competition with Porto in 2004, and took English side Chelsea to two semifinals -- facing Barcelona on six occasions in often highly-charged encounters. But he said that leading Italian champions Inter to a first European Cup final since 1972 -- with German giants Bayern Munich now in the way of the Nerazzuri's first title in 45 years -- was the best achievement of his career. ""For the players, me, the fans, it's the greatest. We were a team of heroes. We sweated blood,"" Mourinho said after Inter lost 1-0 on the night, hanging on despite playing for an hour with only 10 men following the sending-off of former Barcelona midfielder Thiago Motta. ""It's been 38 years since Inter played in the final. This is not a team of young players who can wait 15 years to make the final -- they will not have another 10 opportunities to play in one,"" Mourinho added. ""Against Barcelona it's difficult with 11 players, but with 10 it's an historic achievement to win like this. It's the most beautiful defeat of my life."" Mourinho is targeting a hat-trick of trophies this season, with Inter leading the Serie A title race by one point with three matches to play and also having secure a place in the Italian Cup final -- with Roma the chief rival in both competitions. ""We have five games left in all competitions. Tonight we will party, tomorrow we will sleep and after that prepare to face Lazio on Sunday,"" he said. ""I ask the fans for another favor -- come to Milan airport and welcome this splendid team home. Come to Rome on Sunday for the game with Lazio and then come to the Italian Cup final next Wednesday."" Mourinho has had a difficult time with the Italian press since replacing Roberto Mancini at the San Siro in 2008, but said he had a close bond with his club. ""I was close to the fans when I was at Chelsea, but I am even closer to the Inter fans. I love Inter and the supporters, but not Italian football. I respect it, but I don't love it,"" he said. ""I thank everyone who played and who did not play. I thank all the fans, those who were here and those who remained at home. Absolutely incredible things happened."" Barcelona will now turn their attention to retaining the Spanish league title, as Josep Guardiola's team lead Real by a point with four matches to play. ""We lost to a great team and a great coach, but we want to win the league and we will be back -- I have nothing to reproach my players for,"" the coach said ahead of Saturday's trip to sixth-placed Villarreal.","Jose Mourinho says reaching Champions League final with Inter is his best achievement .

"Medellin, Colombia (CNN) -- Medellin is a place that, for many, will always be associated with Pablo Escobar -- the late drug lord who unleashed a murderous wave of violence and turned the Colombian city into one of the world's most dangerous. Nearly 20 years after his death, the Medellin that Escobar and his infamous cartel once ruled has been transformed beyond recognition. In March, it was named the world's most innovative city by the Urban Land Institute. ""It's a great opportunity to show the city we are building,"" says mayor Anibal Gaviria. ""Medellin has gone through really difficult times and people internationally have a reference to this pain."" ""This designation as the most innovative city allows us to show the new face of Medellin, which has a lot of challenges but which has come a long way."" Visiting one poor hillside community in the city, the traditional chaotic construction of cheap housing associated with slums is still there. But now a gleaming seven-station outdoor escalator runs through the heart of the community. ""I have a lot of fun,"" says nine-year-old Mariana Savalo. ""You can take it wherever you want to go and it helps bring up sick people."" The project took two years to complete, at a cost of $5 million. It replaced a 300-step staircase, runs 18 hours a day, and has become a crucial link to the city center -- and the job market. ""Medellin has taken things which in themselves are not innovative,"" explains Gaviria. ""But the way Medellin has included them in urban and social development is the innovation. "" This city's infrastructure illustrates his point: For less than a dollar, citizens can ride the subway and then transfer directly to the Metrocable -- a vast cable car system which sweeps residents high into the city's deprived areas. It stops in a mountaintop nature reserve, giving residents easy access to weekend recreation. The regeneration began under former mayor Sergio Fajardo, who pioneered a theory known as ""urban acupuncture"" from 2003, which focused on reclaiming areas from the cartels through strategic projects. ""Fajardo said his strategy was, for the first time, to put a lot of investment towards the most deprived areas,"" says Italian architect Francesco Orsini. ""Before that politicians used to go there to get votes, promising many things and not go back."" Orsini was a member of the team that redesigned the city's urban landscape. One landmark project is the Parque Biblioteca Espana -- a striking library built in an area where Escobar used to recruit assassins. ""We managed to bring into these low income settlements a high standard of architecture,"" says Orsini. ""So we managed to dignify these spaces. So everybody says: 'This is my library and I identify myself with that beautiful design.'"" The overall aim was to create pride in each citizen's neighborhood and the city itself. A scheme known as participatory budgeting -- where residents define local priorities -- remains central to its success. ""One of the biggest things about Medellin is pride and love towards the city,"" says Gaviria. ""That pride needs to be nurtured ... how? Through civic participation. Through citizens feeling they participate in the construction, design and approval of public works and government programs."" A level of civic pride is evident. Many of the poor areas used to be strewn with rubbish and sewage. Now, the streets are clean, with brightly-colored recycling bins featuring prominently. As the city looks to its future, the hillside communities, together with the majority of the city's young people, are obvious areas of economic expansion. The mayor's office has established small clinics to encourage ""micro entrepreneurs"" like Clara Ramirez, who sells handicrafts. ""I have learned a lot, like calculating costs and budgets,"" she says. ""And computers -- now I have a few ideas if one day I have to present my work as an entrepreneur."" Medellin is by no means a perfect city: Its murder rate has fallen by 80% since the Escobar days but it remains significant. And many still live in poverty. Yet there is an undeniable sense of optimism and pride that the city seems to be on the right path through a commitment to innovation.","Colombian city of Medellin was once known as the home of drug lord Pablo Escobar .

"(CNN)  -- Hayao Miyazaki is regarded by many as the world's greatest living animator and an icon of Japanese popular culture. In 2002, his work burst onto international screens with the ghostly animation ""Spirited Away."" It smashed box office records in Japan and earned him an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Setting up Studio Ghibli in 1985, the 70-year-old has made 18 animated features that fuse wild fantasy with more serious issues including environmentalism and feminism. Miyazaki's 2008 film ""Ponyo"" featured a catastrophic tsunami, but the animator insists that including disasters in his films only makes him a realist able to highlight the fragility of life rather than a prophetic, doom-monger. ""I can't predict things, but I knew that a tsunami was coming because if you live in Japan that's to be expected,"" he said. ""We just forgot that at some point a tsunami will come. Even in the disaster stricken areas, people should have known, or even if they knew they probably felt that they were protected by the concrete around them."" Miyazaki visited the tsunami-hit area of northeast Japan four months after the disaster to screen his films to local children. Surveying the devastation around the town of Rikuzen-Takada, he said: ""The people who are going to live here should take the time and really think about what kind of town should be rebuilt."" His own attention to detail and pain-staking approach to making his films has gained him plaudits from contemporaries like Pixar's John Lasseter and ""Wallace and Gromit"" animator Nick Park. But he does believe that his Studio Ghibli is one of a dying breed; a place where animators draw by hand and use computer animation sparingly. ""We are an extinct species maybe, an island of the Galapagos, and well, (hand drawing) is the only thing I'm interested in and therefore people who are not interested in working by hand should choose another place of work."" While aware of the need to creating a functioning business with Studio Ghibli, Miyazaki remains protective of his films -- ""all my films are all my children"" -- especially when shown to international audiences. He once sent a samurai sword to Harvey Weinstein who was handling the release of ""Princess Mononoke"" with a note attached reading: ""No cuts."" ""Sometimes we have to create animation to support the studio, not have the studio to support the animation,"" he said. ""But we can't really have that approach so we have to change our mindset and say that we want to make this animation. ""Just as long as there are people, there is an audience for the films we make, that is enough.""","Hayao Mizayaki created Studio Ghibli with business partner in 1985 .

"(CNN) -- Some of the president's men are still working. In golf's Presidents Cup, that is. And while U.S. President Barack Obama wasn't in attendance in Ohio -- he has more important things to worry about -- a former president, George W. Bush, greeted both teams Thursday at the Muirfield Village Golf Club. The biennial competition, which pits the U.S. against the rest of the world minus Europe, has been kinder to the Americans than the more prestigious Ryder Cup. Indeed since the tournament started in 1994, only once has the International Team prevailed, and the U.S. has won four in a row. The U.S. featured six players in the top 10 in the rankings, including world No. 1 and PGA Player of the Year Tiger Woods. The International Team, by contrast, had one -- Masters champion Adam Scott. Early indications suggested the U.S.'s superiority in the rankings would translate to an easy victory -- they led all six fourballs in the early stages. But after about a 90-minute delay because of thunderstorms, the International Team fought back. By day's end, it was 3.5 to 2.5 for the U.S., a slender advantage. Jason Day's dramatic putt at the 18th gave the Australian and Graham DeLaet a win over Hunter Mahan and Brandt Snedeker after Woods and Matt Kuchar routed Angel Cabrera and Marc Leishman 5 and 4. ""It's awfully fun partnering the No. 1 player in the world,"" Kuchar said in a televised interview. The U.S. fell behind as Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley lost to Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel 2 and 1 before Scott and Hideki Matsuyama halved with Bill Haas and Webb Simpson. Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson eased past Branden Grace and Richard Sterne 5 and 3 to level the match. In the decider, Steve Stricker and Jordan Spieth edged Ernie Els and Brendon de Jonge. Stricker's short putt at the 18th gave the U.S. the lead heading into Friday's foursomes.","After the opening day of the Presidents Cup, the U.S. leads 3.5 to 2.5 in Ohio .

"CHENGDU, China (CNN) -- Rainy weather and poor logistics thwarted efforts by relief troops who walked for hours over rock, debris and mud on Tuesday in hopes of reaching the worst-hit area of an earthquake that killed nearly 10,000 in central China, state-run media reported. Setting out from Maerkang in Sichuan Province at 8 p.m. Monday, the 100 or so troops had to travel 200 kilometers (124 miles) to go before reaching Wenchuan, the epicenter of the quake, also in the province, Xinhua reported. After seven hours, they still had 70 kilometers (43 miles) to go. ""I have seen many collapsed civilian houses, and the rocks dropped from mountains on the roadside are everywhere,"" the head of the unit, Li Zaiyuan, told Xinhua. Added CNN Correspondent John Vause: ""The roads here are terrible in the best of times ... right now they're down right atrocious. They've resorted to going in one man at a time on foot."" Nearly all the confirmed deaths were in Sichuan Province, but rescuers were hindered because roads linking it to the provincial capital, Chengdu, were damaged, Xinhua reported. Local radio quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged. The earthquake was powerful enough to be felt throughout most of China. Many children were buried under the rubble of their schools. The Chinese government said the death toll was sure to rise. An expert told CNN the 7.9-magnitude quake at about 2:28 p.m. Monday (6:28 a.m. GMT) was the largest the region has seen ""for over a generation."" Residents as far as Chongqing -- about 200 miles from the epicenter in Sichuan Province -- spent the night outdoors, too afraid of aftershocks to sleep indoors. Local radio in Sichuan quoted disaster relief officials as saying a third of the buildings in Wenchuan collapsed from the quake and another third were seriously damaged.  Watch as the death toll rises » . The state-run Zhongxin news agency reported that a survivor who escaped Beichuan county in Sichuan Province described the province as having been ""razed to the ground."" The Red Cross Society of China, coordinating some of the international aid efforts, encouraged financial donations because of the difficulty of getting supplies to those most in need. At least six schools collapsed to some extent in the quake or aftershocks that followed, Xinhua reported.  See a report on rescue operations at the school » . At one school, almost 900 students -- all eighth-graders and ninth-graders, according to a local villager -- were believed to be buried.  See workers in Chengdu hiding under their desks during the quake » . At least 50 bodies were pulled from the rubble by Monday night at Juyuan Middle School in Juyuan Township of Dujiangyan City, Sichuan Province, Xinhua reported. ""Some buried teenagers were struggling to free themselves from the ruins while others were calling for help. Eight excavators were working at the site. Devastated parents watched as five cranes worked at the site and an ambulance waited,"" Xinhua reported. ""A tearful mother said her son, ninth-grader Zhang Chengwei, was buried in the ruins."" Meanwhile, 2,300 people were buried in two collapsed chemical plants in Sichuan's Shifang city, and 80 tons of ammonia leaked out, Xinhua reported. Six hundred people died there. The plants were among a series of buildings that collapsed, including private homes, schools and factories. The local government has evacuated 6,000 civilians from the area and was dispatching firefighters to help at the scene, Xinhua reported. Much of the nation's transportation system shut down. Xinhua reported there were ""multiple landslides and collapses along railway lines"" near Chengdu.  Quake victims have been sleeping outside in Chengdu » . Sichuan Province sits in the Sichuan basin and is surrounded by the Himalayas to the west. The Yangtze River flows through the province and the Three Gorges Dam in the nearby Hubei Province controls flooding to the Sichuan -- though there were no reports of damage to the world's largest dam. Monday's quake was caused by the Tibetan plateau colliding with the Sichuan basin, Zhigang Peng, an earthquake expert at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, told CNN. ""Earthquakes in this part of China are infrequent but not uncommon,"" he said. The last major earthquake in the region occurred in the northwestern margin of the Sichuan basin when a 7.5-magnitude quake killed more than 9,300 people on August 25, 1933. President Hu Jintao ordered an all-out effort to help those affected, and Premier Wen Jiabao traveled to the region to direct the rescue work, Xinhua reported. ""My fellow Chinese, facing such a severe disaster, we need calm, confidence, courage and efficient organization,"" Wen was quoted as saying. ""I believe we can certainly overcome the disaster with the public and the military working together under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the government."" Peter Sammonds, professor of geophysics at University College London, called the earthquake ""tremendous."" ""Particularly in the more remote, the more mountainous part where this has taken place, a lot of the buildings are built on sediments that are quite unstable. They're probably liquifying, causing the buildings to collapse. You might expect landslides to occur, which could actually stop the relief efforts going through on the roads, so this could be very grim in the remoter, more mountainous parts of this province."" While many of the most immediate efforts were focused on Sichuan Province, Xinhua also reported dead and injured in Gansu, Chongqing and Yunnan provinces. A provincial government spokesman said they feared more dead and injured in collapsed houses in Dujiangyan City in Wenchuan County. A driver for the seismological bureau said he saw ""rows of houses collapsed"" in Dujiangyan, Xinhua reported. Bonnie Thie, the country director of the Peace Corps, told CNN she was on a university campus in Chengdu about 60 miles from the epicenter, in the eastern part of China's Sichuan province, when the first quake hit. ""You could see the ground shaking,"" Thie told CNN. The shaking ""went on for what seemed like a very long time,"" she said. Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said this quake could cause major damage because of its strength and proximity to major population centers. Also, it was relatively shallow,  and those kinds of quakes tend to do more damage near the epicenter than deeper ones, Presgrave said. An earthquake with 7.5 magnitude in the northern Chinese city of Tangshan killed 255,000 people in 1976 -- the greatest death toll from an earthquake in the last four centuries and the second greatest in recorded history, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tangshan is roughly 995 miles (1,600 km) from Chengdu, the nearest major city to the epicenter of Monday's quake.  Read an explanation about earthquakes » . After the quake struck Monday, the ground shook as far away as Beijing, which is 950 miles (1,528 km) from the epicenter. Residents of the Chinese capital, which hosts this year's Olympic Games in August, felt a quiet, rolling sensation for about a minute.  See CNN's interview with an American in Chengdu » . Thousands of people were evacuated from Beijing buildings immediately after the earthquake. At least seven more earthquakes -- measuring between 4.0 and 6.0 magnitudes -- happened nearby over the four hours after the initial quake at at 2:28 p.m. local time, the USGS reported. A spokesman for the Beijing Olympic Committee said no Olympic venues were affected. The huge Three Gorges Dam -- roughly 400 miles east of the epicenter -- was not damaged, a spokesman said. The earthquake was also felt in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taiwan, and as far away as Hanoi, Vietnam, and Bangkok, Thailand, according to the Hong Kong-based Mandarin-language channel Phoenix TV.

"(CNN) -- Mexico's high court has overturned a lower court ruling that freed Mexican drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero. The Mexican Supreme Court's decision came a day after U.S. authorities said they would pay up to $5 million for information leading to Caro Quintero's arrest or conviction. Caro Quintero, 61, once leader of Mexico's now-defunct Guadalajara Cartel, is accused in the 1985 kidnapping and killing of DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. He had served 28 years of a 40-year sentence for the killings when a judge in Mexico's Jalisco state overturned his conviction in August. After a meeting in Washington in September, Mexican Attorney General JesÃºs Murillo Karam promised that authorities in his country would reapprehend Caro Quintero. But there's been no word on the accused drug lord's whereabouts since then. The Drug Enforcement Administration describes Caro Quintero as fugitive from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on felony murder and kidnapping charges, in addition to other criminal charges. On August 9, a Mexican federal court overturned Caro Quintero's conviction, ruling that he had been incorrectly tried in the country's federal judicial system, when he should have been tried at the state level. In a 4-1 ruling Wednesday, Mexico's Supreme Court declared that ruling invalid. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Mariano Castillo, Rafael Romo and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Mexico's Supreme Court declares an August appeals court ruling invalid .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Novak Djokovic will play Rafael Nadal in the final of the ATP World Tour Finals at London's O2 Arena after both men comfortably overcame their Swiss opponents in Sunday's semifinals. World No.1 Nadal dispatched his old adversary Roger Federer in straight sets 7-5 6-3 to book only his second appearance in the season-ending tournament final while Djokovic dismissed Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3 6-3. The results set up what should be an absorbing match on Monday evening and a fitting finale to a season the Serb and the Spaniard have dominated. Together, the pair have amassed more than $20 million in prize money in 2013 and won 16 titles -- Nadal has ten to Djokovic's six. They have met three times on hardcourts this year with Nadal shading it 2-1 thanks to wins in Montreal in August and the following month at Flushing Meadows. But Djokovic won their most recent encounter at the China Open in straight sets and is unbeaten in 21 matches since losing to the Spaniard at the U.S. Open. ""It's going to be a great final. I hope all the crowd will enjoy it because we definitely do on the court. It's always a thrilling competition between me and Rafa. It's the biggest match of this part of the year for both of us and we want to end up with the title. The better (man) will win,"" Djokovic said. Nadal is also looking forward to the challenge. ""It's the perfect way to finish the season, probably one of the best seasons of my career,"" Nadal said after his victory over Federer. ""This is a special tournament but I have lost here before and not had the most luck, so it's great to be in the final."" Nadal overcame Federer in 79 minutes shading a hard-fought first set before easing through the second as Federer was let down by some untidy errors. A loose forehand gifted Nadal a break of serve before a wayward volley handed Nadal a 75th win of the season in a remarkable comeback year. ""I just struggled to stay consistent enough throughout the match and that's why he deserved to win. He was better today,"" Federer said afterwards. Djokovic, meanwhile, coasted to victory over Wawrinka who was competing in his first ATP World Tour Finals. The 28-year-old Swiss broke the Serb in the third game, before Djokovic assumed total control. The world No.2 broke back in the next game and again in the eighth before serving out the set. Wawrinka then lost his opening service game in the second as Djokovic once again quietly dominated with a trademark blend of defense and attack. ""It was a very enjoyable match for me today. The performance was by far the best so far in the tournament,"" Djokovic said.","World No.1 and World No.2 will play in Monday's final at London's O2 Arena .

"TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- Some Florida minimum-security inmates want to know: Can you handle the heat? Inmates work with peppers at the Hillsborough County Jail in Tampa, Florida. Hot sauce heat, that is -- Jail House Fire Hot Sauce, cooked up by inmates at the Hillsborough County Jail and now offered for sale. The idea to make Jail House Fire Hot Sauce came from a Cuban former inmate who thought food in the big house was bland. Allen Boatman, the head of the jail's horticulture program, remembers what his former trusty said: ""We're growing these peppers. Why don't we use them?"" Peppers are grown as part of the jail's horticulture program, which is voluntary and offered only to minimum-security trusties. The inmates learn about growing plants, ornamentals, trees, herbs and vegetables -- including more than 1,200 varieties of peppers. ""I thought that was a great idea, so I started doing research on some of the recipes,"" says Boatman. The research led to a variety of hot sauces that can be bought for $7 a bottle at the jail in Tampa, Florida, or online at www.jailhousefire.org. There are three different sauces for sale: . Coming soon is a fourth sauce: Misdemeanor.  Watch the inmates at work on hot sauce » . Orders for the Jail House Fire sauces have come in from as far away as Germany, England and even Australia. The inmates make no money from this product. The money goes back into an inmate fund that pays for things like the greenhouse where the peppers are grown. The horticulture program pays for itself, says Boatman, so no taxpayer money is used. Several times a year the program hosts a sale of its ornamentals, shrubs and trees, and the locals turn up to support the program. The money raised is used to purchase necessities like fertilizer and soil. A green thumb is not the only thing that inmate and program member Deline is developing, he says. ""We learn a lot about professionalism, respect, teamwork, ya know -- all that helps,"" Deline says. And working in the fields is good for the inmates' self-worth, Boatman says. ""They actually see something growing that they've been involved in. It gives them a lot of sense of pride and accomplishment,"" says Boatman. ""Possibly that'll give them some momentum when they are released to go and get a job and start being a productive member of society."" Boatman doesn't just wish his trusties a good future; he gives them an opportunity. When the inmates are released, they are given a certificate of completion in vocational horticulture. This certificate comes from the school board, with no mention of the program behind bars. Deline hopes this will work in his favor when he starts looking for a job. ""Florida is full of a lot of landscaping [and] landscaping companies, a lot of nursery companies,"" Deline says. ""Maybe I can use the experience to better myself in the future.""","Florida minimum-security jail raises peppers, uses them in hot sauce .

"(CNN) -- The co-founder of the popular social news site Reddit has called on the leaders of Google, Facebook and Twitter to help defeat a controversial cybersecurity bill that would compromise the privacy of their users if passed by lawmakers. ""I'm hoping that all of these tech companies take the stand that their privacy policies matter, their users' privacy matters, and no legislation like CISPA should take that away,"" Alexis Ohanian, former owner of Reddit (Wired's parent company Conde Nast currently owns Reddit), said in a video posted last week. ""If someone wants access to our private home or to our mail we would say, Well go get a warrant. Right? CISPA basically says, uh, not necessary. Your digital privacy is irrelevant."" The video shows Ohanian trying to call Google CEO Larry Page to urge him to oppose the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). But when he reaches the company — through the switchboard — the operator tells him that no one by that name works at Google. ""I am pretty sure there's a Larry Page at Google,"" he replies. Ohanian, who is on the steering committee for the Internet Defense League and is very active in the fight to preserve internet freedom, also called on the public to sign a petition to defeat CISPA in the way users helped defeat the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Propert Act in 2011. ""Since we couldn't get in touch with the deciders, maybe you can,"" he says. ""Sign the petition, get on social media, because this is what defeated SOPA and PIPA and this is what will defeat CISPA and this is what will defeat whatever they throw at us. Internet freedom, Internet privacy matters."" The bill opens the way for government agencies and the private sector to share information about cyberattack threats, but critics say it lacks protections to preserve the privacy of users and gives companies immunity for repercussions that might come as a result of sharing information. The White House announced this week that President Obama planned to veto the bill if passed without protections that would force companies to anonymize and minimize data they provide the government and other companies. In a statement the White House said it remained ""concerned that the bill does not require private entities to take reasonable steps to remove irrelevant personal information when sending cybersecurity data to the government or other private sector entities. Citizens have a right to know that corporations will be held accountable—and not granted immunity—for failing to safeguard personal information adequately."" Despite Ohanian's plea and the White House veto threat, the House passed the CISPA bill on Thursday by a vote of 288 to 127. A companion bill is planned for the Senate. The American Civil Liberties Union said today, following the passage of CISPA in the House, that it will continue working to correct the problems with CISPA. ""CISPA is an extreme proposal that allows companies that hold our very sensitive information to share it with any company or government entity they choose, even directly with military agencies like the NSA, without first stripping out personally identifiable information,"" Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel at the ACLU's Washington Legislative Office, said in a statement. ""We will work with Congress to make sure that the next version of information sharing legislation unequivocally resolves this issue, as well as tightens immunity provisions and protects personal information. Cybersecurity can be done without sacrificing Americans' privacy online."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old boy was charged late Sunday in connection with a shooting at the Bryant Park skating rink that wounded two people, New York City police said. Corey Dunton was arrested and charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon, and will be charged as an adult, according to New York Police Detective Kelly Ort. Police believe Saturday's shooting began over an argument about a coat, Ort said. One victim was shot in the back and the second one in the leg, police said. The victims' injuries are not life-threatening. The victims were 14 and 20 years of age. Police are withholding the victims' names at this time. Megan Cutcher, a San Francisco resident visiting New York City, was having a drink with relatives at a nearby restaurant when the gunfire started. ""We sat down at one of the outdoor couches with a heater and ordered a drink,"" Cutcher said. ""Right after we ordered, we heard three shots. Initially, it just sounded like a pop gun, but then people started screaming, and we realized it was more serious."" She grabbed her mother and pushed her under the table. ""We were at most 10-15 feet from the ice,"" she said. ""Luckily, the couches we'd been sitting on blocked us from the view of the shooter."" A few minutes later, the gunfire stopped and the restaurant staff ushered them into the kitchen for safety. ""I was able to calm down a bit, though my heart was racing,"" she said. Police ordered them to stay put while they searched the area. About an hour later, they got an all-clear to use a particular exit. Shooting leaves 2 dead at house party near Houston .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race has often been looked to as an off-year barometer of national political sentiment. This year's grind-it-out race, an acrimonious spitball contest between two candidates only slightly more likeable than Walter White, is anything but. In a lesser-of-two-evils campaign, Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Democratic fundraiser and confidante to former President Bill Clinton, is clinging to a modest but sturdy lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, the state's attorney general. Republicans have pilloried McAuliffe as a sleazy political operator and failed businessman who exploited his Washington connections to help his sputtering car company, GreenTech Automotive. Cuccinelli has been targeted as a far-right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception. Democrats on Twitter are fond of calling him #creepyken. McAuliffe is leading Cuccinelli among likely voters by an eight-point margin, 47% to 39%, according to a Washington Post poll out this week. McAuliffe is hardly bulletproof: A federal investigation into GreenTech has sullied his reputation, and only two-thirds of Democrats -- his own party -- consider him ""honest and trustworthy."" But Cuccinelli is on much shakier ground. While Republicans are slightly more fired up about voting for him than Democrats are for McAuliffe, Cuccinelli's favorable ratings are next-to-toxic: More than half of likely voters view him unfavorably. Enter Robert Sarvis. As public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies, the baby-faced 37-year old Libertarian candidate from Fairfax has quietly crept northward in the polls, reaching 10% in the Post poll. That's not nearly enough to win in November -- with just five weeks until Election Day, even Sarvis admits ""we have to get a lot higher"" -- but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from Cuccinelli. Sarvis chafes at the label. ""I don't even know what it means to be a spoiler,"" he said in an interview. ""The system is rotten to the core from Republican and Democratic malfeasance. They have already spoiled the system. I don't even know what it means to be a spoiler. If I am the only one arguing for freedom and the rule of law, then those two are the spoilers as far as I'm concerned."" Positioning himself as a moderate . The Harvard and NYU-educated attorney and software programmer -- he was part of a team that won Google's Android Developer Prize for creating a ""mobile app for true nightlifers"" -- is positioning himself as the moderate choice between two ""extreme"" candidates. In his telling, McAuliffe ""stands for an extreme version of crony capitalism."" Cuccinelli is ""very regressive on social issues"" and ""unreliable"" on economic matters. Both parties, he said, are in league with the banks and ""rich folks"" -- a frustration that first motivated him to run for office in 2011, when he mounted an unsuccessful Republican bid to unseat longtime Democratic state Senate leader Dick Saslaw. Though he said he left the GOP after that race, he voted in Virginia's Republican presidential primary in 2012, casting a ballot for Ron Paul. That November, he voted for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee. Sarvis supports same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization and says climate change is real. He opposes gun restrictions, higher taxes, the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and last year's landmark transportation bill in Richmond that raised some taxes to help fix northern Virginia's clogged roadways. Sarvis said he would pay for transportation funding, in part, by cutting from the education budget and finding ways to ""prioritize spending."" Sarvis might deny being a spoiler, but Cuccinelli's campaign conceded Thursday that the Libertarian is draining support from the Republican nominee. ""There's no question that a vote for Robert Sarvis is a vote for Terry McAuliffe and a vote against liberty,"" said Richard Cullen, Cuccinelli's communications director. ""It's important to remember that there's no greater defender of first principles and liberty in Virginia than Ken Cuccinelli,"" Cullen said, outlining why Libertarian-leaning Republicans should stay in the party fold. ""Ken was the first attorney general in the nation to sue to stop Obamacare and he led an eight year battle to secure Virginians' private property rights in the state constitution. He's also the only candidate in this race who's laid out a clear, substantive plan to free up the private sector and create 58,000 jobs."" Challenges for third-party candidates . Few political observers in Virginia expect Sarvis, who has little money in the bank and almost no political machinery behind him, to reach the 10% threshold, or even the 8% mark he hit in another recent poll from NBC News and Marist. The last third-party candidate in Virginia to reach that level of support was Marshall Coleman, who snagged 11% of the vote in the madcap three-way 1994 Senate race. Unlike Sarvis, though, Coleman had political pedigree and bona fide institutional support: then-Sen. John Warner backed Coleman that year over the flame-throwing Republican nominee, Oliver North. The Democratic incumbent, Chuck Robb, eked out a three-point win that year. A more recent example of third-party noise-making came in the 2005 governor's race, when Russ Potts, a GOP state senator who ran as an independent, aired a memorable statewide television ad featuring people loudly banging on pots as they chanted ""We want Potts!"" Despite polling as high as 9% that year, Potts only garnered 2% in the end, as Democrat Tim Kaine edged out Republican Jerry Kilgore to win the governorship. Even if Sarvis tumbles from his current standing and only captures a small slice of the vote on Election Day, Republicans fear that most of that support will come straight out of Cuccinelli's back pocket, especially in what's expected to be a low turnout election. ""Nearly all of his vote will come from people right of center who feel obligated to vote but can't support Cuccinelli because he is too far to the right, or they fear what he would be like as governor and can't vote for McAuliffe because he's a Democrat,"" observed one well-connected Richmond Republican who is not directly involved in the race. Cuccinelli faces gender gap . Cuccinelli is in trouble with or without a third party candidate, due in large part to a startling gender gap that emerged this summer after free-spending Democrats began hammering the Republican on women's health issues. Women favor McAuliffe over Cuccinelli by an enormous 24-point margin, and even without Sarvis in the race, the Post poll showed McAuliffe leading Cuccinelli by a five-point margin, 49-44. But Sarvis isn't going anywhere, and his rising poll numbers are making an uphill fight for Cuccinelli that much steeper. Sarvis' most obvious challenge is exposure. A large majority of Virginia voters still have no clue who he is or what he stands for, a challenge that wasn't made easier by his exclusion from a debate Wednesday night sponsored by the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. In response, Sarvis tapped into his meager campaign budget -- he reported having only $19,109 in the bank at the end of August -- to run a TV ad during the debate attacking McAuliffe's ""cronyism"" and Cuccinelli's ""narrow-minded social agenda."" The ad starred his two children and his African-American wife, Astrid, whom he met in a Mississippi book store when he spied her reading ""The Da Vinci Code"" and told her he had recently seen the movie. John Vaught LaBeaume, a Sarvis adviser, said the campaign has been in touch with the organizers of the third and final debate in Roanoke in late October, and have received ""encouraging"" signals about being included. Until then, Sarvis said he's content to meet voters by driving around the commonwealth in his van, listening to Pink Floyd, as the other campaigns savage each other on the airwaves. ""If they keep destroying each other with negative ads that's fine with us,"" he said drily.","Republicans look to retain governorship in battleground state .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- You have a job, and it's a good one at that. But something is missing. You aren't really challenged anymore. You've been doing the same thing too long. Your company isn't likely to be promoting anyone soon because it has just gone through a major downsizing, merger or takeover. You have two choices: Quit and start over somewhere else, assuming there is somewhere else to go; or look closer to home, right in your current company, to see what other ways your talents can be put to use. Getting out of your career rut requires a mental tow truck. Rev up your brain and consider these points: . 1. Adjust your pace. If you told a 500-meter sprinter who was 250 meters into the race that he was now going to be running a mile, what's the first thing he'd do? Of course, he would change his tempo. He'd stride differently, pace himself differently. The first thing any sensible employee does in a downsized company is to do the same. Realize the path between promotions may now be longer. The rules have changed in mid-race. Tear out your hair and curse the gods if you think it'll help, but the worst thing you can do is make believe it didn't happen. 2. Analyze your competition. More than ever, it's important to know whom you're up against for those few remaining slots. What are the other people doing? What are they overlooking? Is the next promotion slated to go to somebody outside the company to bring in ""fresh blood"" and ""new perspectives""? Analyze yourself, too. How marketable are you in the outside world? Get to know your value and your options. 3. Look for sideways growth. If you can't grow going up, can you build your credentials and experience through lateral moves that would teach you new skills? If you're dead-ended in programming, explore the prospects in marketing. There's never been a company yet that didn't need more sales. Give yourself an alternative route. It's a great way to improve your promotion odds long term. 4. Study the corporate culture. Does the company favor a certain way of doing things? Is there a corporate style? When you study the way the winners do it and compare that to the way you do it, you may not like what you see, but you'd better see it. 5. Take a look at your personal risk factor. Sure, there are ways to move up faster, but before you leap, look at the risks involved. If your advancement opportunities are fewer, you may have to find ways to stand out from the rest of the pack. You may fall flat on your face trying, but are you willing to take the chance? Do you have any bold new ideas to propose? Will you take on projects that really stretch your abilities? You can get yourself noticed, and you may get ahead in the process, but your risk of failure increases, too. I'm for trying. Go the extra mile. It's never crowded. You'll fail some of the time. If you don't, you're not trying hard enough. If you want to be the leader of the pack, you have to be willing to stick your neck out in front of the others. Sometimes it's risky not to take risks. 6. Draw up your plan. Add up all the factors: pace, competition, long-term growth options, risk and the hard facts about advancement. Then put down your plan, in writing. 7. Measure your results. If you can, share your plan with your boss, and then measure your own progress on a fixed schedule. If you still don't seem to be going places, it's time to tune up the résumé and look around for a new track to run on. It's been said that the hardest part of climbing to the top of the ladder is getting through the crowd at the bottom. I would add that the first step is the hardest one to take.

"(CNN) -- ""This is Norway checker,"" echoed the voice through the scrambler. ""I have a good stop for you in Stavanger."" Nobody on the outside world could have known what she meant. But inside Bletchley Park, a World War II code-breaking enclave in the English countryside of Buckinghamshire, 18-year-old Ruth Bourne had discovered a vital piece of intelligence. Working alongside thousands of other women to decipher encoded German signals sent between Nazi generals, Bourne's discovery meant passing on the information to her superiors to assess whether this was another piece of the decryption puzzle. Read more: Code-breaking Enigma machine goes under the hammer . With every room named after a country that had been toppled by the Nazis, and each machine christened as one of its towns, Bletchley Park's simple yet effective checking system proved crucial in the defeat of Hitler's regime. A culture of secrecy . Far from being a group of experienced decoders, however, the estate's recruits mainly consisted of young teenage military personnel, a smattering of crossword whizzes who had been able to complete The Daily Telegraph's puzzle in less than 12 minutes, and numerous 18-year-old girls plucked from their quiet home towns. ""It was the middle of the war when I received a call saying I was to go into war work to support Britain's efforts from home,"" explains 88-year-old Margaret Bullen, a machine wire operator who served from 1942 until the end of the war. ""A letter from the Foreign Office then arrived saying I had an interview -- but I had no idea what it was for, and two weeks later, I was told I'd be off to Bletchley."" Read more: Enigma machine sells for world record price . ""Before starting work we were told to sign the Official Secrets Act, which was a rather frightening experience for someone as young and naive as I was,"" says 90-year-old Becky Webb, who joined the war effort at age 18 in 1941. ""I had no idea how I'd comply with it!"" But compliance was the only option, making these three young women -- Webb, Bullen and Bourne -- fierce guards of the country's anonymous decoding history for several decades. Indeed, it wasn't until some thirty years later that Bletchley's long maintained shroud of secrecy began to lift, after the publication of ""The Ultra Secret"" -- a tell all book from former RAF officer Frederick W. Winterbotham, who later became an Ultra supervisor. The 1974 expose revealed how Ultra intelligence had been used to intercept communication behind enemy lines and disseminate vital information to Britain and its allies. Though Winterbotham was accused of embellishing and aggrandizing his role in the tale, without his account, the real story of what went on inside the UK's code-breaking operation may never have been known. Read more: 70-year-old coded war message found attached to pigeon . ""It sounds strange that we knew so little about what was going on, but that was how it was,"" reflects Bullen. ""I was sent to live with a couple who were ordered to take me in because of the war. They never once asked me what I was doing there--nobody did--not even the local village workers who'd serve us coffee at the cafÃ© on our lunch break, in spite of the fact a group of 18-year-olds had suddenly arrived in this little hamlet,"" she explains. ""I only heard the name Colossus--the machine I was working on--some three decades after the war ended, and it wasn't until I later visited Bletchley Park that I said: 'this is where I worked, this is what I did!'"" While Winterbotham's revelations sent shock waves through the secretive decryption community, lifting the lid on what really happened inside the park ensued slowly and sporadically, with the bulk of the information being released in the early 2000s. ""I'm delighted that we can discuss our time there now that everything has come out, and I give talks on the subject whenever I'm asked,"" enthuses Webb. ""I've given 97 to date!"" Silent heroines . For many of the young women at Bletchley, though, the removal of the clandestine veil came too late, with the majority of workers' parents having passed away before the decryption effort became public knowledge. Bourne, an 18-year-old naval recruit who was sent to one of the park's expansion locations in Eastcote -- on the outskirts of London -- was one of many who was never able to tell her loved ones about her contribution to the war. ""You led two lives there,"" she recalls. ""One life was in A Block, where you ate in the canteen, and talked about boyfriends, and getting trains to London, and where to find black nylon stockings."" ""B Block was where we worked, surrounded by high walls, barbed wire and two naval marines guarding the place. If you could make your voice heard over the noise of 12 Turing Bombe machines, that was the only time you would speak about work -- but you never would,"" she explains. ""I never knew what any of my coworkers were doing, and vice versa, and my parents never knew a thing of it."" After the Nazi regime fell in 1945, many of Bletchley's women returned home, while others stayed involved with the military's work. Bourne was given work as a wire destroyer: desoldering the many cables that had been painstakingly connected during intelligence operations throughout the war, while Webb was sent to the Pentagon to paraphrase translated Japanese messages for transmission to officials. ""Upon leaving Bletchley, we really had no skills whatsoever,"" remembers Bourne. ""Apart from how to keep a secret!"" And that secret was very nearly never told, especially after the original estate was due to be knocked down some 23 years ago, with houses and a supermarket planned to be built in its place. Preserving Bletchley . It was in May of 1991that Bletchley's fortunes changed, after a small local committee gathered a group of veterans at the park to say a final farewell to the historic location. But the group became determined to turn it into a heritage site after hearing the astounding stories of so many code-breakers, engineers and members of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WREN) who worked at the park during the war. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed the following year, and from then on, regular reunions and exhibitions at the estate have enabled its former workers and inhabitants to share stories that were on the precipice of being lost forever. Winterbotham's book might have been the first time that story of the World War II code-breakers entered the realm of popular culture, but it certainly wasn't the last, with TV drama ""The Bletchley Circle"" proving popular in both the UK and United States earlier this year. With a second series on its way, and exhibitions at the Trust attracting visitors from around the globe, the world's fascination with the once elusive Bletchley Park shows no sign of slowing. The culture of secrecy that once threatened Bletchley from being all but erased from the history books has well and truly ended.

"(CNN) -- What happens when the Winter Olympics party leaves town? It's a question that is probably giving organizers of the Sochi 2014 Games sleepless nights and, if the example of Lillehammer is anything to go by, some food for thought. Will all the expense be worthwhile? Russia is spending an unprecedented $50 billion on completely revamping its faded Black Sea resort, hoping to turn it into a tourist mecca and hi-tech business destination for decades after next February's 16 days of competition. Can Vladimir Putin's grand planners learn from one of the smallest host venues in Olympic history? Leap of faith . As Stein Gruben prepared to make the historic leap at the opening ceremony of the 1994 Winter Games, he carried with him not just the symbolic torch but also the hopes of the Norwegian nation. He was drafted in 48 hours earlier after Ole Gunnar Fidjestol was injured during practice, and his ski jump was to be the dramatic denouement to the Olympic flame's 7,500-mile journey from Greece. Following the theft of Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" from Norway's National Gallery in Oslo earlier that February day, Lillehammer's organizers could have been forgiven for wearing their own looks of anguished despair as Gruben started his descent. But they needn't have worried. The 26-year-old understudy landed safely in the Lysgardsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena before handing on the torch on for its final earthbound journey to the Olympic cauldron. While Lillehammer '94 is perhaps best known for the sad soap opera that played out between U.S. figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, Norwegians remember a far happier time, when a small town of 23,500 residents became the center of the sporting universe. Party atmosphere . ""It was a party for the Norwegian people,"" recalls Inge Andersen, Secretary General of the Norwegian Olympic Committee. ""It brought people together, there was a lot of pride and there was also lovely winter conditions. So it was, in one way, a great promotion for the country. Everyone was happy."" This celebratory atmosphere helped push the country's athletes to new heights. Speed skater Johann Olav Koss led the way with three golds (and three world records) as Norway bagged a record 26 medals (10 gold, 11 silver, five bronze). But six years earlier, the idea of Lillehammer playing host to such scenes was almost impossible to imagine. Norway had endured its worst Winter Games for more than three decades at Calgary in 1988, picking up just three silver and two bronze. And after finishing fourth in the bid to host the 1992 Games (won by Albertville, France), Lillehammer was considered a rank outsider in the race to host the '94 Games -- the first time winter and summer Olympics were held in different years. But to everyone's amazement, Lillehammer beat Sweden's Ostersund -- population 60,000 -- in the final round of voting, setting in motion the task of turning a remote town 110 miles north of Oslo into a center of sporting excellence. ""There was really nothing there,"" Andersen told CNN. ""There were no big venues before the Olympics. It was a huge gift to this part of Norway."" Around 680 million Norwegian Krone ($220 million) of the 12 billion NOK ($2 billion) total budget was spent transforming the Lillehammer landscape. New venues were built for ski jumping, ice hockey, bobsleigh/luge along with freestyle and cross-country ski stadiums. Additional arenas were sited in neighboring towns Hamar and Gjovik and two new ski resorts were built north of the Lillehammer in Kvitfjell and Hajfell. ""Lillehammer is now the natural choice for top athletes and national teams. It has probably become the strongest sports region in the country,"" says Andersen. The 16-day event is also remembered as the first ""green"" Games, enshrining the now familiar ethos of conservation and sustainability at big sporting events. Perhaps the most visible and enduring reminder were the Olympic medals themselves, which were partly made from stone extracted during construction of the ski jumping arena. A different type of recycling was used when the 26,500mÂ² international media center was refurbished and handed over to Lillehammer University College in 1995. Today, the campus has more than 4,000 students and, since 1997, has been home to the Norwegian Film School. Olympic tourist trap . While an educational legacy may be secure, the economic aspirations of boosting tourism in the region proved harder to realize. Part of the idea of staging the Olympics in Lillehammer was to provide investment in inland Norway, Andersen says, bringing it up to a level with the successful oil and fish industries on the west coast and in the north of the country. It worked in as much that it encouraged (and still does) affluent city dwellers in Oslo and other southern cities to build luxury second homes near the sports facilities. But the goal of encouraging more Norwegians and foreign tourists to the wider region have largely failed, says Jon Teigland, a Norwegian social scientist who has studied the economic after-effects of the Lillehammer Olympics. ""The predictions on a regional level was that tourist demand would increase more than 100%. Local scientists predicted annual increases of 15% over a long period. The reality is zero outside all four communities that got Winter Olympic sports facilities,"" says Teigland. Norway did experience a rise in foreign tourists before the Olympics and for two years after, says Teigland, but this was largely down to increased numbers from eastern Europe (particularly Germans) following the fall of communism in 1989 and subsequent years. But long-term predictions (10% per year for the decade after the Games) for tourist growth nationally never happened. Lillehammer and the other Olympic resorts didn't emerge completely unscathed. In the five years following the Games, 40% of the town's hotels went bankrupt, says Teigland. And while cross-country events are incredibly popular, the alpine resorts of Hafjell and Kvitfjell north of Lillehammer remain economically fragile, he says. Norway's experience isn't unique. Most, if not all of the last eight host countries of Winter Games have experienced negligible increases in tourist numbers, says Teigland. It's something that organizers of the next ""small town"" Olympics at Pyeongchang, South Korea in 2018 should bear in mind. ""They should be very careful about developing a lot of accommodation facilities if they have not seen strong growth in winter sports already,"" Teigland says. The $50 billion question? Of course, before Pyeongchang comes Sochi 2014. Russia's great winter sports showpiece will be the most expensive Olympics (winter or summer) in history and five times more expensive than its original budget. Lillehammer also overshot its original costs by a similar multiple. It's hard to see how hosting an Olympics can ever add up financially, but it appears you can't put a price on the experience of hosting. ""Lillehammer was well organized. It really was a huge party. Was it worth $2 billion or not? It seems like a lot of Norwegians think that it was,"" Teigland says. Andersen agrees. ""Here in Norway, I have never heard people say it was not worth it,"" he said. ""Everything in Lillehammer got a lift. It wasn't just an investment in the sports venues, it was an investment in the town itself and also the rail and road links from Oslo."" Norwegians have much to cheer about when it comes to medals too. Since 1994, the homeland of Sondre Norheim -- the man who invented recreational skiing in the 19th century -- has collected a further 92 Winter Olympics medals (including 34 gold), and finished top of the table at Salt Lake City in 2002 with 13 golds and 25 in total. Thanks to the Netflix series ""Lilyhammer,"" TV viewers worldwide are getting to know the town all over again and in a little over two years, Lillehammer will welcome back a new generation of athletes for the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. ""We are building a new knowledge for young leaders and coaches here in Norway,"" Andersen says. ""I believe that will be our big gift for the next generation.""","Small Norwegian town rose to sporting prominence at 1994 Winter Olympics .

"Going Global showcases entrepreneurs taking their businesses around the world, tackling issues like business strategy, marketing and international logistics. (Financial Times) -- Can chess be transformed into a money-spinning global spectator sport? It is a question that will be much on Andrew Paulson's mind, as he settles down to watch the opening ceremony of the game's latest world championship match in Chennai, southern India, this Thursday. An imposing, shaven-headed American media entrepreneur with an intellectual air, Mr Paulson last year paid Fide, the world chess federation, $500,000 for exclusive global rights to commercialize the sport over the next decade. At one level he seems an unlikely impresario, not least because he cheerfully admits to playing barely any chess himself. Yet he has a publicist's gift for the grandiose, describing the game as a ""glorious contest of honor and beauty, of human greatness and magnificent theater"" -- albeit one that is much in need of a marketing shakeup. Mr Paulson plans to infuse chess with the same mix of lucrative sponsorship deals and general razzmatazz that helped the Indian Premier League to revolutionize international cricket. If outwardly tedious sports such as snooker or golf can become mass-market spectacles, he reasons, why not a pastime that Fide says is enjoyed by roughly 600m each month? The difficulties he faces are clear from the contest in Chennai, which many aficionados say ought to have the makings of a classic. See also: How to recruit a diamond in the rough . On one side of the board is Viswanathan Anand, home town hero and five time world champion, whose place as India's most famous non-cricketing sportsman has helped chess to build a growing fan base in the country. On the other is Magnus Carlsen, a telegenic Norwegian prodigy, whose floppy blonde hair and handsome features make him something of a sex symbol -- as well as the highest- ranked player in chess history. And yet the match remains a hard sell for spectators. Chess contests are typically lengthy, draws are common, while the finer details of strategy are basically incomprehensible to all but a few experts. A taste of Mr Paulson's plans to overcome such problems were on show at a tournament in London earlier this year, including a system called ""ChessCasting"" where the audience is guided by specially programed tablet computers. Future tournaments could feature more outlandish ideas, such as biometric bracelets tracking player's heart rates and perspiration levels -- giving spectators an instant sense of the stresses faced at the board. ""We have tested a feature with cameras to track eye movement as well, so you can see where they look on the board in real-time,"" Mr Paulson says. Despite his efforts, commercial progress has so far been slow. The match in Chennai boasts just one sponsor, the host state of Tamil Nadu, which handed over Rs290m ($4.7m) to cover costs and prizes. The games will be broadcast live, but only on India's stodgy government-backed television channel. Still, Mr Paulson refuses to be downcast. ""Chess tournaments have traditionally been organized by ex-chess players, who are reductionist, and have lost touch with the cinema, the drama of this game,"" he says. ""But in time a revolution is possible. If you can persuade millions to watch golf, chess is going to be an easy sell."" See also: Finding an edge in a crowded market . An alien game . The complexities of chess are bad enough, but the game faces a further barrier in enticing big-money corporate sponsors: the curious reputation of Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who has run the sport for nearly 20 years. The former Russian politician turned businessman is best known for consorting with unsavory dictators -- something that otherwise enthusiastic financial backers might find a little off-putting. A friend of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, in 2011 the eccentric millionaire also visited Libya during its civil war, playing a chess match with Muammer Gaddafi. Last year he dropped in on Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Mr Ilyumzhinov is also oddly fond of extraterrestrials: he once claimed to have been abducted by aliens, and has said that chess was first brought to earth by beings from another world. ""People like [Andrew] Paulson are right that chess is a massive untapped marketing opportunity,"" whispers one grandmaster. ""But can you really expect serious international companies to sign up to a sport whose top guy thinks their game is a gift from distant planets?"" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","Entrepreneur Andrew Paulson bought the rights from FIDE, the World Chess Federation .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Democratic measure to temporarily reverse the doubling of interest rates on millions of government-backed student loans fell short in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, but there was hope a bipartisan deal would be struck soon to remedy the situation. ""We're trying to find some common ground,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democratic leader who spearheaded fresh talks on the dispute. ""We don't have an agreement and I can't say when or if we'll come together."" Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, a GOP member of the group seeking a deal, believes there are some options that ""seem to pique a lot of interest in a bipartisan way."" Democrats needed the support of 60 senators in a test vote on a proposal backed by the White House to temporarily return rates for subsidized, need-based Stafford loans to 3.4 % to give lawmakers more time to work out a long-term fix for a number of higher education affordability issues. It never had much of a chance because all 46 Republicans opposed it as did some Democrats and was easily defeated. Interest rates on the subsidized financing for low-income students doubled on July 1 because of congressional inaction to hold them steady heading into the next school year. Far more students take out unsubsidized student loans from the government -- those rates have been at 6.8% since 2007. Student loan debt has skyrocketed in recent years, as have delinquencies, making it a pressing political and financial issue for millions of Americans. Many young graduates are deep in debt and without jobs. Student loan debt is second only to mortgages as the largest debt that consumers carry. For the class of 2013, much of the debt is in government loans with graduates owing an average of $26,000, according to a Fidelity survey of 750 college graduates. The new rates apply for loans beginning after July 1. Opponents of the Senate Democratic remedy said it would have just deferred hard decisions and kept rates low for a short time. They prefer a permanent change to how interest rates are calculated for the millions of undergraduates, graduate students, and parents who take out government loans each year. Bipartisan talks were triggered after top White House officials, including Chief of Staff Denis McDonough and Education Secretary Arne Duncan, met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders Tuesday night. Negotiations are aimed at sifting through the various proposals for interest rates, surcharges, and whether to mandate a cap on how high rates could rise, a key demand from Democrats. ""These things move in tandem,"" explained Durbin. ""As you lower the cap you raise the rates. And vice versa. As you raise the cap you lower the rates. So we're trying to find the right spot that works for everyone and we're still working on it."" Sen. Tom Carper, another member of the bipartisan group, said Republicans appeared ready to compromise by accepting a rate cap. ""There is a good spirit and I think the interest is in finding a way to yes,"" the Delaware Democrat said. House Republicans, who prefer that markets set rates, pushed through a measure in May that ties rates to the bond market and caps them at 8.5 %. This summer's fight is similar to the one that took place last year when Congress acted to avert an increase in the middle of a presidential campaign.","Student loan debt is skyrocketing, with much of it in government loans .

"(CNN) -- It's a moment familiar to any regular air traveler. A passenger's photo shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling on Monday's Continental Flight 128. The plane bucks up and down, lurches forward and back, or both. Sometimes overhead bins fly open. The squeamish gasp. Babies cry. Then, usually, it's all over. In-flight turbulence is often a mere inconvenience. But it's also the leading cause of airline passenger injuries that are not associated with a fatal crash, experts say. And, on rare occasions, it can be deadly. In the case of Monday's Continental Flight 128, an unexpected blast of air led to much more than jangled nerves, bumps and bruises. Turbulence struck the flight, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas, unexpectedly, injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to Miami, Florida. Police said 26 passengers were injured, four seriously.  Learn more about airline turbulence » . Turbulence, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, is caused by a quick change in air movement. Jet streams, air shooting off of mountains, cold or warm weather fronts and thunderstorms can all cause changes in speed or direction. The rapid shift in gravity force -- or G-force -- can cause a sensation not unlike being whipped around on a roller coaster. Most of the time, discomfort is the worst byproduct. ""Normally, it's an inconvenience,"" said Kevin Garrison, a retired Delta Air Lines pilot living in Lexington, Kentucky. ""Very rarely does it hurt passengers, which is odd because a lot of them don't keep their seat belts on."" And wearing seat belts, aviation officials say, is the best way to stay safe. ""In the event that something happens,"" said Les Dorr, a spokesman for the FAA, ""that's the best advice that we or anyone else can give passengers."" Since 1980, three people have been killed in turbulence-related accidents, according to the administration. At least two of those deaths involved passengers who reportedly were not wearing seat belts while the seat-belt sign was on. There have been 234 turbulence-related accidents since 1980, and 114 passengers were seriously injured in those accidents, the FAA reported. Flight attendants have been hurt at a much higher rate. During that same time period, 184 attendants were seriously injured, despite their numbers being far smaller than the number of passengers. ""The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants,"" Dorr said. ""They have to be up performing their tasks, even when the seat-belt light is on."" And while pilots are almost always strapped in with seat belts, even they aren't exempt. ""I've had a few bloodied heads -- when I hit my head on the overhead when the seat belt was a little loose,"" said Garrison, who flew for Delta for 27 years. In Monday's accident, passengers reported they were slammed into the Boeing 767's ceiling -- some said two or more times -- when the plane dropped rapidly. ""I saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls,"" Fabio Ottolini, who was returning to Houston with his wife and daughter after visiting family in Brazil, told CNN affiliate KTRK-TV. Passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts. Initial reports are that the Monday flight was hit by what's called clear-air turbulence, or air pockets that hit without warning. While pilots are always on the lookout for regular turbulence spots -- like mountain ranges and places where weather fronts are converging -- clear-air turbulence can happen anywhere. ""You can't see it; you can't sense it with radar,"" Dorr said. ""The best way to determine if there's a possibility of clear-air turbulence is to have somebody in front of you that's already flown through it."" Dorr said passenger injury numbers have dropped over the past few years, during an industry-wide effort to increase safety. No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008, and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries, according to the FAA. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team has focused on seat-belt awareness and pushed for better communication systems for reporting turbulence, Dorr said. All licensed pilots also receive ""upset training,"" which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.","Three turbulence-related deaths since 1980, FAA says .
At least two of the three were people not wearing seat belts .

"(CNN) -- It is perhaps the most iconic sports photograph ever taken. Captured at the medal ceremony for the men's 200 meters at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, U.S. sprinter Tommie Smith stands defiantly, head bowed, his black-gloved fist thrust into the thin air. Behind him fellow American John Carlos joins with his own Black Power salute, an act of defiance aimed at highlighting the segregation and racism burning back in their homeland. It was an act that scandalized the Olympics. Smith and Carlos were sent home in disgrace and banned from the Olympics for life. But they were treated as returning heroes by the black community for sacrificing their personal glory for the cause. History, too, has been kind to them. Yet few know that the man standing in front of both of them, the Australian sprinter Peter Norman who shocked everyone by powering past Carlos and winning the silver medal, played his own, crucial role in sporting history. On his left breast he wore a small badge that read: ""Olympic Project for Human Rights"" -- an organization set up a year previously opposed to racism in sport. But while Smith and Carlos are now feted as human rights pioneers, the badge was enough to effectively end Norman's career. He returned home to Australia a pariah, suffering unofficial sanction and ridicule as the Black Power salute's forgotten man. He never ran in the Olympics again. ""As soon as he got home he was hated,"" explains his nephew Matthew Norman, who has directed a new film -- ""Salute!"" -- about Peter's life before and after the 1968 Olympics. ""A lot of people in America didn't realize that Peter had a much bigger role to play. He was fifth (fastest) in the world, and his run is still a Commonwealth record today. And yet he didn't go to Munich (1972 Olympics) because he played up. He would have won a gold. ""He suffered to the day he died."" An obscure pick . Peter Norman grew up in a working-class district of Melbourne. As a youngster he couldn't afford the kit to play Australian Rules Football, his favorite sport. But his father managed to borrow a secondhand pair of running spikes, and his talent for sprinting was quickly recognized. Yet Norman was still an obscure pick when the 28-year-old arrived in the high altitude of Mexico City. It was the first time he had run on an Olympic standard track, and he thrived in the thin air. ""I could feel my knees bouncing around my chin,"" Norman said in ""Salute!"" ""It lengthened my stride by about 4 inches!"" It was events off the track that had dominated the lead-up to the 1968 Olympics. In the U.S., the civil rights movement fought running battles with the police and army across America against segregation and racism. Both Martin Luther King Junior and Robert Kennedy had been assassinated and the Vietnam War was raging. Meanwhile, in Mexico, hundreds of protesting students were massacred in the run-up to the Games. The regime covered up their deaths as the athletes arrived. Australia too, was in the midst of racial strife. The country's ""White Australia"" policy had provoked protests of its own. It put heavy restrictions on non-white immigration -- and a raft of prejudicial laws against its indigenous aboriginal population, including a policy of taking Aboriginal children from their birth parents and handing them to white couples for adoption, a practice that continued until the 1970s. Unexpected threat . Although Norman was a staunch anti-racism advocate, no one expected him to take a stand in Mexico. The Australian Olympic Committee had laid out just three rules for him to follow. The first was to repeat his qualification time before the Games. ""Rule number two: don't finish last in any round,"" Norman recalled. ""Third, and under no circumstances, don't get beaten by a Pom (a British runner)."" Norman had previously been ignored by the U.S. team, who had assumed they'd win a clean sweep of medals in the 200 meters, but he burst on to their radar when he broke the Olympic record in one of the early heats. ""When I first saw Peter, I said, 'Who's this little white guy?' "" Carlos told CNN. He would soon regret the oversight. When the 200 meters final arrived, all eyes were on the U.S. duo. Smith was expected to win easily (""You wouldn't be able to catch him on a motorbike,"" was Norman's assessment) but the speculation centered on what political gesture the American athletes might make on the podium. The starting pistol was fired and Smith powered to gold. But out of nowhere Norman stormed down the last 50 meters, taking the line before a shocked Carlos. Norman's time of 20 seconds flat would have won gold four years later at the Munich Olympics and at the Sydney Games in 2000. A fateful decision . Smith and Carlos had already decided to make a statement on the podium. They were to wear black gloves. But Carlos left his at the Olympic village. It was Norman who suggested they should wear one each on alternate hands. Yet Norman had no means of making a protest of his own. So he asked a member of the U.S. rowing team for his ""Olympic Project for Human Rights"" badge, so that he could show solidarity. ""He came up to me and said, 'Have you got one of those buttons, mate,' "" said U.S. rower Paul Hoffman. ""If a white Australian is going to ask me for an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge, then by God he would have one. I only had one, which was mine, so I took it off and gave it to him."" The three men walked towards their destiny. The medals were handed out before the three turned towards the flags and the start of the Star Spangled Banner. ""I couldn't see what was happening,"" Norman said of that moment. ""I had known they had gone through with their plans when a voice in the crowd sang the American anthem but then faded to nothing. The stadium went quiet."" The fallout was immediate for Smith and Carlos, who were sent home in disgrace. Norman was never given the chance to go a step closer. He was never picked to run in the Olympics again. ""I would have dearly loved to go to Munich (but) I'd earned the frowning eyes of the powers that be in track and field,"" he said in ""Salute!"" ""I'd qualified for the 200 meters 13 times and 100 meters five times (but) they'd rather leave me home than have me over there (in Munich)."" Shunned in his own country? Norman retired from athletics immediately after hearing he'd been cut from the Munich team. He would never return to the track. Neither would his achievements count for much 28 years later when Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics. ""At the Sydney Olympics he wasn't invited in any capacity,"" says Matthew Norman. ""There was no outcry. He was the greatest Olympic sprinter in our history."" In his own country Peter Norman remained the forgotten man. As soon as the U.S. delegation discovered that Norman wasn't going to attend, the United States Olympic Committee arranged to fly him to Sydney to be part of their delegation. He was invited to the birthday party of 200 and 400-meter runner Michael Johnson, where he was to be the guest of honor. Johnson took his hand, hugged him and declared that Norman was one of his biggest heroes. ""Peter was not sanctioned ... we are not sure why he missed selection in 1972 but it had nothing to do with what happened in Mexico,"" the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) told CNN when asked about Norman's exclusion from the team that traveled to Munich. ""Peter was not excluded from any Sydney 2000 celebrations."" The AOC points out that Australia's greatest ever sprinter had been given several crucial roles in the festivities. ""He represented the AOC at several team selection announcements,"" it said, ""including the announcement of the table tennis team in his home town of Melbourne prior to the Sydney Games."" Remembering Peter Norman . When ""Salute!"" was released in Australia in 2008 it caused a sensation, breaking box office records. In a country known for its reverence of sporting legends, many were hearing Norman's story for the first time. But he would never see the film that would put his achievements back into the public consciousness. Peter Norman died of a heart attack on October 9, 2006. At the funeral both Smith and Carlos gave the eulogy, where they announced that the U.S. Track and Field association had declared the day of his death to be ""Peter Norman Day"" -- the first time in the organization's history that such an honor had been bestowed on a foreign athlete. Both men helped carry his coffin before it was lowered into the ground. For them, Norman was a hero -- ""A lone soldier,"" according to Carlos -- for his small but determined stand against racism. ""He paid the price. This was Peter Norman's stand for human rights, not Peter Norman helping Tommie Smith and John Carlos out,"" Smith told CNN. The three had remained friends ever since their chance meeting on that podium in Mexico City 44 years ago. ""He just happened to be a white guy, an Australian white guy, between two black guys in the victory stand believing in the same thing."" A proud legacy . Arguably the biggest price Norman paid was the fact that his run in the 200 meters final had been obscured by the Black Power salute. It remains to this day one of the finest, and least expected, individual performances by a sprinter at the modern Olympics. By the end of the final, Norman had shaved half a second off his best time. His full potential was never realized yet, even after the ignominy of his return, Norman bore no grudges. ""It has been said that sharing my silver medal with that incident on the victory dais detracted from my performance,"" Norman explains poignantly at end of ""Salute!"" ""On the contrary. I have to confess, I was rather proud to be part of it.""","At Mexico 1968, Australian sprinter Peter Norman won silver in the 200 meters .

"(CNN) -- Madonna wants you to start a revolution. The superstar spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday about her new project, Art for Freedom. With it, she is inviting fans to submit original video, music, poetry and photography to fight oppression, intolerance and complacency through art. Through Art for Freedom, she explains, ""We have created this platform to give people around the world an opportunity to answer the question: 'What does freedom mean to you?' "" ""I'm encouraging other people, whether they're professionals or not, to use their creativity to express themselves, to get a conversation going, to get the party started, really,"" Madonna told Cooper. In September, Madonna revealed what was then only known as #secretprojectrevolution in 10 cities, including Los Angeles and New York City. Those in attendance were treated to a ""call to action"" film the singer created with photographer Steven Klein, in partnership with VICE Media and BitTorrent. Cooper caught up with a relaxed Madonna, who joked that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a grueling workout. But the artist was clearly passionate about the subject and even asked her son Rocco to wait a moment while the interview ran long. Cooper and Madonna had a wide-ranging conversation, touching upon her favorite quote from author James Baldwin (""I don't separate the human spirit from the artistic spirit"") to what ever happened to that Boy Scout uniform Madonna wore to the GLAAD awards earlier this year. (Each of her kids claimed an article of clothing, but ""I kept the combat boots,"" Madonna said. ""I'll need those for my revolution."") Here are some highlights from the interview: . Anderson Cooper: I've heard you call this project the most important thing you've done, besides raising your children. Madonna: Yes. Obviously, I feel a great sense of responsibility being a good parent and raising my children. I don't take that job very lightly. Who they are, what they become and what they contribute to the world is very important to me. No slacking in that area, thank god, but the same goes with this film. I've put in I don't know how many man hours, I've poured my own money into it. Steven Klein has done the same. We've done it for no financial gain, (and) also not to promote any product in particular. The only reason we're doing this is because we want to shed light on subjects that need to have light shed on (them). I do see that the world that we live in is collapsing to a certain extent, and civilization as we know it is caving in on itself. I believe that we are at a very low level of consciousness, and we do not know how to treat each other as human beings. We are caught up in our own lives, our own needs, our own ego gratification. I feel a strong sense of responsibility in delivering that message. Madonna: Get the fast facts . Cooper: It seems there is an optimism in what you're doing. Madonna: Of course. I'm doing it because I believe in the ultimate good of humanity, but a lot of times push has to come to shove. I think you've noticed yourself over the years that, when do people really want to come to the rescue of others? When there's a catastrophe. When 9/11 happens, or when the floods happen in New Orleans, or when the bombs happened in Boston. What happens? People come together. Suddenly, people say, what can I do to help? What can I do to be of service? What I'm trying to say is, why do we have to be pushed to the worst-case scenarios to bring out the best in ourselves to be the best version of ourselves that we can be? Madonna is 2013's top-earning celebrity . Cooper: I went to the opening of ""secretprojectrevolution"" in New York and you incorporated some words from James Baldwin. I'm not quoting directly, but he said, only the artist can truly see and describe the human condition. I don't think that's something a lot of people really think about, but that's something clearly you believe in very strongly -- that art can actually make a change in people's lives. Madonna: I believe that. And I think that it used to make a much bigger change in people's lives in the days when people were not censored. In the days when branding wasn't in charge. Now, in order for people to get their stuff out there, they have to be associated with a brand and once you start associating with a brand, unfortunately, the brand starts to censor you. And then suddenly it's not your pure vision anymore. Imagine if someone like John Lennon or Bob Marley, Sid Vicious, Picasso, whomever, were doing their work and some corporation, some CEO, some branding entity was saying to you, well you can do that, but you've got to remove this aspect of your work. There would no longer be that purity anymore. We wouldn't have their gift. We wouldn't learn from what they had to share with us. I'm all for noncensorship and freedom of expression.

"(CNN) -- The newest iPads could make their debut later this month. Apple is planning an October 22 press event to show off the latest additions to its iPad line, according to AllThingsD's John Paczkowski, confirming an earlier report in Current Editorials. The announcements are expected to include a redesigned, thinner iPad and a Retina display iPad Mini. The devices would likely pack in the usual incremental improvements that mark each new generation of Apple mobile devices, including better cameras and faster processors. Apple's fancy new fingerprint technology might also make an appearance in the new iPads. Apple has held a press event every October since 2010, announcing products that ship just in time for the holiday rush. Last year, Tim Cook introduced the iPad Mini, the full sized iPad with Retina display, and some new Macs. It would not be unusual for the company to mix in some Mac news with the iPad announcements. The new Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks, was announced in June at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco. The final version of the operating system has already shipped to developers, and it's likely it will be made available to the public soon after this press event. Other Mac news could include the latest Macbook Pro and Mac Mini updates and a release date for the all new Mac Pro.","Report says Apple plans October 22 iPad event .

"(CNN) -- It reads like the opening scene of an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. A young man climbing a French glacier finds a cache of glittering jewels wrapped in bags stamped ""Made in India"" -- remnants, perhaps, of cargo from an ill-fated airliner called the Malabar Princess. The best thing about it? This story is true. It happened early this month on a glacier overlooking the southeastern French village of Chamonix, Albertville police Chief Sylvain Merly said Thursday. The climber -- who Merly said asked to remain anonymous -- found the jewels inside a metal box atop the glacier. He turned them over to police in Bourg-Saint-Maurice on September 9. Merly declined to characterize the stones, which are being described in French media as rubies, sapphires and emeralds. They're worth somewhere between â‚¬130,000 (about $175,000) and â‚¬246,000 ($331,600), Merly said. French authorities are trying to trace ownership of the jewels. If proof of ownership can't be established, the unnamed 20-something mountaineer could stand to receive a portion of their value, Merly said. TrowelBlazers: In search of the female Indiana Jones . The gems may be from the 1950 crash of Air India Flight 245, the ""Malabar Princess."" The plane smashed into nearby Mont Blanc during a storm, killing all 48 aboard. When it crashed, the plane was preparing to make a stop in Geneva, Switzerland, as it flew between Bombay -- now Mumbai -- and London. French authorities say it's also possible the gems could have been aboard an Air India Boeing 707, the ""Kanchenjunga,"" that crashed in nearly the same spot 16 years later. A diplomatic bag from that flight was recovered last year. Adding a bit of intrigue to the story, the 1966 crash is the subject of scattered conspiracy theories suggesting the Air India flight, which carried the father of India's nuclear industry, Homi Bhabha, was shot down by a fighter jet or missile. Debris from the wrecks routinely emerges from the bottom of the glacier, including metal, wire and even a piece of landing gear discovered in 1986, according to a Mont Blanc tourist site.

"(CNN) -- A Detroit man, who stabbed an officer outside a courtroom and escaped wearing the officer's uniform, has been captured, authorities said. The inmate, Abraham Pearson, was spotted walking in a Detroit neighborhood Monday night, said Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon. Authorities said Pearson attacked a deputy with a sharpened comb in front of two other inmates inside a holding cell at the Frank Murphy Hall Monday morning. He then handcuffed Deputy Harrison Tolliver, and fled, also taking the officer's cell phone and radio, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office said. The two inmates did not intervene or leave the cell, according to police. Pearson escaped from the rear of the building, carjacked a citizen and drove away in a Dodge minivan. The Dodge was recovered and the officer's uniform was found under a vehicle near Beaubien Street in Detroit. Pearson was facing sentencing on Monday on carjacking and armed robbery charges. According to the sheriff's office, the 25-year old has a lengthy criminal record and was on parole. The arrest could add at least 11 more charges to the crimes he was already facing, Napoleon said. Tolliver, 63, was taken to the Detroit Receiving Hospital and later released. Tolliver is a retired Detroit police officer who joined the Sheriff's Office in December.

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Every day the fate of 200,000 Mumbai residents' lunches lie in the hands, and on the heads, of the city's lunch delivery men, the dabbawalas. Lunch is served: The dabbawalas have been serving up lunch to Mumbai residents for 118 years. A corp of around 5,000 tiffin lunch box dabbawalas have been supplying the city's hungry workers with hot home-made lunches since Mahatma Gandhi was a 21-year-old law student. From Monday to Saturday, regardless of monsoon rains or sweltering heat, they can be seen across the city balancing up to 40 metal lunch pails on their heads or pushing fully laden hand carts . ""The world is advancing and people are taking outside food, but maybe only once in a week. People still like to take homemade food, usually every day, so that's why we're in demand,"" says 33-year-old dabbawala Manish Tripathi from his apartment in Borivali, a suburb of Mumbai. Not only providing a necessary and recession-proof service -- even in tough economic times, people will always need lunch -- the dabbawalas are a cooperative that can boast a business record of reliability that would have any operation salivating with envy. In a city of 18 million people living cheek by jowl, most of them appearing on the move at the same time, the chances of a lamb biryani ending up in the place of a tarka dahl would seem to be high . However according to Tripathi, for every 16 million deliveries only one will go AWOL. ""Really it is magic,"" he said, perhaps revealing the unexpected secret of success of the dabbawalas. The six sigma rating the dabbawalas received by Forbes magazine precipitated a rush of interest from management supply companies and business schools searching for the secrets of its success. The rating means that the dabbawalas have a 99.9 percent efficiency rate. The ""magic"" Tripathi goes on to explain has less to do with an intangible mysticism and more to do with the tight-knit group of dabbawalas and the unique delivery system.  Watch Manish Tripathi explain how the dabbawalas work » . A typical day for a dabbawala starts at around 8 am when the cylindrical metal tiffin boxes are collected from homes and taken to the nearest railway station where they are loaded onto crates and transported by train to downtown Mumbai. Tripathi and his group of dabbawalas work along the city's Marine railway line and begin to gather at Churchgate station at 11.30 am. Each wearing a white Gandhi topi hat, the dabbawalas have time to chat and organize the tiffin boxes between them, before taking up to 40 tiffin boxes each, slung over bicycle handlebars, loaded onto hand carts or carried on long trays balanced on top of heads. On average one tiffin box will change hands four times in its journey from a home kitchen to a hungry office worker. So far, so simple. However, the majority of the dabbawalas are illiterate and the sorting is done mostly by a system of color coding handles and tiffin box covers that has hardly changed since the first tiffin was delivered in 1890. As well as the long-practiced delivery system, and the cheap, extensive and reliable rail network of the city, it's the unity of the dabbawalas that Tripathi credits with being a key factor in their longevity. The dabbawalas belong to the Vakari sect and have roots to the simple farming community of Pune outside Mumbai in Maharashtra state. ""They are a single DNA,"" he says. ""Everyone is a Marathi, they are made from the same cloth, speak the same language, everyone's lunch is the same, everyone's god is the same. So there's a high degree or coordination and commitment. ""When you have organizations with people with different backgrounds, different castes, different languages, there's bound to be disagreement and a problem among them."" Despite the growing social mobility of India's middle classes, caste then still has a central place in the lives and options open to millions more in India. For Tripathi and the other dabbawalas their success and longevity is source of pride in their heritage. If the delivery system of the dabbawalas and hiring system is archaic, Tripathi can be credited with bringing the collective into at least the 20th century. He set up a dabbawala web site five years ago and in 2006 started a text message ordering service for dabba customers, which 5 to 10 people use every day. Companies haven't been slow to tap into the dabbawalas network or reputation of reliability and trustworthiness. The Bank of India, and India's booming mobile phone and Internet providers including Airtel and Reliance and have used the dabbawalas to distribute flyers for their services with the tiffin boxes. ""Once in a while the customers don't mind, but if this is happening every day the customer will get annoyed, so we keep it to a minimum,"" says Tripathi. While small groups of dabbawalas operate individually of other groups in different areas of the city -- sharing the months taking equally between all; an average dabbawala wage is around $100 a month -- there is an informal hierarchy. A board of directors is made up of around five senior dabbawalas who in their dotage don't have to carry the lunch boxes until they kick the can, but are on hand to resolve any disputes. Expansion of the network of dabbawalas is limited, however, the extra revenue from associations with the likes of Airtel, lectures and media operations goes to the Dabbawala Foundation, a social security fund for the dabbawalas and their families, a well as a means to buy new carts for bicycles. As well as delivering the tiffin boxes, English-speaking Tripathi is the chairman of the Dabbawala Foundation, who clearly enjoys his extra role as patron. ""I get the money from various sources,"" he says. ""I can't talk about where the money is from,"" he continues, his eyes dropping to the floor, "" but I can say that money is never a problem. If you're intentions are good, money will come automatically,"" he smiles the twinkle returning to his eye. By finding a way through the network of unmapable Mumbai streets and latterly discovering ways in which to tap into new revenue streams the dabbawalas appear future-proof, their unique system more than capable standing up to and economic downturn or personal changes in taste.","Mumbai's dabbawalas have been delivering lunches in the city for 118 years .

"(CNN) -- Two people were killed and 68 others injured in clashes between police and foreign workers following a visa crackdown in Saudi Arabia, the official news agency reported. Police arrested 561 people Saturday in the capital of Riyadh, according to the Saudi Press Agency.

"(CNN) -- He shocked the football world when he led Zambia to glory in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. Now Herve Renard is heading to France in a bid to turn around the fortunes of struggling club Sochaux. Frenchman Renard coached ""The Copper Bullets"" to victory in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon last year, with a penalty shootout win over Ivory Coast crowning Zambia champions of Africa for the first time. After exiting this year's tournament at the first round stage and failing to guide Zambia to the 2014 World Cup, Renard will return to his homeland with Sochaux, which has won just one of its first nine Ligue 1 games. ""Herve Renard has been released from the job of Zambia national coach,"" read a statement from the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ). ""He has been offered a wonderful opportunity at Sochaux. FAZ and Herve have consulted and it has been agreed not to stand in his way."" ""It is a compliment for a coach working in Africa to be head-hunted by a European club. It makes us proud to take ownership of Herve's rise."" Renard will replace Eric Hely, who resigned after Sochaux was beaten 5-1 by Guingamp in September. Under the stewardship of caretaker boss Omar Daf, the team won its first league game of the season against Valenciennes but was then thrashed 4-1 at Bordeaux last weekend. Sochaux is second-bottom of the Ligue 1 table with five points, two points from safety. Blog: Five things we learned about FIFA .

"(CNN) -- The winner of Australia's election, Tony Abbott, on Saturday pledged to form a competent and trustworthy government after he defeated Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. ""I can inform you that the government of Australia has changed,"" the conservative challenger told supporters. ""For just the seventh time in 60 years the government of Australia has changed. ""I now look forward to forming a government that is competent, that is trustworthy, and which purposely and steadfastly and methodically sets about delivering on our commitments to you, the Australian people."" READ MORE: Tony Abbott: Australia's next leader . Although final results had yet to come in, Rudd said he had telephoned Abbott to concede defeat. ""As prime minister of Australia, I wish him well in the high office of prime minister of this country,"" he said at a party meeting in Brisbane. Rudd was conciliatory in his speech and accepted his share of blame. ""Tonight is the time to unite in the great Australian nation,"" he said. ""Because whatever our politics may be, we are all first and foremost Australian."" ""I know that Labor hearts are heavy across the nation tonight. And as your prime minister and as your parliamentary leader of the great Australian Labor party, I accept responsibility. I gave it my all, but it was not enough for us to win. I'm proud that despite all the profits of doom, that we have preserved our federal parliamentary labor party as a viable fighting force for the future."" According to the Australian Election Commission, Abbott's Liberal-National Coalition won 86 seats in the House of Representatives, against Labor's 57. Any group that wins 76 seats or more can form a simple majority. The Coalition win ends six years of Labor Party rule under Rudd and Julia Gillard who deposed each other in successive leadership challenges. READ MORE: Best Australian election gaffes . Before the vote, commentators said the Australian electorate had tired of the apparent disunity within the Labor Party, and were looking for change. ""Rudd's had his turn,"" one voter told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on polling day. Rudd's return fails . Back in June, Rudd's Labor colleagues had hoped he'd bring the same magic to the polls demonstrated in 2007 when he defeated the former Liberal leader John Howard. However, the early lift Rudd brought to the election race quickly faded, and in the final days of the campaign the Labor leader was vowing he'd fight to the end. Rudd kept a low profile on election day, prompting speculation about when he would turn up to vote. When he finally arrived at a polling station in Brisbane, hecklers shouted slogans slamming the government's plan to send asylum seekers for offshore processing. ""Hey Kevin we're talking to you, not PNG, not Nauru,"" they shouted. OPINION: Australian parties in 'race to bottom' on asylum seekers . What about Syria? The focus of this election was very much on domestic issues, including the economy, education and broadband Internet services. The international quandary over the scale of any military response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria seems to have been set aside, for now. Abbott has indicated that, as Australian prime minister, he'd take a cautious approach to any involvement in foreign conflicts. ""I just think we need to be very careful in a situation like this cause we can easily make a bad situation worse by acting precipitously,"" Abbott told the ABC. ""I don't think we should be getting above ourselves here. We are a significant middle power but no more,"" he added. It's the economy... In the final days of the campaign, Rudd tried to win over voters with the promise of more jobs, painting Abbott's planned budget cuts as a sure way to send the economy into recession. In a bid to emphasize his government's economic credentials, Rudd seized upon the latest GDP figures released earlier this week showing an annual growth rate of 2.6%. ""As of this year, since we came to office in 2007, the Australian economy is 15% bigger than it was,"" Rudd said. ""I draw to your attention the fact that the British economy has shrunk 3% over that time."" Under Abbott, the government would find billions of dollars in budget cuts, including slashing $4.5 billion (US$4.1 billion) from foreign aid over the next six years. Money saved would be spent on infrastructure projects including motorway upgrades, in a decision slammed by aid groups. ""We are a strong OECD country, yet we are fast becoming the least generous when it comes to reducing global poverty,"" said Norman Gillespie, the CEO of UNICEF Australia. Paired with Abbott's budget cuts is a generous maternity plan pitched to female voters despite opposition from big business and from within his own party. Mothers would be given up to $75,000 (US$68,490) for six months' maternity leave at a total cost of $5.5 billion (US$5.01 billion) each year. Other key issues, alternatives . Aside from business, the two main candidates were separated by their views on same-sex marriage. Rudd is firmly for it, Abbott, a former Catholic seminarian, insists that marriage should be between a man and a woman. However they were much closer on the issue of asylum seekers. Both main parties advocate sending people who arrive by boat to offshore processing centers where most, if not all, would be potentially resettled if found to be refugees. READ MORE: Australian parties in 'race to bottom' on asylum . Other winners, losers . WikiLeaks founder and the leader of the WikiLeaks Party, Julian Assange, failed in his long distance bid for a seat in the Australian Senate. Assange, who co-ordinated his campaign from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he's been holed-up for fear of arrest and extradition, said under the circumstances he was happy with the outcome. ""I think it's a great result. The party was registered in July -- three months ago. It's had its leader and primary candidate stuck in an overseas embassy for 400 days in a foreign country, nine hours time difference and with an international banking blockade against it,"" Assange told the ABC. He said the WikiLeaks Party, which earned about 1% of the votes in the state of Victoria, would survive to contest the next election. Meanwhile, reports suggested another outspoken leader of his own party, Clive Palmer, was on track to win a Senate seat. The mining billionaire, perhaps best known outside Australia for his plans to build a replica of the Titanic, founded his Palmer United Party just four months ago. On Sunday, he claimed that preferences from his party helped secure Abbott's win. Other parties vying for votes included the No Carbon Tax Climate Sceptics Party, the Voluntary Euthanasia Party, the Sex Party, the Australian Fishing and Lifestyle Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party. None of them recorded a strong showing.","Tony Abbott pledges competent and trustworthy government .

"(CNN) -- Nine people were killed and 25 injured Thursday in twin blasts in eastern Iraq, health officials said. The attacks took place in Wasit as thousands of worshipers jammed the streets to attend festivals marking Ashura, the most important holy day on the Shiite Muslim calendar. Ashura commemorates the death of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. Both blasts targeted a procession tent. During Ashura, pilgrims often set up tents to distribute water and food to passersby. The tents also give fellow pilgrims a place to rest, mourn, chant and pray before they march to Karbala, the holy shrine of Imam Hussein. Wasit is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) southeast of Baghdad. The explosions are the latest in a spate of attacks apparently targeting Shiite Muslims during this holy week. On Wednesday, four coordinated blasts killed 10 people in Baquba, police said. Those explosions targeted a series of Shiite processions. Imam Hussein's death was one of the events that helped create the schism between Sunni and Shiite Islam, the two main Muslim religious movements.

"Musanze, Rwanda (CNN) -- For Rwanda's national cycling team, survivors of its genocide, cycling is proving to have an unlikely healing power. Eighteen years after the genocide of Tutsis that claimed an estimated 800,000 lives in all, Team Rwanda is now gaining international recognition, and one member will compete at this year's summer Olympics. With a population of more than 11 million and a land size roughly half the size of Scotland, the east African nation of Rwanda is Africa's most densely populated country. In Musanze, 96 kilometers outside the capital of Kigali, on one of the few paved roads in northwestern Rwanda, many get around on bicycles, some made entirely of wood. These wooden bicycles, typically made from acacia trees, evolved as a solution for wheel-barrowing crops from farm to farm. They are heavy, used by farmers to transport loads of up to 300 kg, and with only a thin piece of rubber for a tire, they are difficult to maneuver and brake suddenly. Because of this, they are banned from the main roads. ""If you hit something or somebody, that person would be dangerously hurt,"" explains Francois Bizimana, one of the village's bike makers, who has previously been hospitalized with injuries from an accident on one of his bikes. ""You do a lot of damage when you get in an accident with them. Some of us are not used to road safety and rules, so that caused a lot of trouble for us."" Learn more: 100 days that changed history... In 2006, when Rwanda's first annual cycling festival was created by Jonathan ""Jock"" Boyer, the first American to finish the Tour de France, and mountain bike pioneer Tom Ritchey, it was named the Wooden Bike Classic in honor of these traditional contraptions. The event showcased so much talent that the next year, Boyer returned to establish and coach the country's first national team, Team Rwanda. One of its five founding members, and winner of the first Wooden Bike Classic, Adrien Niyonshuti, will represent Rwanda at the 2012 summer Olympics. Niyonshuti was seven years old in 1994, when conflict between two ethnic groups, the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority, spiraled into a genocide that claimed an estimated 800,000 lives over 100 days. His grandmother and six of his brothers were killed. Another founding team member, Jean de Dieu ""Rafiki"" Uwimana contracted malaria while sleeping outdoors, after escaping with his grandmother. He was separated from his parents and brother, and thought they were dead for five years after the genocide. Read more: Rwandan rugby team's trip to Hong Kong...

""Nutrition is important. Our food choices are limited,"" she continues. ""They're used to eating for bulk, not nutritional value. Now, they've started to see the benefits of nutrition, stretching, training program and they're doing well."" For some, the rigorous training regimen is a welcome distraction from painful memories. ""You never forget it, in your life,"" says Uwimana. ""But...I'm busy. My future is looking good now. Many people know me, and I'm changing life for my country and my family also."" Their success is helping to change lingering perceptions of Rwanda as a broken, dangerous and impoverished place. It's also helping to change how Rwandans view themselves.

"Washington (CNN) -- As President Barack Obama prepares to deliver one of the most important addresses of his presidency, the American public remains deeply skeptical and confused about his plan to strike Syria -- what it would accomplish, and whether it is even necessary now, given the Russian proposal to place Syria's chemical weapons stockpile under international control. With many Americans saying they are still unclear about what Obama wants to do, here are five questions the president must answer before he can begin to sway the court of public opinion in his favor. 1. Now that there may be a diplomatic alternative -- the Russian plan -- why does the U.S. still need to attack? This is the most important question of the day. In a major development, Syria has reportedly accepted the Russian proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile to international control, but the details of what was actually agreed to are still murky. The White House is skeptical, cautioning that it could be a stalling tactic, but said it would take a hard look at the proposal. The Obama administration has agreed to work with French President Francois Hollande and British Prime Minister David Cameron, in consultation with Russia and China, to explore the viability of the Russian proposal. These efforts will begin Tuesday at the United Nations and will include a discussion on elements of a potential U.N. Security Council resolution. A stunning turn that could silence Syria war drums . Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that he still needs the threat of military action in order to force a negotiated settlement. If he can win support from Congress for an attack, that threat will be an even more effective tool. Many members of Congress are pushing a nonmilitary route. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, sent a letter to his constituents, citing other possible options: international coalitions, economic sanctions, war-crime tribunals. Two senators are drafting a compromise resolution that would hold off on a military strike and give Syrian President Bashar al-Assad the option to sign on to the Chemical Weapons Convention within the next 45 days. If he fails to do so, then a U.S. retaliation would be warranted. The president previously failed to garner meaningful international consensus for a military strike. Russia and China blocked any action at the Security Council. And at the G20 meeting last week, the president did not come away with additional international support, although 14 nations signed on to a letter condemning al-Assad's tactics in the civil war. But with the Russian deal on the table, now even Iran has said it would support removing chemical weapons from Syria. 2. Why should the U.S. be worried about what Syria allegedly did? Is it worth going to war? Obama must make a convincing case that the use of sarin gas in Syria was a moral abomination that the U.S. and the international community simply cannot tolerate, and that allowing it to go unpunished would leave an imminent and continued threat to U.S. national security. But, simply put, Americans are sick of war. In a CNN/ORC poll released Monday, six in 10 say the Iraq war was a mistake and about half say the same thing about the war in Afghanistan. Three-quarters say the U.S. shouldn't play the role of world policeman. Additionally, nearly seven in 10 say that it's not in the U.S. national interest to get involved in Syria's civil war. So the president must provide a really good reason to intervene in another messy conflict in the Middle East, where politics are far more complex than the secular two-party system in the United States. Even more, 72%, say a U.S. airstrike would not achieve significant U.S. goals. CNN Poll: Part of Syria strike opposition is the messenger's fault . Members of Congress have spoken about the same concern. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said on CNN's ""The Lead"" last week that there is ""no military intervention at this stage"" that could lead to an outcome favorable to America's national security interests. As part of the president's media blitz, National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Monday that al-Assad's use of chemical weapons ""threatens the national security of the U.S."" and Israel. She said every time chemical weapons are used, it ""raises the likelihood"" that terrorists will obtain the chemical weapons, which she said puts U.S. troops and diplomats overseas at risk and opens the door for use of other ""weapons of mass destruction."" Obama will have to make a direct connection to national security and American interests. But after Iraq, the bar to prove a national security threat to the United States seems to be much higher. 3. What would be the endgame? Obama will have to explain to the American people the goal of military strikes. He has said his goal is not to take out al-Assad or institute regime change or even to aid the rebels, but to enforce an international treaty outlawing chemical weapons. Deterring future use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's chemical weapons stockpile are the reason for U.S. military intervention, Rice argued. Or, alternatively, Obama needs to show how critical congressional support -- and the support of the American people -- are to bringing Syria to the negotiating table to follow through on the Russian proposal. Either way, the president will have to succinctly and clearly explain his argument to the American people. Some question if ""deter and degrade"" would even work. Furthermore, is it reason enough, when nearly three-quarters of Americans say a U.S. airstrike would not achieve significant U.S. goals? U.S. Senate: How they'll vote on Syria strike . The administration promises limited military action. Rice has said the U.S. is capable of a limited strike, pointing to previous military engagements that lasted just hours, including a bombing campaign against Iraq in 1998. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that the campaign will be ""unbelievably small."" The president will have to explain exactly what the endgame is and precisely what ""limited"" means. 4. If the U.S. attacks, what if al-Assad retaliates? This is a major risk that concerns many members of Congress. If the U.S. military attack is extremely limited and al-Assad retaliates, what are the contingency plans? Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, asked that critical question: ""What if we execute this strike and then he decides to use chemical weapons again. Do we strike again?"" She said it's one of her biggest concerns. Al-Assad has said he would respond. ""You should expect everything,"" he told PBS and CBS interviewer Charlie Rose. The American people are going to want to hear contingency plans for what happens next if American strikes don't cripple al-Assad's chemical weapons use. 5. Now that Syria has said it would comply with the Russian proposal, why does the president still need to address the nation? Obama told Blitzer he isn't so convinced that Syria is telling the truth. The administration distrusts Syria and its ally, Russia, and worries that the proposal to hand over its chemical weapons stockpile is simply a tactic to buy time and derail a potential U.S. strike. While the administration indicated that it will look into Syria's offer, the president doesn't want to get burned. So he will continue to press his case for a military strike. And if Syria's offer proves empty, the president won't have lost any time waiting on the sidelines. Syria's offer, however, has the potential to make Obama's sales job either easier -- or harder. If Syria is bluffing, the president can come back to the American people and make an even stronger argument for military action. But al-Assad has at least provided the illusion that the stubborn regime is open to an alternative, making Obama's task of persuading the public to favor a military strike a little more difficult. Still, the feeling inside the White House is that, given the Russian proposal, there may now be less urgency for a vote in Congress. White House officials tell CNN that their position has been strengthened since Syria embraced the proposal to turn over its stockpiles. However, if the U.S. and the international community believe Syria will turn over the stockpiles, but then al-Assad drags his feet, fails to comply, or, worse yet, launches another attack, Obama could come back and say, ""We tried the diplomatic approach, but it failed,"" leaving the nation and the world no other alternative but to attack. CNN's Jim Acosta, Tom Cohen, Michael Pearson and David Simpson contributed to this report.","Obama is scheduled to address the nation Tuesday night from the White House .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A man who tried to swim across a river to North Korea was killed by a rain of bullets fired at him by South Korean soldiers, a military official said. The shooting took place Monday afternoon at the heavily fortified border that separates the two Koreas. The South Korean man managed to get past a barbed wire fence by the bank of the Imjin River, which flows through part of the Demilitarized Zone between the two countries, and then jumped into the water with a Styrofoam float, Brig. Gen. Cho Jong-sul said Tuesday. ""We kept warning him verbally to come back to land,"" Cho said at a news conference. ""The river was only about 800 meters wide where he jumped in. It wouldn't have taken long for him to swim across with the float. It was a very tense situation."" When the man failed to heed the warnings, the entire unit of about 30 soldiers began firing at him. ""Several hundred shots were fired,"" Cho said. Asked whether this was a reasonable response, he said, ""It is a regulation to shoot anyone who does not respond to the command and tries to escape in the controlled area."" Defections to North unusual . The two Koreas are technically still at war after the all-out conflict they fought between 1950 and 1953 ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. Their border is considered to be the most heavily fortified in the world. Authorities said the man's surname was Nam but declined to disclose any other details about him beyond his nationality. The case is still being investigated, Cho said. Several South Korean news outlets reported that Nam was in his 40s. While tens of thousands of people have managed to flee to South Korea from the authoritarian regime in the North -- mostly through China -- defections in the other direction are very rare. Cho didn't say whether there had been any similar cases previously. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that this was the first shooting of this kind of somebody apparently trying to defect to North Korea. In 2009, the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency trumpeted the defection of a South Korean, Kang Tong-rim, who it said crossed the eastern part of the border. But South Korean authorities said he was fleeing police who wanted him for an assault incident. North and South Korea reopen Kaesong Industrial Complex .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- At this very moment, in a major Chinese city, a worker is boarding a train home. His journey is just one of 3.4 billion trips that will be taken during China's Lunar New Year. An unprecedented number of Chinese will travel home this year to be with family and friends during the holiday, making it the world's largest annual migration of people. Their yearly homecoming has been repeated over and over for the past two decades, reuniting families in the villages with the workers who have fueled China's economic miracle. But that growth has come at a tremendous personal cost thanks in part to a household registration system called ""hukou."" The hukou is akin to an internal passport that divides the population into rural and urban residents. As such, migrant workers are prevented from accessing social services in the city they're working in. Photos: China's great migration . The deeply discriminatory nature of China's hukou system came into clear focus last month after the fatal collapse of a bridge in Henan. Local media reports said victims' families with an urban hukou would receive 400,000 yuan in compensation compared to 180,000 yuan for those with a rural hukou. The institutionalized restriction of people's movement in China goes back for centuries, and was re-introduced by the Communist Party after 1949. Labor rights activist Han Dongfang of China Labor Bulletin says China's booming economy in recent years has made many hukou restrictions disappear, especially those that restrict the freedom of movement. ""But restrictions on access to education, welfare, medical and housing benefits still exist and disproportionately affect the poorest and least educated citizens,"" he says. ""In effect, the hukou system now only targets the poor."" Opinion: Why I dread Chinese New Year . Han was a democracy activist who set up the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. He has spent the last two decades in exile in Hong Kong, defending worker rights in China. Though not many people outside China have heard of the hukou system, Han says they must for a very simple reason -- the bottom line. Meaningful hukou reform would bring more riches to China's workers and the world. ""If 200 million Chinese workers, which is only about one-third of the total labor force in China, become regular consumers and taxpayers, not only will China's economy benefit, the rest of the world will benefit as well, as China consumes more products and services from abroad."" Rob Schmitz, the China-based correspondent for Marketplace, often reports on labor issues in China. He puts the plight of China's migrant workers under the hukou system in simple and stark terms: ""They are treated like illegal immigrants inside their own country."" And these ""illegals"" make up a major portion of the urban populace. Beijing may have a population of over 20 million, but migrant workers make up a third of its residents. Thanks to the hukou system, one-third of the population of the Chinese capital are without access to basic services like health care and education. ""One of the biggest issues within the hukou system is the children,"" says Schmitz. ""Many children are born in the large cities where their parents have moved to. This is their hometown, as far as they know it... but once they turn a certain age, and if they want to go to college someday, they will have to move to where their household registration is in their 'lao jia' or home village."" It's no surprise that many migrant workers choose to leave their children behind in their hometown to be raised by their grandparents. They are called ""liu dong er tong"" or ""floating children."" China Labour Bulletin estimates there are some 16 million children ""floating children"" in China. The group says they have a substandard education. They're more prone to violence and crime. They are more vulnerable to sexual abuse. What fortune will the Year of the Snake bring you? Beijing has vowed to reform the hukou system as part of a greater urbanization drive -- encouraging more Chinese to move to cities where they can earn more and spend more. And China's newest generation of migrant workers are pushing -- and protesting -- for that reform to come quickly. ""Today's younger workers, who have greater aspirations and expectations than their parents, are much more likely to express their discontent with the system, especially the way it restricts their access to public schooling for their children, subsidized housing, health care, etc.,"" says Han. ""They see themselves as urban residents and believe more that they should have equal access to such services."" Suki Chung of Labour Action China adds that China's latest generation of workers are more rights-aware and willing to challenge the long-held registration system. ""For the first generation of migrant workers, their hometown subsidized them and their children could go to school at home. But the new generation want their family to stay in the city."" After two decades of the ""Great Migration,"" China's latest generation of workers simply want to stay put. To hell with the hukou.","Household registration system ""Hukou"" behind China's mass migration .

"(CNN) -- Patrick Kennedy is sprawled in a too-small chair in a tiny courtyard in Atlanta,  talking to a reporter and trying to catch the early spring sunlight. The 43-year-old Kennedy left Congress in January, after spending more than half his life in public office. Now he's outside the Carter Center, taking a break after talking up his latest plan to a group of mental health advocates, including former first lady Rosalynn Carter. One thing Kennedy enjoys is talking, and these days, he can say whatever he wants. He shouts when he gets excited. He laughs a lot. He curses when he brings up frustrations. What he's talking about now is ""Moonshot."" If Kennedy has his way, 50 years from now the world will remember next week as the first step on one of the great triumphant journeys -- like the call by Patrick's uncle, President John F. Kennedy, that sent men to the moon. Patrick Kennedy: Brain research is the new 'moon shot' That call, as Kennedy likes to point out, came May 25, 1961 -- a half-century ago. Today, says Kennedy, the race is to inner space, the goal to create a detailed map of the brain in 10 years, with advances toward curing ""every kind of brain disease."" The role Kennedy plays now would have been hard to imagine back in May of 2006, when he made his woozy emergence from a green Mustang convertible with an old Kerry-Gephardt bumper sticker on the back, which he'd just crashed into a concrete barrier near the U.S. Capitol shortly after 2:30 in the morning. A day later, head bowed, Kennedy blamed sleeping pills for the crash and announced he was checking into rehab at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. We didn't know the whole story then, that the congressman had already been to rehab a half-dozen times. As is often the case, there had been hints. Shoving a security guard at the Los Angeles International Airport. A fight on a yacht, that brought a visit from the Coast Guard. Another boat, and another fight, this time with the rental company. Kennedy has acknowledged a trip to rehab for cocaine abuse way back in 1985, as a 17-year-old high school senior in Andover, Massachusetts. Along the way he also got a diagnosis of bipolar illness, although he now says recent testing suggests he is not bipolar but has a different, unspecified disorder. At the time of the infamous Capitol Hill crash, Jim Ramstad was a Republican congressman from Minnesota. He was also a recovering alcoholic, who had his last drink in 1981, shortly before an unpleasant encounter with some Sioux Falls, South Dakota, police officers. ""I called Patrick that morning, and told him I knew exactly what he was going through. And if he wanted me to come to him and talk, I would."" Ramstad had worked with Kennedy on mental health legislation but was not a close confidant. That changed over the next few weeks, as he paid repeated visits to the Mayo Clinic. ""We really formed a bond of friendship, and got to be close friends,""  says Ramstad. The former congressman, who became Kennedy's sponsor at Alcoholics Anonymous, says he's proud his friend was so open about the public crackup. ""Patrick got up there and told the truth. He let it all hang out, so to speak. And that's why he has been able to recover."" After getting home from the Mayo Clinic, most politicians -- heck, pretty much any politician you can think of -- would have run from the attention. Kennedy seemed to embrace it. By 2008, he was leading the drive for ""parity,"" the requirement that mental ailments -- addiction included -- must be covered by insurance companies, along with other kinds of illness. President Bush signed the bill into law that year. Says Ramstad, one of the bill's original sponsors a decade earlier: ""Without Patrick and his father (Sen. Ted Kennedy) as catalysts, we never would have passed the legislation."" In a Boston hotel suite in early April, Kennedy explained his vision of parity. ""If you have diabetes and have a chemical imbalance so you need more insulin, you don't get any questions about it. But if you need a neurotransmitter -- more serotonin, or dopamine -- then (people) look at that as something askew, as if the brain isn't part of the body,"" says Kennedy, his voice rising. ""I mean, we're in modern times and people are still treating this illness, mental illness, as if it's back in the Dark Ages."" If 2008 was a year of professional triumph, it also brought devastating personal news: that Patrick's father was fighting a brain tumor. ""He gave me an implicit message when he asked me to be around him at the end of his life,"" says Kennedy, who calls the final time with his father ""the most important year of my life."" As Kennedy recalls it now, ""The only thing that mattered to (my dad) when he was alone at the end of his life was not being alone and being surrounded by the people he loved the most, who he knew loved him the most."" The strain took a toll on Patrick. Two months before his father's death, he checked into rehab again. When Ted Kennedy died in August 2009, Patrick took it hard. Six months later, he announced he would not run for re-election. He seems to have walked away on his own terms. ""He would have won re-election easily,"" according to Darrell West, a political scientist who has followed Kennedy's career closely since the early 1990s. Incidentally, Kennedy's departure in January marked the first time in 58 years that there is no Kennedy in the national government -- no congressman, senator or president. Kennedy says he was tired of struggling with the stress of public office. ""I have put certain days together, and managed effectively to live and fight for another day legislatively,"" says Kennedy. But, ""I'm looking to live more than just surviving. I'm looking to live a life that's fuller in sobriety. I could function (while still in office), but that's not all I want to do. I want to live."" He's seized the opportunity. Come July, Kennedy will be married, to Amy Petitgout, a sixth-grade history teacher he met after, yes, another talk. It was about special education, the cause championed by his aunts Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who founded the special Olympics, and Jean Kennedy Smith, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for promoting the artistic talents of people with disabilities. Petitgout's father, a special education teacher, had a ticket to the event but couldn't go. As Kennedy says, ""The rest is history."" Ramstad, his AA sponsor, says his old friend is happier than ever. ""He was so close to his dad. They used to talk five or six times a day. Losing him left a huge void in his life. And now here comes Amy."" Kennedy glows when he talks about his fiancée, or about reading bedtime stories to her 3-year-old daughter. But he's all impatient enthusiasm when talk comes back around to Moonshot, or as next week's conference is officially called, ""One Mind for Brain Research."" The surroundings will be modest, an academic-style conference in Boston. Then again, President Kennedy's original 1961 call for a space race was prosaic too, the last of several budget requests in a businesslike address to Congress four months after taking office. What we remember better is the stirring speech he gave at Rice University the following year. ""We choose to go to the moon in this decade and to do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard,"" the president famously declared. His nephew, Patrick, grins at the challenge ahead. ""This is a thousand moon shots in order of complexity, and that makes it all the more challenging. For our generation, this is our chance to make the difference.""","Former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy launching new effort to map the human brain .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A member of the Haqqani Network -- a family whose brutal tactics have helped foment instability in Afghanistan for decades -- is dead in Pakistan.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A spate of suicides at France Telecom has put the spotlight on workplace stress and the devastating impact it can have on employees. France Telecom employees protest against work conditions following a colleague's suicide. There have been 24 suicides and 13 attempted suicides among France Telecom's 100,000 employees since the beginning of 2008. Labor unions blame restructuring and poor working conditions for creating a climate of stress. Last week a 51-year old father of two jumped to his death from a bridge. He was reported to have left a letter blaming his death on the ""atmosphere"" at work, according to media reports. The deputy chief executive of France Telecom Monday resigned in the wake of the staff suicides. Louis-Pierre Wenes said in a message to staff: ""Despite the hard edge of the technological and economic fight, especially in our business, nothing can justify men and women putting an end to their lives. Today, like before, I cannot accept it."" Patricia Pegg Jones is health and well-being program leader at the Work Foundation. She told CNN that the economic downturn has increased pressures on employees. ""In the current recession people have less control; there's more uncertainty and a lack of security,"" she said. She told CNN there is evidence that workers are more likely to suffer from stress in the recession and also a higher incidence of ""presenteeism"" -- when employees go to work despite being unwell. Pegg Jones says that a lack of workplace autonomy can also impact employees' health, with research showing that workers who have less control over their work are more likely to be ill. She said employers can help workers in times of uncertainty by being open and communicating effectively with them, explaining what changes are in store. ""Employers have to recognize that people take changes differently; some people can deal with the uncertainty and other people undergo a paralysis,"" she told CNN. ""It's important to recognize that workers don't all respond the same way to restructuring and the impact of recession."" Stress is one workplace hazard that can be detrimental to employees' health, but working too hard can be just as dangerous. In Japan, deaths among overworked employees are so common there is even a word to describe the phenomenon -- ""karoshi,"" or ""death from overwork."" Toshiro Ueyanagi is a lawyer specializing in cases of ""karoshi."" He told CNN that most deaths related to overwork are from heart attacks and strokes, and that overwork can also result in mental illness. Ueyanagi says it can be hard to prove that a death is the result of overwork and while the Japanese government recognized 377 cases of ""karoshi"" last year, he believes the number could be closer to 10,000. ""I think there are two reasons why ""karoshi"" is prevalent in Japan -- a hard-working tradition and very weak laws and regulation in the workplace,"" he told CNN. Ueyanagi says the word ""karoshi"" came into common use around 1990, when Japanese workers began working longer hours in response to competition from overseas and in response to the recession at the time. He adds that despite increased awareness of the dangers of overwork, de-regulation and increased global competition mean that Japanese workers are working harder than ever. ""Some workers have lost their jobs and workers who remain in the workplace have to work harder than before,"" he told CNN. In July 2008 a Japanese labor bureau ruled that a Toyota employee died from heart disease caused by overwork. His wife's lawyers said that in the two months leading up to his death he averaged over 80 hours of overtime per month. Ueyanagi says that in recent years there have been cases of ""karoshi"" among Japanese women, especially those working as schoolteachers and middle managers. As well as representing victims' families in ""karoshi"" cases, Ueyanagi has established a ""karoshi"" hotline, which receives between 400 and 500 calls each year from families seeking compensation and people asking how to prevent ""karoshi"" or deal with stress. But there are personal reasons behind Ueyanagi's crusade against ""karoshi."" ""I think my father died from cancer because he was too busy to see a doctor,"" he told CNN. ""It's one reason why I take this phenomenon seriously.""","24 suicides among France Telecom employees since the beginning of 2008 .

"(CNN) -- ""Who's the treasurer?"" Brothers Brant and Dylan Ozanich and Wyatt McCall were at a motorcycle shop in Hamilton, Montana, ordering a part for Dylan's bike when they met two old bikers from Texas and talked with them about their trip across the country. Although they had no treasurer, Brant pointed to McCall to answer the question. ""You guys are going to need this, trust me,"" said one of the older men, handing him $200 in cash. The three friends, all in their early 20s, admit they looked a little raggedy at the time. ""It was straight kindness,"" said McCall, and typical of the generosity of the bikers they met across the country. And it turns out, ""we did need it the next day for more bike repairs."" The generosity of strangers repeated itself during the two-month summer journey of three young men on the cusp of adulthood to find and document Main Street culture and people across the United States. And making the trip on motorcycles connected them not just to the towns and people they visited, but also to the country's biker community. An exploration of biker culture . Contributing their own money and raising funds from family, friends and Kickstarter, the trio started a blog, raised over $10,000 to fund the trip and pay for the pre- and post-production costs of documenting their journey. They documented the journey on their blog and the reddit online community, and they hope to have a documentary and book out sometime next year. Traveling on motorcycles turned out to be key. Dylan rode a 1982 Yamaha XJ 750 Seca ($500 cost); Brant rode a 1980 Yamaha XJ 650 Maxim ($500); and McCall rode a 1985 Honda V65 Magna ($1500 cost). ""On Maxim, On Magna, On Seca"" was a mantra they picked up for the trip. ""We didn't know motorcycles were going to be that much of a connection between people, but they were,"" said McCall. ""Every time you get to a new place, you're part of this new community."" ""With motorcycles you feel the scenery and the microclimate change and smell the fields you drive through,"" said Brant. ""Besides, it's just plain badass."" Finding their first Main Street . They packed up their bikes and left around noon on July 6. They planned to head north, turn east to get to New York, south to Mississippi and then through Texas and the Southwest to return home to California, But they decided not to keep to a strict schedule, allowing for fellow travelers to guide them on their way. It didn't take long to hit pay dirt. A few hours after they hit the road, they found their first Main Street in Point Arena, a small town north of San Francisco. As they hopped off their bikes, the locals they met convinced them to come back the next day for a parade marking Independence Day. ""The whole community came out and let us be a part of it and accepted us into the community,"" Dylan said. That serendipity set the tone for the rest of the trip. The best sandwich in Idaho, or anywhere . The travelers only had a guarantee of places to stay (and eat) in New York and Los Angeles. Everything else would be an exploration, local recommendations and possibly, information from their not-guaranteed Internet connections. The road led them to a Mennonite deli in Clark Fork, Idaho, that ""made the best sandwiches we've ever tasted,"" said McCall. They bought sandwiches and drove a mile down the road into Montana near a bridge to picnic and more. ""We jumped off the bridge to swim,"" Dylan said. And the drive through the Bitterroot Mountain range that cuts Idaho and Montana wasn't too shabby either. They also explored the source of their food, working for five days at Echo Valley Farm in Wisconsin in exchange for room and board. ""It was some of the most gorgeous, breathtaking American looking farmland I've ever seen, with rolling green hills and grain mills,"" Brant said. ""It felt like what we were looking for the whole time -- true America heartland."" The farm's kindness was typical of the people who gave them shelter on their journey. ""We pulled up, three dirty bikers, to this nice sustainable farm,"" he said. They ""showed us a nice place to park the bikes, took us on a tractor up around the whole property and told us about everything they were doing."" A willingness of strangers to share their stories was also typical. Shortly after they crossed the Mason Dixon Line into Maryland and found a good campsite at Catoctin Mountain Park, they heard music coming through the woods. ""Was it a violin or cello?"" said McCall, so they went to explore it. They discovered two older Korean men playing songs about Korea on their saxophones. ""We found the coolest guys on the whole trip,"" said McCall. Busted shocks and other struggles . The trip wasn't without its troubles. Dylan's shocks stopped working somewhere in Montana. ""For a few days I didn't know if my bike would be able to make it,"" he said. But they were able to fix it. ""We pulled it all apart in the forest, drained it and put in new fluid."" Brant also had the smallest gas tank, holding a gallon less than the other two bikes. He also had the worst gas mileage. And so he ran out of gas at least five times on the trip, and coasted into gas stations on fumes at least three times. ""I learned toward the end of the trip to carry a water bottle or two of gas."" By the time they arrived home in San Francisco on August 28, everyone was glad to sleep in their own beds again. ""For the first six days back, McCall was at his girlfriend's house, and Dylan and I sat on the couch watching movies,"" said Brant. 'An adult within my society' Giving up the benefits of home for a couple months was worth the journey. Dylan left San Francisco thinking it would be a way to transition from his youth to adulthood. Along the way, he hoped to learn ""what it means to be a man in my society."" While he doesn't have any specific answers, ""seeing my country and understanding what my country is about ... helped me understand that more."" While Brant has always liked to travel and experience new things, he thought he would graduate college, get a job and save for his next planned trip. Not anymore. ""Being out there in America on the road, and roughing it, inspired me to book a plane ticket to South America with my last $400,"" he said. ""I thought, 'If you did this, you can do pretty much anything without a lot of resources.' "" McCall, who had graduated in May not knowing what he wanted to do, thinks travel and video may be his calling.(And he learned how to ride a motorcycle along the way.) The three friends credit each other with making it an amazing experience. ""We did get in fights and have problems, but we wouldn't have been able to do it without each other,"" said Dylan. ""Every different leg of the trip, there was one pushing, one dragging and one on a stretcher,"" he said. ""It would change every single day."" ""We wouldn't have made it across the country and back without the others.""","Three young men set out to discover America from their motorcycle seats .

"(CNN) -- As you are standing in an airport security line this Thanksgiving week, waiting to be funneled into one of the invasive new body-imaging machines, or, if you decline that, to be pulled aside and subjected to a way-too-personal pat-down, ask yourself how you would feel if you lived in a country like this: . You can walk into any airport, with or without a ticket, and wander unimpeded right up to a boarding gate. You don't have to surreptitiously slip past a security checkpoint, because there are no security checkpoints. If you don't have a driver's license or a photo ID card with you, that doesn't matter; no one will request to see one. If you are carrying a loaded gun in your pocket or underneath your jacket, no one will know. In fact, if you do have a valid ticket, there will be nothing to prevent you from boarding a flight while armed to the teeth with concealed weaponry. The atmosphere at the airport is as free-and-easy as in a public park. The official assumption is that the people around you pose no threat; from the moment you walk through the front doors of the airport until the moment you step onto the plane, not a soul will stop you or ask you a question. Would you feel safe? Would you want to live in such a country? You did, if you were a citizen of the United States before the 1970s. Opinion: Scanners, patdowns violate law . And, in retrospect, the surprising thing is not that airport security measures have become so intrusive and dehumanizing. The surprising thing is that, for all the years of American commercial aviation prior to the '70s, an implicit trust prevailed. For all those years, the strangers around you in an airport or on an airplane were presumed to bear no ill will toward their fellow passengers, to represent no potential danger. It was a series of hijackings that put the checkpoints and the first rudimentary metal detectors in U.S. airports; they have been there for so long now that it seems like a gauzy illusion to recall the time when travel was predicated on good faith. Ever since September 11, 2001, airline security has escalated with each new terror attempt. No one has had to ask why. The Transportation Security Administration seems to have been caught off guard by the genuine anger on the part of passengers in recent days. Americans have acquiesced for so long to just about anything the government has asked them to accept in the name of national security that the TSA may have thought that of course, if safety was at stake, the public would always willingly go along. But the body-imaging machines that see through clothing, paired with the humiliating new pat-downs, have, perhaps for the first time since 2001, made people begin to ask the question: How much is too much? When is the line crossed -- when, even with the best intentions of security officials, does America stop feeling like America? They are questions with no satisfactory answers, because no one believes that the TSA has instituted the new measures on a whim; the TSA's job is to keep flying as safe as humanly and technologically possible. And if security measures at airports were to be significantly reduced -- if, because of an outcry by passengers, the government were to reluctantly remove some of the screening procedures that it feels are necessary -- would people feel confident getting onto planes? Obama: Security procedures are necessary . It's a mess, and there's no need to point a finger at either the TSA or the passengers who feel that the new methods violate their dignity and their very sense of what it means to be a free citizen. Neither side is at fault here; it's always easier to place blame, but in this instance it is hard to make the case that either side is being irrational. The saddest thing is that it is, indeed, becoming a controversy in which those with opposing viewpoints are characterized as being on different sides. Yet if we step back for a second, we realize that the two sides are the government entity whose job is to keep Americans safe, and those very Americans who wish for safety for themselves and for their families. Two sides that, under most circumstances, would be on the same side. But these are not most circumstances, and have not been for many years. There have been calls for mass refusals in U.S. airports on the heavy travel day before Thanksgiving -- suggestions that passengers declare that they will not enter the body-imaging machines. If that happens, there could be chaos, and the most melancholy scene of all: nine years after the terror attacks on the United States, the sight of American travelers facing off against their fellow Americans who have been assigned to keep them free from harm. More opinion on topics in the news . Many times each day, in airports across the nation, people can be heard saying to others who are setting off on journeys of their own: ""Where are you going?"" This year, in the airports that not so long ago in U.S. history were open and unfettered, we might ask ourselves a different question: . How did we get here?

"(CNN) -- Supermodel Naomi Campbell took the stand Thursday in the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor and said she received a gift of ""dirty-looking stones"" that she assumed was from him. Campbell was handed the stones following a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela in 1997. ""When I was sleeping I had a knock on my door. I opened the door and two men were there. They gave me a pouch and said, ""A gift for you.'"" The men didn't introduce themselves nor say anything else, Campbell said. The next morning, she opened the pouch and saw a few ""very small, dirty-looking stones."" She then shared what happened with her agent and another woman at breakfast. ""Well that's obviously Charles Taylor,"" one of them said. Then, one of them added, ""Well, obviously they are diamonds."" Taylor faces war crimes charges over a brutal conflict in Sierra Leone which was fueled by rough diamonds, also known as blood diamonds or conflict diamonds. Prosecutors say Taylor gave Campbell a diamond during the war in Sierra Leone, contradicting Taylor's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict. The defense said it hadn't seen a copy of Campbell's testimony, which interferes with Taylor's right to a fair trial. Under tribunal rules, the defense team should get advance access to prosecution witness testimony so it can prepare its arguments. Prosecutors said they have not obtained a statement from Campbell, but they did provide a copy of her anticipated testimony to the defense. Prosecutors had rested their case against Taylor in February 2009, but reopened it specifically to call Campbell to testify after learning in June of that year that Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond in South Africa in 1997. Prosecutors said they also wanted to call actress Mia Farrow and a witness named Carole Taylor to testify, court papers show. Prosecutors have said that Farrow confirmed that Taylor gave Campbell a diamond. When arguing to reopen the case, prosecutors said Campbell's testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Campbell did not want to be involved in the trial but was subpoenaed July 1. Taylor, 62, was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in Sierra Leone. It was fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior, and often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, sexual slavery and violence, and enslavement. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty.

"(CNN) -- As a group of tourists was passing through the villages of Lesna and Zabrody in the north east of Poland last month, they caught glimpse of something that immediately sent them reaching for their cameras. Strolling through the meadows near the densely forested Bialowieza National Park were three magnificent European bison, standing up to two meters high and weighing up to 1,000 kilograms each. It was a doubly gratifying sight for Rafal Kowalczyk, a conservationist and the Director of the Mammal Research Institute at the Polish Academy of Sciences, who enjoyed seeing the tourists as much as the bison. Europe's largest land mammal had been declared extinct in the wild at the end of the 1920s, but after spirited and careful re-introduction efforts throughout the past 60 years, descendants of a small captive herd have gradually reassumed their position among Poland's vibrant indigenous fauna. The tourists, meanwhile, were training only their lenses on the animals and not the viewfinders of a shotgun, proving to Kowalczyk that the creatures could bring visitors to Poland for reasons other than to hunt them. ""It really increases the touristic attraction of the area,"" said Kowalczyk, who co-ordinated one of several bison conservation programs between 2006 and 2010. ""This is a unique animal, a kind of relic of the past because most of these large herbivores have become extinct. There are fewer European bison than the black rhino in Africa, for example."" Back from the brink . European bison, also known as ""wisent"", roamed freely across the continent until the early 20th century, when a combination of factors including a shrinking habitat and poaching left only 54 individuals in captivity, according to a recent report commissioned by the Rewilding Europe initiative. But since 1959 small populations have been introduced in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia, but most successfully in Poland where there are now 1,299 closely monitored, free-roaming individuals in small herds. The European bison spent several years classified as ""endangered"" on the Red List of Threatened Species published by the International Union of the Conservation of Nature. But recent population trends have increased annually by around 15%, earning the bison an upgrade to ""vulnerable"". The animal is far from out of the woods yet, but there is reason for cautious optimism. Conservationists regard bison as a so-called ""umbrella species"", whose well-being also tends to ensure a positive habitat for many other treasured creatures including moose, wolf and lynx, plus various bird and insect species. READ MORE: Poland's little-known heritage sites . In attempts to broaden the genetic diversity among bison --all of Poland's bison descend from those 54 captive animals that survived ""extinction"" -- scientists have created migration channels to facilitate the interbreeding of herds. Locals residents have also been educated about the animals habits and the perceived damage caused by the bison to young trees, or when they stray into agricultural land. The principal concerns now are centered on controlling the bison population, ensuring herds do not become too large for the areas of land they occupy. Natural mortality among bison is low and the space they demand vast; five bison per 1,000 hectares of land is deemed the optimal density. Some culling of old, sick or unusually aggressive creatures has therefore become necessary, but the process is controversial, particularly since the Polish Ministry of the Environment has recently allowed commercial hunters to take part. Hunting as a conservation measure? Bison is not a game animal in Poland, meaning specific permission must be sought in order to kill one. But a small number of permits are now being issued annually to commercial agencies, providing the chance for hunters from anywhere in the world to add this rare beast to their trophy collections at a cost of up to $30,000 per animal. ""Rather than have him (a bison selected to be culled) killed in a fight or smashed through a fence and injured, they simply allow him to be hunted,"" said Bob Kern, President and Founder of the Hunting Consortium, who arranges overseas trips for hunters from the company headquarters in Virginia. ""That brings money into the reserve and into the conservation system and it prevents wanton waste."" Kern added: ""About 70% of money that goes into wildlife conservation nowadays comes from the sustainable use community. That means hunters and fishermen."" Dr Wanda Olech-Piasecka, of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, is a member of a commission -- alongside veterinarians, ecologists and scientists -- that discusses the number of hunting permits to issue each year and decides on the individual bison to be removed. She said that the process is strictly regulated, with a hunter being escorted by a forest ranger, pointed to the one animal he is allowed to shoot and only permitted to fire when it is alone. ""Everything is organized,"" said Olech-Piasecka. ""This kind of hunting involves 20, maybe 25 animals per year in Poland."" But Kowalczyk does not believe that the animals are plentiful enough in Poland for even this carefully regulated hunting to take place. ""This culling or hunting is occurring in some populations that number below 100 individuals,"" he said. He suggests that the bison might be better suited to life on the plains and out of the forests, which would not place an artificial limit on population numbers. ""There is huge potential for bison increase in many areas and I'm quite sure that culling or hunting is not a good way to mitigate conflicts.""","European bison have been successfully reintroduced to Poland .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Men taking any of three erectile dysfunction drugs -- Viagra, Levitra or Cialis -- may be at increased risk for sudden hearing loss, prompting Food and Drug Administration officials to require label changes for the medications. The FDA is requiring label changes for drugs that may increase the risk of sudden hearing loss. The FDA said manufacturers must change the labels ""to display more prominently the potential risk of sudden hearing loss,"" according to the agency's Web site. Labeling must also be changed for the blood pressure medication Revatio, which has the same active ingredient as the other drugs. Men taking any of the ED drugs and experiencing hearing loss should immediately stop taking the drug and see their physician, the FDA said. Patients taking Revatio and experiencing hearing loss should not discontinue taking the drug because it is used to treat a potentially life-threatening condition, the FDA said. Those patients are urged to see their physicians immediately. The FDA is requiring the label change for the entire class of drugs -- called Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitor, or PD-5 inhibitors. The FDA says all manufacturers have agreed to the change their labels. ""This is basically a public health announcement to let people decide if they want to take the drug,"" Dr. Robert Boucher said. Boucher is an ear, nose and throat specialist for the FDA who reviewed reports of sudden hearing loss in patients taking these drugs. The FDA began investigating the possible link between hearing loss and ED drugs after the publication of an article for ear, nose and throat specialists in last April's Journal of Laryntology and Otology, according to FDA spokeswoman Rita Chappelle. The study reported on a man taking Viagra who had experienced sudden hearing loss. This prompted the FDA to look for other reports of sudden hearing loss. The FDA found a total of 29 reports, which involved patients experiencing ringing in their ears, vertigo and/or dizziness. In most cases, the hearing loss only occurred in one ear, and for about one third of patients, the hearing loss was temporary. Boucher said ""these 29 adverse event reports date back to 1996, when Viagra, the first impotence drug, was approved."" ""So, we're only talking about a couple cases per year,"" he said. He said 40 million prescriptions of all four drugs have been filled worldwide so far. ""This is a very small number of cases, but because we're talking about a person's ability to hear, we thought it was important to make the label clear that this is a possible event,"" Chappelle said. There are about 4,000 new cases of sudden hearing loss in the United States each year, according to the National Institutes of Health. Hearing loss can be caused by blood flow blockage as a result of diabetes or other illness, smoking, age and antibiotics. Pfizer manufactures Viagra and Revatio and Eli Lilly manufactures Cialis. Levitra, developed by GlaxoSmithKline and Bayer HealthCare, is jointly promoted in the United States by GSK and Schering-Plough Corporation. Representatives from Pfizer and Eli Lilly stressed that this is a ""class label change"" for all such drugs. In separate statements, Pfizer and Lilly representatives said ""the FDA is making this change in the interests of patients so that patients can make informed decisions regarding PD-5 medications."" GlaxoSmithKline did not return calls, but Schering-Plough noted that ""based on patient reports, all occurrences of sudden hearing loss in patients taking Levitra were temporary.""

"(CNN) -- If you want a snapshot of the challenges facing newspapers, you should have been with me at the exhibition area at the SXSW Interactive gathering in Austin, Texas, a few days ago. The New York Times had set up a booth, with hundreds of other companies, and a woman was hawking print and digital subscriptions. A man shuffled by and she made her pitch: You must read the Times, how about subscribe? The man shrugged and said no thanks, but admitted he did read Times stories online. The woman pressed on, a bit sharper: Wait, you read the Times but won't pay? You know how good it is. The man did not slow his pace; he said he read the Times' stories not at NYTimes.com or on a Times app, but on the Huffington Post and other aggregators. The look on the woman's face was one of disgust. The Times umbrellas and others goodies for those who did sign just lay there. The man moved on. To its credit, the New York Times is having success with its digital subscription model -- total digital subs are up over a year ago and the Gray Lady even saw a bump in newspaper subscriptions because of the way it had bundled its digital offer. The newspaper industry is declining faster than any other industry in the United States, according to a report released last week from the Council of Economic Advisers. The best papers in the country are bleeding red; skilled editors, reporters, photographers and ad people are being let go to balance the books and please creditors. So what? Well, as millions of people grow suspicious of government on one side, or Wall Street on the other, the news media is about the only place left that can consistently hold institutions accountable. You don't have a news business without people to gather it. As the paper side collapses it's taking the news side with it. What happened? The loss of classifieds to the Internet, an investment community that played these institutions like poker chips and left choking debt in the wake, owners without an honest commitment to independent news in a democratic society, and newspapers themselves that were slow as readers flocked to the Web. I grew up reading the Wilmington News Journal and New York Daily News and as an adult had a front row seat as papers and print publications struggled with all things digital: platforms, technology, audience trends and revenue. Newspapers need to succeed in five broad areas if they have a hope of saving the news: . First, newspapers are losing their connection to enough readers to stay in business. Papers did not keep up as attention spans shifted and younger readers failed to develop a news reading habit. NPR's new CEO Gary Knell told an industry group last week that no one under 30 has read a paper, and they never will. The noble and necessary work of covering, investigating and following stories goes on, but papers are slow to meet readers where they live. The commuter-friendly tabloid became a habit for generations of readers. It was the right format for readers crammed onto buses and subways. The lesson: Convenience is one key to connection and news habits. Authenticity is another factor (ask a Pete Hamill). As a young reporter I grabbed the Philadelphia Daily News first because its voice captured the street sense of the city in a way that the excellent Inquirer never truly could. Second, newspapers do a rotten job explaining why they matter. Yes, they make the case every day in what they cover. But they need to share what they do, how they do it, why they do it, and show the difference they make. The Las Vegas Sun, in its investigation of appallingly negligent hospital care two years ago, showed how to explain the process to readers. Openness increases credibility. Papers also need to explain why professional newsrooms exist plus carve out a space for readers to have a meaningful role. The website Talkingpointsmemo.com has conducted groundbreaking investigations by relying on and trusting its readers. The site, and others, show that crowd sourcing works. There is a role for bloggers, readers and social media if it is done smartly. Next, the move to mobile. From phones to tablets, this is the most exciting development of a new medium since the Web itself. It isn't just that newspapers need apps or a presence on these devices, it's what they should be doing with them. Far beyond repurposing news, this is a whole new chance to engage readers, curate the best coverage and display and explain news in new ways. I saw some compelling examples at SXSW that give me hope. The business side of the newspaper business remains a mess. Ad revenue continues leaking from the print side, and the digital side is taking a long, slow time to make up the difference. The days are long gone when all content can be locked behind a pay wall, as much as some wish. That doesn't mean news has to be free even if it is freely available. Licensing of content still makes sense. Limited pay wall models, like The Times', clearly show promise. Finally, the biggest barrier to newspapers' future is that guy who walked by The New York Times table and shrugged. The problem is us, the reader. Public media, my profession, asks listeners and viewers to pay part of the cost. Some do; at least in large enough volumes to keep it going and (pretty much) healthy. I'm not suggesting this will work for newspapers; but we need people like you and me to value the news we read anywhere and also accept that we have to pick up the tab. The stakes are much bigger than a free umbrella. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John Barth.","Study shows newspaper industry is declining faster than any other U.S. industry .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts teen accused of raping a fellow student at a summer sports camp pleaded not guilty Tuesday. Galileo Mondol, 17, is one of three high school junior varsity soccer players who authorities allege entered a cabin occupied by freshman students and assaulted three victims at a camp in western Massachusetts. At Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors said the three went into the freshman cabin searching for victims, using a broomstick to assault them. Attorney William Korman told CNN that Mondol was an innocent bystander and actually tried to stop the other students from getting involved. Mondol is being tried as an adult and faces charges that include aggravated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery on a person who has turned 14, assault and battery and intimidation of a witness. On Tuesday, he should have been heading to school for the first day of classes. ""I imagine he planned on getting dressed for his first day of school, and instead he had to get arraigned on felony charges,"" Korman said. ""He's very mature for his age. He understands the severity of the charges, but he's also confident because he knows he didn't do anything. He knows he will be exonerated."" Mondol is being held without bail pending a ""dangerousness"" hearing Friday, Korman said. If Mondol is found to be dangerous, the judge can continue to hold him without bail for 90 days. If the judge finds him not dangerous, his bail will be set at $100,000. Two other JV soccer players, both 16, face similar allegations, prosecutors said in a statement. It was unclear Tuesday whether they had been arraigned or entered pleas in response to the charges. Frederick Lantz, a spokesman with the Berkshire District Attorney's office, said he could not reveal details about their cases because they were minors. The assaults occurred last month at Camp Lenox near Otis, a town in western Massachusetts, according to the Berkshire District Attorney's Office. The city of Somerville, just northwest of Boston, rented the facility for team-building activities for its fall sports teams. A criminal investigation began after the allegations were reported to members of the Somerville High School athletic department. ""We are disturbed and appalled that these crimes may have taken place,"" Somerville's mayor and schools superintendent said in a joint statement, ""and our thoughts and concerns are with the victims and their families.""

"(CNN) -- If you had caught me straight out of college at age 22 in the halls of the Vermont State House where I was a lobbyist-in-training and asked me what I was gonna do with my life, I would have told you that I had just passed the HSK, otherwise known as the Chinese equivalency exam, and was planning to study law at Beijing University with the intention to improve U.S.-China relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms. I had it all figured out. Little did I know how much my life would change when one night I heard Doc Watson singing ""Shady Grove"" from a record player in the corner of a room at a party: ""Shady Grove my little love, Shady Grove my darlin', Shady Grove my little love, I'm-a-goin' back to Harlan."" The rippling trance of an old-time banjo groove, and Doc's soulful voice layered on top, the sound of merging immigrant cultures of old Ireland and Africa in Appalachia -- it was all so beautiful. And, after having been obsessed with the mammoth history and richness of Chinese culture for years, I was relieved to find something so truly beautiful that is so truly American. I knew I had to get a banjo and bring it with me to China. TED.com: Eddi Reader sings ""Kiteflyer's Hill"" Before leaving for law school in China I jumped in my little red truck, threw my newly bought old-time banjo in the back, and went on a road trip through Appalachia to learn some old-time American music. I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky, at the International Bluegrass Music Association convention. And here's where the story gets nutty: I met two girls in a hallway, I nervously played a couple of old-time songs with them and a record executive walked up and invited me to come to Nashville to make a record! Fast-forward a year, I delayed going to law school in Beijing, and instead lived in Nashville and learned to write songs. My first song came out in English, titled ""Rockabye Dixie,"" and my second song in Chinese, ""Song of the Traveling Daughter"": . 门 外有个世界 （Men wai you ge shijie） . 心中有个声音 （Xin zhong you ge shengyin） . 四方等你来呀 （Si fang deng ni lai ya） . 游女游女 （You nu you nu） . Translation: . ""Outside your door the world is waiting . ""Inside your heart a voice is calling . ""The four corners of the world are watching .

Music is a powerful way to connect cultures. I see it when I'm on a stage at a bluegrass festival in Virginia. When I look out at the sea of people in lawn chairs and bust into a song in Chinese, everybody's eyes pop wide open and they nudge their neighbor: ""Is that girl singing in Chinese?"" After a show, people would come up to me; everyone seems to have a story about their connection to China. And I see the power of music when I'm on stage in China: I start a Chinese song and the audience roars with delight that the blond, curly-haired girl with the banjo can sing their music. More importantly, I see how music directly connects people's hearts. Like the time a little Chinese girl came up to me after I performed at a relocation school in Sichuan's earthquake disaster zone and asked: ""Big Sister Wang, can I sing you a song that my mom sang before she was swallowed in the earthquake...?"" She sat on my lap and I could feel the warmth of her body. She sang me the song, and tears started rolling down her cheeks and tears started rolling down mine. The light shining from her eyes felt like a place I could stay forever. TED.com: Yang Lan: The generation that's remaking China . In that moment, we weren't our Chinese or our American selves.

"(CNN) -- Kathleen Hanna isn't Wonder Woman. Despite her iconic status as a ""famous feminist"" -- as one of the leaders of the '90s riot grrrl movement from her days in Bikini Kill -- she is also human. And when her body started failing her, she realized she couldn't do it all, which is why she called a hiatus for her band Le Tigre six years ago. It took a long time for Hanna to get a correct diagnosis -- late-stage Lyme disease, after being told alternately that she had Crohn's disease, MS, lupus and degenerative arthritis -- and proper treatment, and until she knew what was going on, she didn't want to disclose it to the world. ""I didn't want to do press and say I was sick!"" Hanna said. "" 'Hey, everybody, I have to leave; I'm sick!' "" Now in remission, she's back full force, with a new band (the Julie Ruin), a new album (""Run Fast,"" out this week), a tour, a documentary (""The Punk Singer,"" out this fall), an archive at NYU and more. ""Is everyone like, 'Shut this woman up!'?"" Hanna said with a laugh at the thought of being overexposed after years of silence. ""I wanted to archive my work to make sure it lasted longer than I did,"" she said. ""And I still have some struggles with my health. It's always like, 'I don't know if I'll be able to show up at your thing.' 'I don't know if I'll be able to go to the premiere of the movie about me.' But I was. Hanna has been able to keep up with the rigors of her schedule. And for that, she said, ""I'm just so thankful, because I have stuff I want to do, you know? I just want to enjoy my life! And now I can move on and do whatever I want now."" Part of Hanna's recent overload of activity stems from her facing her own limitations, her legacy and her mortality, because there was a period of time where she was forced to consider the possibility that she might not be able to sing for a living anymore. The original riot grrrl on Katy Perry, '90s revival . Some of the alternate careers she considered were interior design (she took classes at Parsons), visual art, scripting comedy and, strangely enough, writing country songs. But just because Plan B didn't turn out to be necessary doesn't mean Hanna is abandoning all her new avenues. ""I would love to make a bunch of country demos and write country songs for really great country singers,"" Hanna said, noting that she grew up listening to country music. She counts George Jones, Randy Travis, Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline and Miranda Lambert among her favorites. ""I'm really annoyed by the wave of country music that's just a list of stuff,"" she said. ""It almost sounds like L.A. people writing country music, because it's just a list of stuff: 'My pickup truck and my cowboy boots and my Levi's jeans and my girlfriend with the short shorts.' It's so boring!"" Her country songs, Hanna said, would either be abstract or have ""narratives that do something weird and interesting,"" such as ""He Stopped Loving Her Today"" and ""In Color,"" two of the country songs she's been studying. ""If I can't sing them myself, there's nothing better than writing songs for other people and watching them be performed,"" she added. ""It's kind of more thrilling than doing it yourself."" Although Hanna drives her husband, Beastie Boy Adam Horovitz, crazy ""by listening to the country station in the car all the time,"" as a joke they wrote an ironic country song together called ""Don't F*** with My Truck."" ""It's the most offensively sexist song,"" she laughed. ""One of the verses is really sexist, and the verses are about different forms of violence. And it will be released by someone with a name like mine that isn't mine, under a fake name."" Hanna and Horovitz have also collaborated on a television comedy series that they wrote called ""Bridget Drives a Bus,"" based on the alt-cabaret show by Bridget Everett. The plot centers around a ""bus driver in New Jersey who wants to move to Manhattan and become a huge star, and she gets in wacky hijinks,"" she said. ""It's kind of how you imagine New York is before you moved here, and then you move here, and you're disillusioned."" Hanna's mapped out the first three seasons and is working on the pilot with a production company. If the pilot isn't picked up, she plans to try to make it as a movie because, she said, she so strongly believes in the script and the character. Don't expect that movie, however, to have a stereotypical girl power moment. Hanna suggested updating the Bechdel test, which groups films according to whether they have scenes featuring two or more women talking about something other than a man. ""I feel like the real test should be whether or not two or more female characters who are singing into a hairbrush or a spoon with frosting on it, singing an Aretha Franklin song such as 'Respect,' "" she said. ""There should be a wooden spoon test, because those faux-feminist scenes are despicable! It's like those white-people-save-the-day movies, like what was that Sandra Bullock movie? 'The Blind Side'? How many more of those do we need? I can't believe this movie exists."" Hanna isn't too concerned that a Wonder Woman movie doesn't exist, either. ""I don't find her that redeeming,"" she said. ""I'm not that interested in female superheroes."" Hanna does have a suggestion in lieu of the Amazon for Hollywood to take on: ""Martha Washington Goes to War,"" her favorite cyberpunk superhero. ""And the more action movies that have strong females, the better.""","Hanna is in remission from late-stage Lyme disease .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama unveiled a new $5 billion veterans jobs plan Friday that the administration says will put thousands of men and women who once wore their country's uniform back to work. The new Veterans Jobs Corps initiative, first mentioned in the president's State of the Union address last week, involves partnerships with the Veterans Administration and the Interior Department, as well as state and local law enforcement agencies. Under the blueprint, the administration will award $166 million in grant money to communities that show a preference for hiring post-9/11 veterans for new law enforcement positions. In addition, $320 million in grant money will be awarded to various fire departments who pledge to hire and train new veterans. Money for those grants has already been appropriated by Congress. The president, however, will now seek an additional $4 billion in his upcoming budget to expand both programs. Congress last fall rejected a similar proposal that was part of the president's broader jobs initiative. The president rolled out the new plan during a speech at an Arlington, Virginia, firehouse. ""This has been a top priority of mine,"" he declared. ""These are Americans that every business should be competing to attract. These are the Americans that we want to keep serving here at home as we rebuild this country. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure that when our troops come home they come home to new jobs and new opportunities and new ways to serve their country."" The president's upcoming budget will also include a $1 billion proposal to create as many as 20,000 new jobs for veterans relating to conservation efforts on America's federal and state public lands. That initiative, to be overseen by the Department of Interior, would put veterans to work in visitor and tourism-related jobs as well as positions that will assist in general upkeep and maintenance roles throughout the country's public parks and nature preserves. It is unclear what type of reception the overall proposal will receive on Capitol Hill, particularly among Republicans who have been complaining about rising deficits. ""These are commonsense initiatives to serve our 9/11 veterans who are coming home,"" Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar told reporters on a conference call. ""We hope Congress does its job (in approving the funding)."" Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki said Thursday the president will also propose expanding training programs for entrepreneurial veterans seeking to start their own businesses. This program would include online training seminars conducted by the Small Business Administration lasting as long as eight weeks and could serve as many as 10,000 veterans annually, according to administration estimates. ""Our country owes them a debt of gratitude and we must ensure that veterans who come home from Afghanistan and Iraq get the opportunities they deserve,"" Shinseki said. The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans is 11.1%, nearly 3 percentage points higher than the country's overall unemployment rate. Among the president's few jobs proposals to clear Congress last year were new tax credits for businesses that hire recent veterans.

"Washington (CNN) -- The news was devastating for Shannon and Jeremiah Collins: Their 19-year-old son, Marine Lance Cpl. Jeremiah Collins Jr., died in Afghanistan's Helmand province. Then it got worse. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin, couple learned the survivor benefit paid to the families of fallen troops for burial and other expenses had been suspended because of the government shutdown. Her sadness, Shannon Collins says, was compounded by worry and questions about how to pay off the debt. It's a question that embarrassed and outraged government officials, who scrambled to find a way to provide the survivor benefits to the families of 26 troops who have died since the shutdown began on October 1. On Wednesday, the Pentagon struck a deal with a private charity to ensure families of fallen troops are paid the survivor benefits, which include a $100,000 payment made within days of the death, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said. The government will reimburse the Maryland-based Fisher House Foundation once the shutdown is over, Hagel said in a written statement. Fisher House founder no stranger to service members in need . ""I am offended, outraged, and embarrassed that the government shutdown had prevented the Department of Defense from fulfilling this most sacred responsibility in a timely manner,"" Hagel said. ""In the days before the shutdown, we warned Congress and the American people that (the Defense Department) would not have the legal authority to make these payments during a lapse in appropriations."" The announcement came just after the U.S. House voted unanimously to resume paying survivor benefits. It was unclear whether the U.S. Senate would take up the bill, given that a legislative fix may now not be necessary. President Barack Obama ordered administration officials on Wednesday to find an immediate solution. ""The president was very disturbed to learn of this problem, and he directed the Department of Defense to work with the Office of Management and Budget and his lawyers to develop a possible solution, and he expects this to be fixed today,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. The survivors benefit includes funeral and burial reimbursements. It also includes a gratuity for travel to funeral or memorial services -- or to be at Dover Air Force Base, where remains of those troops who died overseas typically go. As the debate swirled around how to restore the military death benefits, Hagel traveled to Dover for the arrival of the bodies of four soldiers killed Sunday when insurgents attacked their unit with a improvised explosive device in Afghanistan's Zahir District. The four are Pfc. Cody J. Patterson, 24, of Philomath, Oregon; 1st Lt. Jennifer M. Moreno, 25, of San Diego, California; Sgt. Patrick C. Hawkins, 25, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania; and Sgt. Joseph M. Peters, 24, of Springfield, Missouri. It is rare for the defense secretary to attend a ceremony for the return of the soldiers, but Hagel's appearance appeared to send a strong message about the government shutdown. Carney said the payments were not specifically addressed in legislation to ensure military personnel would be paid during any shutdown. He did not elaborate on what the solution might be. It's unclear exactly when Obama learned of the situation, which reporters were briefed about four days before the shutdown began. At the briefing Wednesday, Carney refused to say when the president learned benefits were being delayed. ""I don't know specifically,"" he said. A senior Defense Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that Hagel warned senior White House officials and some in Congress days ago -- before the shutdown began -- that death benefits would not be paid families of fallen troops during the shutdown. On September 27, Pentagon comptroller Bob Hale told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that death gratuities would be one of the things held up by a shutdown. ""This is ghoulish, but it's the law, not policy,"" he said. ""Remember that. If the death occurred after the lapse took place, then the money would be obligated after the lapse took place, and we would have no authority to pay based on that money until the lapse ended. So in that case, they could be delayed."" It's the ""worst nightmare"" for military families, said Amy Neiberger-Miller of TAPS, a support network for families of the fallen. 5 crazy side effects from the shutdown . Before the Pentagon worked out a deal, Fisher House Foundation -- a group that helps the families of troops in need -- offered an advance grant to families of the fallen during the shutdown, according to a letter sent Tuesday from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, to Hagel. Even as the Defense Department entered into a contract Wednesday with Fisher House, both sides in Washington were blaming the other. The holdup on death benefit payments is just one issue affecting military families because of the shutdown. Child-care programs have been scratched, subsidized military grocery stores are closed, nonessential medical care has been cut back, and kids' sports programs have been canceled, CNNMoney reports. ""The president is the commander in chief. He should not be using troops and their families as pawns in this political bickering,"" Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pennsylvania, said on the House floor. ""He should be doing everything he can to stand up for the men and women of our military. Instead, he is refusing to negotiate until he gets his way."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said: ""Shouldn't we be embarrassed about this? Shouldn't we be ashamed?"" Meanwhile, the members-only gym at the House remains open. ""The electricity, the hot water, the towels -- they are not provided by gym fairies,"" Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, said Wednesday, calling, on the House floor, for the gym to be closed. ""They are provided by taxpayers."" ""Some of the most fanatic about inflicting unnecessary pain on the American public are regulars, enjoying our House gym while the staff gym is closed,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Throughout the world, but mainly in Europe and parts of Asia, numerous palaces, castles and chateaus have been carefully converted into deluxe lodgings -- rich in history and, understandably, often in cost. Some of the finest include the newly opened Four Seasons Lion Palace in St. Petersburg and the recently renovated Gritti Palace in Venice -- both among the selection featured below. Excluded in this list are the well-known palace hotels of India in order to highlight similar-ish accommodations available in other countries. Please let us know other great stays you've experienced. La Posta Vecchia, Rome . Located 30 minutes outside of the Italian capital, La Posta Vecchia was built in the mid-17th century by the Renaissance Prince Orsini. In the 1960s, oil tycoon J.P. Getty bought and restored it, salvaging many original artifacts while simultaneously reinvigorating the palace with pieces from his own art collection. Today, the hotel balances ancient and contemporary themes, with priceless antiques alongside modern features such as an indoor pool and a helipad. Highlight: The hotel's private museum, housing ruins dating back to the second century B.C. La Posta Vecchia, Strada Ciclabile Palo Laziale, 00055 Ladispoli, Rome, Italy; + 39 06 994 9501; standard rooms from US$350 a night . Hotel Vestibul Palace, Split, Croatia . Part of Diocletian's Palace, an immense bastion built by the Roman emperor in the fourth century A.D., the Hotel Vestibul Palace is located within the Peristile square, a place once reserved for the gods. The hotel teems with history outside but inside things are mostly modern and the contrast of contemporary furnishings sitting next to 1,500-year-old walls allows one to appreciate the surroundings all the more. Highlight: Figuring out which era parts of the palace are from, with the hotel merging Romanic, Gothic and Renaissance periods. Hotel Vestibul Palace, Ulica Iza Vestibula 4  21000, Split, Croatia; +385 21 329 329; standard rooms from US$150 a night . Aman at Summer Palace, Beijing . Beijing's grand Summer Palace is one of the most popular sights of the Chinese capital and only a group like Aman Resorts would dare try match it, let alone exceed it, with a hotel. The Aman at Summer Palace is near the East Gate of the palace and comprises a series of 100-year old pavilions that were previously reserved for guests of the Empress Dowager. Imperial Chinese intricacies are abundant, including Ming Dynasty-style furniture and a number of private pavilions in the suites. Highlight: The Reflection Pavilion, a peaceful setting with a lotus pond where guests can enjoy drinks and cigars. Aman at Summer Palace, 1 Gongmenqian Street, Summer Palace, Beijing, PRC 100091; +86 10 5987 9999; standard rooms from US$1,050 a night . Mamaison Suite Hotel Pachtuv Palace, Prague, Czech Republic . Once Mozart's temporary home in the Czech capital, the Pachtuv Palace was the residence of Earl Hubert Karel Pachta, who purportedly locked the composer in a room until he finished Don Giovanni. To be fair, there are worse places you can be imprisoned, with each of the hotel's 50 suites restored: frescoes line the ceilings, fireplaces roar in the corner, four-poster beds offer a noble sleep. Highlight: The two gorgeous Baroque-style courtyards, which allow you to escape the city. Mamaison Suite Hotel Pachtuv Palace, Karoliny Světlé 34,  110 00 Praha, Czech Republic; +420 234 705 111; standard rooms from US$180 a night . Hotel Imperial, Vienna, Austria . Built as the Vienna home of Philip of Württemberg, the Hotel Imperial originally housed the prince from 1863 to 1865, until a city planning problem saw him move on. In 1873, an investor bought the property in time for that year's Vienna Expo, converting the numerous halls into individual hotels rooms while retaining many regal touches. Little has changed since, with the palace's 150-year history available to all who stay at the hotel: ornate 19th-century chandeliers, crest-embossed drapes and endless relics. Highlight: The traditional personal butler service, which comes with every suite. Hotel Imperial, Kärntner Ring 16, 1015 Vienna, Austria; +43 1 50 1100; standard rooms from US$630 a night . Hotel Gritti Palace, Venice, Italy . Venice has an endless number of ""palaces"" converted into hotels, but few match up to the opulence of the Gritti. Constructed in the 16th century for the city's ""Doge"" (Duke), it was later used to welcome Vatican ambassadors, before finally being turned into a hotel in the late 1800s. Following a 15-month renovation, the hotel re-opened this spring, with each of its 82 rooms restored with the Renaissance in mind. Highlight: The Explorer's Library, paying homage to the hotel's many literary guests, including Ernest Hemingway and W. Somerset Maugham.

The year is 1356 and the Hundred Years' War ravages on -- the Battle of Poitiers has just taken place and Edward the Black Prince has captured the King of France, Jean le Bon, imprisoning him in a castle keep in the Loire Valley. Jump forward nearly 700 years and that keep still stands as part of the privately owned Chateau de Saint-Loup hotel. Guests are treated to a truly medieval experience, with accommodation choices in the gorgeous 17th-century chateau, in the 12th-century tower square or within the keep itself. Highlight: The appropriately named Black Prince suite, with such medieval touches as his-and-her baths and a granite fireplace. Chateau de Saint-Loup, 79600 Saint-Loup-Lamairé  France; +33 5 49 64 81 73; standard rooms from US$150 a night . Amberley Castle, Sussex, England . Dating back more than 900 years, Amberley Castle was once owned by Queen Elizabeth I. Today, the castle incorporates 19 spacious yet traditional suites, a tennis court and a golf course. Battlement towers previously used to keep watch on the numerous conflicts in the area still keep watch, and an 18-meter high wall still stands. Highlight: The still-working portcullis, which is closed every night just past the stroke of midnight. Amberley Castle, Amberley, Arundel, West Sussex BN18 9LT; +44 017 9883 1992; standard rooms from US$830 a night . Ciragan Palace Kempinski, Istanbul . Considering Istanbul's strife-torn history, it's almost a miracle the Ciragan Palace has survived. It housed two separate sultans during its lifetime, before a great fire destroyed much of the site in the early 1900s. A 1989 effort restored its original architecture as a hotel complex. It's now run by the Kempinski Hotels group and a recent 2007 renovation has seen even more palatial features reinstated. Highlight: The Sultan Suite -- at more than US$41,400 (plus 8% VAT) a night -- is one of the most expensive suites in the world.

Built in the late 1700s exclusively for a powerful Dutch consul, before being sold to the Marquis of Marialva, Lisbon's Palace de Seteais is a grand escape located in the UNESCO World Heritage town of Sintra. Considered a national monument, the entire first floor of the palace is open to the public, with reception halls, salons and other areas containing a number of frescoes and tapestries. The second floor holds the 30 guest rooms, each retaining the palace's 18th-century style through antique furnishings and immense space.

A true sign of Russia's luxurious dreams, the Lion Palace is the Four Seasons' first hotel in Russia. Originally built in the 19th century for the exquisitely named Princess Cleopatra Lobonova-Rostovskaya, it spent much of its life as upscale apartments for her royal friends and family, before falling into a state of disrepair in the 1900s. Re-opened just last month, the hotel has regained its palatial status, with its central location and majestic rooms transporting guests back to Tsarist Russia. Highlight: The granite grand staircase, which leads to the Presidential suite and has been recreated with the nearby Hermitage and Winter Palace in mind.

"Washington (CNN) -- The mood among American conservatives is now one of apocalyptic despair. Having convinced themselves that this election arrayed freedom against tyranny, they now must wonder: Did their country just democratically vote in favor of tyranny? On Fox News election night, Bill O'Reilly explained the meaning of the election: The ""white establishment"" was now outnumbered by minorities. ""The demographics are changing. It's not a traditional America anymore."" And these untraditional Americans ""want stuff. They want things. And who is going to give them things? President Obama. He knows it, and he ran on it."" O'Reilly's analysis is echoed across the conservative blogosphere. The (non-white) takers now outnumber the (white) makers. They will use their majority to pillage the makers and redistribute to the takers. In the process, they will destroy the sources of the country's wealth and end the American experiment forever. You'll hear O'Reilly's view echoed wherever conservatives express themselves. Happily, the view is wrong, and in every respect. America is not a society divided between ""makers"" and ""takers."" Instead, almost all of us proceed through a life cycle where we sometimes make and sometimes take as we pass from schooling to employment to retirement. Opinion: Election a call for purple politics . The line between ""making"" and ""taking"" is not a racial line. The biggest government program we have, Medicare, benefits a population that is 85% white. President Barack Obama was not re-elected by people who want to ""take."" The president was re-elected by people who want to work -- and who were convinced, rightly or wrongly, that the president's policies were more likely to create work than were the policies advocated by my party. The United States did not vote for socialism. It could not do so, because neither party offers socialism. Both parties champion a free enterprise economy cushioned by a certain amount of social insurance. The Democrats (mostly) want more social insurance; the Republicans want less. National politics is a contest to move the line of scrimmage, in a game where there's no such thing as a forward pass, only a straight charge ahead at the defensive line. To gain three yards is a big play. Whatever you think of the Obama record, it's worth keeping in mind that by any measure, free enterprise has been winning the game for a long, long time to this point. Compare the United States of 2012 with the United States of 1962. Leave aside the obvious points about segregation and discrimination, and look only at the economy. In 1962, the government regulated the price and route of every airplane, every freight train, every truck and every merchant ship in the United States. The government regulated the price of natural gas. It regulated the interest on every checking account and the commission on every purchase or sale of stock. Owning a gold bar was a serious crime that could be prosecuted under the Trading with the Enemy Act. The top rate of income tax was 91%. Opinion: How progress is possible in second term . It was illegal to own a telephone. Phones had to be rented from the giant government-regulated monopoly that controlled all telecommunications in the United States. All young men were subject to the military draft and could escape only if they entered a government-approved graduate course of study. The great concern of students of American society -- of liberals such as David Riesman, of conservatives such as Russell Kirk and of radicals such as Dwight Macdonald -- was the country's stultifying, crushing conformity. Even if you look only at the experiences of white heterosexual men, the United States of 2012 is a freer country in almost every way than the United States of 1962. Obama has changes in mind that conservatives and Republicans will oppose. He will want to raise taxes; he will want to sustain social spending at a permanently higher level; he has in mind new regulations over health care, energy production and banking. He'll win some; he'll lose some. To the extent that his wins prove injurious, future Republican Congresses and administrations will struggle to undo them. That's politics: a contest that never ends and in which the only certainty is the certainty of constant change. The Republican challenge next is to reassemble a new coalition for limited government and private enterprise. That coalition must include Americans of all ethnicities. To assume from the start that only certain ethnicities will contribute, and that others aspire only to grab, is not only ugly prejudice; it is also self-destructive delusion. Opinion: Vote over, but election dysfunction remains . People of all backgrounds want to create, save and contribute to society. A party of the center-right should make them all feel at home, regardless of how they pronounce their last name, the complexion of their skin or the way in which they express love and build family. The Roman Catholic Church deems despair a mortal sin. To abandon hope is to reject the reality of goodness and to forswear future action. The United States is a great and good country, and it remains great and good even when we do not get all our own way politically. The United States is a tolerant and free country, which means that there are no ""tipping points"" beyond which it becomes impossible to correct mistakes. Fifty years ago, Marxism was still a live intellectual force in British universities. Marxists taught that human society must inevitably evolve into a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat. The great British conservative historian Hugh Trevor-Roper scoffed at this arrogance. He said, ""When radicals scream that victory is indubitably theirs, sensible conservatives knock them on the nose. It is only very feeble conservatives who take such words as true and run round crying for the last sacraments."" We need more sensible conservatives. As for the feeble conservatives, they should take a couple of aspirin and then stay quietly indoors until the temper has subsided and they are ready to say and do something useful again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says conservatives are brooding over the loss of the election .
He says some see it as the whites being outnumbered by minorities who want handouts .
Frum: Obama was not re-elected by people who wanted to take but by those who want to work .
Both parties favor social programs to varying degrees, he says, but socialism not in offing ."

"(CNN) -- Kenyan intelligence knows him simply as Ikrima. But his full name is Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, and he is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab. U.S. officials say Ikrima was the target of a raid Saturday by U.S. Navy SEALs on an Al-Shabaab compound near the town of Baraawe in Somalia. It's believed that he escaped after the U.S. troops came under heavy fire. Ikrima, thought to be in his late 20s, is wanted by both the Kenyan government and its Western allies and was a close associate of one of al Qaeda's most important operatives in East Africa. A recent Kenyan intelligence report that was leaked just after the Westgate mall attack in Nairobi outlined several plots in which he was allegedly involved. All of them involved targets in Kenya, and all the attacks would have involved Kenyan citizens trained by Al-Shabaab. Among those conspiracies, according to the leaked report, was a planned attack on Mandera airport in Kenya's North Eastern province. Ikrima was ""directing an attack targeted at Mandera airport between 25th and 28th April 2013,"" according to the report. He was ""being assisted by Liif, an Al-Shabaab explosive expert,"" and the attack would have involved 11 terrorists. Wife: Terror suspect had left al Qaeda . Another plot -- in 2011 -- involved dispatching one operative to a safe house in Nairobi whose mission was ""to train youth, lay down the infrastructure for a major attack and await instructions."" That individual was later arrested at a house said to have contained grenades, rifles and ammunition. The Kenyan report also alleged that one of Ikrima's most ambitious conspiracies had been sanctioned by al Qaeda in Pakistan. It envisioned multiple attacks in Kenya at the end of 2011 and in early 2012 targeting the Kenyan parliament, United Nations offices in Nairobi and Kenyan politicians. There was also ""financial and logistical support from a South African facilitation network."" It's not clear whether Ikrima had any role in the Westgate attack, but given the involvement of some Kenyans in the siege, it seems likely. Ikrima has been at the forefront of Al-Shabaab's efforts to recruit and train Kenyans and other foreigners for Al-Shabaab -- and to develop a Kenyan affiliate called al Hijrah. Terror leader 'ruthless', 'secretive' Kenyan officials have said that he regularly traveled between Somalia and Kenya, and was in Kenya at one point last year. At least one of the plots he directed involved South Africans. Sources say Ikrima regularly changes his appearance -- at one point having very long hair, and at another a moustache similar to former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's. Morten Storm, a former informant who has worked for several Western intelligence agencies, has told CNN that he developed a close relationship with an Al-Shabaab figure called Ikrima between 2008 and 2012. He said he is confident that it's the same person who was targeted over the weekend. Storm, who is Danish, described Ikrima as a Somali-Kenyan Al-Shabaab operative who had spent time in Norway. He said that Ikrima made clear to him via e-mail that he was ready to send recruits from the West back home from Somalia to launch attacks. Norwegian journalist Bent Skjaerstad told CNN his sources have confirmed that Ikrima had indeed spent time in Norway and had tried to recruit for Al-Shabaab in Europe. Skjaerstad, who reports on security and terrorism for TV2, said Ikrima had lived there between 2004 and 2008. He had failed to gain asylum status but had been given Norwegian travel papers. Skjaerstad told CNN that according to his sources, Ikrima had traveled to Somalia while living in Norway and had used about a dozen aliases. ""There was a connection to Ikrima in a court case in Sweden of two Swedish nationals of Somali descent who were accused of participating in terrorist training in Somalia,"" Skjaerstad said. ""There was phone surveillance introduced as evidence in the trial in which the two men discussed Ikrima. They spoke of him as their contact when they arrived in Kenya from Sweden,"" he said. Bergen: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . Storm, who no longer works underground, has shown CNN encrypted e-mails he exchanged with Ikrima over a period of several years. Those communications show that Ikrima was involved in developing contacts between members of Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen. They included contacts between Ikrima and the America-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. missile attack in September 2011. This relationship was a source of great concern to Western intelligence agencies as it evolved in 2009-11, because it linked the most active and dangerous al Qaeda affiliate -- AQAP -- with an emerging terror group in Somalia, a country with an extremely weak government. One e-mail from al-Awlaki to Storm, dated December 12, 2009, said: ""The brs (brothers) here eagerly want to establish connections with Somalia so these brs could be a start,"" a reference to Ikrima and others. Storm replied: ""Ikrima from Somalia is still waiting for your questions, he just told me, that he is planning to come over to your place with some other guys."" It's not over, Somali terrorists say after mall attack that killed 67 . Ikrima established contact with al-Awlaki but never ended up making the trip to meet him in Yemen, according to Storm. Instead, he stayed in East Africa, traveling between Kenya and Somalia, and becoming a key handler for foreigners, including Westerners who wanted to join Al-Shabaab, Storm said. In March 2012, Ikrima warned Storm of growing pressure from the Kenyan security apparatus. ""So you need to be extra carefull (sic) they dont get a single trace of anything coz they are now tracing a sister who was a widow of one of the london 7/7 bomber,"" he wrote, a reference to Samantha Lewthwaite, who is believed still to be in Kenya and is wanted by Kenyan authorities. Storm told CNN that in 2012, he was offered a substantial sum to help Western intelligence agencies find Ikrima, known to his handlers at that point as Ikrima al Muhajir. He said Ikrima was in Kismayo, Somalia, when they last communicated in mid-2012, shortly before Kenyan forces pushed Al-Shabaab out of the port city. One of Ikrima's associates was Abdelkadir Warsame, who was detained by the U.S. military while crossing by sea from Yemen to Somalia in April 2011. Warsame had been involved in establishing training and weapons transfers with AQAP. Another close associate of Ikrima, according to Storm, was Jehad Serwan Mostafa, an American Al-Shabaab operative still at large. The United States has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. Intelligence sources say Ikrima is thought to have first gone to Somalia in 2006 and subsequently worked for two Kenyans prominent in Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda: Harun Fazul and Saleh Nabhan. Nabhan was a senior Kenyan al Qaeda operative, and he was among the U.S. government's most wanted terrorists. He was suspected of helping to orchestrate the 1998 East Africa Embassy bombings, a 2002 bombing on a Mombasa resort, and a near simultaneous failed missile attack on an Israeli airliner taking off from Mombasa's airport. Ikrima became one of his trusted insiders, according to Storm. Nabhan was killed in a raid by U.S. special operations forces on a convoy traveling south along Somalia's coastal road in September 2009. A younger relative of Nabhan, Omar Nabhan, was among the gunmen killed at Westgate, Kenyan authorities say. If Ikrima survived the weekend attack by U.S. special operations forces and is able to continue operating, Kenyan authorities will be concerned about his ability to continue developing al Hijrah cells in the slums of Nairobi and Mombasa, Kenya. A Kenyan expert on the group, Robert Ocholar, tells CNN that Kenyan security services have driven al Hijrah underground but in the process made the group more unpredictable and dangerous. Ocholar says he was made aware in 2011 of a camp in Kenya's Eastern Province used by Al-Shabaab as staging ground for recruits going to Somalia. Ocholar says that in Kenya, there is more radicalization among young Muslim Kenyans than among the sizable Somali community. That in part may be down to the activities of Ikrima, aka Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed.","Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed was target of raid Saturday by U.S. Navy SEALs, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan authorities on Wednesday announced additional arrests in connection with a massive shipment of cocaine in an Air France flight from Caracas that landed in Paris. In a prepared statement, the Venezuelan Attorney General's Office said 17 people have been arrested in the drug trafficking case. The flight originated at Simon Bolivar International Airport in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. An Air France executive in Venezuela, six airline employees, a security guard and a loading platform supervisor are among those arrested. Eight members of the Venezuelan national guard are also in custody and were scheduled to appear in front of a judge Wednesday afternoon for a preliminary hearing. On September 11, French authorities discovered 1.3 tons of pure cocaine stuffed inside 30 suitcases on the flight. The colorful bags did not match any of the passengers on board, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. The street value of the stash is about 200 million euros, or $270 million. $2.6 million in cocaine found in British woman's luggage . French authorities didn't publicize the find until Saturday. Venezuela's Public Ministry announced the arrests of three of the national guard members Sunday. Woman busted in Spain for cocaine in breast implants . Authorities worked with Spanish, British and Dutch police on the investigation, BFMTV said. This case ""illustrates the importance of strengthening International cooperation in the fight against traffickers,"" French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said. Suspected drug smugglers sail to jail . In Venezuela, authorities promised a swift investigation as soon as the confiscation was announced in Paris. All 17 arrests were made in less than three days. Venezuelan Interior and Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres told reporters in Venezuela that authorities think an organized crime group with Italian and British members is responsible for the shipment. ""The suitcases were not taken into the plane through the regular baggage platforms at the airport. We're investigating how the drug (shipment) got to the airport,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A new CNN poll confirms that we're witnessing a quiet reversal in the character of our two major parties. Traditionally, Republicans have always coalesced around the conventional wisdom front-runner for president. Conservatives respect structure, order and party brand names. Not for nothing was the name Nixon, Bush or Dole on the GOP presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004. In contrast, Democrats have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand, rising from obscurity to the White House -- think Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. But a fresh-out-of-the-oven CNN presidential poll shows a fractured GOP field of newcomers with no clear front-runner while the Democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own: Hillary Clinton. Opinion: GOP strategy on shutdown courts doom . Yes, it is pathetically early to be projecting on the 2016 presidential campaign. Predictive capacity hovers somewhere near zero, and time fixated on polls would be productively used thinking about the 2014 midterms or the fights over the debt ceiling looming over our divided, dysfunctional Congress. But as a snapshot of the underlying dynamics driving the two parties, this new poll is worth a look. On the GOP side of the aisle, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie narrowly leads the fractured field at 17%, one point above Rep. Paul Ryan, best known as Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate. In the old days, the previous vice presidential nominee would be the future favorite. But that doesn't seem to be the case for Ryan, who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the Romney campaign. Traditionally, the governor of blue state New Jersey wouldn't be on the GOP radar at all, but Christie -- cruising to a landslide re-election -- seems to be the exception to this and other rules. Next on the list is Rand Paul, the scion of an outsider libertarian movement sparked by his dad's multiple runs for president. But the compelling and controversial one-time eye doctor is a first-term senator from Kentucky, far from your typical presidential timber. Perhaps most interesting is the second tier of GOP candidates. Jeb Bush seems settled in at 10%, despite brand name and legendary brand loyalty. Two Hispanic senate Republicans, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, come in next at 9% and 7% respectively. And then, at the bottom of the barrel, come two 2012 aspirants: Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Far from being strengthened by their 2012 campaigns, these two candidates seem weakened by the experience. Rick Perry's ""oops"" heard round the world still resonates while Santorum's strident social conservatism doesn't seem to be taken seriously by 95% of the party faithful. Strange days. Obama pressures conservative Republicans over possible shutdown . The real news is on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton has accumulated a towering 55 percentage point lead over her next closest competitor, Vice President Joe Biden, who is at 10% and doesn't exactly lack name recognition. Below Biden are first-term Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6% and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley -- perhaps the most openly ambitious of the bunch -- at 2%. Clinton's dominance illustrates an interesting dynamic. Six years ago, she was a far more polarizing figure among Democrats (and independents). Today, after her service as secretary of state, she seems more qualified and less polarizing, transcending her association with the culture of wars concurrent with Bubba's two terms in office. Tough and experienced, Clinton is now positioned as a candidate who rivals Obama's 2007 surge. She will also be positioned as the candidate of the 51%, compelling to women of all ages and even possibly competitive among Republican women in this incarnation. Uncle Joe Biden is well liked by the rank and file, but there doesn't seem to be much of a stampede to put him on the top of the ticket. Warren's strength comes from fascination with the new and represents the growing strength of the liberal base in the party. And while successful governors like Cuomo and O'Malley have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates, the party faithful don't seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment. If Clinton does not run for some reason, Democrats will quickly wake up to the awkward fact that they have almost no depth of the bench after two Obama terms. So there you have it: Democrats are behaving like Republicans, falling in line behind the big brand name dominating a race that is still three years away. And Republicans are behaving like Democrats, putting forward a fractured field with no clear front-runners but elevating a New Jersey governor, a Wisconsin congressman and a Kentucky senator to the front of the pack. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: A new CNN poll shows a reversal in the character of two major parties .

"Washington (CNN) -- The hundreds of thousands of typhoon victims in the Philippines need help, and they need it now, the U.S. Marine Corps general in charge of the U.S. military relief effort says. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy told CNN he needs immediate dispatch of U.S. Navy amphibious ships that carry equipment to produce potable water and the variety of helicopters, small boats, trucks and other supplies needed in the relief effort. ""They are the Swiss army knife of the U.S. military,"" Kennedy said of the amphibious ships, speaking to CNN in a telephone interview from the Philippines. The Pentagon appeared to be heeding his call. Two U.S. Navy amphibious ships are now sailing from their home base in Sasebo, Japan, to Okinawa, where they will pick up Marines and continue on to the Philippines, a U.S. military official said Tuesday evening. Three warships that are home-ported in the Pacific are also under orders to prepare to deploy in the next 48 hours, a senior Pentagon official told CNN. Pentagon press secretary George Little said the military is working hard to give Kennedy whatever he needs. He said 250 U.S. service members are now in the Philippines, and they have delivered 107,000 pounds of relief supplies. How to help survivors . Kennedy said the most crucial need right now is to provide shelter for the tens of thousands of displaced people, as well as food, water and sanitation. The situation is so dire there may not even be enough time or capability to fly in portable toilets, and human waste might have to be burned in place, he said. While U.S. Marines are on the ground providing aid and more U.S. military help has been dispatched, Kennedy said more help is urgently needed. ""The rest of the world needs to get mobilized, the rest of the donor community,"" he told NBC News. ""A week from now will be too late. "" ""We can't wait,"" said Martin Romualdez, a Philippines congressman. ""People have gone three days without any clean water, food and medication,"" he told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""People are getting desperate."" Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on Friday as one of the most powerful storms recorded. By Tuesday, officials had counted 1,774 deaths from the storm. Authorities had said Haiyan may have taken as many as 10,000 lives, but Philippines President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday that the death toll would more likely be about 2,000 or 2,500 people. Projected death toll falls, but tensions rise amid aid bottlenecks . With wind gusts well above 200 mph and a massive storm surge, the storm displaced at least 800,000 people, the United Nations said Tuesday. More than 2 million people need food aid, the Philippine government said. Compounding relief efforts Tuesday was a new tropical low, Zoraida, which has dumped 4 inches of rain in some of the hard-hit areas. That makes the amphibious ships Kennedy has asked for even more vital. The amphibious ships have tracked ""assault amphibious vehicles"" that can carry supplies and move over and through piles of debris to distribution points where aid is needed most. Typhoon Haiyan: 'The one building that survived the storm' The Pentagon has dispatched the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which was visiting Hong Kong, to the disaster area. Two cruisers, three destroyers and a supply ship are joining the carrier for the mission, Little said. ""The George Washington can produce more than 400,000 gallons of fresh water per day. As you know, and as a reminder, a U.S. Navy carrier, the USS Lincoln, supported tsunami relief operations in 2004 in the Pacific, providing much needed capabilities to operations ashore,"" Little said. The U.S. military relief effort will take supplies to distribution points, but those supplies will be then handed out by Philippines forces, Kennedy said. Local forces are in the best position to know community leaders and make sure those in the most need are getting the help, he added. As of Tuesday night in the Philippines, lights and radars were being assembled at the airport in Tacloban, at the heart of the disaster zone, and the facility was expected to be running full day and nighttime operations within 24 hours, he said.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese rescuers on Tuesday found 14 fishermen alive and recovered the bodies of two who had died from boats that sank during a typhoon, authorities said. Fifty-eight fishermen remain missing from the three boats that went down in the South China Sea roughly 300 kilometers from the Chinese island of Hainan, the local government said Tuesday. Twenty-two ships and four planes are combing the area for the missing men, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported, citing Hainan maritime authorities. Rescue operations have been hampered by strong gales and rough seas. Two of the vessels foundered Sunday afternoon as they battled gales, and the third one sank Monday morning. A total of five fishing boats with 171 crew aboard were caught in the storm, the Hainan Maritime Search and Rescue Center said, according to Xinhua. The two other vessels managed to survive the harsh conditions. All three boats that sank were from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Fourteen of the fishermen were rescued on Monday. President Xi Jinping on Monday urged local authorities to do their utmost to find the missing or stranded and minimize casualties, state media reported. Xi also ordered the armed forces and central government departments to help in the rescue effort. The storm affecting the region, Typhoon Wutip, made landfall in central Vietnam late Monday, weakening as it moved inland. Three people have been killed as a result of the storm, the state-run Vietnam News Agency reported Tuesday, citing the regional center for flood and storm prevention.

"(CNN) -- Chemists used to use balls and sticks to make models to help them understand how molecules worked. That has vastly changed. On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in chemistry rewarded three scientists for work leading to the computer programs used today to precisely calculate how very complex molecules work. Accomplishments by chemists Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel have enabled programs to even predict the outcomes of very complex chemical reactions. As a result, computers have become just as important in chemistry labs as test tubes, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said when announcing the prize. Slow motion . The exact mechanics of a chemical reaction are hard to observe in the laboratory. ""Molecules are lazy creatures. Most of the time they don't do anything,"" said Gunnar Karlstrom from the Royal Academy. ""They just swing around and don't do anything, and then suddenly, when they react, everything goes quick, like that."" New computer programs allow scientists to make models of these speedy reactions and study them at a slower pace, he said. The three scientists combined the principles of traditional Newtonian physics, which has the advantage of being simple, with quantum physics, which is much more complex but also much more accurate, because it deals with what goes on at a subatomic level. That has resulted in programs that are simple to use but also highly accurate. Predictions made by the programs eliminate the need for some lab testing. For example, they help reduce the necessity of testing a new drug on animals, Karlstrom said. Karplus researches at Harvard University and at the University of Strasbourg in France. Levitt is based at Stanford University Medical School, and Warshel is based at the University of Southern California. All three were born in other countries. They received the Nobel Prize jointly and will split the prize money of 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million). 'God particle' theorists receive Nobel Prize in physics . Last year . Two American scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2012 for their work revealing protein receptors that tell cells what is going on in and around the human body. Their achievements have allowed drugmakers to develop medication with fewer side effects. Research spanning four decades by Robert J. Lefkowitz and Brian K. Kobilka on ""G-protein-coupled receptors"" has increased understanding of how cells sense chemicals in the bloodstream and external stimuli such as light, said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awarded the prize. This week . Two Americans and a German shared this year's Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine Monday. Americans James E. Rothman and Randy W. Schekman, and German Thomas C. Sudhof were honored for discoveries of how the body's cells decide when and where to deliver the molecules they produce. And on Tuesday, two men who predicted the existence of the Higgs boson particle 50 years before its discovery took the prize for physics -- Francois Englert of Belgium and Peter Higgs of the United Kingdom. Higgs and Englert's theories of the elusive particle explained what gives matter its mass and played a key role in completing scientists' understanding of the nature of all matter. Nobel medical prize goes to 2 Americans, 1 German . Nobel history . Since 1901, the Nobel Committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in chemistry 105 times. In certain years, mainly during World Wars I and II, no prize in chemistry was awarded. The youngest recipient was Frederic Joliot, who won in 1935 at the age of 35. The oldest chemistry laureate was John B. Fenn, who was 85 when he received the prize in 2002. Frederic Sanger was the only scientist to win the chemistry prize twice for his work related to the structure of proteins and DNA. There is a fine line between the science of chemistry and the fields of physics and biology. Famed female scientist Marie Curie of France, for example, won Nobel honors for her work in radiophysics in 1903 and again in 1911 for discoveries in radiochemistry. The committee also will announce prizes in literature, peace and economics in the coming days. Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel created the prizes in 1895 to honor work in physics, chemistry, literature and peace. The first economics prize was awarded in 1969.

"(CNN) -- Three correctional officers in Pennsylvania have been accused of organizing inmate fights and rewarding the victors with food and coffee, according to Pennsylvania State Police. York County Prison correctional officers David Whitcomb, 28, Mark Haynes, 26 and Daniel Graff, 37, were charged with official oppression and harassment on Friday after a state police investigation, Pennsylvania State Trooper Robert Hicks told CNN. The investigation into the alleged incidents began after video surveillance showing Haynes and Whitcomb grabbing an inmate by his back and neck was discovered during an unrelated investigation. A captain then asked the inmate involved to provide a written statement about the event, the state police report said. The inmate, David Wright, 27, wrote that officers Whitcomb, Haynes and Graff had arranged for him to fight another inmate, James Hicks, 27. Wright won the fight and was rewarded with extra lounge food and coffee, according to a state police report. The state police report also said that officers also told Wright that they would give him lounge food if he permitted them to punch him in the leg and arm. Graff reportedly also sprayed pepper-foam in Wright's face in exchange for coffee, though Wright reported that he never received more lounge food or coffee, according to the report. Like Wright, James Hicks also was given food in exchange for letting the officers punch and choke him, police said. Additionally, James Hicks told investigators that the three officers challenged him to perform tasks such as drinking a gallon of milk in an hour, eating a spoonful of cinnamon, snorting a line of spicy vegetable Ramen noodle powder and drinking water with pepper foam in it. James Hicks wrote that the correctional officers called their challenges the ""Retard Olympics."" He said that the acts were consensual and that he was rewarded with food, the report said. Despite the professed consent of the participating inmates, the officers were still charged after an investigation that found ""sufficient evidence"" of their misconduct,"" Trooper Hicks told CNN. ""Even though it was consensual, correctional officers were still using the power of their position. They controlled the distribution of the food and the coffee, and they were using them to entice the inmates to engage in these activities,"" Trooper Hicks said. The incidents allegedly occurred between January and July, the state police report states. All three correctional officers have been placed on administrative leave, Trooper Hicks said. CNN's attempts to reach Whitcomb, Haynes and Graff were unsuccessful. It is unclear whether the three men have hired attorneys. No court date has yet been set, Trooper Hicks said.

"(CNN) -- I remember a chalk line drawn on blacktop by a group of kids at recess when I was young. The message was clear: This is the line you do not cross. If you stepped over it, you would face the wrath of those kids in whatever game we were playing. Now turn that line crimson and color it toxic. This is the adult version of ""do not cross."" This is the infamous red line. We first heard about it in terms of Syria a year ago. President Barack Obama said that the use of chemical weapons by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad would cross a ""red line"" that would have ""enormous consequences."" As chemical weapons were deployed in Syria in August, Obama's tripwire was triggered. Then Obama told reporters: ""First of all, I didn't set a red line. The world set a red line."" When Obama says ""the world"" did it, he was indicating that much of the world long ago decided chemical weapons were an abhorrent thing to unleash in war. More than 160 countries signed a treaty attesting to this view. But why has ""the world set"" this one line in the blacktop, and not others? The United States and its allies ignore the violation of treaties all the time. They ignore the use of other terrible weapons in global conflicts daily. As someone who grew up wondering why we intervened in Bosnia but not Rwanda, as someone who directs a project on rape in war, I want to know: How do we decide what suffering matters enough to get a red line? At the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege project, we've been keeping a live crowdmap of sexualized violence in Syria. I've personally reported multiple stories of rape in which women were hung by their wrists or burned. We've also documented how hundreds of thousands of women have been raped in 16 years of fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Yet Congress is not debating whether to intervene in Congo. It is not struggling over what to do about the rape and torture of women and men in Syria or anywhere else. Why? Here's one gut-wrenching answer: . ""People divide their understanding of militarized violence into normal and not normal, acceptable and not acceptable,"" says Yifat Susskind, executive director of women's human rights organization MADRE. Susskind argues that violence against women has been ""normalized,"" especially in Africa. ""World leaders, like representatives in Congress, have turned a blind eye to the violence in DRC for a simple reason: It does not disturb their preconceived notions about where violence is normal,"" she says. If this statement makes my heart hurt, I'm not sure I can imagine what it means to the people of Congo. I spoke to Eve Ensler, the founder of V-Day. She conceived of the City of Joy, which empowers survivors of sexualized violence, and built it with the women of Congo. Just returned from there, Ensler says she witnessed a kind of dismay about the recent U.S. response to Syria's use of chemical weapons. ""Although the Congolese I spoke to felt great empathy for the Syrians, they felt confused by the U.S.'s immediate and overwhelming reaction when -- after 16 years and 8 million people dead -- they have been waiting and demanding that the U.S. stop supporting Rwanda,"" she says. Ensler and others have long argued that the United States reconsider its relationship with Rwanda, which they say supports the rebel militia M23, one of the main perpetrators of atrocities in Congo. They are pushing for the opposite of military intervention -- they want a political intervention based on human rights violations. ""For how many years have we been banging on the doors of the White House, saying thousands and thousands of women have been raped?"" she asks. Unlike the obvious effects of chemical weapons use, the fallout of rape is often invisible: It doesn't always leave marks, and it is so heavily stigmatized we don't see how it psychologically, and physically, tears women apart. With chemical weapons, gases seep in an indiscriminate cloud and infect whoever is in their path. They've been called ""weapons of mass destruction in slow motion,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. Lewis argues that ""the goal is to have a world in which people don't settle for disputes with violence,"" but he recognizes that ""we're a way off"" from such a day. ""We still need to prevent a world that uses the very worst weapons,"" he says. But ""worst"" is subjective. ""There's a hierarchy of sensation around weaponry,"" Ensler says. ""But in my mind chemical weapons and mass rape are both weapons of mass destruction."" You could argue that the United States gets involved in wars based on careful geopolitics. You could argue, as many do, that the United States intervened in Bosnia because there was a politically viable solution on the table. You could say we stayed out of Rwanda because it was ""messy."" It's a nasty kind of calculus, this business of deciding the red line of intervention, of what kind of pain matters most. Ultimately, however, it may not be as complicated as it first appears. ""Do the people at risk matter to the people in power?"" Susskind asks. ""Does intervention serve the political aims of the powerful? In that calculation, human rights fall far behind.""

"(CNN) -- Negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions may have stalled in Switzerland this weekend, but the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency is optimistic about a new agreement struck with Tehran. The International Atomic Energy Agency signed a cooperation deal with Iran on Monday. It will give the IAEA greater access to long-unseen nuclear sites, including a heavy-water reactor in Arak, the very site that may have tripped up the Geneva talks. Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the agreement signified a new willingness by Tehran to cooperate with the IAEA. ""The atmosphere is very different, the meeting was very constructive,"" he said in an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""This is an important step, but this is a first step, and much more needs to be done."" He said the deal would take a step by step approach to solving problems, bearing in mind the complications in dealing with the Iranian nuclear issue. Amano said Iran and the IAEA have agreed to focus on six practical measures that would be implemented in a three-month time line. ""The joint statement says Iran and IAEA agree to resolve all present and past issues,"" Amano said. ""Issues that are not included in the first step will be addressed in the subsequent steps."" The IAEA's talks with Iran are separate from the big power diplomacy, he said, referring to the recent nuclear talks between world powers and Iran in Switzerland, which disintegrated on Sunday. Hopes for a deal had soared after top diplomats rushed to Geneva, but then faded amid divisions among the P5+1 countries. Representatives from Iran and those six countries are scheduled to meet again in Geneva on November 20, in another attempt to resolve the decade long dispute. ""Geneva talks and IAEA talks are independent, different and separate,"" Amano said. ""We are focusing on verification and technical issues."" State Department: ""We made significant progress in Geneva"" The IAEA chief has reason to be optimistic, given that this is his first agreement with Iran in years, said Joseph Cirincione, president of Ploughshares Fund, a public grant-making foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution. ""This is for real, these guys are not playing a con game,"" Cirincione said. ""These Iranians are a much more pragmatic group. They want to make a deal, they want to end Iran's isolation. They want to end sanctions. They are willing to make serious concessions."" On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department also sounded upbeat, saying significant progress was made in Geneva. ""The P5+1 is united,"" said Jen Psaki, State Department spokesperson. ""There is still a gap between what language might be appropriate; that the Iranians are prepared to accept."" Iran has always insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Western powers and Israel accuse it of harboring ambitions for a nuclear weapon. Iran's refusal to stop enriching uranium has led to crippling sanctions that have stunted its economy, slashed its crude oil exports and triggered widespread inflation at home. U.S. senators from both parties have pushed for tougher sanctions to increase pressure on Iran even as the Geneva talks showed early signs of promise last week. But the White House warns lawmakers that tightening sanctions on Iran could derail the diplomatic push to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Secretary of State John Kerry will push diplomacy as he heads to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with members of the Senate Banking Committee. Some of the restrictions originated in that Banking Committee. The State Department said Kerry would make it clear that putting new sanctions in place would be a mistake. ""We are still determining if there is a diplomatic path forward,"" Psaki said. ""What we are asking for right now is a pause, a temporary pause, in sanctions. We are not taking away sanctions. We are not rolling them back. This is about ensuring our legislative strategy and our negotiating strategy are running hand in hand."" ""The momentum for this deal is almost irresistible,"" said Cirincione. ""It may not happen November 20. It may take a few more weeks, but it is crystal clear, the majority of P5+1 believe a deal is in our best interest.""

"(CNN) -- Even behind bars, James ""Whitey"" Bulger is causing grief to Massachusetts residents. Court documents released Friday show Bulger's attorneys, J.W. Carney and Hank Brennan, have been approved for more than $2.4 million in costs for representing one of Massachusetts most infamous criminals. According to the court documents, the Bulger defense team submitted vouchers for attorney fees incurred dating back to 2011. The documents also indicate an additional $211,000 is awaiting approval. That would increase the total to nearly $2.7 million. The vouchers submitted cover everything from legal research to travel expenses. One of the individual vouchers submitted by Bulger's defense team was for $166,610 in legal and investigative research. The court documents also indicate that neither Carney nor Brennan have submitted vouchers for the months of July or August. Once these vouchers are submitted, the taxpayers could be on the hook for even more. Man held in death of alleged Bulger extortion victim . A judge decided Bulger met the criteria for a taxpayer-funded attorney when Bulger made the case he couldn't afford an attorney. When authorities searched Bulger's home they discovered an arsenal of weapons and $800,000 in assets that were subsequently frozen. Prosecutors argued before the trial started that Bulger likely had countless funds available to him in secret accounts, but they couldn't persuade the judge. Bulger was arrested in Santa Monica, California, in 2011 after eluding authorities for nearly 16 years. He was found guilty on August 12 of racketeering and was linked to 11 killings that happened between 1973 and 1985. Bulger's sentencing hearing will be November 13 and 14 in Boston's John Joseph Moakley Federal Courthouse. The 83-year-old Bulger faces a maximum sentence of life plus 30 years in prison.","James ""Whitey"" Bulger has been convicted of racketeering and been linked to killings .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The U.S. Navy is moving a warship and a sea-based radar platform closer to the North Korean coast in order to monitor that country's military moves, including possible new missile launches, a Defense Department official said Monday. The decision to move at least one ship, the destroyer USS John S. McCain, and the oil rig-like SBX-1 are the first of what may be other naval deployments, CNN has learned. They follow weeks of belligerent rhetoric from North Korea, including threats to use nuclear weapons. The United States and South Korea have gone ahead with joint military exercises despite the threats, and South Korea warned Monday that any provocative moves from North Korea would trigger a strong response ""without any political considerations."" The United States has bolstered the exercises with shows of force that included overflights by nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers, massive Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters. Read more: Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . ""If there is any provocation against South Korea and its people, there should be a strong response in initial combat without any political considerations,"" South Korean President Park Geun-hye said at a meeting with senior defense and security officials, according to her office. Her comments came after North Korea rattled off fresh volleys of bombastic rhetoric over the weekend, declaring that it had entered a ""state of war"" with the South and labeling the U.S. mainland a ""boiled pumpkin,"" vulnerable to attack. The two Koreas are technically still at war after their conflict in the early 1950s ended in a truce not a peace treaty. The secretive regime of Kim Jong Un has delivered a steady stream of verbal attacks against South Korea and the United States in recent weeks, including the threat of a nuclear strike. It has lashed out at the U.S.-South Korean military drills currently under way and at the tougher U.N. sanctions that were slapped on it after its latest nuclear test in February. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman George Little warned against connecting the ship deployment to recent tensions on the Korean Peninsula. ""I would urge everyone to disconnect this ship deployment from recent military exercises in South Korea. We have regular ship movements in the Asia-Pacific region and we use our ship movements for any number of purposes,"" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Analysts have expressed heavy skepticism that the North has the military capabilities to follow through on many of its melodramatic threats. But concerns remain that it could carry out a localized attack on South Korea, as it did in November 2010 when it shelled Yeongpyeong Island, killing four people. Displays of strength . The United States has sought to show its willingness to defend its South Korean ally by drawing attention to displays of its military strength during the drills taking place in South Korea. Washington's recent announcements concerning practice flights over South Korea by B-52 bombers and B-2 stealth bombers, both of which can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons, have not been lost on Pyongyang, which has described them as acts of U.S. hostility. Read more: N Korea readying rockets to aim at U.S. targets . There was no immediate reaction on North Korean state media Monday to the U.S. statement saying the stealth fighters, F-22 Raptors, were sent to the main U.S. Air Force Base in South Korea to support air drills in the annual Foal Eagle training exercises there. U.S. and South Korean officials have been trying to strike a balance between acknowledging that the North's rhetoric is cause for concern and at the same time playing down the severity of the threat. Park said Monday that she was ""viewing the threat from North Korea in a serious manner."" But a senior U.S. Defense Department official said late last week that there were ""no indications at this point that it's anything more than warmongering rhetoric."" And Little, the Pentagon spokesman said Monday that recent U.S. activities with South Korea ""have been about alliance assurance, about ensuring them that we are there to protect them."" ""We haven't seen any kind of troop movements on the North Korean side that would indicate imminent military action. So we think that things may be dialing down just a bit on the Korean Peninsula, at least we hope so,"" he said. South Korea has noted that scores of its workers have continued in recent days to enter and leave the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North's side of the border. That is despite Pyongyang cutting a key military hotline on the border and threatening to shut down the complex. Read more: Why N Korea regime is scary . Moscow and Beijing call for calm . The heightened tensions have prompted North Korea's traditional allies, China and Russia, to urge the different sides to keep a lid on the situation. ""Moscow expects all parties to exercise as much responsibility and restraint as possible in light of North Korea's latest statements,"" the Russian foreign ministry said Saturday according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. China, which expressed frustration over Pyongyang's most recent nuclear test, also called for calm. ""We hope relevant parties can work together to turn around the tense situation in the region,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Friday, describing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula as ""a joint responsibility."" But the coming weeks appear laced with potential for more bouts of saber-rattling. North Korean delegates are currently gathered in Pyongyang for the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's rubber stamp parliament. And April 15 is the anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. That day, the biggest national holiday in North Korea, is usually marked by large-scale parades. Meanwhile, the U.S.-South Korean military exercises that have already stirred so much ire from the North are due to continue until the end of the month. Some analysts have noted that Pyongyang has carried out some sort of military provocation within weeks of every South Korean presidential inauguration. Park, the current president, took office on February 25, five weeks ago. ""You can't put it past them the idea that they are ... trying to establish a new equilibrium in which they are accepted as a nuclear weapons state,"" Victor Cha, former director of Asian affairs for the U.S. National Security Council and now a Georgetown University professor, said about North Korea. CNN's Barbara Starr reported from Washington. K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from South Korea.","A Pentagon spokesman warns against connecting ship deployment to recent tensions .

"(CNN) -- A few weeks before James DiMaggio allegedly kidnapped Hannah Anderson, his sister said she told him that the 16-year-old girl was ""trouble"" and that he needed to ""watch out."" In a sometimes contentious interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night, Lora DiMaggio held out the possibly that her brother was a victim, saying there were ""a lot of holes"" in the case. ""It's very hard to believe that someone who was just so genuine and so dependable every single solitary day just woke up one day and decided to do this,"" she said. Instead, she cast doubt on Anderson. ""I remember very vividly telling my brother, 'She's trouble,'"" she said. ""I said, 'You need to watch out for that one.'"" James DiMaggio allegedly kidnapped Hannah on August 4. Police later found the bodies of her mother and brother at his burned home, about an hour east of San Diego. A police affidavit claims that mother Christina Anderson and brother Ethan had been ""tortured and killed"" by James DiMaggio before he set his home and garage ablaze. After evading authorities for a week, he was spotted in the Idaho wilderness on August 10, nearly 1,000 miles from where the alleged kidnapping occurred. An FBI agent shot him dead, and Hannah was returned to her family in Southern California. Lora DiMaggio maintained that, despite the evidence presented by police, it wasn't clear her brother had done anything wrong . ""The only evidence that has come forward at this point is the fact the two bodies were found on his property,"" she said. ""There's a lot of missing information. I have yet to see any solid evidence."" Sister: DiMaggio was protecting Hannah . Lora DiMaggio said her brother may have come to the aid of Hannah. ""In my heart of hearts, I think that Hannah perhaps got herself into a situation that she couldn't get herself out of, and I do believe that my brother gave his life to protect her,"" she said. Lora DiMaggio didn't explain what situation she thought the teen was in or why she needed protection. Hannah was seen with James DiMaggio in his car about 20 hours before he allegedly set fire to his house, police said. The two were in his blue Nissan Versa just after midnight August 4, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said. They were spotted at a U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint, according to authorities. They didn't say what the two were doing together or whether Hannah was with DiMaggio voluntarily. Phone records indicate the two ""called each other approximately 13 times"" shortly before both their phones were turned off on August 4, a search warrant revealed. In a TV interview with NBC News last week, Hannah said the two texted the day she was abducted because he was supposed to pick her up from cheerleading camp and he needed directions. 'Not the girl that stayed in my home' First Hannah Anderson TV interview: 'My mom raised me to be strong' During the same interview, Hannah described herself as a survivor and thanked those who have supported her. ""In the beginning I was a victim, but now knowing everyone out there is helping me, I consider myself a survivor instead,"" Hannah said. ""My mom raised me to be strong."" Lora DiMaggio told Piers Morgan that she hardly recognized the teen. ""I know that the Hannah Anderson that I saw a few nights ago on the TV is certainly not the girl that stayed in my home three weeks prior to them disappearing,"" she said, but declined to provide specifics. ""I don't know, I don't want to bash anyone,"" she said. ""It's certainly not my intent to come on here and bash anyone."" Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

"(CNN) -- The trek for those traveling through northern Mexico remains dangerous: police rescued 73 people who were being held hostage in the border city of Reynosa. The victims had been kidnapped from buses or bus terminals, and about half were Central Americans, police said. It is likely, though police did not say, that a majority of the victims were migrants on their way north to the United States. Read more: The new Mexico, beyond stereotypes . Some of the kidnap victims were held for as long as four months, Mexico's National Security Commission said in a statement. Federal police on patrol Monday in Reynosa followed a car after its occupants tried to avoid them, the commission said. When the two men in the car pulled up to a house, so did the police. The police approached the house ""from where they could hear cries for help,"" the commission said. Inside the house, police found 73 hostages: 37 Mexicans, 19 Hondurans, 14 Guatemalans, and three Salvadorans, it said. Six minors were among those rescued, the commission said. The Latino footprint in America: 500 years strong . The victims told police that some had been held between four days and four months. The alleged kidnappers made phone calls to the victims' families, demanding ransom payments in exchange for their release, the commission said. Some of the people rescued said they were assaulted or raped, it said. Police arrested the two men in the car who arrived at the house, and a third man who they allege worked as a lookout. Authorities have discovered at least three mass kidnapping operations in and around Reynosa this year. In July, Mexican authorities rescued 81 migrants they said were held captive in Reynosa. And in June, authorities said that in a small town nearby they rescued 165 migrants who were kidnapped as they tried to cross into the United States. The dangers are not limited to the north of the country. In July, authorities in southern state of Chiapas rescued 94 migrants who were crammed into the back of a hauling truck in ""subhuman conditions."" They showed symptoms of asphyxiation and serious lesions on their hands and feet when they were rescued.","Police rescue 73 people from a house in northern Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Two people who thought they were sailing toward a big payday ended up in jail and are suspected of drug smuggling, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Crew members on the Coast Guard cutter Dependable noticed the 49-foot sailing vessel Elegance was ""riding suspiciously low in the water"" in the Atlantic about 500 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on Monday, a Coast Guard news release said. Coast Guard officers, who boarded the Canadian-registered boat after consulting with Canadian authorities, found more than 1,200 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated wholesale value of $20 million, the release said. The two people on the boat were arrested after the contraband tested positive for cocaine, it said. The suspects' names and nationalities were not immediately made public. The Dependable, with the Elegance in tow, suspected smugglers in custody and the cocaine on board, arrived in Boston Friday. While the haul was big, it's just a small part of the Coast Guard's annual cocaine seizures at sea. The Coast Guard has seized 44,000 pounds of cocaine in the previous 12 months, the release said.

"(CNN) -- Four Marines were killed Wednesday during a range maintenance operation at Camp Pendleton in California, the military said. The incident was the deadliest for Pendleton since seven Marines were killed in a February 2012 midair collision between helicopters along the Arizona-California border, said a military spokesman. Six of them were based at Camp Pendleton, California, and the other was from Yuma, Arizona. Their names of the four Marines killed this week weren't immediately released because their families were still being notified, the Marines said. The four Marines were working in a range area used for live-fire exercises, but the deaths didn't occur under such live fire, said a military spokesman who asked not to be identified while the matter is under investigation. The incident could have ""very possibly"" involved unexploded ordnance suddenly detonating, the spokesman said. The range is known as Zulu Black, a Marine spokesman said. The deaths are under investigation, the Marines said. ""We offer our heartfelt prayers and condolences to the families of the Marines lost today in this tragic accident. Our first priority is to provide the families with the support they need during this difficult time,"" Brig. Gen. John W. Bullard, commanding general of Camp Pendleton, said in a statement. In March, seven Marines were killed when a 60mm mortar round exploded at Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada. An investigation revealed that ""the Marines employing one of the mortars did not follow correct procedures, resulting in the detonation of a high explosive round at the mortar position,"" the Marines said in a statement. Three Marines were relieved of their duties after the incident.

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, bookshelves were just for books, a spot to proudly show off your full set of encyclopedias before the advent of Google. These days, homeowners have a more open-minded approach to their shelving. The books are still there, but decorating enthusiasts are using them as elements of decor. HGTV magazine Editor-in-Chief Sara Peterson said that's because finding colorful and affordable home accessories is a lot easier than it used to be. As a result, ""restyling your bookshelves can be a fast makeover that can totally change the look and feel of a room,"" Peterson said. In addition to being a collection of well-loved stories, a stack of books can serve as a base for decorative objects. ""The key to styling out bookshelves is to have a wide variety of objects to play with,"" she said. All different sizes of books, vases, boxes and framed photos bring a bookcase to life. Not only that, but the shelves themselves can be part of the arrangement. ""We're also seeing people line the backs of the bookshelves with wallpaper or even painting the backs, which gives everything on the shelves more of a cohesive look,"" Peterson said. The possibilities seem endless, and therein lies the problem, said e-designer Jana Bek. Communicating via Facetime, phone and e-mail, Bek provides interior designs and blueprints for her clients around the world to implement on their own. When it comes to decorating shelves, the instructions she provides come with an encouragement to be patient. ""Styling bookshelves is always a tricky process,"" Bek said. ""It looks easy but it takes finessing."" It's about balancing the size of the objects placed on the entire bookshelf, she said, paying attention to scale and shape. For example, Bek places larger decorative items on the top and bottom shelves while keeping items with intricate detail on eye level. And since books and picture frames are often rectangular, she breaks up all the angles with other shapes to keep things interesting. Here's what Open House contributors learned about decorating their own bookcases: . -- ""I learned that large bookcases eat up accessories. I had what I thought was more than enough to fill the shelves. It turned out I needed more!"" -- Lori Evans, Gainesville, Florida. -- ""I love seeing bookcases packed full of books, pictures and collectibles in other people's homes. However, I prefer a cleaner, simpler style in my house. When there are tons of objects in a bookcase, it can overload the senses and not be relaxing."" -- Tiffani Stutzman, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. -- ""For this bookshelf, I found it helpful to have a wide assortment of objects on the floor in front and then start placing objects (on the shelves). That way everything is easy to reach and move around."" -- Sarah Dorsey, Pismo Beach, California. -- ""Antlers are natural and sculptural, and I like to showcase them as art. I found mine at a flea market. They are definitely a conversation starter when we have guests. They also look really cool at night when the library lights are on."" -- Kristin Cadwallader, Rock Island, Illinois. ""I was pleasantly surprised by how finished the shelves looked when we added the glass doors. We'd originally planned to add molding to them to give them a built-in look, but we found we preferred the modern feel the glass doors gave them."" -- Gretchen Holcombe, Roswell, Georgia. -- ""We have a lot of books, so we need to use our bookshelves for real storage, not just a place to put pretty things that need to be dusted. I found everything looks a little less busy if you loosely organize books by color and mix in some meaningful, pretty things."" -- Kelly Marzka, Atlanta. -- ""The thing I learned when I set out to decorate these bookshelves was an important one: That with a little bit of effort you can transform something that may not be your style, or in this case, may even have lingering memories associated with it, and make it truly and uniquely your own."" -- Andrea Trbovich, Hilliard, Ohio. ""I really try to consider how much I love something before I display it. Using the rule of thumb, 'if you make everything special, then really nothing is special' "" -- Tracie Stoll, Prospect, Kentucky. ""I love playing with (the bookshelf). ... I will be making small changes to take it from Halloween to more of a Thanksgiving theme as November approaches."" -- Sarah Macklem, Detroit.","HGTV magazine's Sara Peterson says accessorizing bookcases is quick and easy .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Despite the Solyndra collapse that has tarnished solar energy, the industry has grown into ""a major economic force"" with a job base that expanded 6.8% the past year, nearly 10 times faster than the overall economy, industry representatives said Tuesday. The solar business is now a $6 billion industry, up 300% from 2006, said officials with the Solar Foundation, a nonprofit affiliated with solar energy industry. With 100,237 jobs as of August, solar employers expect their workforce to grow 24% next year, according to the foundation's National Solar Jobs Census 2011, completed in partnership with BW Research Partnership's Green LMI Consulting division and Cornell University. ""It's great news,"" said Andrea Luecke, executive director of the Solar Foundation. ""Despite a struggling economy and the worst recession since the Depression and despite the Solyndra debacle, the industry is experiencing record-breaking trade numbers, record-breaking installed capacity, and record-breaking private investment."" Solyndra Inc. was once considered a model ""green"" company producing state-of-the-art solar panels, but it is now at the center of congressional scrutiny and a FBI probe after the Fremont, California, firm filed for bankruptcy in late August and put more than 1,000 people out of work, even though it received $535 million in federal loan guarantees. The bankruptcy leaves the government unlikely to get back the money it loaned. President Barack Obama touted the company in a visit last year. Despite the controversy, the solar sector appears bullish, Luecke said. ""Solyndra, of course, is just one company, and they went out of business because they could no longer compete with not only Chinese manufactures but also U.S. manufacturers,"" Luecke said. ""There's nothing to indicate that the solar industry is not poised for growth, though we do need smart policy investment as all energies do,"" Luecke added. She was referring to state and federal legislation that would give ""employers the confidence they need to expand their workforce,"" she said. California continued to be the national leader in solar employment, with 25,575 workers. Other states in the top 10 are Colorado, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida, Texas, Oregon, New Jersey and Massachusetts, the group said. The study identified 17,198 solar employments sites in the United States. The survey collected data from more than 2,100 companies. ""The National Solar Jobs Census is an important reference because the previous lack of data about solar employment was presenting difficulties to policymakers and training providers,"" Philip Jordan, chief business officer at BW Research Partnership, said in a statement. Added John Bunge, associate professor in the department of statistical science at Cornell University's School of Industrial Labor Relations: ""The jobs census is setting a new standard for clean energy job studies. ""The use of both primary and secondary data sources, along with careful statistical analysis, gives us high confidence in the results. We expect our rigorous methodology to be extended to econometric studies of green jobs beyond the solar industry,"" he said in a statement.","Solar energy is now a $6 billion industry .

"(CNN) -- The ""Snake Man"" is real. The mythical creature with the body of a serpent and face of a human folds himself into a tight coil for the gasping crowds, before slithering into his next impossible position. Or at least, that's how it seemed to circus manager Winston Ruddle when he first saw the homeless boy dressed head-to-toe in a snake skin suit, performing on the streets of Mombasa, Kenya. A decade later, the mysterious ""Snake Man"" -- better known as 30-year-old contortionist Lazarus Gitu -- is now set to perform on New York's Broadway, one of the star acts in Ruddle's spectacular circus show, ""Mother Africa."" ""I had been in the circus business since the 1980s and I'd never seen something like Lazarus,"" said Ruddle. ""It's not so common to find a flexible man -- most contortionists are females from Mongolia or China. He was so unusual."" From street to stage . While other professional contortionists spend years training in specialist schools from just five-years-old, Gitu learned his trade while living on the streets aged 14. An orphan whose mother had died from Aids and father from old age, Gitu learned to bend his body into incredible positions from watching other performers busking. ""I noticed I could do better than them, and I started training on my own,"" said Gitu. ""I was on the streets for six years with other boys and they all depended on me as their star show -- it was how we made money to survive."" The freakishly flexible teen became something of a legend on the streets of Mombasa, and when Ruddle came to the city looking for performers for his new circus troupe, he was quickly pointed in the direction of the ""Snake Man."" World class . Ruddle, a Zimbabwean-born former acrobat with dreams of creating an all-African circus that would tour the world, auditioned more than 300 performers that day. None impressed him. ""Then somebody told me about this street performer, this 'Snake Man,' so I went to see him. I was amazed,"" said Ruddle. ""He had all the goods but his act still needed some polishing. I invited him to come back to Tanzania with me and train at my acrobatics school."" Watch video: Stars of Cirque du Soleil . Three years later ""Mama Africa"" was born. Boasting around 50 performers --including acrobats, aerialists, clowns, and magicians -- the tribal-inspired show has toured across Europe, Australia, and come this December, Broadway. ""The circus has changed the lives of many street boys,"" said Gitu. ""Now they see a future as performers, they can travel the world, meet others artists, and earn decent pay."" Snake charmer . While all the elaborately dressed ""Mama Africa"" performers display remarkable strength, stamina, and skill, it is the ""Snake Man"" who has carved a name for himself off the stage, regularly appearing in variety TV shows across Europe and the United States. Sometimes performing with fellow contortionist Hassan Mohamed, the ""Plastic Boys,"" as they are known, bewitch audiences with their fantastically flexible maneuvers. Indeed, from cramming himself inside a tiny glass box to leisurely bending his legs backwards over his head, Gitu appears to be an otherworldly creature made entirely of rubber. ""The audience is mesmerized -- some are shocked and some are afraid of what they see,"" said Gitu. ""But contortion is not dangerous if started in early childhood. Today I usually train for around one-and-a-half hours a day."" Circus life . Despite the bright lights of the Big Top, circus life can also be less-than glamorous, with the Mama Africa performers usually living in four double-decker buses as they travel across the country. ""We have around 10 people on each bus --the top deck has the beds, and below is the kitchen, dining room, lounge,"" said Ruddle. ""It's more like a big family."" For Gitu, the circus has also given him the chance to build a permanent home, recently buying a house in Tanzania. It's a long way from the streets of his youth.

"(CNN) -- It took Jordan two years, two group stages and a full 18 games to get to the brink of their first ever World Cup finals. The country had reached fever pitch, salivating at the prospect of their small Arab kingdom securing a place in Brazil alongside the world's best soccer-playing nations. Standing in their way were Uruguay, 1950 World Cup winners and ranked as the sixth best team on the planet, brimming with world class talent like Liverpool's Luis Suarez and Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani. But though the team known as 'Al-Nashama', which translates as 'The Brave Gentlemen', battled gamely in the first leg of their playoff in front of their reigning monarch King Abdullah, the dream is all but over. Uruguay ran out 5-0 winners in Amman, delighting their small pocket of fans who made the journey from South America, meaning the mother of all footballing miracles will be needed if Jordan are to qualify. Still, a portion of their deflated supporters stayed behind after the final whistle to applaud the opposition, whose superior quality told in goals from Maxi Pereira, Christian Stuani, Nicolás Lodeiro, Cristian Rodriguez and Cavani. Jordan started well, Odai Al Saify nearly sneaking a shot inside the near post of Uruguay goalkeeper Martín Silva, but the home side were soon on the back foot. The deadlock was broken on 22 minutes when Pereira, who plays in Portugal for Benfica, tapped home from close range after Cavani's header had been parried by Jordanian goalkeeper Abdulla al-Zubi. The second wasn't far behind as Stuani steered a low shot into the net after poor defending allowed a cross to fall to the striker, who plys his club trade for Espanyol in Spain. After the interval, Jordan fashioned their best chance of the game but Ibrahim al-Zawareh missed the target from close range after Shareef Adnan's inviting cross. Lodeiro made it three on 69 minutes, sweeping home after good work from Cavani and Rodriguez grabbed a fourth moments later with a crisp volley from inside the area. Jordan's misery was complete in time added on as Cavani got the goal his performance warranted, arrowing a free kick from 25 yards into the top corner. The return leg is in Montevideo next Wednesday but Jordan will travel to South America in the knowledge that their first World Cup appearance is set to elude them again. Mexico joy . Mexico are odds on to join Uruguay in Brazil after they took a commanding 5-1 lead in their playoff with New Zealand. There was a real fear among the country's football mad fans that Mexico might miss out on the World Cup for the first time since 1990, and they had to rely on other results going their way even to make the playoffs. Coach Miguel Herrera was their fourth in five qualification matches but his decision to overlook star names like Manchester United's Javier Hernandez in favor of those who play in Mexico's domestic league paid off. Two goals from Oribe Peralta and further strikes from Raúl Jiménez, Paul Aguilar and Rafael Márquez put Mexico into a five-goal lead before Chris James grabbed a consolation goal for the Kiwis. The return leg takes place in New Zealand next Tuesday.","Uruguay thrash Jordan 5-0 in their World Cup qualification playoff first leg .

"San Diego (CNN) -- It's hip to be Hispanic. I was on a call the other day with someone who joked that she wanted to be named an ""honorary"" Hispanic because ""that's the cool group right now."" The 2010 Census found that there are about 52 million Hispanics in the United States. They're everywhere, in all 50 states. And they're shaping how Americans think about sports, fashion, food, entertainment, music, pop culture, business, media, the arts and the digital world. America's largest minority is especially cool this time of year. In 1988, when Congress established Hispanic Heritage Month, from September 15 to October 15, lawmakers no doubt intended for Americans to reflect on the past. But somewhere along the line, it became a time to look to the future. The original idea was to celebrate what Hispanics have contributed to this magnificent country, and all that they have sacrificed, dating back at least to 1863, when Corp. Joseph H. De Castro of the Union Army became the first Hispanic recipient of the Medal of Honor, for heroism at Gettysburg during the Civil War. To date, the Medal of Honor has been awarded to 44 men of Hispanic heritage, and in 25 of those cases -- more than half -- it was presented posthumously. But today, Hispanic Heritage Month is mostly about looking forward and pondering the impact that Hispanics are going to continue to have on this country for as far as the eye can see. In business, companies spend enormous amounts of money hoping for a slice of the $1.2 trillion that Hispanics spend annually on goods and services. In politics, many of what analysts call ""battleground states"" are heavily populated by Hispanics. Nevada, Florida, Colorado and New Mexico mattered a lot on election night 2012, and they'll matter more in the years to come. Hispanics make up 16% of the U.S. population, and it's estimated they'll account for 29% by 2050. About the same time, whites will cease to be a statistical majority in the United States. What does this all mean anyway? Opinion: GOP, don't give up on attracting Latino support . Hispanics have put all their eggs in the basket of changing demographics. They've assumed that, as their numbers grow, they'll automatically become powerful, influential and prosperous. The other day, I was on a panel where a university professor suggested that the best hope for immigration reform was for America to get to the point where Hispanics represented so much of the electorate that no politician would dare cross them. Alas, it doesn't work that way. In fact, as the Hispanic population grows in the years to come, we can expect many non-Hispanics to panic and batten down the hatches. For instance, even though most Hispanics in the United States are U.S.-born citizens, you'll see more Arizona-style immigration laws intended to put immigrants in their place. And often, those laws will wind up also victimizing those U.S citizens who simply resemble immigrants. Read: Hispanics. This year, to mark Hispanic Heritage Month, I thought that I'd give my compadres something they could really use: a reality check. For most Hispanics in the United States, life is not a fiesta. Things are not rosy. They're actually quite bleak. And demographic trends being what they are, that's bad news for the whole country. According to a 2011 study by the Pew Research Center, the median wealth -- assets minus debts -- of Hispanic households fell by 66% from 2005 to 2009. Over the same period, the median wealth of white households fell by just 16%. As a result, the study found, the median net worth of white households is now 18 times that of Hispanic households. It's true that some of the nation's corporations are making a play for Hispanic customers, but not many of their top executives and board members are Hispanic. Closer look: Hispanics in the U.S. And how are lower-level Hispanic workers treated at these companies? At a Target distribution center in Woodland, California, three former employees are suing the company for discrimination and retaliation. The lawsuit claims that white managers used ethnic slurs and that when the workers complained, they were fired. It also brought to light a ""training document"" that used negative stereotypes to advise managers about how to deal with Hispanic workers, including this: ""Food: not everyone eats tacos and burritos; Music: not everyone dances to salsa; Dress: not everyone wears a sombrero; Mexicans (lower education level, some may be undocumented)."" You get the idea. Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said in a statement that while she couldn't comment on specific allegations, the company doesn't ""tolerate or condone discrimination in any form."" Snyder said that the guide wasn't part of any ""formal or company-wide training"" and that it is ""not representative of who Target is."" She also apologized for its content. It's true that Hispanics are now able to help decide elections, and that they're courted by both parties. Yet Hispanics are treated disrespectfully by both the Democrats who take them for granted, and the Republicans who write them off. They're often insulted, deceived, manipulated, and exploited. It's shoddy customer service. Enough of this. Things need to get better for this population. But it won't occur organically. There is no magic tipping point. Things are not going to just start happening for Hispanics when they get to a certain percentage of the population. They have to make them happen. Hispanics already know how to work hard, sacrifice everything, and believe in the American dream. Now they need to know what they're worth, refuse to settle for less, and accept that only they can make dreams come true. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Hispanic Heritage Month, established in 1988, runs from September 15 to October 15 .

"(CNN) -- Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has joined human rights activists in criticizing a two-child limit imposed on Muslim families by authorities in areas of western Myanmar in an attempt to control their population. The government of Myanmar's Rakhine State, which borders Bangladesh, says the restriction was ordered in two townships that have the biggest populations of Rohingya -- a persecuted, stateless Muslim minority -- because of concerns about their high birthrate. Terrorized, starving and homeless: Myanmar's Rohingya still forgotten . ""If they want to live here, they have to follow the rules and orders of this state,"" Win Myaing, spokesman for the Rakhine government, said Tuesday, referring to the Rohingya. ""If not, we can't live together tranquilly."" The ordering of the two-child limit is the latest measure taken against the Rohingya, who were the main victims in outbreaks of communal violence involving the Buddhist majority in Rakhine last year. The clashes killed scores of people and left tens of thousands of others living in makeshift camps. Q&A: What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? Deadly ethnic unrest has become a major challenge for the national government of President Thein Sein, who has overseen a series of reforms over the past two years that have moved Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, closer to democracy. 'Not in line with human rights' ""I think this is against the law,"" Suu Kyi, who leads the opposition National League for Democracy, said Monday in reference to the two-child limit on Rohingya families. ""It's not good to have such discrimination,"" she said after a meeting in Yangon, the country's biggest city. ""It is not in line with human rights."" Read more: Rights group accuses Myanmar of 'ethnic cleansing' It was her starkest statement yet about the difficulties the Rohingya face, following criticism that she hadn't spoken up strongly enough on the issue. Suu Kyi said Monday she didn't know whether the two-child policy was definitely being implemented or not. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch says the measure has been in place in areas of Rakhine since 2005, one of multiple restrictions that make it difficult and expensive for Rohingya to do things like get married or obtain birth certificates. Now, local authorities appear to be exploiting a recent government-commissioned report on last year's communal violence to reaffirm their commitment to limiting the number of children Rohingya can have. ""I think it's profoundly chilling,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia. ""It's an indication of a larger persecution."" Read more: Despite reforms, Myanmar's ethnic violence continues . He said he was unaware of any other country in Asia where one ethnic group sought to control the birthrate of another through governmental regulations. The official report on the communal violence included the recommendation that family-planning education be proposed to the Rohingya population in light of concerns among Rakhine's Buddhist majority about the Rohingya birth rate. But the recommendation included the caveat that authorities should ""refrain from implementing nonvoluntary measures which may be seen as discriminatory or that would be inconsistent with human rights standards."" Win Myaing, the Rakhine government spokesman, claimed the two-child limit doesn't violate human rights. ""This is the best way to control the explosion of the Muslim population in this region,"" he said. Government silence . But Robertson disagreed. The Rakhine government ""spews mistruths, saying that these people are overpopulating,"" he said. Describing the two-child policy as ""discriminatory and an abuse of human rights,"" Robertson called on Thein Sein, who recently met with President Barack Obama in Washington, to say whether the national government supports the measure. ""It's a policy that's been hidden in the shadows,"" he said. ""Now, it's time for the Burmese government to respond."" Thein Sein's spokesman, Ye Htut, and other government officials didn't respond to calls seeking comment on Tuesday. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that Rakhine's population of about 800,000 Rohingya have suffered restrictions on their human rights for decades. It describes them as ""one of the most persecuted peoples in the world."" Human Rights Watch has described the violence in Rakhine last year and its aftermath as ""a campaign of government-supported crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing"" targeting the Rohingya. The Myanmar government has disputed that account as ""one-sided."" Journalist Phyo Wai Lin and CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Myanmar's Rakhine State puts a two-child limit on Muslims in some areas .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Bruce Lee, the movie icon credited with bringing martial arts to the mainstream, has long been one of Hong Kong's proudest exports -- and come Saturday, Hong Kongers will have a chance to own a piece of history, when 13 pieces of Lee memorabilia go to auction. The star of classics such as Fists of Fury and Enter the Dragon, Lee was raised in Hong Kong before moving to the United States in 1959 to teach kung fu. Among the items to be auctioned by Phila China and U.S.-based Kelleher Auctions is a fur-lined, Chinese-style costume jacket, which was custom-made for Lee's follow-up film to Enter the Dragon. The coat was worn by the star in 1973, just before he died from a reaction to medication. Other lots include signed student membership cards to Lee's kung fu schools, and a martial-arts book inscribed by the actor. Anna Lee, spokeswoman for Phila China auction house, anticipates the auction will go very well. ""It is the first time since 1993 -- when Lee's family auctioned 200 items in Los Angeles -- that lots of Lee items have gone on sale at once."" About 150 people are expected to attend the auction in person, with phone bidders dialing in from around the world. Bidding is expected to focus on one particular item -- a three-page letter handwritten by Lee in 1966. Written to Taky Kimura -- fellow kung fu instructor, friend and best man at Lee's 1964 wedding -- the note reveals Lee's hopes for the future: ""I'm looking forward for the T.V. series of 'Green Hornet' to come out so that Gung Fu will catch on,"" he wrote in one excerpt. The letter is estimated to sell for between U.S.$25,664 and U.S.$38,496. Phila China expects the 13 lots, which all came from the same American collector, to collectively fetch up to U.S.$113,000. W. Wong Yiu-keung, chairman of the Bruce Lee Fan Club, says this is a momentous occasion for Bruce Lee fans. ""Those lots are meaningful and memorable that let us know more about Bruce Lee,"" he explained. ""Bruce Lee movies had a great impact on both Westerners and non-Westerners -- those movies strides across different countries, races and languages."" After plans to turn Lee's old home in Hong Kong into a museum fell through this year, this auction is one way for Hong Kongers to finally show Lee some love.","Bruce Lee memorabilia goes to auction August 6 in Hong Kong .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A fugitive gunman thought to be behind a string of armed robberies and murders in China dating back to 2004 has been shot and killed following a huge manhunt. Zhou Kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- was killed by police in the southwestern city of Chongqing on Tuesday morning, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Described as ""ruthless and highly dangerous"" by Chinese authorities, Zhou became infamous for robbing people while they were drawing money from banks and repeatedly dodging police manhunts. Thousands of police and soldiers were drafted in over the weekend to search for the 42 year old after a woman was shot dead and two others injured on Friday outside a bank in Chongqing during an attempted robbery, Xinhua said. Later that day, local police reported that a railway policeman was killed while in pursuit of a man believed to be Zhou -- his ninth victim in eight years following a series of robberies in Chongqing, Nanjing and Changsha. All his victims were shot in the head, according to media reports. Zhou was eventually tracked down in Shapingba, a mountainous district on the outskirts of Chongqing, after police uncovered a cave on Monday that Zhou is believed to have stayed in. Inside were two cigarette cases, a T-shirt and human waste, China Daily reported. China's Ministry of Public Security classified Zhou as a ""class-A"" suspect, with a total 5.4 million yuan (US$849,000) in rewards being offered for information leading to his capture. A huge -- but ultimately fruitless -- search for Zhou was carried out in January this year after he allegedly shot and robbed a man who had just withdrawn 200,000 yuan ($31,700) from a bank in Nanjing before fleeing in a car. Nanjing Public Security Bureau's Xuanwu district office told CNN at the time that tens of thousands of police officers took part in the manhunt. It also published two video clips online of the suspect escaping the scene.","Zhou Kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- killed by police in Chongqing .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The United Nations body responsible for preserving the world's most important cultural sites voted Friday to grant ""world heritage"" status to the Church of the Nativity in the Palestinian city of Bethlehem. The declaration by U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization covers the West Bank church, venerated by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus, and the surrounding route taken by religious pilgrims. It marks the Palestinians' first bid for inclusion on the prestigious list of sites deemed to hold ""outstanding universal value"" as part of the world's shared heritage. It comes after Palestinians were granted membership of UNESCO last October, when the body's general assembly voted overwhelmingly to accept them. The vote proved controversial within the United States, which holds the view that Palestinians must reach a peace deal with Israel before the Palestinian Territories can be granted full membership in international organizations. The United States' and Israel's subsequent funding cut to the body caused UNESCO lose more than a fifth of its revenues. Rebels burn Timbuktu tomb listed as U.N. World Heritage site . The declaration, announced in the Russian city of St. Petersburg, was backed by 13 of the body's 21 members. Two countries abstained, while six countries voted against the declaration. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Malki, in St. Petersburg for the vote, thanked all those who voted in favor of including Bethlehem's holiest sites on the world heritage list. ""The victory of Palestine in international organizations is the beginning of the end of the Israeli occupation,"" Malki said in a statement. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's executive committee who heads the group's Department of Culture and Information, told CNN from Ramallah that the vote affirms the Palestinian identity and is one step toward Palestinian self-determination. ""Now we are responsible for our cultural and historical sites as part of human civilization as a whole,"" Ashrawi said. ""Politically it is important, because it is the beginning of the loosening of the control of the Israeli occupation on our land, on our lives, on our culture and at all attempts of confiscation and distortion of our cultural heritage and reality,"" Ashrawi said. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor told CNN that Israel was opposed to the move. ""This is a real theater of the absurd. The Palestinians have stepped over the regular procedure of UNESCO and distorted the usual proceeding in order to vote a decision that has nothing to do with world heritage sites and even less to do with this site, the Church of the Nativity,"" he said. New Delhi's heritage sites . ""The only purpose of this unprecedented voting procedure was to turn the commission into a propaganda tool against Israel. This should be denounced by all member countries of UNESCO, otherwise this will not be the Palestinians' last word."" The West Bank city of Bethlehem, about 8 kilometers (5 miles) south of Jerusalem, is considered the Palestinian Territories' top visitor destination, largely due to the religious significance of the church. One of the oldest surviving Christian churches in the world, it drew 2 million visitors last year, according to Nada Atrash, an architect and head of the research and training unit at Bethlehem's Center for Cultural Heritage Preservation, which has been lobbying for the site's designation as a World Heritage destination. Atrash said the center considers Bethlehem's inclusion on the list ""as a Palestinian dream, and as a reward of 11 years of work in the field of preserving the cultural and natural heritage in Palestine."" Visitor numbers have hit record highs in recent years but, according to a report into developing tourism in the town, Bethlehem has yet to properly capitalize on its potential. The majority of the visitors were day-trippers on short visits, meaning the full economic benefits of tourism did not flow into the town. Africa's heritage sites under threat . Atrash said it is hoped that gaining world heritage status will help efforts to boost Bethlehem's appeal as a destination and keep visitors in the town longer. ""We are mainly seeking to extend the stay of the visitors, who usually drop (in) to Bethlehem for few hours to visit the church and leave without visiting the town,"" she said. ""We hope that this inscription would contribute to both the promotion of the site and its protection."" Concerns have been raised over the condition of the church, which has suffered extensive earthquake damage in its long history. Another issues is that responsibility for its administration is shared among three religious authorities: the Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Roman Catholic churches. On occasion, tensions among the groups have spilled over into violence; in December, about 100 Greek Orthodox and Armenian clerics fought with brooms when a tussle broke out while cleaning the church. One of Christianity's most holy places, the site's focal point is the Grotto of the Nativity, a rectangular cavern beneath the church that has been considered the site of Christ's birth since at least the 2nd century. A 14-point silver star set into the marble floor marks the precise spot where Jesus is said to have been born. In the 4th century, Emperor Constantine founded a church on the site that was destroyed in the year 529, only to be replaced by larger structures, which form the basis of the church today.

"(CNN) -- Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd bid farewell to politics, telling parliamentarians Wednesday in an emotional speech that he will step down at the end of the week. Rudd was first elected prime minister in 2007. Party infighting caused him to lose the post to Julia Gillard in 2010. He reclaimed the position in June in yet more infighting in the Labor Party. But when it came to elections in September, the bookish incumbent lost to the pugnacious style of Tony Abbott. Labor infighting boosted Abbott's standing in the polls and -- under Gillard -- the party faced certain defeat at elections this year. While the installation of Rudd as prime minister for a second time helped the party claw back some of the ground Labor lost under Gillard, many analysts said his arrival came too late to save the party. ""For our family, recent statements since the September election have been particularly hurtful,"" Rudd told lawmakers. ""As parliamentarians you might say we become inured to all of this, although I doubt it."" Abbot's office issued a statement saying ""While Mr Rudd will no longer continue as a parliamentarian, I have every confidence that he will continue to serve our country and the values that he has always believed in."" ""Whatever disagreements my colleagues and I have had with Mr Rudd, we will always honour what he achieved on the day of the National Apology,"" the statement said. ""Ancient wrongs were addressed that day. It was a great moment in our country's history and it happened because of him."" In November 2009, Rudd -- then the prime minister -- formally apologized to thousands of adults who, as impoverished British children, were brought to Australia with the promise of a better life but found abuse and forced labor. The so-called Forgotten Australians -- children who came from British families struggling with severe poverty or from institutions in the UK -- were brought to Australia in a program that ended 40 years ago.","Party infighting caused the Labor Party the prime ministership .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A suburban Atlanta high school football player has died from injuries suffered while making a tackle during a scrimmage game, according to medical examiners. Deantre Turman's death came Friday after he made a tackle during a pre-season game, said Mike Alsip, a forensic investigator for the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office. The teenager broke his neck, Alsip said. The accident happened at a school in the Atlanta suburb of College Park, Georgia, according to CNN affiliate WSB. His coach, Glenn Ford, told the station that Turman -- a cornerback known to friends as ""Tre Tre"" -- went immediately limp and unresponsive after the play. Coaches and others tried without success to revive him during what Ford said was a 15-minute wait for an ambulance. The young athlete was pronounced dead at a hospital about an hour and 15 minutes after the accident, according to Alsip. Turman, 16, was popular and well-regarded, Ford said. ""People knew Tre Tre. They knew and loved him,"" Ford said, according to the station. Tarsha Keller, the woman who raised Turman since his mother died when he was just 4 years old, told WSB that the teen died doing what he loved. ""Being the competitor and playing different sports made him happy,"" Keller told WSB. Deaths from high school football are exceedingly rare. Over the last 10 years, an average of fewer than three boys a year have died from on-field injuries playing high school football, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. No players died in 2012, the first time that had happened since 1994, according to the center.

"(CNN) -- Rightly billed as a clash of tennis titans, World No.1 versus World No.2, few were expecting the comprehensive manner of Novak Djokovic's defeat of Rafael Nadal to retain the ATP World Tour Finals title Monday night in London. Nadal will still end the year as the top ranked player in the world, but he was given a timely reminder that on the fast indoor surface of the 02 Arena, Djokovic reigns supreme, retaining his title with a 6-3 6-4 victory. It came after just one hour 36 minutes on his third championship point, with Nadal putting a forehand wide, rounding off an uncharacteristically tame display from the Spaniard. Djokovic has been undefeated since losing to Nadal in the final of the U.S. Open in September and he deservedly lifted the trophy, named in honor of former ATP president Brad Drewett, who died earlier this year. After the gladiatorial style entrants by both men, it was Djokovic who struck the first blows, racing to a 3-0 lead with an early break of Nadal's service. He had a point for a double break, but the Spaniard weathered the storm before making inroads on Djokovic's next service game to draw them level at 3-3. But Djokovic was not to be denied and after holding his own service, he broke Nadal again, the decisive point seeing both men at full stretch with scarcely believable retrieving. Djokovic finally put away a decisive volley then held his own service, clinching the set with an ace. He was immediately on the front foot in the second set, breaking Nadal early again to take a lead he never relinquished. Nadal was under pressure as he served to stay in the match at 3-5, saving the first match point and forcing his opponent to serve out for the championship. Nadal at last showed glimpses of his true quality by saving a second championship point, but any hopes of an unlikely revival were quickly snuffed out as Djokovic sent down an ace to bring up his third chance to take the title for a third time. Nadal still leads their career meetings 22-17 and will be looking to revenge the defeat when the 2014 season starts with the Australian Open in January. Before that, Djokovic will lead Serbia in the final of the Davis Cup against the Czech Republic, hoping to continue his unbeaten end to the season. Earlier, Fernando Verdasco and his Spanish compatriot David Marrero lifted the doubles title, beating the top seeds and three-time former champions Mike and Bob Bryan of the United States. Verdasco and Marrero won a close final 7-5 6-7 10-7 in one hour and 44 minutes, succeeding Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez as winners of the end of season finale. They shared $335,500 in prize money, while the Bryans -- five-time finalists -- split $195,500. The losing pair have the consolation of comfortably ending 2013 as the top pair in the world, winning three of the four major titles with a 70-13 record.","Novak Djokovic wins ATP World Tour Finals title for second straight year .

"(CNN) -- The crew of a Danish cargo ship that caught fire off the coast of Norway was trapped on board after a rescue attempt Saturday was halted because of bad weather, authorities said. A helicopter airlift of some of the crew members aboard the Britannia Seaways was halted because of strong winds, said John Sjurso, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center of Southern Norway. The fire began Saturday in the steering room of the Britannia Seaways, which was in the North Sea en route from Oslo to Bergen, Sjurso said. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Crew members were fighting the fire, but it was not immediately known what equipment they had at their disposal to battle the flames, Sjurso said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The Britannia Seaways, a three-deck cargo ship, is carrying 24,000 tons of military equipment and has a crew of 32. It is not immediately known how many of the crew were rescued before the airlift was stopped due to the storm. Sjurso said late Saturday the ship is still running under its own power.

"(CNN) -- President Obama embarked Thursday on his first presidential visit to Asia, an eight-day journey that will take him to five cities in four countries. Throughout the trip to Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea, Obama will emphasize the importance of Asian nations as vital U.S. partners on major issues such as economic growth, nuclear nonproliferation, the war in Afghanistan and climate change, three officials said in a briefing this week. The presidential itinerary includes formal talks with Asian leaders as a group and individually, a bilateral meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and the first participation by a U.S. president in a summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic alliance. The itinerary also reflects Obama's personal ties to Asia, where he spent part of his childhood. He will have a bilateral meeting with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, where Obama lived from 1967 to 1971. As the first U.S. president with ""an Asia-Pacific orientation,"" Obama ""understands that the future of our prosperity and our security is very much tied to this part of the world,"" said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. It won't be all diplomatic meetings, though. Obama's first trip to China will include a ""town hall"" style meeting in Shanghai and sightseeing in Beijing. While in Japan he'll meet the emperor and empress, according to Rhodes. Obama's departure was delayed one day to allow his attendance at Tuesday's memorial service at Fort Hood Army Post in Texas for the 13 people killed in a mass shooting there last week. The revised itinerary cut a day from the stop in Singapore, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said earlier this week. En route to Tokyo, Obama will take time in Anchorage, Alaska, to speak to troops at Elmendorf Air Force Base during a two-hour layover. The president will meet with new Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, Medvedev and Yudhoyono, and also will take part in an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. APEC consists of 21 Pacific Rim nations that make up more than 50 percent of the world's economic output. The forum sees its goal as ""facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region."" Hatoyama and Obama have said they will affirm a strengthening of the bilateral alliance. But the U.S. president will be greeted by a Japanese leadership that has pledged more independence from the United States and has said it is reviewing a bilateral deal to relocate a U.S. Marine Corps base on Okinawa. The agreement was met with fierce local opposition. Increasing U.S. exports to a region expected to grow by more than 7 percent next year will also be an important topic, said Michael Froman, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. Asia ""already takes about a quarter of our exports, and those exports are expected to increase as the region grows"" Froman said. The result could be an increase of ""hundreds of thousands"" in the current 1.6 million U.S. jobs linked to Asian exports, he said. The officials were careful to avoid any perception that Obama's presence at the ASEAN meeting would amount to a bilateral discussion with the prime minister of Myanmar, who also will attend. After years of refusing direct talks with Myanmar, also known as Burma, the United States has indicated a possible re-engagement with the military regime it considers repressive for cracking down on political opposition, including the National League for Democracy led by detained Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. ""The statement we're trying to make here is that we're not going to let the Burmese tail wag the ASEAN dog,"" said Jeffrey Bader, the National Security Council's senior director for East Asian affairs. ""We're going to meet with all 10 and we're not going to punish the other nine simply because Burma is in the room, but this is not a bilateral [meeting]."" In China, Obama will continue efforts to define and strengthen the relationship with the world's largest emerging economy, which has a growing influence in Asia, Bader said. ""We see it as a relationship where we're obviously going to have differences, where we are going to be competitors in certain respects,"" he said. ""But we want to maximize areas where we can work together because the global challenges will simply not be met if we don't."" Bader cited North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the economy, climate change, human rights and Afghanistan as among the top issues for the China swing. On human rights, Bader said Obama is likely to address ""freedom of expression, access to information, freedom of religion, rule of law, and certainly Tibet."" Obama will make clear to Hu that he intends to meet in the future with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, Bader said. China, which rejects Tibetan aspirations for autonomy, opposes such high-level contacts with the Dalai Lama. On North Korea, the State Department announced Tuesday that U.S. officials will travel to the country by the end of the year to seek a resumption of broader talks on ending the Pyongyang government's nuclear program. The Obama administration has claimed initial progress in its strategy of forging an international effort including China, South Korea and other countries to put pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions. Japan has been asking for a comprehensive solution to North Korea's missile tests and the abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s. North Korea and South Korea reported an encounter Tuesday involving gunfire between two of their naval ships off the Korean Peninsula. No casualties were reported, and a State Department spokesman downplayed the significance of the incident. CNN's Tom Cohen, Kyung Lah and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama will speak at Elmendorf Air Base in Alaska en route to Japan.

"(CNN) -- Around 1,700 people who visited Yosemite National Park from mid-June to the end of August are being advised to seek medical attention if they exhibit hantavirus symptoms. The park sent letters to the visitors Monday and Tuesday, explaining that hantavirus cases had been uncovered and that visitors should see their doctors if symptoms surface, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. In recent months, two park visitors have died from the virus. ""Early medical attention greatly increases the chance of survival in cases of HPS,"" or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the letter says. ""It is recommended that if you, or anyone in your party, has any of the symptoms listed ... particularly fever, muscle aches, or cough, that you seek health care immediately and advise your health care professional of the recent cases of HPS."" ""An outreach effort is currently underway by the park concessioner to contact visitors who stayed in 'Signature Tent Cabins' at Curry Village,"" the park said in a statement. 3 dead after contracting hantavirus at Yosemite . Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare lung disease that kills about a third of those who get infected. Symptoms can include fever, muscle aches and fatigue, though it is not communicable from person to person. ""However, if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue, and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure, together with shortness of breath, (that) would be strongly suggestive of HPS,"" the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In the United States, the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice, cotton rats, rice rats and white-footed mice. The virus can be present in the rodents' urine, droppings and saliva, and is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus, the CDC says. On Monday, Yosemite announced that a second person had died after contracting the disease while visiting the park. In addition to that fatality, the park said in a news release that officials identified ""a probable fourth case of hantavirus."" All four cases involve people who stayed at the park's popular Curry Village in mid-June. The park said its officials are trying to reach those who vacationed in these ""tent cabins."" Don Neubacher, Yosemite's superintendent, said that people typically don't fall ill with hantavirus until between one and six weeks after they are exposed. ""The health of our visitors is our paramount concern, and we are making every effort to notify and inform our visitors of any potential illness,"" Neubacher said. Earlier this month, the California Department of Public Health said two state residents who came down with the disease may have been exposed to mice droppings or urine that contained hantavirus while staying at the park. An unidentified 37-year-old man from the San Francisco Bay area died in late July, said Dr. Vicki Kramer, chief of the department's vector-borne disease section. A Southern California woman in her 40s survived and is recovering, Kramer told CNN. The two stayed in separate locations at the village, which contains about 400 canvas tent and wooden cabins. Gediman, the park spokesman, described the cabins as ""very sparse but comfortable."" Park officials have not given details about the one new confirmed case or the ""probable"" one. Officials have focused on deer mice, common in the high-elevation eastern Sierra Nevada region. The mice are gray or brown on top, with white bellies. Their ears have no fur. ""Rodents can infest a whole range of these structures,"" Kramer said. ""Deer mice can get in a hole one-quarter inch in diameter."" In addition to cleaning the 400 camp structures, park officials have said they've increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk. ""You cannot eliminate all the mice,"" Kramer said. ""There are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins."" Before this year, Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010. There is no specific treatment for a hantavirus infection, according to the CDC, but the earlier a patient is brought to intensive care, the better.","Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare but sometimes fatal lung disease .

"(CNN) -- Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti was released from a Houston hospital on Thursday, days after he was injured in a serious crash. Thirteen spectators were also hurt during IndyCar's Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday. Franchitti, who was at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, will travel to Indianapolis, where he will be evaluated and await a second surgery to his right ankle. ""I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and I'm thankful to have such a great family and such wonderful friends and fans. Thanks to everyone at the hospital and the track who took such good care of me during my stay in Houston,"" Franchitti said in a statement. The wreck occurred in the last lap of the race, when Japanese driver Takuma Sato bumped Franchitti's car, sending it airborne into the protective fencing. The car spun multiple times against the fence, sending shards of debris flying toward the grandstands and shearing off part of its side. Franchitti, 40, suffered a concussion in the wreck and fractures to his spine and ankle. The Scotland native won IndyCar racing's top prize in 2012, 2010 and 2007.

"(CNN) -- Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti announced his retirement Thursday, a month after a devastating crash in Houston, where he suffered head and spinal injuries. In a statement released through his team, Target Chip Ganassi Racing, Franchitti said he made the decision to stop racing based on the advice of doctors who have treated and assessed his injuries. ""They have made it very clear that the risks involved in further racing are too great and could be detrimental to my long term well-being. Based on this medical advice, I have no choice but to stop,"" he said. ""Racing has been my life for over 30 years and it's really tough to think that the driving side is now over. ""I was really looking forward to the 2014 season with Target Chip Ganassi Racing, with a goal of winning a fourth Indianapolis 500 and a fifth IndyCar Series championship."" Franchitti suffered a concussion in the wreck as well as fractures to his spine and ankle. The wreck occurred in the last lap of IndyCar's Grand Prix of Houston on October 6, when Japanese driver Takuma Sato bumped Franchitti's car, sending it airborne into the protective fencing. The car spun multiple times against the fence, sending shards of debris flying toward the grandstands and shearing off part of its side. Thirteen spectators were also hurt during the crash. The Scotland native won IndyCar racing's top prize in 2012, 2010 and 2007. Franchitti ends his career with 31 IndyCar wins and 33 starts in the No. 1 position. ""I'll forever look back on my time racing in CART and the IndyCar Series with fond memories and the relationships I've forged in the sport will last a lifetime,"" he said. ""Hopefully in time, I'll be able to continue in some off-track capacity with the IndyCar Series. I love open-wheel racing and I want to see it succeed.""

"(CNN) -- Phil Collins, the man behind 1980s albums such as ""No Jacket Required,"" has announced his retirement from music, but no straitjacket required, he says. In a statement on his website, the 60-year-old dad said he is retiring to devote more time to his family and be a full-time father to his two young sons. His statement was a bid to clarify recent media speculation, which he said painted him as battling health issues and feeling like an outsider in the music industry. The articles painted ""a picture of me that is more than a little distorted,"" he said on his website. ""None of this is true. Thanks ... But there's no need for the straitjacket!"" The actor, pop star and former Genesis drummer said he was surprised by the articles because he had not talked to the media for months. Collins has sold more than 150 million records in his 40-plus years in the music business. ""I'm not stopping because of dodgy reviews or bad treatment in the press,"" he said. ""I'm not stopping because I don't feel loved; I know I still have a very large fan base that loves what I do. Thank you."" He cited an example of his album released last year, which topped the U.K. charts. ""I'm not stopping because I don't fit in, this was proved with ""Going Back"" ... doing incredibly well worldwide. I'm not stopping so I can dive full time into my interest for the Alamo."" That last reference is aimed at comments he has reportedly made claiming to see spirits in modern photos from the fort, and to have spoken with a psychic who told him he was reincarnated from a man who fought in the battle. But he does have a huge collection of memorabilia from the battle stashed at his Switzerland home. ""Some of the things mentioned above have been said by me in various interviews, but said as asides with a smile on my face and in passing. They were not meant to be headlines, they were small parts of a conversation,"" he said. He said the reports have made him ""sound like a tormented weirdo who thinks he was at the Alamo in another life, who feels very sorry for himself, and is retiring hurt because of the bad press over the years."" None of that is true, he said. The British singer and drummer has also written songs for the Disney feature films ""Tarzan"" and ""Brother Bear.""","He releases a statement to clarify recent media speculation over his career .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- An attack Friday night on a hotel in Somalia's capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded, a government spokesman said. The bloodshed came after a car bomb went off outside Hotel Makkah Al-Mukarama in central Mogadishu, Abdikarim Hussein Guled, the African country's interior and national security minister, told local media. Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali, the Somalian government's former acting envoy to Britain better known as ""Dhub,"" said Abdirahman Omar Osman, spokesperson for the country's president. Somalian Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon put out a statement condemning what he described as a ""terrorist attack"" and offering ""his condolences to the civilian casualties."" ""We -- the Somali people and the Somali government -- will stand shoulder-to-shoulder to defeat these killers,"" Shirdon said. ""These terrorists will not defeat us but (will) make us stronger."" It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack. But Somalia has seen such violence before. Some of it has been traced to Al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group and was behind the deadly siege earlier this fall of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall. A U.S. military drone strike late last month in southern Somalia killed two suspected Al Shabaab members, U.S. officials said. And a recent joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces killed at least 30 people believed to be part of that group. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","5 are dead, in addition to 15 wounded, government spokesman says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Thousands of photos taken during John F. Kennedy's 1,036 days as president remain unseen since White House photographer Cecil Stoughton printed and logged them in his darkroom five decades ago. When Stoughton's family auctioned them last month, collector and filmmaker Keya Morgan purchased about 15,000 of the images, including many showing private Kennedy family moments. ""He was there all the time, and he trusted him with his life,"" Morgan said of Stoughton. Most captured public events, but usually just a few shots from an event would have been released, Morgan said. The boxes likely hold surprises, but it could take years for him to examine each image, he said. ""I would say 95% of these photos have never been published or seen by anyone, and that is because there are just way too many,"" Morgan said. Morgan gave CNN the first peek inside the boxes after the photographs were delivered to him in Los Angeles this week. Reaching into a box and pulling out a stack of photos is like traveling through time, he said. He pulled out a stack of 5-by-5 black-and-white photos, some stuck together by the years. They appeared to be in the same sequence in which Stoughton developed them in his White House darkroom. This first stack showed Caroline Kennedy's fifth birthday party, her last with her father. President Kennedy was assassinated five days before her sixth. Another batch revealed a 2-year-old John Kennedy Jr. -- known then as John-John -- reaching into his parakeet's cage while his mother held him. It was the younger John Kennedy who first stirred Morgan's interest in Stoughton's photo archives in 1997. Kennedy was his friend and a client of his New York gallery, he said. ""He called me one night and said 'I need this photo, you know, the photo of me under the desk, but not the famous one,'"" Morgan said. The ""famous one"" of a young Kennedy under the Oval Office desk while his father worked above him was taken by photographer Stanley Tretick for LOOK magazine in October 1963. But Kennedy wanted a photo taken a year earlier by Stoughton, he said. Morgan found a surprise this weekend preparing for an interview with CNN's Don Lemon. It was an unknown photo of Caroline playing with another girl in the same spot under her father's desk. Morgan did not immediately know if the other girl was a Kennedy cousin or a friend. Kennedy cousins may recognize themselves in photos they had long forgotten or have never seen. ""It's impossible for anyone to have seen these because Cecil was so secretive,"" Morgan said. ""He was so protective and he had all these items locked up."" Morgan bought several hundred photos from Stoughton in the last years of his life, including the one that is apparently the only existing photo of Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe. ""Cecil was with President Kennedy basically all the time and even in some fairly intimate moments,"" Morgan said. ""It is shocking at the incredible volume of photos that he took, including some that are highly sensitive and private."" Since Morgan is busy writing a book and producing a documentary about Monroe's mysterious death, combing through his newly-acquired Kennedy collection will be slow, he said. He will start posting the first of the Kennedy images on his website LincolnImages.com for licensing, he said. Morgan also claims the largest collection of Lincoln photos, but the numbers are minuscule compared to Kennedy's. Only 129 unique images of Lincoln are known to exist, he said.","Most of the 15,000 images of Kennedy and family are unpublished .

"(CNN) -- Once Usain Bolt got out of the starting blocks, no one was going to beat him at the world championships. Two years ago at the worlds, the Jamaican false started in the 100-meter final and was disqualified. His countryman and training partner, Yohan Blake, took advantage to claim gold in Daegu, South Korea. There was no false start for Bolt on Sunday in rainy Moscow and he captured his second world title in the 100 meters. His time of 9.77 seconds was well off his world record of 9.58 seconds but still good enough to comfortably beat American Justin Gatlin and Jamaican Nesta Carter. Bolt now owns six world championship gold medals to go along with six gold medals at the Olympics. ""I am happy but I wanted to do better,"" Bolt was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""My legs were sore after the semifinals."" Perhaps mindful of what happened in South Korea, Bolt's start was cautious and Gatlin led him early. But after getting fully into his stride, Bolt -- despite not feeling at his best -- eased past Gatlin and coasted home. Gatlin finished in 9.85 seconds and Carter in 9.95. ""I thought I had it for a second but then I saw these long legs coming on my right side,"" Gatlin told reporters. Bolt last year called himself a ""living legend"" and the result in Moscow on Sunday won't diminish his confidence. It likely also lifted Jamaican sport. Jamaica was left reeling when two-time 200-meter Olympic champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell and Olympic relay gold medalist Sherone Simpson tested positive for banned substances before the world championships. Then last week, soccer's FIFA announced that a Jamaican international tested positive for a banned substance, without naming the player. Besides Powell, Campbell-Brown and Simpson, American Tyson Gay failed a drug test and ruled himself out of the world championships in July. With sprinters thus under scrutiny, Bolt spoke up in July and said: ""I know I am clean."" Without Gay -- who owned the two fastest times in the 100 meters this year prior to Moscow -- and the injured Blake, Bolt's task was made easier in Russia, although Gatlin defeated Bolt in Rome in June. Gatlin has served a four-year ban for doping. Bolt took center stage but he wasn't the only standout to win another world title Sunday. Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba collected her third in the 10,000 meters, an event she's won twice at the Olympics.","Usain Bolt wins the 100 meters at the world championships in a time of 9.77 seconds .

"(CNN) -- Flooding and landslides from tropical depression Parma have killed 186 people in the Philippines, authorities said Saturday. Frightened San Manuel villagers flee after rumors spread that nearby San Roque dam is in danger of collapse. Another 93 people have been injured, according to Nalia Tabliago of the Philippines National Disaster Coordinating Council. Rescuers are searching for 40 people reported missing, Tabliago said. Tropical depression Parma, known locally as Pepeng, dumped as much as 36 inches of rain in some parts of the nation of islands last week, compounding misery in areas already flooded by an earlier storm, typhoon Ketsana . On Friday, landslides blocked traffic along the Marchos Highway, Naguilian Road, Kennon Road and Ambuklao Road, cutting access to Baguio City, Benguet Province and Mountain Province, according to the Office of Civil Defense in Cordillera. Earlier reports from Rocky Baraan, provincial administrator of Pangasinan, said flooding had inundated 32 towns and two cities, Dagupan and Urdaneta. Some 35,000 people had fled to evacuation centers, the official Philippines News Agency reported, citing the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council. The worst-hit areas included Bayambang, Alcala and Basista, the news agency reported. People clambered onto rooftops as floodwaters rose, calling and texting for help. Rescue trucks were hampered by floodwaters that reach the roofs of single-story houses, Baraan said. About 16 rubber rescue boats had been deployed. Since the rains started in central Luzon, three dams in the Pangasinan area have been releasing vast amounts of water -- up to 10 million cubic meters an hour at one dam, officials said. Journalist Lilibeth Frondoso and CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","186 people dead in provinces, including Baguio City, Benguet and Mountain .

"(CNN) -- I'm typing this in bed, lying next to my dog, Mikey. We're best buds, and it's sort of a thing we do. There's also the occasional tongue kiss. His tongue. Not mine. Usually. But we're definitely pretty tight, and he trusts me with most anything. Save for dressing him up. I once tried to put special doggy hiking shoes on him and that was the closest he ever came to formulating human words. He definitely tried to call me, ""Ginger boy."" So, the other day, I was completely amazed when I stumbled on a trending Tumblr blog dedicated to dressing up cats. Dogs are one thing. But, as we all know, cats are evil and sinister, and will disfigure you on a whim, particularly when you are making a spirited attempt to make them look pretty. ""Sorry to hear about Diane. What happened?"" ""She put a ribbon on Snickers."" But maybe dressing up your cat isn't actually such a bad idea. The popular blog is called Meowtfit, and it was recently started by a fun couple in Gothenburg, Sweden, who, one day, decided to accessorize their 16-year-old Siamese cat, Gucci, with a pair of women's leggings. Katja Wulff explained to me, ""We often dress our cats in little outfits and one day we just tried leggings with Gucci. She didn't mind, and she looked so funny in the tights. So, we started the Meowtfit blog."" Two weeks later, after it was featured on the website Sad and Useless, Meowtfit became an international viral smash hit. So, if productivity is suddenly down in your office, blame Sweden. Of course, that's my excuse for everything. ""Sir, this restaurant requires pants."" ""Yeah, but you know ... Sweden."" As the blog became more popular, Wulff, along with her graphic designer boyfriend, Dan Sörensen, started a Facebook page where they also post fan submissions. Apparently, cats in tights has now sort of become a thing. But accept no imposters. Gucci was first. Wulff says her secret to doing it right is stuffing the leggings with ""other tights, panties, and some of Dan's boxers I don't like. He doesn't know that."" So, if you have a recently-updated will, ski goggles, and a full set of medieval chainmail, and want to try this at home, by all means do it. What could possibly go wrong? ""Siri, how do you get human blood off the ceiling?"" Of course, because this is the Web -- a place where horrible, boring people come to complain about everything -- a few visitors to the Meowtfit blog thought this was all rather cruel. But Wulff doesn't mind the (very) limited criticism. She says, ""Gucci likes it when we give her this attention. It's impossible to force a cat to pose like she does. So, I don't care."" Besides, Wulff is actually used to angry comments from her other blog. And as I inquired about her other presence on the Web, I soon discovered I was e-mailing with somebody remarkably creative and unique, and completely worth writing about. So, the cat blog discussion is over. It's amazing. Check it out. Full stop. But, now I want you to really get to know Wulff, who is officially my new favorite person on the planet. (Sorry, Mr. T. It's been a good, long run, but you've been replaced.) The other blog Wulff was talking about is something called Kaffekokarkokboken, which sounds like you accidentally inhaled a Wheat Thin, but loosely translates to ""Coffee Boiling Cookbook."" It's all about making food in a coffee maker. Naturally. ""I've been doing it for almost five years now,"" Wulff says. ""It started when I didn't have a kitchen, and now it's a hobby."" It seems that a coffee maker can be used in many different ways beyond just its intended purpose. Which, of course, is to take up space on your counter next to the Keurig. (Confession: I recently made the switch. It's completely wasteful and unnecessary, and I love it. Up yours, planet Earth!) But according to Wulff's blog -- where you can find an excellent English-language primer on the subject -- the plate can by used for frying, the pot for cooking, and the ""filter thingy"" for steaming. And, although I can't understand the text, her blog is actually quite beautiful -- it's even won the Swedish food blog of the year. Which, apparently, exists. Wulff and Sörensen also turned their coffee pot hobby into an actual cookbook, and it includes lots of great photo cameos by Gucci and their other two cats, Iggy and Zappa. Of course, running two blogs is great and all, but the real kicker is this: Wulff's actual day job is as a professional balloon artist! She says, ""The balloon thing is not that big in Sweden, so I'm not as crazy good as your American balloon artists. But when I do work at events, parties, festival and stuff, people (especially children and drunk adults) always love it."" Seriously, Wulff is an international treasure, and she needs to be cloned. Besides, if our future world goes to hell, at least we'll know who to blame. Sweden. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.","A Tumblr blog features cats wearing clothing .

"(CNN) -- On the same day a young rising star is given his big break in Formula One, one old-timer is given a chance to kick-start his motorsport career. McLaren announced Thursday that rookie Kevin Magnussen will race for the British team in the 2014, while Lotus confirmed veteran Heikki Kovalainen will be part of its driver lineup for the remaining two races of this season. Magnussen -- whose father Jan raced for McLaren at the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in Japan -- replaces Mexican Sergio Perez, who revealed Wednesday he will be departing less than one year after joining from Sauber. ""I'm absolutely overjoyed to be making my Formula One debut with McLaren,"" the 21-year-old Danish driver said in a statement. ""I'll put it simply: this team is the best,"" added the 2013 Formula Renault 3.5 Series champion. ""It's been my dream to drive for McLaren ever since I was a small kid, and it's no exaggeration to say that I've dedicated almost every day of my life to achieving the goal of becoming a McLaren F1 driver."" Magnussen, who came through McLaren's young driver program, will partner 2009 world champion Jenson Button, who has experienced a frustrating season in which he has collected just 60 points from 17 races. Perez, known as ""Checo,"" has fared even worse with 35 points, though his fifth in India last month matched Button's best finish so far. McLaren, one of the most successful teams in F1 history, is having one of its worst seasons since the 1980s -- being fifth overall, more than 400 points behind champion Red Bull. Team principal Martin Whitmarsh is excited to have a driver of Magnussen's potential onboard for next year. ""The manner in which he won this year's World Series by Renault 3.5 Championship was truly outstanding, showcasing as it did not only his impressive natural pace but also his increasing maturity and ability to structure and manage a championship campaign,"" Whitmarsh said. ""I want to take this opportunity to thank Checo, who has developed well during a difficult season, as his recent run of points-scoring finishes underlines. ""He's a lovely guy and a fine driver -- fast and combative -- and I'm sure he'll build on that firm foundation in 2014."" Kovalainen arrives at Lotus as a replacement for fellow Finn Kimi Raikkonen, who will miss the rest of the season to undergo back surgery. Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, is returning to his former team Ferrari in 2014 as a replacement for the outgoing Brazilian driver Felipe Massa. Kovalainen, who will partner Romain Grosjean at races in the U.S. and Brazil, made his F1 debut in 2007 and spent two seasons with McLaren in 2008 and 2009. He has been working as a test driver for Caterham, having raced for the team during the 2012 season -- and in its previous incarnation as Team Lotus from 2010-11. The former Renault team took over the Lotus name after that. ""It is a fantastic opportunity for me to join Lotus F1 team for the final two races of 2013,"" the 32-year-old said ahead of this weekend's United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. ""Jumping into a car so late in the year when you have not been competing in the races all season will be a challenge, but I know the team at Enstone well so I have no concerns about getting up to speed."" Kovalainen will have the chance to make a late play for a 2014 drive at Lotus, which has been linked to Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Pastor Maldonado, replaced at Williams by Massa.","McLaren announce Kevin Magnussen will drive for the team in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- On Monday night, Avigdor Liberman was sworn in as Israel's foreign minister after an absence of almost a year, amid a crescendo of opposition protests in the Knesset. A comfortable majority vote -- 62 members voting for, 17 against and one abstention -- paved his way back into office. But his hard-line attitude on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks may put him in the diplomatic deep end with those trying to advance the process. Labor Party leader Shelly Yachimovich said reappointing Liberman was a mistake. ""In light of the attempts to reignite the negotiations with the Palestinians and delicate relations with the U.S. and especially the complex diplomacy involved in the Iranian situation, a foreign minister like Liberman will deepen the rifts and pour fuel on fires rather than putting them out,"" she said. ""This is not good for Israel."" Liberman views Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas as an obstacle to peace. His Yisrael Beiteinu party is also supportive of West Bank Jewish settlements, whose presence is reviled by Palestinians and many Israelis, who consider them obstacles to a peace agreement. Read more: Israel warns against unilateral Palestinian move . Liberman's view seems to contradict the position of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has entered into a negotiating process with the Palestinian Authority. Liberman was acquitted last week on charges of breach of trust and fraud. Netanyahu had held the Foreign Ministry position for almost a year after Liberman resigned to face the charges, and welcomed him back into the government. The trial centered on claims Liberman had pushed to get the Israeli ambassador to Belarus transferred after the diplomat allegedly handed over confidential information that included details of a secret police inquiry regarding Liberman. Liberman denied violating any laws. Liberman has faced international criticism for his hard-line stance on Israel's Arab minorities. His ultranationalist party is especially popular with immigrants from the former Soviet Union, where he was born and raised.","Avigdor Liberman was sworn in as Israel's foreign minister again on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Sea-levels are rising unevenly around the world, with Pacific countries in particular suffering significant increases over the past two decades, according to accurate new satellite data. On average, global sea-levels have been rising at about three millimeters (mm) a year, however, this masks large differences between regions of the world. While some regions have seen sea-level rises of 12 mm a year, others have actually seen decreases of about 12 mm a year. The results are based on radar readings from the European Space Agency (ESA) over an 18-year period from October 1992 to March 2010. ESA used its satellites to send radar pulses to the sea surface below, recording the time delay in its return and creating a precise measurement of their height above the surface. Special report: Sea-level rises . Scientists say sea-level rises are the result of the expansion of water due to rising temperatures, melting of glaciers and the melting of polar ice sheets. The worst hit regions over the past two decades, according to the ESA data, have been the Pacific countries of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and vulnerable Pacific islands like the Solomon Islands. The Philippines for one is already frequently subjected to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rain, with seasonal monsoon rains in August killing at least 11 people. Scientists suggest regions that have seen high sea level rises over the past 20 years will not necessarily continue to see higher than average sea-level rises in the future. ""We suspect that the bigger the differences get, the more they will tend to level out in the future,"" says Robert Meisner, a spokesperson for ESA. However, a recent study of coastal cities still predicted the Philippines' capital Manila would see its vulnerability to flooding double by the end of the century, due to sea-level rises. In some regions of the world, the increasingly accurate sea level data is being used by planners to mitigate against the risk of flooding. See also: Five cities battling flooding, heats and storms . In Venice, where the sea-level data was released, engineers are constructing a new set of tidal barriers to protect the historic city. The city, which attracts millions of tourists every year, is seeing sea-level rises of around 2 mm per year, together with slow, mostly natural, subsidence of about another 2 mm every year. The new $7.9 billion-barrier system will see giant barriers placed on the sea floor around Venice. When the water levels rise, air will be pumped into the barriers raising them up to block the tidal flow and protect the city from flooding. The system is due to be completed in 2014 and is expected to be able to protect the city for the next 20 years.","Global sea-levels rose by an average of 3 mm a year over the past two decades .

"New York (CNN) -- Two Andy Warhol masterpieces are expected to sell for more than $100 million combined when they go up for auction next month in New York. Warhol's ""Coca-Cola (3)"" will be auctioned at Christie's on November 12, followed by his ""Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)"" on November 13 at Sotheby's. ""Coca-Cola (3)"", a 1962 painting by the late artist, depicts a human-size Coca-Cola bottle, and is one of the artist's most iconic images. The auction house estimates the painting, which has resided in the same private collection for almost two decades, will go for between $40 million and $60 million. ""At a time when international top collectors are looking for blue-chip masterpieces, nothing is more iconic ...,"" Brett Gorvy, a chairman at Christie's, said in a press release. ""Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)"", part of Warhol's vaunted ""Death and Disaster"" series, has been in a private collection since 1988 and has rarely been viewed in public. Sotheby's puts its auction value as possibly more than $60 million. Last year, Warhol, one of the pioneers of pop art, was one of the world's top-selling artists, posthumously generating eight figures in sales. ""Silver Car Crash"" will be on display in London on October 12 before it heads to auction. ""Coca-Cola(3)"" will be on display in London October 12-18 and in New York from November 8-12.","Paintings by pop artist will be auctioned one day apart .

"(CNN) -- Christiane Amanpour has urged news industry leaders and politicians to protect journalism with proper funding and respect for human rights, including freedom of the press. In a speech to a major gathering of television executives in Morocco on Thursday, CNN's Chief International Correspondent painted a picture of a vital industry squeezed by cost cutting on one hand and aggressive political interference on the other. ""What we are is story-tellers,"" Amanpour told the opening session of NewsXchange which brings together broadcasters from around the world. Without that commitment to storytelling, the industry would lose its reason to exist and society would lose the ability to hold politicians to account, she said. ""Good journalism is good business,"" Amanpour said, addressing a news industry fraught with concern about falling advertising budgets, challenges from the Internet and fears over the cost of maintaining news coverage. ""Without the storytellers there is no business; there is no successful business."" Amanpour said that politicians were putting increasing pressure on journalists; particularly those from their own national and local media. She called for a recommitment to the principle of the freedom of the press, and a move away from the demonization of journalists themselves. She described the U.S. administration of President Barack Obama as the most ""litigious against journalists that we have had in decades,"" making clear it was not just a problem in emerging democracies such as Turkey, Cairo and Sri Lanka. On Sri Lanka, where the government has attacked media coverage of its human rights record in the victory over Tamil Tiger rebels, Amanpour urged Commonwealth leaders meeting there this week to hold the Colombo government to account: ""I do hope that they will put freedom of press and human rights at the top of their agenda."" At the same time Amanpour made clear journalists had a responsibility themselves to protect balance in their work and also not to portray every politician or person in authority as vain or corrupt. ""We are also at risk of further tearing down the fabric of civil society by adding to the notion that every form of authority is simply useless; hopeless.""

"Washington (CNN) -- If there's a contest for worst travel experience of the year, United Airlines Flight 857 might be in the running. The plane departed San Francisco on Sunday for a 13-hour trip to Shanghai. But most of the 262 passengers didn't get to China until Tuesday evening -- three days late -- after an unplanned and prolonged layover in Anchorage, Alaska. About three hours into the flight, the United jetliner was diverted to Anchorage because of broken bathrooms. When a replacement plane arrived Monday, it also was grounded because of mechanical problems, prompting most of the passengers to catch a third plane Tuesday. ""It was just one thing after the other,"" said Kristin Bishop, who was on a business trip from Chicago. ""It was honestly unbelievable. We couldn't believe it. It definitely was the flight from hell."" Flight 857 shows the impact -- and limits -- of the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights, designed to protect passengers from being held on tarmac-bound jets. In this instance, United appeared to go to great lengths to avoid violating the tarmac rule, which fines airlines if they keep passengers on ground-bound planes more than four hours, with some exceptions. But a string of delays and mechanical problems plagued the voyage almost from the very beginning. Passengers said the the flight left San Francisco at 2 p.m. Sunday, and the first inkling of trouble came three hours later, when the pilot announced a detour to Anchorage because of problems with several of the Boeing 777's lavatories. According to Bishop, the captain announced, ""You may have noticed some lavatories aren't working. We're making an unplanned stop in Anchorage."" When the plane landed, Bishop said, the passengers sat for an hour and a half before they were allowed to get off and wait in a secure area. That wait lasted about four hours, Bishop said, before they got word that the flight was canceled and that a replacement plane would arrive the next day. ""They told us to wait in line and get our meal and hotel vouchers. But it just took them hours and hours to make that announcement, and there was only one guy handing out the vouchers,"" Bishop said. ""And they were checking us off one-by-one, so it took like 10 minutes per person to get your voucher, and there was like 280 of us, I believe."" When all was said and done, passengers got one $12 meal voucher, Bishop said. Bishop said she was issued her hotel voucher shortly after midnight, and the airline refused to release people's luggage, which contained clothing and medication. The bad luck continued Monday. When passengers arrived at 11 a.m. for the 1 p.m. flight, they were informed that the flight had been delayed 2Â½ hours, Bishop said. Once on the second plane, they waited a couple more hours before the captain made an announcement. ""They announced that that plane also has broke down,"" Bishop said. ""The captain acknowledged that it was ironic, which is one way to put it."" Passengers were told that another replacement plane would arrive Tuesday. Bishop said she opted to catch a red-eye plane back. For several dozen passengers who opted to take that overnight flight to San Francisco, there was added drama when lightning harmlessly struck their plane. In a statement Wednesday, United said it provided its customers with hotel accommodations and meal options and provided a different Boeing 777 aircraft. It made no mention of that aircraft's mechanical problems. ""We sincerely apologize to our customers for the delays and are fully refunding their tickets. We are also actively reaching out to our customers to offer additional compensation,"" the statement read. A Department of Transportation spokesman said Wednesday that the agency had received one complaint. ""We sent the complaint to United and asked them to reply to the passenger,"" Bill Mosley said. Meanwhile, Bishop says she still doesn't have her luggage. ""The luggage is in China. Hopefully, I'll get it back,"" she said.","Flight from San Francisco to Shanghai landed after lavatories broke .

"(CNN) -- Spain's unemployment rate rose to a record high of 27.2% in the first quarter of 2013, the Spanish National Institute of Statistics said Thursday. The figure represented an increase of 1.1 % from the previous quarter, as recession continues to take its toll on the debt-stricken nation. Francisco Carrizo, 37, a Venezuelan teacher from Madrid, told CNN that unemployment is at ""preposterous levels"" and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's center-right government is feeding the Spanish people a ""bunch of lies.""

He said many of his students are considering emigrating for higher education to improve their job prospects, fueling fears that Spain is undergoing a ""brain drain.""

However, the spokesman said the protest movement was smaller than in other countries and the Spanish population was ""extremely reasonable."" Spain, the fourth-largest economy in the eurozone, is suffering its second recession in three years, and its ailing banking industry has had to draw on the eurozone's bailout fund to stay afloat. In December, European finance ministers approved a 39.5 billion euro ($51.6 billion) bailout for Spain's banks, which suffered after the collapse of the country's property bubble. But the Mediterranean country has stopped short of following in the footsteps of Greece, Ireland and Portugal in requesting a full-blown sovereign bailout from the eurozone's rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism. To stave off a bailout, Rajoy's administration has been forced to implement harsh austerity measures to keep government borrowing costs sustainable while ensuring larger eurozone partners, such as Germany, remain onside.","Spain's unemployment rate climbs to a new record high of 27.2% .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron urged the international community Thursday to help Somalia's feeble government tackle piracy, militants and hunger. Otherwise, he said, the world risks terror threats from the troubled African nation. World leaders met Thursday in London to address terror and a raging insurgency in the Horn of Africa nation and find ways to resolve other critical problems including famine and weak leadership that have dogged the nation for decades. Representatives from 40 countries, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, attended the conference on stabilizing and rebuilding Somalia after decades of war. ""These problems in Somalia don't just affect Somalia. They affect us all,"" Cameron said at the event. ""In a country where there is no hope, chaos, violence and terrorism thrive,"" he said. ""Pirates are disrupting vital trade routes and kidnapping tourists. Young minds are being poisoned by radicalism, breeding terrorism that is threatening the security of the whole world."" Look at a high-res gallery of Somalia turmoil . Cameron said the world cannot afford to look the other way any more. ""If the rest of us just sit back and look on, we will pay a price for doing so,"" he said. ""For two decades, politicians in the West have too often dismissed the problems in Somalia as simply too difficult and too remote to deal with."" Clinton pledged to boost U.S. efforts in the nation, and said the focus should be on political progress and bolstering security. ""The transitional federal government was always meant to be just that â€”transitional,"" she said. "" It is past time for that transition to occur, and for Somalia to have a stable government. "" Somalia has not had a central government since 1991, and the Islamist Al-Shabaab has waged war against the transitional federal government for years. Clinton said the United States will continue to work with Somali officials to create jobs, provide health and education services, and conflict resolution. ""And today I'm pleased to announce that the United States is providing an additional $64 million in humanitarian assistance to the Horn of Africa countries,"" she said. She said the funds bring the total U.S. emergency assistance to the region up to more than $934 million since last year, including more than $211 million for life-saving programs in Somalia. Thursday's session aimed to galvanize the international community to develop a more comprehensive approach to addressing Somalia. ""We are realistic -- Somalia's problems cannot be solved in a day, but its people deserve a better future, and our own security requires their country to become more stable,"" U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said. The meeting comes a day after the U.N. Security Council voted to increase the African Union force in Somalia from about 12,000 to close to 18,000 troops to help battle Al-Shabaab. ""We must keep up the pressure on Al-Shabaab so that their grip on Somalia continues to weaken,"" Clinton said. The terror group, which announced recently that it joined al Qaeda, has lost ground but remains a potent threat in the country. The international community hopes the bolstered force will further degrade the group, creating space for a political solution. Established in 2004, Somalia's transitional government is weak and needs significant capacity building to consolidate the country's security gains with political ones. The international community wants it to meet a timeline for establishing a new government, including writing a constitution, before August when its mandate expires. The crisis in Somalia has drawn in neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia, which have both sent troops directly, while Uganda, Djibouti and Burundi are contributing peacekeepers. The United States has used drones to target militants in Somalia. Adding to Somalia's burdens is the fight against famine, which has forced a constant stream of refugees into neighboring nations. The United Nations declared an end to the famine recently, but said the hunger situation is still dire.","40 countries and international organizations attend the event .

"(CNN) -- Officials from the Massachusetts Port Authority issued an apology Wednesday after conducting a fire training exercise at Boston Logan International Airport on the 12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks. ""The fire department will be training this morning. Smoke on the airfield is part of the training,"" the airport's Twitter account announced. In response to negative reactions on social media sites, the port authority, which operates the airport, said in a statement, ""Massport apologizes for conducting the fire training exercise and understands that it may have offended many of those touched by the events of Sept. 11."" ""It's just dumb,"" Gov. Deval Patrick said. ""The timing could not be worse."" American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 traveled out of Logan and struck the World Trade Center towers in New York City after being hijacked on September 11, 2001. The terror attack orchestrated by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden killed 2,977 people in New York City; Washington, DC; and Pennsylvania, in the worst such attack in U.S. history. Steve MacDonald, spokesman for the Boston Fire Department, told CNN on Wednesday that the department had no involvement and that the airport used its own fire department for the exercise. ""Safety and security is our top priority and constant vigilance and readiness is critical, but the exercise should not have taken place on the anniversary of 9/11,"" Massport's apology stated. ""The airport community recognizes the day with moments of silence, a service in the chapel, and a wreath at the 9/11 memorial.""

At the heart of her life and art is a childlike sincerity. The 40-year-old former director of an aftercare program sees people as full of troubled stories but essentially worth connecting to. Moxie is part of the ""indie craft"" generation whose slow, repetitive work is an antidote to and comment on today's fast-paced world. Their work is featured in magazines like ""Make"" and ""Craft"" and the documentary ""Handmade Nation."" She also has a shop on Etsy. Even before her creative career took off, Moxie simplified her life and identity by changing her name to her nickname. She tried many crafts before stumbling, through a children's workshop, on feltmaking. Like a crayon, felt is a colorful, harmless material reminiscent of childhood. Turning airy tresses of bright wool into a flat sheet of felt came easy to her and evoked her sense of play. ""What would happen if I ...?"" she asked herself, then started poking ""a bajillion times."" Finally the wool formed into a solid, sculptured mass of fiber. ""Each poke, you are deciding what the piece will be and mean,"" she said. ""There is a lot of possibility in the slowness and simplicity of the tool."" She chatted with CNN.com. Following is an edited transcript. CNN: How does your personal story, growing up as a ""Jewish marshmallow in northern California,"" influence your art? Moxie: Talk about a clash of wealth and status. Back when Marin County (outside San Francisco) had a poor section, I grew up in tiny crap houses next to the wealthiest people in California. I come from a working-class family with complicated family dynamics. In the last five years I lost both my parents, which is not exactly a tsunami tragedy, but it's powerful stuff when you've had a complicated relationship. I did an embroidery piece from the perspective of being behind a crowded street with a lot of people. That was about my parents. That was about loss. You never stop missing your parents. You never stop knowing life is different when they are gone. But life is so enriched with that knowledge, too. Their deaths really focused me as a working person to ask why we are here on this planet. I don't think it's to say yes to people who want us to do the wrong things. We all have a complicated back story and I'm sure it's there in my work. CNN: Your ""Hunger"" series (priced $80 to $400 each) featured doll parts being gobbled up by felted aliens. What was that about? Moxie: There is a whimsy and desperate nature and a shameful feeling to some of those creatures. It is just about my feelings about humanity -- embracing it and also being repelled. (When) every question I could answer poses for me more questions. That's when I know my piece is working. CNN: How did working with children influence you? Moxie: I was teaching an after-school program for 65 kids and hiring artists to come in once a week to teach them. I learned along with them when I hired Nikola Davidson, a (flat) needle felter. ... I was like someone playing with a new toy, getting some satisfaction from the look, feel and whimsy of it. I started wondering what would happen if I made up stories for myself and made 3-D finger puppets to tell my story. No one else had done anything like that with felt. If someone gave me clay at the same time, would it have been the same transformational effect? I don't know. It's hard to say what your own outliers are. CNN: What's your technique? Moxie: Wool, like every animal hair, has scales up and down each fiber. My industrial felting needle has notches on it. When I poke it into the wool, the needle opens and shuts the scales so they lock like Velcro. Basically the wool is my clay and the needle is my fingertips. I poke it where I want it to indent. I add more wool where I want to build shape. CNN: Is that connecting of fibers a metaphor for the connection you want your art to make? Moxie: I believe in the high five. Everyone has a context, a history that no one can know like you know your own. I look for the opportunity every day to celebrate, in a spontaneous and deliberate way, to laugh with someone in a grocery line about something funny that happens or to give someone change for a dollar. I'll offer to high five you. I'm not a special ed kid or anything. I just believe in the potential of people. My day will only be what I make it, and I look for ways to feel human every day. One way is to connect to you. I encourage everyone to try it. CNN: How does doubt and fear influence you? Moxie: More than anything else, I've mastered the ability to ignore the voice in my head that tells me I don't know how to do anything. Some people call it the lizard brain, and it never goes away. I've learned to just do it anyway -- not that I'm not afraid. CNN: Do you listen to or watch anything while felting? Moxie: I can't watch films that are important to me, like any cinematography. I don't watch TV. I listen to podcasts like ""You Look Nice Today: A Journal of Emotional Hygiene,"" ""Stitching n  Junk,"" and ""WireTap."" A relatively new one, ""Back to Work,"" is about productivity and creative process. It's about how to stop getting distracted by people teaching you not to be distracted, and putting your butt in the chair. I also love ""WTF,"" because I'm an old-school stand-up comedy nerd and Marc Maron, the host, is really smart and complicatedly broken. He interviews his colleagues and sometimes talks about how broken they are. That is white hot, really good.

"(CNN) -- Williams has turned to Brazilian Felipe Massa to boost its flagging F1 fortunes, the British based team confirming his signing for the 2014 season Monday. Williams, once a major force in the constructors' championship, has claimed just a single point in 2013 and has parted company with Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado. In his place comes the 32-year-old Massa, surplus to requirements at Ferrari after the signing of Kimi Raikkonen, but with a wealth of Grand Prix experience. He will partner Finland's Valtteri Bottas as Williams looks to revive its flagging fortunes. ""We are delighted to be able to confirm our 2014 driver line-up and welcome Felipe into the Williams family,"" said team principal Frank Williams. ""He is an exceptional talent and a real fighter on the race track; he also brings a wealth of experience as we begin a new chapter in our story."" Massa, runner up to Lewis Hamilton in the 2008 title race, has 11 wins and 36 podium finishes in his F1 career, but has had to play second fiddle to Fernando Alonso at Ferrari in recent seasons. ""When I was a kid, I always dreamed about racing for Williams, Ferrari or McLaren and I'm glad to be signing with another icon of the sport following my time at Ferrari,"" he said. ""With such a major change of regulations in 2014, I hope my experience will be useful in helping the team in its effort to move on from a difficult period,"" he added. Read: Massa's emotional return to Hungary . Bottas impressed Williams with his performance to put their car third on the grid after qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal this season, but he was unable to capitalize in the race. Maldonado, who gave Williams a surprise victory in last season's Spanish Grand Prix, has been unable to build on that promise and it is unclear if he will secure a seat with another team in 2014. ""We wish him well for the future,"" said Williams, who has signed Massa and Bottas to multi-year contracts. His team last won the constructors' title -- the last of nine -- back in 1997, with Jacques Villeneuve claiming the drivers' crown. Meanwhile, Raikkonen will miss the final two races of this season due to a long-term back problem that requires surgery. The injury flared up at September's race in Singapore, and the 34-year-old Finn has now decided to have an operation so he is fit for the start of next season. His Lotus team may promote third driver Davide Valsecchi, according to the F1 website, or give reserve Jerome d'Ambrosio a runout in the GPs in Austin and Sao Paulo.","Williams signs Felipe Massa for 2014 F1 season .

"(CNN) -- With hundreds of millions of Africans owning mobile phones, citizens are becoming increasingly well connected. This is providing a powerful opportunity for citizens to access critical information about their parliaments and to report on human rights violations, corruption and poor service delivery. These interventions are amplifying the voices of marginalized communities and helping citizens to hold governments to account. For citizens to actively participate in democracy, it is critical that they are able to access information on parliamentary proceedings and elected representatives. MySociety is contributing to this process. It has partnered with local organizations across Africa to build sites like Mzalendo in Kenya and Odekro in Ghana, which enable citizens to access information about parliamentary proceedings and their elected representatives, rate their MPs and gain a better understanding about government's inner workings. They've taken this process one step further in South Africa. The Open Democracy Advice Centre has created a platform where citizens can submit Freedom of Information Requests. A data repository has been created online, enabling journalists, analysts and campaigners to utilize this information to hold government to account and campaign for improved service delivery. Read this: 10 African tech startups you need to know . There's a real thirst for this information in Africa. In Nigeria, a simple application created by developer Pledge 51 enables citizens to access their constitution by mobile phone and has been downloaded more than 750,000 times. During protests sparked by last year's fuel crisis, where an increase in the price of fuel resulted in soaring commodity prices, this enabled citizens to exercise their rights against police forces. Misinformation fueled this crisis, with few citizens understanding the new fuel subsidy payment or oil revenue share in their country. A local organization called BudgIT aimed to address this by generating simple infographics which took citizens through these complex processes in a visual format. Utilizing the power of social media, this sparked more informed debates and dialogue that contributed to restoring order. The team has since produced a whole series of images that breakdown the Nigerian budget by state and sector, enabling citizens to better understand the country's budget and to utilize this information to ensure that allocated funds are translated into improved services. Across the continent, platforms are being developed that enable citizens to use SMS from basic phones to report challenges in service delivery. In the impoverished Khayelitsha township in Cape Town, residents have submitted around 3,000 reports on issues like poor sanitation, electricity and transport to the Lungisa platform from their mobile phones, Facebook and the web. Remarkably, most of the issues have been resolved by the city council. Read this: African innovation can take on the world . In Northern Uganda, the brutal Lord's Resistance Army conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people, leaving infrastructure and service delivery in dire straits. A Peace, Recovery and Development Plan has been put in place but progress is limited. Only a few health centers have been established, there's a severe shortage of drugs, medical workers and equipment and corruption is commonplace. CIPESA has created a platform populated with information on health programs being implemented in the region and citizen journalists are able to submit reports, photographs and audio footage describing the real situation on the ground, whilst Voluntary Sector Accountability Committees established by WOUGNET are utilizing a similar platform to report on corrupt practices and poor governance. The data collected is being used by the NGOs to hold government to account and advocate for improved services. In many African countries, youth often feel excluded from the political process. As young people are the biggest consumers of technology, platforms are being developed that enable them to become more actively engaged. In Kenya, Youth Agenda is utilizing an SMS platform to encourage youth to vet their leaders according to policies and attributes instead of along tribal lines. The platform is also used to gauge political opinion. The feedback is collated into reports which are fed into government, giving youth a voice and allowing them to contribute to the development of policy. Until 2009, Kibera -- one of the world's largest slums and home to more than 250,000 people -- appeared only as a blank on online maps. This made it easy for government to ignore the needs of its citizens. Map Kibera has equipped young activists with GPS-enabled phones and has supported them in creating a map of the region, part of a wider program that empowers youth to raise awareness of the challenges faced by their communities and advocate for change. Read this: Tech hub working on 'next big idea' Plan Cameroon has taken this process a step further in three districts. Once youth have mapped their area, they populate the map with data on service delivery such as access to water points, clean water and hygiene facilities. Local councilors and activists are utilizing this data to mobilize the involved communities to demand better services and advocate for change. Technology applications can be developed anywhere and what's exciting about many of these initiatives is that they're being devised locally. Technology innovation hubs are springing up across the continent. These state-of-the-art facilities enable technologists and social activists to access high-speed internet, events and mentoring, as well as creating a collaborative environment that galvanizes the tech community. This is beginning to have a significant effect on the number and quality of projects being developed locally. Homegrown solutions are often most effective, as local communities are best able to understand the complex local needs, behaviors and nuances. Some of these hubs such as Jozi Hub in Johannesburg and Co-Creation Hub in Lagos, Nigeria, have targeted programs to support transparency initiatives, thus catalyzing this process. Undoubtedly, technology isn't a panacea for all social problems. And at times, such as when the technology utilized isn't locally available or where governments lack capacity to respond to issues being reported it can be entirely inappropriate. However, when combined with well devised programs, their power to reach the previously unreachable and to bring the voices of citizens closer to government makes them a significant contributor to the process of ensuring that government's best serve the interests of their citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Loren Treisman.","Mobile phones are helping African citizens hold their governments to account .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- As Israel's top housing official announced Sunday the details of plans to build new settlements on disputed territory, critics warned that the construction could derail upcoming Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Opposition Israeli politicians sharply criticized the announcement, which comes days before Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are set to resume long-stalled direct talks on Wednesday. ""(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu has to decide which government he is heading, a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement,"" said Shelly Yachimovich, head of the Labor Party and the Israeli opposition. New Israel settlement plan casts shadow on talks . She described the plans for fresh construction as a ""'finger in the eye' of the United States, Europe, the Palestinians and the majority of the Israeli people that are seeking peace."" Finance Minister Yair Lapid said the settlements ""are not conducive"" to the peace-talk process and described the move to build more units as a mistake. But Housing Minister Uri Ariel stood by his announcement and said the government was asking for bids from construction contractors to build more than 1,000 new settlement units. ""The Israeli government is lowering the cost of living in all parts of Israel,"" he said. ""No country in the world will accept dictates from other countries where it is allowed to build and where not to."" Israel will continue to market homes and build all over the country, he said. ""This is the right thing to do,"" he said, ""both in Zionist and economic terms."" Palestinian leaders criticize decision . But the news that Israeli authorities have given preliminary approval for new settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem -- considered illegal under international law -- has angered senior Palestinian figures and prompted condemnation from Israel's Western allies. The issue of Israeli settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators agreed to return to the table after intense diplomatic efforts by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on a visit to the region last month. On Sunday, Palestinian chief peace negotiator Saeb Erekat criticized the settlement announcement, calling for international condemnation. ""This is more than a provocation. This is more than poking us in the eye,"" he said. ""This is something absolutely unbelievable, unacceptable and something that should be condemned as soon as possible."" Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, decried what she said was the failure of the international community to hold Israel accountable for its actions. ""We are not surprised, but at the same time, we are dismayed at the American role,"" she told CNN Sunday. ""If the U.S. is serious about peace, it has to stop, it has to make Israel stop its settlement activities, it has to curb Israel's veracious appetite for Palestinian land and resources, and it has to tell Israel that it must abide by international law and the requirements of peace."" Israel's renewed plans of constructing settlements, she said, are undercutting the proposal to achieve Mideast peace that officials have long touted: the two-state solution, which would create separate Israeli and Palestinian states. ""It has rendered the peace talks entirely irrelevant because it is unilaterally destroying the two-state solution,"" she said, ""stealing Palestinian land, building more settlements in Jerusalem, and then saying it wants to talk about the two-state solution while effectively it is acting to destroy it."" Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman, said Sunday that the construction would not impact peace talks. ""How is this a problem if Israel is building in communities that in any way in any possible future peace agreement will stay part of Israel in any case?"" he said. ""I think there's more posturing here, there's more spinning here, than reality. The truth is the way to solve all these issues is through negotiations, and we're ready to do that."" A sporting push for peace . U.S. does not ""accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday that the United States had been in touch with the Israeli government over the decision and was making its concerns known. ""Our position on settlements has not changed. We do not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity and oppose any efforts to legitimize settlement outposts,"" she said. Psaki said she had no indication that the Israeli announcement would impact on the negotiations. Kerry, she added, ""has made clear that he believes both of the negotiating teams are at the table in good faith and are committed to working together to make progress."" Israel: 26 Palestinian prisoners to be released . As the talks near, Israeli officials have approved the release of 26 Palestinian prisoners. Authorities said they would publish a list of the prisoners online Sunday night. The prisoners will be released at least two days after the list is published, the Israeli government said in a statement. As they approved the release Sunday, the statement said, a committee of Israeli Cabinet ministers stressed ""that if any of the released prisoners return to hostile activity against the state of Israel, they will be returned to continue serving their sentences."" Amid tensions, a border shooting . The Israeli military shot and killed an unarmed Palestinian Saturday along the border fence between Gaza and Israel, an Israeli military source said. Explosive devices have been planted in the area in the past, an Israeli military spokesman said. ""He began crossing the fence with a suspicious object in his possession,"" the spokesman said. ""Upon crossing the fence the soldiers fired warning shots in the air. The suspect failed to comply. He did not stop, so the soldiers, after exhausting other means, fired towards the suspect. The incident is being currently investigated."" Palestinian medical sources said the Palestinian had been shot in the head and chest. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Vladimir Duthiers and Talal Abu Rahma contributed to this report.","NEW: Chief Palestinian negotiator: Israel's settlement announcement is ""unacceptable""

"(CNN) -- Summon Siri, the digital assistant contained within the iPhone 4S, and ask: ""Why is it so hard to find good help these days?"" ""I don't know what you mean,"" answers the robotic female voice. Despite all of the quirky, saucy and entertaining responses to oddball remarks -- like ""I'm drunk"" (Siri returns a list of taxi services) or ""What do you look like?"" (""Shiny"") -- Siri is unable to deliver on many basic commands. For example, the voice-command service refuses to launch applications. (""I can't do that for you, Mark. I'm sorry to let you down."") The iPhone 4S has an improved camera and a button on the lock screen to quickly access it, but Siri is not a photographer. (""I can't take your pictures for you."") Twitter is embedded in the new version of Apple's mobile software, but ask Siri to tweet, and it says, ""Sorry Mark, I can't help you with Twitter."" A glaring omission, which would happen to be a major technical undertaking for Apple, is the inability for third-party developers to tie their apps into Siri. At launch, Apple included data from Yelp for restaurant and retail recommendations, and the Wolfram Alpha search engine for a wide swath of data queries such as city populations and currency conversions. However, the other 500,000 or so programs on the App Store can't interact with Siri. Brady Forrest, who organizes technology conferences in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he'd like to be able to call up Siri to identify songs with Shazam, get food delivered or order a product on Amazon.com. But this would be possible only if Siri's functions were unlocked in the same way a developer can access the phone's camera or gyroscope. ""My concern is that Siri will be more constrained by 'biz dev' than by technology,"" Forrest said, basing his worries on Apple favoring Yelp over Google for local business reviews. What's more frustrating is that the original Siri app, which Apple shut down after the iPhone 4S was released, was able to accomplish tasks through other services. It could order movie or concert tickets, book restaurant reservations using OpenTable, and call a cab via Taxi Magic. It could also tweet. Perhaps an open framework is coming. Apple typically does not discuss future releases, and the Siri reborn for the iPhone 4S is less than a week old. On its website, Apple lists 18 apps that Siri works with, two of which, Maps and Yelp, are U.S.-only. The company says it is still working to add new features to the service. ""Siri is currently in beta, and we'll continue to improve it over time,"" Apple's website says. For the things Siri can do, it (she?) does them well. It can pull up directions, transcribe written notes, create calendar appointments, and remind me to take out the trash at 9 p.m. or whenever I arrive home . Siri's voice recognition technology is adept at interpreting my mumbles and whispers. (It's still awkward to talk to a gadget in public.) And whether I say ""text"" or ""message"" or ""send an SMS,"" Siri knows what I mean. But as I turn to Siri more frequently, I have run into some walls. I can dictate text messages and e-mails, which can then be read back to me, but Siri won't read me my e-mail messages aloud, which would be useful for when I'm driving. And Siri can't record audio to Apple's own app. ""I haven't yet learned dictation, Mark. You'll have to use the Voice Memos app for that,"" Siri says. While Siri can't access songs contained within MOG, Pandora or Spotify, it can play an album from Apple's own music app, much like the old Voice Control feature. Yet it can't start a movie stored in Apple's videos app. Using Voice Control instead of Siri remains an option, which is convenient because Siri requires an Internet connection. But when the phone doesn't have Web access, say in the subway, the system does not automatically switch from Siri to Voice Control. Customers around the world have complained that Siri can only operate in English, French and German. Apple says more languages, including Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean and Spanish, will be integrated next year. Maybe demanding an assistant be quadrilingual is asking too much. Comedian Stephen Colbert poked fun at the high expectations for Siri on his show, jokingly asking his phone to write lines for him. But as users get accustomed to shouting demands at their phones and having them fulfilled, Apple -- like its competitors in Microsoft's Bing or Google's voice search -- has more work to do to translate into voice commands all of the functions that are currently just a few taps away.","Siri, Apple's voice-controlled assistant, is quite good at what it knows how to do .
However, Siri is unable to perform some basic tasks .
Apple says Siri is a ""beta"" and that the company will improve it over time ."
"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- With memories of last year's killer typhoons still fresh, Typhoon Megi roared across the Philippines on Monday, ripping through roofs and cutting off electricity. The cyclone's peak wind speeds decreased as the system moved over the Sierra Madre mountains, but it still packed sustained winds of around 167 kph (103 mph) with gusts up to 204 kph (126 mph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. This is down from peak sustained winds of 212 kph, with gusts up to 259 kph (161 mph), over the weekend. Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, was expected to pick up steam again as it heads over the South China Sea. Current forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Center show the storm heading toward the southeastern China coast, just west of Hong Kong. In the Philippines, five people have died in what the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council is billing as the strongest storm of the year, according to Catherine Martin, manager of disaster management services at the Philippine National Red Cross. Emergency workers pulled the body of Vicente Decena, 53, from a bloated river; a tree fell on the house of Aileen Respicio, 20, killing her and injuring her child. Five others were injured elsewhere, the disaster council reported. Even as it weakened, Megi continued to pose a serious threat. Trees swayed and relentless rains inundated roads. Storm chaser James Cabrera, who was in Luzon, said parts of the Philippines could see 300 to 500 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) of rain. ""Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile, the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses,"" James Reynolds, a storm chaser who is on Luzon, told CNN on Monday. ""We have learned our lessons from the grim experiences we had during typhoons Ondoy [known internationally as Ketsana] and Pepeng [Parma],"" House Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. said, according to the Philippine News Agency. ""We must all cooperate because nature's wrath exempts no one."" A year ago, tens of thousands of people were in evacuation centers as four consecutive typhoons drenched the Philippines. About 500 people were reported dead. Journalist Eduardo Lingao in Manila contributed to this report for CNN.","Typhoon Megi, also known as Typhoon Juan, has weakened further over land .

"(CNN) -- Police expanded their search Friday for a man who either jumped or fell from a small plane as it flew off the Florida coast near Miami. The pilot of the single-engine Piper PA-46 aircraft called air traffic controllers Thursday afternoon to say his passenger -- the only other person on board the flight -- had fallen out of the plane. ""He opened the back door and he just fall down the plane,"" the pilot said, according to a recording of the conversation. The pilot said he was flying at 1,800 feet about two miles from the shore when the man fell. Authorities identified the man as Gerardo Nales, a 42-year-old man from Key Biscayne, Florida. After searching until dark Thursday, authorities resumed their efforts early Friday, expanding the search area based on currents and weather conditions, police said. Police think it's unlikely Nales could have survived the fall. They're describing the search as a recovery mission. A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped. Investigators questioned the 47-year-old pilot but did not release his name. Homicide detectives also are involved, as they are in all death investigations, Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Sgt. Robin Pinkard said. The pilot first told air traffic controllers that a door was open on the plane, then added that a passenger had fallen out. ""I have a door ajar,"" he said, ""and a passenger that fell down."" The Piper PA-46 -- a private plane -- went on to land safely at Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities in New York state are working to identify the remains of an infant found in an upstate river that are believed to be those of a baby missing from Utica since June. Utica Police Sgt. Steve Hauck said a crew of about seven New York State Police divers found the remains in a container in a very specific part of the Mohawk River. They believe they belong to Levon Wameling, who was 10 months old when he was reported missing. Following ""credible information from State Police,"" investigators searched the river Friday morning, according to Utica Police Chief Mark Williams. ""It's safe to say we were told a narrow area of where (the remains) might be and we found (them) there. We have to do our due diligence to confirm the identity, but we are confident they are the remains (of Levon),"" Hauck said. The Onondaga County Medical Examiner's Office will conduct the autopsy. Hauck said there is no official time table for when the autopsy results will be available but said identification would likely come first. Determining the cause of death might take months. He said investigators have DNA samples from Levon and his family to compare to the remains. He added that autopsies of children often take longer than those of adults and that being submerged in the river affected the remains. On Thursday, the missing the child's father, Jevon Wameling, was arrested by New York State Police and accused of breaking into a home in a suburb of Utica to steal jewelry and money. Hauk wouldn't say whether Wameling had anything to do with the tip leading police to the as-yet unidentified remains, citing the ongoing investigation, but the circumstances of Levon's disappearance raised questions about the boy's father from the start. Wameling took two weeks to go to an attorney's office then call police to report Levon's disappearance, authorities said back in June. ""Based on the information that he's given us, we have a lot of concern,"" Williams said at the time. ""We have a problem with what he says,"" Williams said. ""There's no question about it."" The father told investigators he took the child out for a late-night walk and locked himself out of his home, so he put the boy down on the small front porch and went around back to find a way in. When he opened the front door, he said, the baby was gone. ""We have a lot of investigative work to be done on this case still,"" Williams said Friday. ""We're going to make sure the person responsible for this is charged."" Levon's first birthday would have been August 31, police said.","New York State Police find the remains of a child in a river based on a tip .

"(CNN) -- The fourth typhoon to hit the Philippines in a month came ashore east of the capital, Manila, on Saturday morning, bringing heavy rain, flooding, and washing away shanty houses near the coast. Typhoon Mirinae quickly moved west into the South China Sea and became a tropical storm. It was forecast to continue due west and then take a slight turn south, hitting Vietnam in about 48 hours, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. There were power flashes across Manila, as the storm hit Saturday and cut the electricity supply, videographer James Reynolds said. The storm was weaker than expected, he said, but it still brought fierce winds and lots of rain. ""The wind and the rain and the floods have still caused quite a considerable amount of damage, certainly in the southeastern portion of the city, which is where we were,"" Reynolds told CNN by phone from Manila. ""We saw many shanty-type houses that had been washed away and residents frantically try to get hold of their household material."" Are you there? Share photos, video of the weather . The storm dropped at least 85 millimeters (3.3 inches) of rain on Manila. The city of Daet, on the eastern coast, received 149 millimeters (5.8 inches) of rain, and Virac, which sits on an island that juts into the Pacific, received 72 millimeters (2.8 inches) of rain.

The first of the four typhoons to batter the Philippines happened in late September, when Ketsana drenched the island nation with its heaviest rainfall in 40 years. Eighty percent of Manila flooded and more than 420 people died. See images from Mirinae . Flooding from Ketsana has lasted well into October, and tens of thousands of people are still in evacuation centers, according to the disaster coordinating council. On October 3, Typhoon Parma made landfall in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon, the largest of the Philippine islands. It destroyed 55,000 houses and killed more than 430 people. Last week a third typhoon, Lupit, narrowly missed making landfall but still brought lots of rain to the Philippines.","Storm hits Saturday, cuts electricity supply, videographer says .

"(CNN) -- When the Republican candidates were asked what they would bring to the White House if elected, Georgia businessman Herman Cain set himself apart from the career politicians on the stage with him by replying: ""I would bring a sense of humor to the White House, because America's too uptight!"" He could have been describing the others on stage with him Monday night at the GOP presidential candidate debate sponsored by CNN and The Tea Party Express. Here is how they answered the same question: . Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania: Well, mine is pretty obvious. Karen and I have seven children, so we'd add a bedroom or -- and some beds to the White House. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: Well, first of all, I would reduce the White House by kicking out all the White House czars the first day, creating a lot more space. And then, because of Callista's interest, we'd have a lot more music, because of my granddaughter, Maggie, we'd have ballet, and because of my grandson, Robert, we'd have a very large chess set. So it'll all come together. Texas Rep. Ron Paul: I'd bring a bushel basket full of common sense. And I would also bring a course in Austrian economics to teach the people the business cycle and why the Fed creates inflation and depressions and all our unemployment problems. Texas Gov. Rick Perry: It's simple. I'm going to bring the most beautiful, most thoughtful, incredible first lady that this country's ever seen, Anita. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney: You know, one of -- one of my heroes was a man who had an extraordinary turn of phrase. He once said about us, he said, you know, you can count on the Americans to get things right after they've exhausted all the alternatives. And now and then we've made a couple of mistakes. We're quite a nation. And this man, Winston Churchill, used to have his bust in the Oval Office. And if I'm president of the United States, it'll be there again. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann: I would bring a copy of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, and that's it. Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman: And to play to that theme -- my wife's going to kill me for saying this -- but I would bring my -- as a 40-year motorcycle rider, I would bring my Harley-Davidson and my motocross bike.","Candidates tell what changes they would bring to the White House .

"(CNN) -- WJLA anchorman Leon Harris remembers that when the pain began on August 1, it came out of the blue. ""I woke up that Thursday morning prepared to go to the gym and then go to work and have a regular day,"" he said. ""But I had this incredible, sudden pain in my stomach that was something that I have never felt before in my life. It felt like a horse had kicked me."" He admits that wasn't enough to move him to seek help, though he says the pain was worse than other injuries and illnesses. He has had broken bones, surgeries, popped tendons, fallen off a truck, and driven himself to the hospital with severe appendicitis. ""I've actually been run over by a truck -- none of that compared to what I felt in my stomach at that time. ""I'm going through pain unlike any pain I have ever felt in my life and it literally knocked me to the floor and you know, being a stupid guy, a regular guy, I did what most guys do. I said: You know let me just take some Pepto Bismol, let me pop a couple of Gas-X pills, that'll take care of it, it's just gas."" An hour later, his wife, Dawn, who had recently graduated from nursing school, found him writhing in pain on the floor. She immediately got him to a local hospital. Harris credits her for saving his life. He says unequivocally, if she hadn't come upstairs when she did, he wouldn't still be here. He thought he would just spend the night in he hospital and be back to normal the next day. But about 4 o'clock that morning things got serious. ""All of a sudden, the door opened, these guys came rushing in the room saying we've gotta to go to intensive care immediately ... and I was sort of in a fog, not on any drugs at the time except for pain meds. I found out later it was because they said my kidneys were shutting down and my lungs were beginning to fill up with fluid. ""They called my wife and said you need to get here immediately because we need to intubate him -- to put me on a ventilator and they needed her to sign off on it."" When Dawn arrived, he remembers she asked him where his phone charger was. At that moment, he says, his eyes rolled back up in his head and he passed out. ""I was pretty much out from that moment for the next nine days."" So, within 36 hours of that initial ""kick"" in the stomach, Harris was being life-flighted to Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore. ""For you to be life-flighted you've got to be in pretty bad shape,"" he says. Harris got a diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis. ""My pancreas basically decided to start dying and taking my kidneys, my lungs and other internal organs along with it."" He says his doctors described his gut as looking like ""a bomb had gone off inside me."" He adds, ""you don't get symptoms until it's already happening and if you don't get that process stopped quickly enough it can be fatal, and that's what was so dangerous about the situation I was in."" In order to allow his pancreas to heal, Harris says he wasn't allowed to have anything in his mouth for 17 days, relying on feeding tubes for nourishment and a tube down his windpipe to breathe. The main causes of pancreatitis are gallbladder disease and alcohol consumption. Harris has a family history of gallbladder disease. While the specific cause for him is unknown, Harris knows this type of infection can be fatal and he says he came close to dying a couple of times. ""My heart stopped and they actually had to revive me ... at one point they were trying to replace the tube into my windpipe. I flat-lined. They were able to get me revived and the same thing happened the very next day. I had the tubes going down into my windpipe and I just knew that I couldn't breathe. That was the absolute worst part of the whole thing. The pain in my stomach, fine -- that felt like someone had just taken a knife and cut my entire insides out. That hurt. That was nothing compared to not being able to breathe. That sensation of not being able to breathe, it was just like trying to go run a marathon breathing thru a cocktail straw."" He was so uncomfortable, he tried to pull one of the tubes out. ""I punched people, I kicked people. At one point it took 10 people to keep me on the table."" He was restrained, his hands and feet tied down for his own protection. He says hospital staff nicknamed him the beast. Eventually that fight began to take a toll. ""August 9, I just got exhausted and I said I give up, I can't fight this anymore, what's the sense of fighting, and just decided OK, fine, this is God's way of telling me, 'OK buddy this is it' and so that night I begged them to let me die."" But when he closed his eyes, Harris says he saw his wife's face. ""That's when I said I can't quit. If I quit I'm gonna go to hell and I'm not gonna go to hell for quitting. If I go to hell it's gonna be for something else, it won't be for quitting."" Harris recovered and some are calling it miraculous. ""If there is such a thing as a miracle, the night of August 9 is when it happened. I begged to die and by August 10 I had a miracle,"" he said. He has an even bigger appreciation for his wife and two children and the friends and family who stood by him during this ordeal. He also has some advice for other men who may be ignoring what their body is telling them. ""Don't wait until you have as close a brush with leaving this Earth as I did before you decide that you're worth going to see a doctor. ... Don't say 'Eh, I don't need to go see a doctor' --yeah you do!"" Harris continues to recuperate and is back at work. He returned to the anchor desk on September 9.","On August 1, Leon Harris felt terrible pain .

"(CNN) -- Lil Wayne is down on drugs -- for others. For himself, well, it's a different story. The man who infamously told Katie Couric during a 2009 interview ""I'm a gangsta, Miss Katie. I don't take nothing from no one. I do what I want to do,"" has been equally outspoken about his use of ""sizzurp"" or ""purple drank,"" a prescription cough syrup made with a combination of promethazine and codeine. ""Sizzurp"" has even found its way into Lil Wayne's song lyrics, and his issues with substance abuse have been well documented. Promethazine has several uses, including treating allergy symptoms, easing nausea and as a sedative. According to Drugs.com, dangerous side effects can include ""twitching or uncontrollable movements"" of limbs, face, eyes and the tongue. Of course, rappers talking about drug use is nothing new. As is often the case with hip-hop -- which began as a vehicle to document the lives of inner-city youth -- art, more often than not, imitates life. But Lil Wayne's recent hospitalization has cast a spotlight on hip-hop and drug use because of fans' concerns over his past behavior. Scant information has been released about what may have caused the award-winning artist, who was born Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., to have a seizure that landed him in a Los Angeles hospital. His label's publicist confirmed to CNN at the time that the rapper had suffered a seizure. Lil Wayne: I'm 'more than good' And what will happen now that he's out? Talking drug use is one thing. But rehab seldom comes up in the conversation. ""Where hip-hop falls short is in addressing the rehabilitation aspect,"" said writer JasFly, who has reported on the industry. ""Wayne is one of our hip-hop rock stars, but where is the help for him?"" A big star and his proteges . With his monumental success on the charts and devil-may-care attitude, Lil Wayne has in some ways transcended the male dominated hip-hop genre and occupies the rarefied air of one of music's biggest stars. Lil Wayne is not only a platinum-selling artist in his own right, but he's also the man responsible for stars like ""American Idol"" judge Nicki Minaj and rapper Drake. He often appears on songs of other artists as diverse as Kelly Rowland and teen heartthrob Joe Jonas. He also is one of a number of rappers who have openly discussed drug use. In 2011, he and fellow rap superstar Eminem discussed their substance abuse issues with GQ magazine. The New Orleans native, who fans also lovingly call ""Weezy,"" said he quit narcotics, not necessarily by choice, but partly because it was a requirement of his probation after a 2008 arrest in Arizona where authorities allegedly found ecstasy in his backpack. The rapper secured a plea deal and was given probation. ""I wish I could be back on it,"" he told the publication. ""That's how it f**king feels. [cracking himself up] 'How does it feel to be sober?' I'll be like, 'It feels f***ed up.' What do you want me to say? 'It feels great'? No."" The list of those who, like Lil Wayne, have been accused of drug charges is long -- including the recent arrest of rapper Too Short who was charged with a felony count of drug possession after police allegedly found suspected meth on him, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. There has been no information released about how the rapper has pleaded to the charge. The rapper's manager, David Weintraub, denied in a statement to CNN that Too Short had drugs on him at the time of his arrest. ""Any assertion that Short was carrying powder is ridiculous! Every rap fan knows Short's into weed!,"" the statement said. Rapper Snoop Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion in homage to the Rastafarian culture) has been a well-known marijuana user. VH1's reality show ""Love and Hip Hop"" highlighted rapper Joe Budden's addiction and relapse after years of sobriety. ""My two demons are real simple, drugs and depression,"" Budden told the Combat Jack radio show in December. ""They go hand in hand with one another."" Such openness about mental health issues -- and the self-medication that illegal drugs can provide -- has historically not always been the case in the African-American culture. ""The African American community generally has a certain amount of circumspection as it pertains to psychiatry and mental health, and reasonably so,"" said Dr. Drew Pinsky, host of HLN's ""Dr. Drew on Call."" ""(Those medical disciplines) have ill-served that community historically, and there's a certain amount of distrust, and you can't do this work without absolute trust,"" he said. ""There's also a lack of embrace of things like 12-step (programs) and the idea that these are long-term propositions to get better from."" That historical reticence -- coupled with a life of fame that often finds celebs of all races surrounded by entourages who may not be willing to offer tough love -- can contribute to the issue. ""There's also a cultural insulation,"" Pinsky said ""They don't want to change, like many addicts and musicians."" Rap artist DMX appeared on Pinsky's show ""Dr. Drew's Lifechangers"" in 2011 and said he began using drugs at the age of 14, and the wealth he acquired accelerated his drug use. According to Billboard, the rapper has had dozens of arrests, and as of 2010 they tallied 26 convictions -- 11 felonies and 15 misdemeanors. Some of those have included drug charges. Jermaine Hall, editor-in-chief of Vibe magazine, told CNN that some rappers have now moved well beyond drinking and smoking marijuana. Hall said he believes ""the casual drugs are different now."" ""Now we have pills, now we also have Molly (the crystal or powder form of the drug MDMA), and I would say to the late 2000s, we also had the ecstasy rush,"" Hall said. ""So we're dealing with different levels of drugs that are now being considered recreational, which is a very dangerous situation."" A long history in the music business . ""I can mingle with the stars and throw a party on Mars / I am a prisoner, locked up behind Xanax bars"" - Lil Wayne, ""Feel Like Dying"" But journalist and San Francisco State adjunct professor Davey D said drugs have long been a problem in the music industry as a whole, not just hip-hop. Artists referencing drugs goes back as far as jazz star Cab Calloway's ""Reefer Man"" in 1932, and use has been well-known on down through rockers like Kurt Cobain and others who suffered overdoses. ""The whole adage behind 'sex drugs and rock 'n' roll' is something that people kind of conveniently forget about,"" he said. ""Not to say that it's right, but in terms of suddenly saying 'Well these guys are [rapping] about purple syrup' and overlook the LSD and psychedelic stage in music ... is just ridiculous."" Davey D said the issue of drugs in hip hop is ""systemic with an economic incentive to keep it going."" ""When these artists are on drugs and they are able to do their music or it gives them a certain notoriety, then everybody's cool with it because it kind of adds to the allure and mystique,"" he said. ""The artists themselves, sure they should take some responsibility, but if they actually have a substance abuse problem, whether they are a drinker or whether they are someone using mind altering substances...then they actually have a disease that needs to be cured, and I don't know if you suddenly do that on your own. ""So then we have to ask questions of the multimillion-dollar record label that they are on: 'Why are you putting this out and why are you allowing this to exist?'"" Harold Owens, the senior director for MusiCares Musicians Assistance Program -- which is funded by the Grammy Foundation -- has witnessed the addiction struggles of musicians across various genres. He's staged interventions for some. There is a stigma in the hip-hop community, Owens said, about coming clean and discussing it in a genre that many feel has helped promote drug use. ""There could be many sober hip-hop artists -- in the community that have gotten sober, or at least more than a few that just don't talk about it."" Owens said. JasFly, who is also a cast member of the soon-to-debut VH1 reality show ""The Gossip Game,"" which explores the lives of female journalists and bloggers who cover hip-hop, said she worries there may be more of a focus on preserving Lil Wayne's image. Helping him, if that's what he needs, doesn't seem to be a priority, she said. ""There seems to be a lot of concern about Lil Wayne the business,"" she said. ""But what about Dwayne Carter the person?"" CNN's Denise Quan, Eliott McLaughlin and Abbey Goodman contributed to this report.","Lil Wayne's recent hospital stay stirred conversation about hip hop and drugs .

"(CNN) -- My earliest memories of life in Cambodia are clouded -- I strain to recall my biological parents. I do remember waking up each morning, climbing trees to forage for fruit and berries with my cousins, and sitting around a fire each night for the one meal we ate each day. I've always remembered my Yea (grandmother) but time washed away the memory of her face -- if not her presence -- in my life, which I'm told began in a refugee camp. After my adoption, memories of Cambodia lived on in my dreams which I would tell my adopted mother upon waking. These nighttime images of life in my homeland: Were they real? I wondered. One memory is etched clear in my mind: A two-day trip traveling by moped, car and foot only to be left at a building with many infants, toddlers and strange adults. Left alone, I developed a pain in my stomach that seemed to last for days -- no one would tell me why I was abandoned there. I received a package while at the orphanage with pictures and a doll. While the doll was taken away, I was permitted to keep the pictures of these strange white people who held a Cambodian baby. One morning in December 1999, I was taken to a hotel with another little girl. In the car, we were told we would be meeting our new families. When we arrived, I saw the couple from the photos. Again, the pain in my stomach swelled. The airplane landed after 30 hours of flying. I instinctively knew I was never to see my Yea again. It seemed so cruel -- why was this happening to me? I could not stop my tears. I arrived to a large house in Long Island, New York, to find that I had two brothers, Joseph, 5, and Patrick, 7. With them was my sister, Sofia, a 1-year-old Cambodian girl adopted by my American parents a few months after she was born. I had no idea then what an extraordinary family I was entering. I was immediately drawn to my brothers' athletic activities, like baseball and ice hockey, which made it easy to get along with them. I had difficulty connecting with my father, probably because all the caretakers in my life had been female. My father was very patient, giving me ""space"" until I was ready to open up. No matter how cold or distant I was toward him, at the end of every day, he told me he loved me. I could tell by his hugs and the batting lineup when we played tee ball: ""Girls first, Srey first,"" he told my brothers. Six months later, I started to call him ""Dad."" From day one, I had a bond with my new mother. Our first language was soccer. Every day, no matter how cold or rainy, we would kick around a soccer ball. Seeing my enthusiasm for the sport, my mother enrolled me in a soccer league and became the coach. In 2010, I was named the MVP and awarded the Sportsmanship for the New York State High School State Championship. When I received the award I look up into the crowd and there she was my mom, my coach for life shouting my name. My parents selflessly supported me and my siblings in everything that we pursued, somehow finding time to make each of us feel special, safe and loved. As years went by, I began to have questions about my birth parents and my Southeast Asian roots. In response to my curiosity, my parents arranged a trip to my homeland, Cambodia. My mother and I went in the summer of 2009. We visited the orphanages where I had lived, bringing toothbrushes, art supplies and other gifts. We spent several days creating arts and crafts with the children and listening to music. For the older kids -- many of whom were close to my age enjoyed the attention -- we held a dance contest for them. As we laughed together, I saw myself in their faces. We spent eight days searching for my family's village in the northern region of the country. When we entered my village, I instantly recognized the neighbor's reed home, its distinctive bamboo design in the window. An ocean of emotions hit me like waves on the shore. I ran from the car and, as if I had never left, my Yea appeared out of the door of the hut we once shared. We rushed toward one another's arms, I could no longer understand what she was saying but her grasp was tight and I did not want to let go. When I did, she dropped to her knees in tears. ""Forgive me for giving you away,"" were the words of the translator. She looked at me, she added, ""I would do it again -- you are beautiful women."" I picked her up -- her frame so fragile, her eyes showered with tears. She was the Cambodia that I remembered, the source of those mysterious childhood dreams. Back in the hut, Yea unfolded my own undiscovered story. I was born in Khao I Dang, a notorious refugee camp in Thailand where my family had fled. I returned to Cambodia as an infant with my mother, her sisters, and Yea sometime in late 1993 or early 1994. It became apparent that dates and details of my past were obscured by my grandmother's hardships. As we sat in a circle with all of my aunts and cousin, it was evident the only person missing was my mother. According to Yea she died six months after the return from the camp. While Yea wiped away tears, she handed me two photos: one of my mother and another of me as a 3-year-old child. It was my turn to wipe tears from my eyes -- the same eyes as the woman in the photo, the birth mother I had hoped to find and now would never know. As we sat, it felt odd not being able to speak freely with my own grandmother, a translator having to interpret my feelings. I asked my Yea about my childhood. She described me as a hyper child, given to teasing and practical jokes. ""Some things do not change,"" my mother laughed. I shared my experience of going to high school, playing on travel soccer teams that traveled to Europe, having a family, planning for college. My Yea did not seem to understand, I could tell in her eyes she was trying to understand, it suddenly occurred to me our lives ended up so dramatically different. As we sat, Yea turned to my adopted mother and spoke with a sudden harshness in her voice. My grandmother wanted to know if my American family had me working in servitude farming the fields. We were shocked. Our translator explained that the dark tan of my skin that triggered Yea's reaction; in her life, a dark tan suggests hard work on the land rather than long hours of practice on the soccer field. My mother assured Yea I was a girl with many opportunities in America, that I would be educated and would prosper. Watching my mother's attempt to put my Yea at ease, I was struck by how different my life would have been if she had not adopted me. I felt a new level of gratitude my parents, my siblings and my life in America.","Srey Powers, a former Khmer refugee, was adopted from Cambodia at the age of six .
