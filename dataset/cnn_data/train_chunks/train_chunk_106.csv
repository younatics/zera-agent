"(CNN) -- Mammoth cruise ships can be difficult to get around, even in the best of circumstances. In the worst -- which is how one might describe the situation aboard the listing Costa Concordia -- they are near impossible. Yet even before the sun rose Monday, about 120 rescue personnel were out in or around the liner that hit rocks near Tuscany and rolled spectacularly on its side. They were in a race against time, and in a battle with numerous challenges, to try to save survivors or at least recover the bodies of the passengers and crew members who are still missing. Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario . The search was temporarily suspended by noon Monday, after authorities said the vessel had begun to sway, making it dangerous for the crews. But it resumed a short time later, despite a forecast calling for increasingly strong winds that Coast Guard spokesman Filippo Marino said had rescuers worried. They are ""working in very, very bad conditions,"" said Luciano Roncalli of Italy's national fire service. ""It's cold, of course. It's dark during the day and the night. ... It's really, really dangerous."" Authorities have said that at least six people died after the Costa Concordia hit rocks Friday night off the tiny island of Giglio, where nighttime temperatures have recently dipped below freezing. A total of 29 people -- four crew members and 25 passengers -- are still unaccounted for from the listing cruise ship, Italian coast guard chief Marco Brusco said Monday, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. That figure includes two of the 120 Americans who were aboard the ship, the U.S. Embassy in Italy said. Now turned on its side, the ship is roughly half-submerged. Rescuers hope is that any survivor has found refuge above water, or perhaps in an air pocket, and can be brought out alive. ""There could still be people locked into compartments ... where they can't physically move because of the twisting of the metal,"" said Butch Hendrick, president of the diving safety company Lifeguard Systems. In its current state, the Costa Concordia resembles a dark, convoluted cave -- with its countless nooks and crannies and few ways to easily escape. Six underwater cave rescue divers are working among the rescue personnel. The divers are likely equipped with twice as much oxygen as regular scuba divers, have a guideline nearby in case they need help finding a way back to safety, and have knives and whatever lights they can carry or wear, said Robert Laird, a co-founder of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group. Still, whatever equipment and precautions they take, ""what they are doing is extremely difficult,"" he said. ""If you do not have the right frame of mind to deal with being in the dark and in tight closed spaces, then you're (in trouble),"" said Laird, who has dived in many caves and ships, though neither he nor his group are involved in the Italian operation. Unlike open water divers, these divers don't have the luxury of coming up for air anytime they want, and they can't count on the help of sunlight. Laird said he expects that, besides being pitch-black, the water in the ship teems with debris. ""They could swim right by a dead body and not even see it,"" Laird said. Rescuers are navigating a seeming labyrinth. The Concordia is practically a skyscraper in two directions: 17 decks high and 951 feet long. Emergency personnel are aiming to look into 1,500 cabins and all around the ship's many other public spaces, including eight bars, five restaurants, four swimming pools, a casino and more. Hendrick, a veteran of many such rescue dives, estimated it could take a couple of weeks for the whole ship to be checked. ""It's enormous,"" said Richard Bordoni, another member of the Italian national fire corps. ""They have to stay safe, and it takes them a long time to go down a corridor."" Late Sunday, the cruise line said the ship's captain may have made ""significant"" errors leading to the wreck and subsequent rescue effort. ""The route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore, and the captain's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard Costa procedures,"" Costa Cruises said in a statement. Authorities told ANSA that the captain, Francesco Schettino, has been detained for alleged manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board. Speaking on Italian television, Schettino insisted the rocks were not marked on his map. ""On the nautical chart, it was marked just as water,"" Schettino said, adding that the ship was about 300 meters (1,000 feet) from shore. But the Italian coast guard insisted that the waters where the ship ran aground were well-mapped. Local fishermen say the island coast of Giglio is known for its rocky sea floor. ""Every danger in this area is on the nautical chart,"" Coast Guard Capt. Cosimo Nicastro said. ""This is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing. ... All the dangers are known."" Survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and unable to cope. ""It was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,"" said passenger Benji Smith, recounting how he made his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife. ""I felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us."" Compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of the boat's lifeboats was available, as the ship was listing. Passenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming. ""It was so crowded, and there was no room for us,"" said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. ""It was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure."" Many questions remain: Why was the ship -- with about 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members -- so close in to shore in an area where the seabed is pockmarked with rocks? What happened in the minutes after the ship ran aground? Why was no ""mayday"" distress signal sent? ""Looking at the pictures of the damage, it almost looks as if they saw it at the last minute, and they tried to swing the ship to the right to miss,"" said Chris McKesson, professor of naval architecture at the University of New Orleans. Whatever happened to cause the crash, what's happening now to deal with its aftermath -- and, ideally, get to those still on board -- is now the focus. Those rescue crews have to deal with not just myriad logistical difficulties, but also physical and mental challenges. Emergency personnel in the open-air part of the ship need ropes to get around, because the floor has become the wall in most cases. Whether they are rappelling or swimming, doors may have to be opened upward, not the standard way, given the position of the ship. ""The doors are very heavy, and the windows are very thick, so it's quite difficult to break them,"" said Roncalli of the national fire service. Making one's way around without light and where everything is turned on its side can test even the toughest person's mental makeup. Laird, of the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery group, notes that many cave diver deaths ""are attributed to panic."" Even those not underwater face situations in which even a small slip-up can be life threatening, he said. Despite such challenges, Roncalli vowed that rescue personnel were prepared and intent on continuing their mission as long as necessary. ""They keep on working until we are sure that no person is missing,"" he said. ""The conditions are very tough, but we can manage it.""","NEW: The rescue/recovery operation on the ship could take weeks, a diving expert says .

"(CNN) -- At least 20 people were killed and 200 more were injured Friday in the northern Mediterranean city of Benghazi, Libya's second-largest, said a medical source in Benghazi who was not identified for security reasons. The casualties occurred as thousands of Libyans took to the streets to voice their discontent over leader Moammar Gadhafi, witnesses said. Friday's killings brought to 50 the number of people killed since Tuesday, when the protests began, the medical source said. Amnesty International said security forces had killed at least 46 during the past three days, with sources at al-Jala Hospital in Benghazi saying that the most common injuries were bullet wounds to the head, chest and neck. ""The alarming rise in the death toll, and the reported nature of victims' injuries, strongly suggests that security forces are permitted to use lethal force against unarmed protesters calling for political change,"" said Malcolm Smart, the Amnesty's director for the Middle East and North Africa. CNN was unable to independently verify the information. In front of the main courthouse in a square in Benghazi, thousands of demonstrators filled the streets demanding a change of government, a protester said. He said people were chanting for Gadhafi and his children to get out of Libya. He called Gadhafi's authoritarian rule ""the biggest dictatorship in history."" Late Friday, a witness said more people were still streaming into the already crowded plaza, with some erecting tents, apparently planning to spend the night. There was no sign in the square of police or military forces except for the presence of three tanks, which were not moving, he said. Another source said that he saw three Libyan army tanks in the square and that young demonstrators were engaging the tank crews in conversation. He said government forces were not visible in or around Benghazi. He added that he visited Al-Jala hospital and that it was ""full of dead and wounded."" Electricity was lost in parts of the city but had been restored by late Friday, when the city was quiet, he said. Farther east, in al-Baida, thousands of people showed up to bury 13 protesters killed in clashes in recent days, said Mohamed Abdallah of the opposition National Front for the Salvation of Libya, who has been receiving information about Libya from sources there. Plainclothes members of the Revolutionary Committee had reportedly fired at the protesters, Abdallah said. Demonstrations unfolded Friday in other cities as well, he said. CNN has not been permitted to report from Libya and cannot confirm information about the demonstrations. The government maintains tight control of the news media and telephone services, and many people expressed fear of talking openly amid what they described as a climate of fear. CNN has been relying on information from protesters, human rights groups and foreign-based Libyan organizations assessing the situation through their sources on the ground. Libyan state-run television was airing taped images of Gadhafi surrounded by adoring crowds. The demonstrations erupted Tuesday after the detention of a human rights lawyer and spread across the country. U.S. President Barack Obama condemned the government crackdowns in Libya, Bahrain and Yemen, which are all embroiled in unrest. ""Wherever they are, people have certain universal rights, including the right to peaceful assembly,"" Obama said. ""The United States urges the governments of Bahrain, Libya and Yemen to show restraint in responding to peaceful protests, and to respect the rights of their people."" ""The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Moammar Gadhafi's brutal rule when faced with any internal dissent,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director for Human Rights Watch. Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, also condemned the crackdown in Libya and other countries ""as illegal and excessively heavy-handed."" Abdallah, the spokesman for the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, reported that protesters in Benghazi had freed people who had been detained during the first two days of the unrest. He said protesters also set afire a police station and the Revolutionary Committee headquarters in Benghazi, al-Baida and Darna. Gadhafi's regime, however, has sought to portray a different picture of events and sent out tacit warnings via mobile phone texts to Libyans planning to make their voices known. ""The inappropriate use of telecommunications services contradicts our religion ... our customs ... and our traditions,"" said a text from the General Communications Body. Another said: ""We commend the conscious youth who have realized that sedition destroys his family, his city, his country. And we commend our cities who have realized that touching national unity destroys the prospects of future generations. Together for the sake of the Libya of Tomorrow."" A screen grab of the messages was sent to CNN by Abdulla Darrat, spokesman of Enough Gadhafi, a U.S.-based organization that has been in close touch with people on the streets of Libya. State-run television countered the anti-government protests with coverage of pro-Gadhafi demonstrations. It showed men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans, waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader's limousine as it crept through Tripoli. Scores of supportive demonstrators packed the roadway and held up pictures of their leader as fireworks burst into the night sky. The images followed reports from protesters, witnesses and human rights activists who described brutality by internal security forces, sometimes dressed in plain clothes. One of the protesters likened the situation in Libya to that which occurred early this month in Egypt, telling Human Rights Watch that ""they are sending baltaqiyyas (thugs) to beat us."" Libya, like many of its Arab neighbors, is suffering from economic hardship and a lack of political reform. Youth unemployment is high. Gadhafi is acutely aware of popular grievances and has spoken with groups of students, lawyers and journalists in the past few weeks, a source told CNN this week. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Fionnuala Sweeney, Ben Wedeman and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Witness says square in Benghazi is full of protesters, but there is little sign of police or military .

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Nearly two years after falling in love, ""American Idol"" alumni Ace Young and Diana DeGarmo are opening up about their relationship. Season 5 heartthrob Young, 31, and season 3's runner-up DeGarmo, 24, met in the spring of 2010 when both signed on to costar in the Broadway revival of the musical ""Hair."" ""We became best friends through 'Hair,' ironically not through 'Idol,' "" says DeGarmo, who now plays as a New Jersey Mob boss's daughter on the CBS soap ""The Young and the Restless."" ""It just blossomed into a beautiful relationship."" The attraction was immediate for Young, who, along with DeGarmo, had to get naked onstage for each performance of ""Hair."" ""She said, 'You're not looking, right?' "" Young says of the first time they disrobed in rehearsals. ""And I was like, 'Oh no, not at all.' But I was looking, and I was like -- sold!"" But Young had his eye on DeGarmo before that moment. ""I was already interested in her as a person before I got to see her with no clothes on,"" he said. ""But [that] sealed the deal."" After the musical closed in June 2010, Young, 31, returned to L.A. while DeGarmo, 24, went on tour with the musical ""9 to 5."" The time apart was difficult, Young says: ""If you love somebody, whenever they're not around, it sucks."" So when DeGarmo's tour ended last summer, Young found a way to keep her close. ""She came to California and kept saying, 'I'm looking [at] apartments,' "" he recalls. ""And I was like, 'Why don't you just stay with me?' The moment she got here, she realized I wasn't going to let her get an apartment. It was like, either we're doing this or we're not. And, thankfully, she was all in."" Adds DeGarmo: ""I crashed on the couch -- more like, I crashed in his bed -- and just didn't leave."" These days, the couple's not only living under the same roof, but working together. They recently formed a music group with two friends called All Access, and Young, who earned a Grammy nomination for co-writing ""Idol"" pal Chris Daughtry's hit ""It's Not Over,"" is also producing country songs for DeGarmo. ""She's my best friend,"" he says. ""To be able to dive in with Diana and help create songs that [tell] her story is amazing."" See the full article at PEOPLE.com. © 2011 People and Time Inc.

"Santa Ana, California (CNN) -- A judge has postponed an arraignment hearing scheduled for a former Marine accused of fatally stabbing four homeless men in Southern California. The hearing for Itzcoatl Ocampo, 23, was postponed Wednesday until February 17 after Judge Donald F. Gaffney granted a defense motion asking for more time. Ocampo, 23, remains jailed without bail. He is in a protective ""suicide blanket,"" defense attorney Randall Longwith said. Longwith told reporters he asked for the delay because he had not been given enough time to meet with his client. Authorities only allowed him to talk with Ocampo for 15 seconds Tuesday, he said. ""There was no basis for a plea at this point. I don't have enough information to even make a plea,"" he said. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters Wednesday that Ocampo was a ""serious, vicious killer."" ""He appears to be lucid, calm, intelligent, somebody who knows what he's doing. And his acts are very intentional,"" Rackauckas said. Describing his brief conversation with Ocampo, Longwith painted a different picture. ""He looked at me. He answered when I asked him questions. It was a flat affect and a distant look in his eyes. ... He looked frightened in there, starry-eyed,"" Longwith said. The attorney said he did not know whether his client had been medicated. He said he hoped to have doctors examine Ocampo as soon as possible. Ocampo faces four charges of first-degree murder. He was arrested Friday night after he allegedly stabbed a transient to death, Anaheim Police Sgt. Bob Dunn said. Rackauckas said Tuesday that prosecutors had not decided whether they would seek the death penalty in the case. Attached to the 1st Marine Logistics Group at Camp Pendleton, California, Ocampo was a corporal and a motor vehicle operator, serving in the Marines from July 2006 until July 2010, and was deployed to Iraq for six months in 2008, according to Marine service records. He received an Iraq campaign medal with one star, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and a National Defense Service Medal, records showed. Ocampo's family members watched Wednesday's hearing on a video monitor at the courthouse, but did not speak to reporters. The arrest left those who know Ocampo confused. The suspect's father, Refugio Ocampo, who is himself homeless, told the Orange County Register it was hard to believe his son could be involved in the killings. ""I saw him so many times giving the last money he had in his pocket ... to the homeless, to the people that (are) asking for some help. ... My son's always been a role model,"" Refugio Ocampo said in a video interview posted on the newspaper's website. Norberto Martinez, a family friend who lives with the veteran's uncle, mother and two siblings in Yorba Linda, California, said family and friends were surprised to learn that the mild-mannered 23-year-old was a suspect in the slayings. Martinez said he watched ballgames on television and went on walks with Ocampo, but avoided talking about the war because it upset the veteran. ""I wouldn't talk to him about Iraq,"" Martinez said. ""Whenever he talked with me, he was normal."" The four slaying victims are James McGillivray, 50, who was killed December 20; Lloyd ""Jimmy"" Middaugh, 42, who died December 27; Paulus ""Dutch"" Smit, 57, killed on December 30; and John Berry, 64, who was stabbed to death January 13.

"(CNN) -- The parents of a 15-year-old Massachusetts high school student who committed suicide after being bullied by her classmates received a nearly quarter-million-dollar settlement, according to documents made public after a months-long attempt to uncover details of the agreement. The settlement was reached with the town of South Hadley in November of 2010, but it was only made public Tuesday after a reporter successfully sued to gain access to the records. The reporter, Emily Bazelon from Slate Magazine, filed the public records lawsuit on December 2 with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union, after first requesting the documents in May. Superior Court Judge Mary-Lou Rup on Friday ordered the settlement be made public, adding that Bazelon ""demonstrated that she, in her role as a news reporter, and the public have a First Amendment right to access the information contained in these settlement documents."" The agreement centers around the case of Phoebe Prince, whose body was found last year hanging in the stairway leading to her family's second-floor apartment. On the day she died, Prince had endured a torrent of verbal abuse that began at the school library and continued as she walked home from school in tears, according to prosecutors. Her parents, Anne O'Brien and Jeremy Prince, received the $225,000 settlement sum after filing a complaint with the state's Commission Against Discrimination in 2010, arguing that South Hadley Public Schools failed to address hazing that preceded their daughter's death. The settlement prohibits Prince's parents from again suing the town over Prince's suicide, but it also binds them to a confidentiality agreement that prevents publicizing details of the agreement. In a letter written to the Slate reporter on May 9, town officials pointed to a confidentiality clause in the agreement as reason for keeping the record sealed. ""I did not want to violate the trust of the people who entered into it with that confidentiality clause in it,"" town counsel Edward J. Ryan Jr. told CNN. Civil rights advocacy groups have since hailed Friday's decision. ""A public document does not become private because the government inserts a confidentiality clause or a nondisclosure clause,"" said Newman. According to the court order, public records are defined as ""all books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements"" and other items ""made or received by any officer or employee of any agency.""","Phoebe Prince's parents receive $225,000 settlement after daughter's 2010 suicide .

"(CNN) -- A series of U.S. diplomatic cables from early this year directly accused Syria of supplying advanced weaponry, including SCUD ballistic missiles, to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon. U.S. protests to Damascus met with persistent denials, according to the cables, which were published by the WikiLeaks website. At a meeting in February, according to one cable, a senior U.S. diplomat stressed Washington's concerns directly with Syrian President Bashar Asad, ""who bluntly stated that he knew of no new weapons systems going to Hezbollah."" But just a week later, an urgent note from U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to the U.S. Embassy in Damascus said the United States had learned of Syrian plans to supply Hezbollah with SCUD-D ballistic missiles, which would magnify its threat to Israel. Clinton wrote: ""I must stress that this activity is of deep concern to my government, and we strongly caution you (Syria) against such a serious escalation."" To reinforce the point, the cable continues: ""Your interest in avoiding war should require you to exert maximum restraint, including restraining Hezbollah and preventing the group's acquisition of such lethal, long-range weapons."" Within 24 hours, the senior U.S. diplomat in Damascus met with the vice foreign minister, Faisal al-Miqdad, to convey Clinton's message. The cables described him as ""clearly surprised"" by the allegations. ""Flatly denying any Syrian role in the supply of weapons to Hezbollah, Miqdad contended Damascus supported Lebanese independence,"" a cable says, quoting Miqdad as saying: ""You may hear about weapons going to Hezbollah, but they are absolutely not coming through Syria."" Miqdad then went on the offensive, according to the cable, asking: ""The most sophisticated weapons are coming to Israel, to be used against whom?"" But the U.S. diplomat in Damascus commented: ""Even a seasoned diplomat like Miqdad could not restrain a raised eyebrow at our mention of the transfer of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah."" The following day another cable from the secretary of state's office asked U.S. diplomats to rally support from allies for Washington's position. It said: ""We want France, Britain, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar to make a renewed push to echo our concerns with Syria."" Allies should be told that Washington believed ""Syria has provided or will provide guided short-range ballistic missiles to Hezbollah that could target two-thirds of Israel, including Tel Aviv, from launch sites north of the Litani."" The Litani is a river in southern Lebanon. ""Our information also indicates that Syria has made advanced surface-to-air missile systems available to Hezbollah and has probably provided training on these systems to Hezbollah personnel,"" the cable continued. In April this year, Israeli officials alleged that the transfer of SCUD-D missiles had gone ahead. At the time, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said: ""If such an action has been taken, and we continue to analyze this issue, clearly it potentially puts Lebanon at significant risk."" So why would Syria provide Hezbollah with weapons that could destabilize an already volatile region? Another cable tries to answer that question. ""Syrian leaders appear convinced that arming Hezbollah will increase Syria's leverage in bringing Israel to the negotiating table,"" it says. But the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus suggests in a cable that is misguided. ""Syria's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by Hizballah could prove disastrous for Syria and the broader region,"" he writes. The U.S. assessment is that Hezbollah is far better-armed than it was in 2006, when it fought a one-month cross-border war against Israel. Referring to its missile and rocket armories, a cable from November 2009 says: ""This capability, if fully used, would represent a quantum leap over the damage and psychological terror Hezbollah rockets caused in northern Israel during the 2006 war."" Regional analysts believe that Hezbollah has some 40,000 rockets as well as up to a dozen SCUD-Ds from Syria.","SCUD ballistic missiles would increase Hezbollah's threat to Israel .

"(CNN) -- New sprint sensation Christophe Lemaitre became the first Frenchman to win three gold medals at a major athletics event on Sunday as his country finished second in the table behind Russia at the European Championships. Lemaitre, the first white man to break the 10-second barrier over 100 meters last month, helped his 4x100m relay team to triumph in Barcelona and add to the 20-year-old's double in the individual sprints. Martial Mbandjock, who had earlier won two bronzes behind his teammate, snatched victory on the final leg as Italy were beaten back into second with Germany third. France's women's 4x100m team finished second behind shock winners Ukraine, who set the fastest time this year of 42.29 seconds. Poland denied the favored Russians a medal, but their larger neighbors won both the men's and women's 4x400m relay events as they finished with a total of 10 golds and 24 podium placings -- six more than France. Distance double for Britain's Farah . Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad and Bouabdallah Tahri gave France a 1-2 in the men's 3000m steeplechase as Spain's Jose Luis Blanco took bronze. The hosts ended the competition in sixth place with two golds and eight medals overall after Nuria Fernandez and Natalia Rodriguez finished first and second in the women's 1,500m ahead of third-placed French runner Hind Dehiba, while Russian favorite Anna Alminova was back in sixth. Alemitu Bekele denied Turkey teammate Elvan Abeylegesse a 5,000m-10,000m double after passing the tiring former world record-holder on the home straight in the shorter distance, with Portugal's Sara Moreira third. Sprint double for Lemaitre . In the women's high jump, Croatia's two-time world champion Blanka Vlasic won with a late leap of 2.03m to head off Sweden's Emma Green and Germany's Ariane Friedrich. Germany's Christian Reif won the men's long jump with this year's leading mark of 8.47m to comfortably beat France's Kafetien Gomis and Britain's Chris Tomlinson. The British team finished third overall with six golds and 19 medals in total, a record for the team, after also taking silver in the men's 4x400m and bronze in the women's event. Lemaitre claims 100m gold in Barcelona . Poland's Piotr Malachowski won the men's discus from Germany's Robert Harting and Robert Fazekas of Hungary, while Switzerland finally won a medal after Victor Rothlin won the men's marathon in a time of two hours and 15.31 minutes to comfortably head off Spain's Chema Martinez and Russia's Dmitriy Safronov.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The State Department called the expulsion of the second U.S. diplomat from Ecuador in just over a week ""unjustified,"" rejecting charges the diplomats meddled in Ecuador's internal affairs. First Secretary Mark Sullivan has been given 48 hours to leave the U.S. embassy in Quito, Ecuador. On Wednesday, the Ecuadorian government expelled First Secretary Mark Sullivan, whom it accused of meddling in the government's internal police policies, giving him 48 hours to leave the country. On February 7, the government expelled Armando Astorga, an attaché with the Department of Homeland Security working in the U.S. Embassy. Acting Deputy Spokesman Gordon Duguid said the expulsions stem from the fact that certain Ecuadorian police were banned from taking part in U.S. counternarcotics training programs, but rejected ""any suggestion of wrongdoing by embassy staff."" ""Despite the government of Ecuador's unjustified actions, we remain committed to working collaboratively with Ecuador to confront narcotics trafficking,"" Duguid said. Asked whether the State Department would reciprocate the expulsions by kicking out Ecuadorian diplomats from the United States, Duguid would say only, ""We will respond as appropriate."" A senior State Department official suggested the police in Ecuador police did not meet the criteria to take part in the training, noting, ""The United States does have procedures that require it to vet candidates for U.S.-funded training."" The official added, ""In some countries this is seen as onerous. However, it is part of the legal accountability measures we must follow.""","Government gives First Secretary Mark Sullivan 48 hours to leave the country .

"(CNN)  -- Mano Menezes has been entrusted to lead Brazil into the next World Cup on home soil in 2014 after being named as the replacement for sacked coach Dunga. The 48-year-old has no experience outside of his native Brazil where he has enjoyed success with Gremo and his current club Corinthians. ""I have the honor to inform you that I was approached by the Brazilian Football Confederation to take over the post of national team coach,"" AFP reported Menezes at a media conference in Sao Paulo. ""I have come here to officially confirm that I have accepted the offer."" The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said Menezes had been on a three-man shortlist to succeed Dunga and his chances greatly improved after Fluminense refused to release Muricy Ramalho from his contract. The new man in charge was then contacted by Ricardo Teixeira, the head of the CBF. ""Menezes was already on a three-man shortlist, drawn up during the World Cup in South Africa,"" said a statement on the official CBF website. ""And his name was confirmed following talks with Texeira during which he approved the renewal project decided by the CBF pertaining to the 2014 World Cup that Brazil will host,"" it added. Reports in Brazil said the third name on the CBF shortlist was former coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, who led Brazil to their 2002 World Cup triumph. Former Portugal and Chelsea coach Scolari will remain at Brazilian club side Palmeiras. Menezes will be officially unveiled on Monday before naming his squad for a friendly against the United States on August 10. Dunga was sacked after Brazil were sent crashing out of the quarterfinals of the World Cup by the Netherlands. They had gone into the finals as South American champions and the world's top-ranked team, but after taking the lead against the Dutch slipped to a disappointing 2-1 defeat.","Mano Menezes is the new coach of Brazil in succession to sacked Dunga .

The FBI believes the suspect is responsible for robbing 10 banks in San Diego County and one in Riverside County. The ""geezer bandit"" has carried a weapon in at least two of the robberies and should be considered dangerous, authorities said. ""In these types of crimes, the potential for violence is significant,"" April Langwell, spokeswoman for the San Diego office of the FBI, said in May. ""The last thing we want to happen is an employee of the bank or a customer to be injured as a result of one man's greed."" The robber has been described as between 60 and 70 years old. However, there has been some suggestion that he may be wearing a mask to conceal his real age and make him appear much older than he is, Langwell said. He is approximately 6 feet, 190 pounds, of average build and has been known to wear prescription eyeglasses and various hats and caps, including a blue baseball cap with a script style ""P"" on the front.

"(CNN) -- The main airport in St. Louis is expected to operate a full flight schedule Tuesday, less than four days after a powerful tornado tore through the facility, airport officials said. But restoration efforts are far from over at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, where the Friday night storm shattered windows and ripped off part of a roof. ""It obviously just took a couple of minutes for the damage to occur,"" Airport Director Rhonda Hamm-Niebruegge told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""It will take weeks, maybe a couple of months, to clean up all of it."" Still, Hamm-Niebruegge said efforts to get the facility up and running again have been ""miraculous."" American Airlines returned to service on Monday, officials said, leaving only Cape Air among the airport's 13 airlines still out of service because of storm damage. Cape Air will resume flights on Tuesday, airport officials said in a statement Monday evening. American and Cape Air were among the hardest hit after the storm, which devastated the airport's C concourse. The tornado damaged 750 homes near the airport, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said. And preliminary National Weather Service estimates released Saturday show the tornado packed winds between 111 and 165 miles per hour when it hit the airport. There were no fatalities reported -- a fact that Nixon characterized as ""absolutely amazing."" At the airport, Hamm-Niebruegge said the facility's design -- and the way people responded to warnings -- played a key role. ""It is a historic building, and it's built very, very well. I think that had a part to do with it, but we also had very early warnings,"" she said. Besides damage to homes and the airport, the strong winds also hit businesses and tore through the roof of a Ferguson, Missouri church, where dozens had gathered on Good Friday to watch the movie ""Passion of the Christ."" Officials have said inspections of buildings will take several days and hauling off debris will take longer. Elsewhere in Missouri, storms over the weekend left behind water on the runways at a regional airport, forcing authorities to shut down the facility temporarily. The Cape Girardeau Regional Airport, located about 100 miles south of St. Louis, has been shut down since Sunday, administrative coordinator Katrina Atkins said. Crews were activating a pumping system to remove the standing water Monday, she said, but authorities had not determined when the airport would reopen. CNN's Tom Laabs contributed to this report.

"New York (CNN) -- Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was granted bail Thursday after being indicted on charges related to the alleged assault of a maid in his New York hotel Saturday. ""It's a great relief to the family to be able to have him with them,"" defense attorney Bill Taylor said to reporters outside the courtroom. He said his client would spend Thursday night at the jail on Rikers Island before being released Friday. The next court appearance, an arraignment, is slated for June 6. Supreme Court Judge Michael Obus granted the bail on the condition that Strauss-Kahn post $1 million in cash, that he also post a bond for $5 million, that he surrender his travel documents and that he submit to home detention. The announcement came shortly after his indictment on seven criminal charges was announced. They are: two counts of criminal sexual act, two counts of sexual abuse, and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, Strauss-Kahn is accused of having ""engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion,"" the indictment says. ""Under American law, these are extremely serious charges,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters outside the courtroom. ""The defendant was indicted on all the charges presented to the grand jury,"" he said. Strauss-Kahn resigned from his IMF post on Wednesday. As he entered the courtroom for the bail hearing, he looked at his wife, seated in the front row, and smiled. Strauss-Kahn on Monday had been denied bail, with the criminal court judge saying his attempt to leave the country after the alleged incident made him a flight risk. His lawyer argued Thursday that Strauss-Kahn had been scheduled to leave New York and fly to Paris on Saturday using a ticket he had bought on May 11. Taylor said Strauss-Kahn had called the Sofitel hotel from John F. Kennedy International Airport to locate his cell phone, which he had left in the hotel, then called a second time as his plane was boarding to request that its delivery be hastened. Instead, police at the airport took him into custody. Taylor noted that his client resigned his position as IMF chief on Wednesday, and had surrendered his passport and a U.N.-issued travel document. ""In our view, no bail is required,"" the lawyer said. ""He has one interest at this time and that is to clear his name."" Taylor added that Strauss-Kahn had agreed to live with his wife in an apartment in Manhattan after his release. Prosecutor John McConnell argued the high-profile economist had no right to bail. ""While there is presumption of innocence, the proof is substantial and it is growing every day,"" he said, adding that the forensic evidence is consistent with an attack and the alleged victim has identified Strauss-Kahn as her attacker. McConnell noted that France does not extradite its own nationals, and said Strauss-Kahn's departure on Saturday from the hotel was in haste, suggesting ""something went on in that hotel room."" For his part, Obus said he was solely concerned about ensuring Strauss-Kahn returns to face charges. ""We don't want his money,"" he said. ""We just want to make sure he comes back. He has resources to live comfortably in his own country."" As the hearing recessed, Strauss-Kahn blew his wife a kiss. Meanwhile, Strauss-Kahn's alleged victim, a 32-year-old Guinean maid for the Sofitel hotel, testified before the grand jury on Wednesday, according to an attorney representing her. ""If you've had any experience with someone who has been traumatized by sexual assault, reliving it in your mind is hard enough,"" attorney Jeffrey Shapiro said on CNN's ""American Morning"" Thursday. ""Having to recount it, even to a therapist, is difficult, much less having to talk about it on the record in front of a grand jury. I mean, it's extremely difficult, and nonetheless she's making it through this."" The case has set French political circles abuzz, as the international economist was widely considered the French Socialist Party's best hope to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's elections. In a statement released Thursday, Sarkozy called Strauss-Kahn's resignation ""inevitable"" and called for an ""open and transparent selection process"" for Strauss-Kahn's replacement. In a brief letter to the IMF executive board late Wednesday, Strauss-Kahn proclaimed his innocence. He said he was stepping down to ""protect this institution which I have served with honor and devotion, and especially -- especially -- I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence."" ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" he said. In his letter, Strauss-Kahn said he felt compelled to resign. ""I think at this time first of my wife -- whom I love more than anything -- of my children, of my family, of my friends,"" he wrote. ""I think also of my colleagues at the Fund; together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more."" While the search begins to replace him, the first deputy managing director, John Lipsky, will lead the fund, the IMF said in a statement. ""As acting managing director, John Lipsky will provide able and experienced leadership to the fund at this critical time for the global economy,"" Geithner said in a statement Thursday. ""We want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession for the fund's new managing director."" In statements, South Africa called for a candidate from a developing country to be named as Strauss-Kahn's successor, while Brazil called for establishing criteria and conducting a thorough search. On Thursday, Lipsky urged policy makers to work together to strengthen the global economy. ""I deeply regret the circumstances that have made it necessary for me to substitute for the fund's managing director,"" Lipsky said in a speech at the annual meeting of the Bretton Woods Committee in Washington. Prosecutors allege that a naked Strauss-Kahn, 62, chased the housekeeping employee through his suite and sexually assaulted her. But defense attorney Benjamin Brafman disputed the allegation, saying ""forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case."" Strauss-Kahn allegedly committed the offenses at noon. He checked out of the hotel at 12:28 p.m. and went to a previously scheduled lunch about 12:45 p.m., according to a document supporting his motion to approve bail. The lunch was with one of his daughters, according to a source with knowledge of the case. After lunch, he was driven to John F. Kennedy International Airport and boarded an Air France flight that was scheduled to depart at 4:45 p.m., the bail document says. As he sat in first class awaiting takeoff and a planned meeting the next day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, followed by a meeting with European finance ministers on Monday in Brussels, his world of power and privilege came crashing down. Police, alerted by hotel staff to the employee's accusations, ordered him off the plane and placed him in custody. Strauss-Kahn was examined for scratches and DNA samples were taken, and investigators searched for other evidence in the suite, including possible bodily fluids from both individuals, a law enforcement official told CNN. He consented to the testing after investigators prepared a search warrant, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to release the information. Strauss-Kahn became embroiled in sexual controversy soon after joining the IMF in September 2007. He acknowledged reports that he'd had an improper physical relationship with a female employee. But the relationship was consensual, an independent inquiry found, and the IMF's executive board concluded in October 2008 that ""there was no harassment, favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director."" Nevertheless, the board found ""that the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment,"" the IMF said in a written statement. On Thursday, the IMF sent reporters updated standards for staff conduct that were approved May 6. Under the organization's new policy on closer personal relationships in the workplace, a supervisor who has an intimate personal relationship with a subordinate must report that relationship to the ethics adviser, his or her supervisor or the human resources department ""to seek resolution of potential conflict of interests and workplace fairness concerns,"" the new standards say.

"(CNN) -- The United States should use the ""utmost caution"" as it makes the Asia-Pacific region a key focus of its newly announced military strategy, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said in a commentary published Friday. On Thursday, President Barack Obama and top defense officials unveiled a new U.S. defense strategy that focuses heavily on the Asia-Pacific region, a fast-growing economic powerhouse with numerous potential flashpoints that the administration has identified as crucial to U.S. interests. While resulting in a leaner force, the new strategy also calls for the U.S. to increase its military's ""institutional weight and focus on enhanced presence, power projection, and deterrence in Asia-Pacific,"" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Thursday. While welcoming a peaceful U.S. role in the region, Xinhua's commentary Friday warned the United States against acting like a ""bull in a china shop."" ""The U.S. role, if fulfilled with a positive attitude and free from a Cold War-style zero-sum mentality, will not only be conducive to regional stability and prosperity, but be good for China, which needs a peaceful environment to continue its economic development,"" the Xinhua editorial said. ""However, while boosting its military presence in the Asia-Pacific, the United States should abstain from flexing its muscles, as this won't help solve regional disputes."" The new defense strategy, which still lacks many specifics, is meant to pare U.S. defense spending by at least $487 billion over the next decade and drops a long-standing doctrine calling for the ability to fight to simultaneous ground wars. The result will be a more ""agile, flexible, ready-to-deploy, innovative and technologically advanced"" force prepared to counter terrorists, rogue states and the threat of nuclear weapons worldwide, Panetta said Thursday. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the focus on the Asia-Pacific region is crucial. ""The strategy talks about a shift to the future,"" he said Thursday. ""And all of the trends -- demographic trends, geopolitical trends, economic trends and military trends -- are shifting toward the Pacific."" With U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down, the focus on the Asia-Pacific region has become a key theme of the administration's foreign policy commentary in recent months. In November, Obama toured the region to highlight its economic and strategic importance to U.S. interests and announced plans to eventually station a task force of up to 2,500 Marines in Australia . ""The United States is a Pacific power, and we are here to stay,"" he said at the time, pledging that the coming defense cuts would not affect the country's military posture in the region. He reiterated that pledge Thursday. ""As I made clear in Australia, we will be strengthening our presence in the Asia Pacific, and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region,,"" he said.","U.S. officials announced new defense strategy this week .

"(CNN)  -- Former world number one Justine Henin has ruled herself out of the U.S. Open after sustaining an elbow injury in her Wimbledon exit to Belgian rival Kim Clijsters. It is a shattering blow for Henin, who will also miss her 'Best of Belgium' clash with Clijsters in Brussels on July 8. Henin, who made her comeback to competitive tennis at the start of the year after 18 months in retirement, picked up the injury during her fourth round defeat to Clijsters. Clijsters wins Battle of Belgians at Wimbledon . She suffered the injury when falling early in the first set, but bravely played on in a match that lasted three sets. Henin confirmed the news in a statement on her personal website. ""Following my fall at Wimbledon....I took several medical examinations which have revealed a ligament partial fracture at the right elbow,"" it read.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Police tightened security Wednesday in India's Punjab for the funeral of a preacher whose killing in Vienna, Austria sparked violent protests in the Sikh majority state last week. The body of Rama Sand lies in state in Vienna before being transported to India. Top-ranking officers are camping in Jalandhar district, where Rama Nand will be cremated Thursday, said Parag Jain, Punjab's inspector-general of police. ""Security arrangements are elaborate,"" he told CNN. Nand's body is due to arrive from Vienna early Thursday in Sachkhand Ballan, a monastery dedicated to Guru Ravidass, a 14th-century low-caste Hindu spiritual figure. Guru Ravidass' writings are predominantly found in the primary Sikh scriptures called the Guru Granth Sahib, placed in the sect temples as in the Sikh houses of worship. Sect head Niranjan Dass, who was injured in the Vienna assault, will also be arriving Thursday, Sachkhand Ballan secretary S.R. Heer said. The sikh guru's death led to widespread violence across the Punjab region, which resulted in the army and federal security forces being called in to restore order. Thousands took part in demonstrations across the Doaba region, where protesters attacked public transportation, knocking out train service in some areas. They also blocked a national highway to Jammu, CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported. A number of businesses were ransacked as well. Police reported one death. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, himself a Sikh, appealed for calm, in a statement. ""There is no place for violence in a secular society like India's and certainly no excuse whatsoever for the violation of the sacred premises of a (Sikh temple) for narrow sectarian or other purposes,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.","Tensions ease in Punjab after widespread violence over Sikh guru's death .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's 30-minute TV ad, which ran simultaneously on broadcast and cable networks at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday, is muscle-flexing that has little precedent, a campaign advertising expert said. Sen. Barack Obama aired a 30-minute campaign ad Wednesday night. ""It's evidence, if you needed any, that the Obama campaign has more money than there is ad time left to buy,"" said Evan Tracey, director of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. ""This is flexing the muscles."" Tracey estimates that it will cost the campaign ""in the $4 to 5 million range -- at a minimum, $3.5 million."" But, he said, spending the money is a ""no-brainer"" for the Democratic presidential hopeful. ""The strategic brilliance of this for Obama is that he is going to consume about 24 hours of the news cycle,"" Tracey said. ""It boxes [John] McCain in, takes the oxygen out of the room."" In the carefully produced infomercial, Obama laid out his plans for the economy and for bringing an end to the war in Iraq. It also featured stories of struggling families in swing states such as Ohio and Missouri and included testimonials from high-profile supporters, including Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. iReport.com: What do you want to ask Sen. Obama? Obama's Republican opponent, Arizona Sen. John McCain, was not mentioned, nor was the GOP. The spot ended with a brief, live Obama address to a rally in Florida, another hotly contested state in this year's campaign. ""I'm reminded every single day that I am not a perfect man,"" he said. ""I will not be a perfect president. ""But I can promise you this: I will always tell you what I think and where I stand. I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you when we disagree. And, most importantly, I will open the doors of government and ask you to be involved in your own democracy again."" There was so much buzz surrounding the infomercial -- which was announced about two weeks ago -- that on Tuesday, Time magazine's Mark Halperin put the ad's two editors on his daily list of the ""five most important people in American politics not running for president.""  Watch more on the Obama campaign ad buy » . Those editors, Erik Smith and Mark Putnam, were ""still in an edit room"" cutting the 30-minute piece Tuesday when he published the list, according to Halperin, Time's editor-at-large and senior political analyst. The ad ran at 8 p.m. ET on CBS, NBC, MSNBC, Fox, BET, TV One and Univision, the Spanish-language network, six days before Election Day. CNN declined to run the spot, and talks between ABC and the Obama campaign fell apart. ""We were approached by the Obama campaign and declined their request,"" said Sal Petruzzi, senior vice president for public relations of Turner Broadcasting, CNN's parent company. ""We did not want to pre-empt our programming lineup with a 30-minute spot. We would rather use our air to continue to cover the campaign, candidates and issues like we always do, from all points of view with the best political team on television."" An ABC spokeswoman declined to comment about the network's talks with the Obama campaign. ""As a matter of policy we don't comment about clients with whom we are doing business,"" said Julie Hoover of ABC. The Obama campaign has bought advertising on ABC in the past, she said, ""but they did not buy the half-hour."" Obama taped an interview Wednesday with ABC's Charles Gibson, which is to run Thursday, his campaign said. A source familiar with ABC policy suggested the network had offered the Obama campaign a different time slot. ""Hypothetically, we would have offered them equivalent time,"" the source said. ""We don't have to give them the exact slot they are asking for."" Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said ABC had ultimately offered Obama the slot he wanted, but the campaign turned it down. ""By the time they agreed, we had already committed our resources,"" Burton said. The Obama campaign reported last week that it had raised a record-shattering $150 million in September. Obama has outspent McCain by a huge margin, according to CNN's consultant on ad spending. Between the time the two candidates clinched their party's nominations in the spring and October 25, Obama spent more than $205 million on TV ads. McCain spent more than $119 million, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group. The McCain campaign launched an ad Wednesday attacking Obama for his 30-minute special. ""Behind the fancy speeches, grand promises and TV special lies the truth: With crises at home and abroad, Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs,"" the ad said. The timing of Obama's informercial pushed back the start of a World Series game, provoking a jab from McCain during a Wednesday afternoon appearance in Florida. ""It used to be that only rain or some other act of God could delay the World Series,"" he said. ""But I guess network executives figured an Obama infomercial was close enough."" The Obama campaign did not ask that the game be delayed, said a spokesman for Fox, which broadcasts the World Series. ""They asked Fox to buy the air time,"" the spokesman said. ""Fox went to our partner, Major League Baseball, and asked if it would be OK to delay the game to take this important political advertisement. They agreed."" MLB's willingness to delay the fall classic for a political ad shows how very unusual the Obama TV spot is. ""Ross Perot did it in 1992, but it wasn't this close to Election Day, and now you have a very different media consumption environment. You didn't have the cable then,"" Tracey said. ""There is no precedent for this sort of an ad this late in the race.""

Commuters make the trek across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after it reopened Tuesday. Commuters began driving over the bridge around 6:40 a.m. PT (9:40 a.m. ET), shortly after Randy Iwasaki, director of the California Department of Transportation, announced the reopening at a news conference. ""The bridge has been inspected, and it is safer than when we closed it on Friday,"" Iwasaki said.

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Alberto Contador has issued an apology after he took advantage of his rival Andy Schleck's mechanical failure to seize the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. Schleck, who was leading Astana rider Contador by 31 seconds in the overall standings going into stage 15 on Monday, dropped his chain while launching an attack on the day's final climb and had to stop to repair the problem. Rather than waiting for his rival -- in keeping with the Tour's sporting traditions -- Contador and a group including fellow contenders Denis Menchov and Samuel Sanchez stole a march to the finish, gaining 39 seconds on Schleck. Contador now leads Saxo Bank's Schleck by eight seconds in the overall standings, with Spain's Sanchez two minutes behind the leader in third and Russia's Menchov two minutes, 13 seconds back. See Contador's Youtube apology here . Spaniard Contador was booed by the French crowd as he was awarded the yellow jersey on the podium and was heavily criticized by Schleck. But after reflecting on the stage, Contador issued a video on Youtube saying: ""The race was in full gear and, well, maybe I made a mistake. I'm sorry. ""At a time like that all you think about is riding as fast as you can. I'm not happy, in the sense that, to me, fair play is very important. ""The kind of thing that happened today is not something I like, it's not my style and I hope my relationship with Andy will remain as good as before."" Luxembourg's Schleck, the runner-up to two-time champion Contador last year, was angered by what he saw as a lack of ""fair play"" and vowed to take ""revenge"" on his rival. ""In the same situation I would not have taken advantage,"" Schleck said, AFP reported. ""I'm not the jury, but for sure those guys wouldn't get the fair play award from me today. ""I'm really disappointed. My stomach is full of anger, and I want to take my revenge. I will take my revenge in the coming days.""

Armstrong then surged forward to win the stage by 40 seconds en route to the fifth of his seven Tour victories. The 187.5 kilometer stage from Pamiers to Bagneres-de-Luchon - the second of four stages in the Pyrenees - was won by French champion Thomas Voeckler after a fine solo ride, finishing nearly three minutes ahead of the race favorites.

"(CNN) -- Ireland upset the Australian Wallabies 15-6 at Eden Park Saturday to top Pool C of the Rugby World Cup. It was Ireland's first win over Australia in five attempts at the global showpiece and puts them securely on the path to the quarterfinals after two victories from two matches. Inspired defense in wet conditions frustrated their more fancied opponents, who trail them by three points with two games to play. ""We were mentally in a place where we felt we owed ourselves a big performance as much as we owed the Irish public one,"" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll told AFP. ""The Irish played more intelligently, they put us under a lot of pressure and profited from that, particularly in our end of the ground,"" Wallabies' coach Robbie Deans said. Australia were ahead early through a James O'Connor penalty in the 11th minute, but Jonathan Sexton's leveled for the Irish with a penalty of their own before putting them 6-3 ahead with a drop goal. O'Connor put Australia back on level terms before the break, but after the interval Sexton gave Ireland a lead they never relinquished with his trusty boot. Ronan O'Gara came off the bench to kick to further penalties, taking his Irish points tally to a record 1,039 and they almost added a late try as winger Tommy Bowe was pulled up by O'Connor five meters from the try-line. Meanwhile, South Africa made it two wins out of two in the defense of the title with a commanding 49-3 victory over Fiji on Saturday. After their narrow 17-6 win over Wales in their Pool D opener, the Springboks were far sharper and scored tries through center Jaque Fourie, Gurthro Steenkamp, Frans Steyn, Morne Steyn, Tendai Mtawarira and Danie Rossouw. Morne Steyn kicked 16 points with a Frans Steyn penalty the other score. Seremia Bai scored a sole penalty for Fiji, who beat Namibia 49-25 in their opener, but were outclassed here.

"(CNN) -- India tied the three-Test series with Sri Lanka after V.V.S. Laxman overcame back problems to score an unbeaten century on the final day of the deciding match in Colombo to seal a five-wicket victory. Set 257 to win, the top-ranked tourists made it home comfortably following a fourth-wicket partnership of 109 between Laxman and veteran batsman Sachin Tendulkar, with Suresh Raina's 41 off 45 balls completing a fine turnaround. Laxman followed up his first-innings 56 as he ended the match unbeaten on 103 from 149 balls, scoring his 16th Test ton despite needing the help of a runner. ""He proved today why he is called very, very special,"" Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told reporters. ""He always comes up with innings that have a huge bearing on the game. ""It was very important for him to score runs as the team needed it most to level the series. I think it is a very special innings. Hopefully, he plays plenty more innings like this for us."" Laxman, a veteran of 113 Tests, said he had struggled to keep momentum due to his back pain. ""I started my innings well, but during the partnership I had a lot of discomfort and the spasms didn't allow me to move freely. Once I was into my 30s it became very painful,"" he said. ""It was difficult. You don't want to create confusion and also not break the rhythm. If you see, Sachin got out once I took the runner. But I was in such pain that I thought that the best decision in team's interest was to have a runner instead of just giving away the wicket due to pain."" Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said the turning point was when his side were bowled out for 267 in their second innings the previous day. ""If we had just tried to bat till lunch, the ball would have got softer and we could have scored a lot more runs. But unfortunately, we played some poor strokes,"" he said. ""Otherwise we could have batted out the day and put the heavy roller on today and declared."" Resuming on 53-3 in their second innings on Saturday, India soon lost nightwatchman Ishant Sharma for four as off-spinner Suraj Randiv claimed his fourth wicket. But Laxman joined Tendulkar, who made a patient 54 off 122 balls -- his 56th half-century in his record 169th Test appearance -- before also falling to Randiv at 171-5. Tendulkar had been dropped by a close fielder when on 18 also off Randiv, who claimed his first five-wicket haul in just his second outing after coming in to replace retired world record-holder Muttiah Muralitharan. Raina, who scored 120 on debut in the previous drawn Test, hit the winning runs with a six off Chanaka Welegedara just before the scheduled tea break. Meanwhile, Pakistan reached 19-1 at stumps of the second day of the second Test against England, having bowled out the hosts for 251 in Birmingham. Pakistan, all out for a paltry 72 in their first innings, are still 160 runs away from making England bat again at Edgbaston. The hosts resumed on 112-2 on Saturday, but spinner Saeed Ajmal took his first five-wicket haul to restrict the deficit. However, Pakistan's bowling options were hit when seamer Umar Gul was ruled out of the rest of the match with a torn hamstring. Kevin Pietersen returned to form with 80, but had a lucky escape on 41 when he was given not out in bizarre circumstances. The South Africa-born batsman pulled away from the crease just before Mohammad Asif was about to deliver the ball, signaling he had been distracted by movement behind the bowler. But then he offered a shot after all and chipped a catch to Pakistan captain Salman Butt, who could not persuade umpire Marais Erasmus to change his decision of ""dead ball."" James Anderson later took his fifth wicket of the match as Butt went without scoring.","V.V.S. Laxman scores unbeaten 103 to guide India to a five-wicket victory .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan bounced back to win the third Test against England by four wickets at the Oval in London as veteran batsman Mohammed Yousuf completed a successful return to international cricket on Saturday. The tourists, whose country has been devastated by floods, reduced England's series lead to 2-1 ahead of the final match at Lord's starting next Thursday as Yousuf's experience proved vital. Recalled after receiving an indefinite ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board in March following his role in the disastrous tour of Australia, the former captain contributed 56 in Pakistan's first innings of 308 and then played another solid hand in the successful chase for 148 on the fourth day. Pakistan lost an early wicket and then Yousuf came to the crease at 57-2 after Imran Farhat fell to Graeme Swann for a quickfire 39. The 35-year-old helped Salman Butt (48) put on an invaluable 46 before the captain was also dismissed by the spinner. Pakistan's nerves showed as Azhar Ali was run out for five, then James Anderson claimed his second wicket as he bowled Yousuf for a patient 33 and Swann trapped Kamran Akmal leg before wicket for a duck without offering a shot. Umar Akmal (16) and Mohammad Amir (4) then guided Pakistan to a morale-boosting victory following two heavy defeats as their team mirrored the three-wicket win over Australia last month when chasing 180. ""The boys showed a lot of character,"" Butt told reporters. ""It was a very good effort from the whole team, no one individual can be singled out. Yousuf brought class and calmness to the middle order. The dressing room is confident in this holy month of Ramadan, we would like to draw this series 2-2."" The 18-year-old Amir was named man of the match after becoming the youngest player to take five wickets in an innings in England, claiming figures of 5-52 as the hosts were bowled out for 222.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Costly and frequent travels to Singapore by Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe for medication were justified because the 87-year-old might be having ""complications,"" his political rival and Zimbabwe's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said Wednesday. ""The responsibility of the state is to look after its leaders. If the president is sick, he should be attended to,"" said Tsvangirai responding to journalists who were eager to know why his and Mugabe's travel expenses had reached $29 million dollars in eight months, according to government figures published quarterly. The figures represent an enormous sum for a country where the majority of the population struggles to have one meal a day. Official figures show Zimbabwe spends about $5 million a month. Mugabe's and Tsvangirai's travels consume more than $3.6 million a month, the figures show. When quizzed by journalists why the 87-year-old frequents Singapore which accounts for the bulk of the two's travels, Tsvangirai said: ""Whether you like it or not he (Mugabe) may say I was sick and I had to go and seek medical attention. Who am I to question him? I do not want to divulge (his real ailment), what you are trying to draw me is to tell what ailment he is suffering from. Maybe the attention (Mugabe needs) is outside the country. Maybe we do not have the expertise (in Zimbabwe). What do you want him to do? He is not certainly suffering from malaria as you would understand, which we can obtain (treatment for) at the nearest hospital. There might be complications."" Mugabe, last week flew to Singapore for medical treatment for the eighth time this year, heightening concern over his health. In March, Mugabe's office declared that he had undergone an eye operation to remove cataracts earlier in the year, and that he had just had ""a final review."" Last month Mugabe's Zanu-PF party set up a committee to probe revelations contained in the WikiLeaks documents that party officials told U.S. diplomats that Mugabe had prostate cancer and would be dead by 2013. The U.S. diplomatic cables indicate that information was allegedly conveyed to the U.S. officials by one of Mugabe's allies, central bank head Gideon Gono.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Kabul's police chief and chief of criminal investigations have submitted their resignations to the Afghan Interior Ministry, but the ministry ordered them to complete their probe into Friday's suicide attacks first, a ministry spokesman told CNN. The ministry has not yet approved the resignations of Police Chief Abdul Rahman Rahman and investigations chief Abdul Ghafar Sayed Zada, spokesman Ezmary Bashari said. The two were ordered to continue their investigation into deadly blasts that targeted foreigners in the capital city Friday. At least 17 people were killed and many others wounded. Once the investigation into the bombings is complete, the minister of interior will make a decision on the resignations, Bashari said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks near the Safi Landmark Hotel in the Shahr-E-Naw neighborhood of Kabul. A number of government and United Nations offices are located there, as well as supermarkets, banks, diplomatic facilities and villas for well-to-do Afghans. An employee at a Kabul hospital said eight Indians and one Pakistani were among the dead. Interior Ministry officials said an Italian was killed, and the Indian embassy said four Indians were killed. The attack started with a suicide car bomb and four suicide bombers with explosive-laden vests, said Taliban spokesman Zaidullah Mujahid. Three of the bombers were killed, he said. About 20 minutes later, a second large explosion occurred.

"(CNN) -- IHOP has filed a lawsuit against a church group called the International House of Prayer claiming that the group is illegally using the pancake house's famous acronym. The legal flap started earlier this month when the International House of Pancakes filed the lawsuit in a federal court in California. The Kansas City, Missouri-based church group ""selected and adopted the International House of Prayer name, knowing it would be abbreviated IHOP. IHOP-KC intended to misappropriate the fame and notoriety of the household name IHOP to help promote and make recognizable their religious organization,"" the lawsuit says. Lawyers from the pancake restaurant say the odds are stacked against the church group and provided the court with pages and pages of documentation of websites, newsletters and signs on buildings where the prayer group allegedly used the IHOP acronym. The use of the acronym infringes on the restaurant's trademark, the restaurant contends. So, IHOP, the pancake house, is asking a judge to get IHOP, the church group, to stop using the letters IHOP. The restaurant says it has used the acronym for more than 30 years. As of Thursday, representatives from the International House of Prayer had not filed a response to the lawsuit, according to court documents. The church group started in 1999 in Missouri and now bills itself as 24/7 place for people to come and pray, according to the group's website.","Lawsuit is filed this month .

"(CNN) -- Voters in the Democratic Republic of Congo head to the polls on November 28 to pick a president and parliament in the mineral-rich central African nation. This is Congo's second election since 1997, and analysts consider it the nation's true test of democracy. Congo's history . Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960, and soon after Patrice Lumumba was elected the nation's prime minister. Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in a coup five years later and changed the country's name to Zaire. Sese Seko was toppled in a 1997 coup led by Laurent Kabila, who renamed it the Democratic Republic of Congo. Soon after Kabila was assassinated in 2001, his son, Joseph Kabila, assumed power and announced the formation of a U.N.-led transitional government two years later. He won the 2006 election, making this year's poll the second since the toppling of Sese Seko. The 2006 election overseen by the United Nations was considered a bridge to transition from a dictatorship. Analysts say this year's election is the true test of democracy. What happened in the last election? International observers considered the 2006 poll -- the first free election in Congo in about 40 years -- as generally free and fair. There were some clashes between supporters of the two frontrunners, but no major violence was reported. His main rival Jean-Pierre Bemba, who got the second-highest number of votes, disputed the official outcome. What are the expectations for this election? Kabila is hoping to secure another five-year term as the opposition hopes to persuade voters change is overdue. A series of campaigns have been held nationwide, with some media reports of violence during the period. A U.N. report this month said there has been limited freedom of expression during the campaign period, and urged candidates to respect the constitution and citizens' rights. International, regional and national observers will be at polling stations together with political parties and religious leaders to monitor the electoral process, according to the U.N. Opposition leaders and analysts have also expressed concern about the make-up of the electoral commission. Why is Congo important? Congo's success is vital to the Great Lakes region, which has suffered the effects of the violence in the nation. Violence and rapes are widely reported in eastern Congo, including a holiday season mass rape last year that sent shock waves across the international community. The east remains the epicenter of attacks by anti-government militias. The international community has spent massive amounts of money in an effort to stabilize the vast nation. Despite its rich resources, Congo battles violence and poverty. A decade of conflict between government forces and armed militias left millions dead as a result of the fighting, and hunger and diseases. Millions of others have been displaced, and the international community has decried the use of rape as a weapon in the conflict. Congo is rich in resources, including cobalt, gold, copper and tantalum. The international community has set up laws to ensure that companies buying the resources are not helping fund wars in the nation and neighboring countries. The main candidates . Congo has 11 presidential candidates, including the incumbent, according to local media reports. But only a few stand a chance at defeating Kabila, who has maintained an edge amid the divided opposition.Nearly 30 million people are registered to vote, according to the reports. Kabila has been at the helm since 2001, and his greatest advantage in his incumbency and the divided opposition, according to analysts. Challenger Etienne Tshisekedi is hoping to capitalize on the nation's desire for political change, but he was a major player during the Sese Seko dictatorship, which might count against him. Kabila's former aide Vital Kamerhe is also among the contenders. He is largely credited with being instrumental in his 2006 win but broke with Kabila's party a few years later. Sese Seko's son, Francois-Joseph Mobutu, is also among the contenders.","This is Congo's second election since 1997 .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's fiery prime minister ratcheted up rapidly-escalating tensions with Israel on Tuesday, comparing Ankara's once-close ally in the Middle East to a ""spoiled boy"" and announcing additional sanctions would soon be imposed. ""We are completely suspending all of these, trade relations, military relations, related with the defense industry,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency. ""All of these are completely suspended and other measures will follow this process."" Asked to clarify whether this meant Turkey will halt more than $3 billion in bilateral trade, an official in the Turkish prime ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol, insisted Erdogan was not referring to trade relations. ""He was referring to the defense industry,"" the official said. ""Nothing more than the measures that have been announced so far."" Last week, Turkey declared it was downgrading relations with Israel, suspending all military agreements between the two countries and giving senior Israeli diplomats less than a week to leave Turkish territory. ""If the current steps are regarded as 'plan B,' there will be a 'plan C,'"" Erdogan said on Tuesday in his first public comments on the matter since Ankara imposed sanctions on Israel. Erdogan's government is incensed that Israel refuses to apologize or pay compensation for eight slain Turks and one Turkish-American. The humanitarian workers and activists were shot dead by Israeli commandos in a botched 2010 raid on an aid convoy that was trying to bust Israel's sea blockade of Gaza. But ""Israel does not want to see a further deterioration in the relationship with Turkey,"" said a senior Israeli government official, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. ""There have been a number of proposals on the table to prevent a deterioration and unfortunately they have not been successful, but from our point of view a deterioration in the relationship serves neither side's interests."" Multiple Israeli sources said they are doing what they can to be responsible and reverse the negative dynamic. Some Israeli officials believe the current troubles between the two countries are minor bumps that can be smoothed out with time and the proper diplomacy. Others believe the deteriorating relationship has little to do with Israel and more to do with a reorientation of Turkish foreign policy towards the Muslim world. A possible Erdogan trip to Gaza is contributing to that school of thought. Diplomats in Cairo and Ankara tell CNN that Erdogan is tentatively scheduled to visit Cairo next week. There is growing speculation in local media that the Turkish prime minister may try to visit Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing. ""This is a process that will continue until the last moment,"" Erdogan said Tuesday, according to Anatolian, when asked about a trip to Gaza. ""We will make the final decision there, talking to our Egyptian friends and brothers. According to that, there may be a trip to Gaza."" Despite deteriorating political relations between Jerusalem and Ankara, trade has grown substantially between the two countries over the last year, according to Turkish government statistics. On Monday, Stanley Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel, gave a speech in which he highlighted the importance of Israel's economic ties with Turkey. He noted that Turkey's economy was the largest in the region, with a gross domestic product in excess of $700 billion, and that Turkey is becoming a key player in regional trade. Turkey is a significant Israeli trading partner, Fischer said, and damage to the trade relationship between the two countries could have serious consequences for Israel. Yigal Schleifer, Washington-based editor at Eurasianet and expert on Turkish-Israeli relations, argues the Middle Eastern ""outsider"" status that once drew Turkey and Israel together into an alliance during the 1990s has changed, as Turkey has grown economically and established closer political ties with Arab neighbors. ""The paths have diverged,"" Schleifer said. ""What you have left is two countries with different visions currently for their position in the region. So Turkey wants to build a more unified region with more open borders that ultimately helps trade and ultimately helps Turkey see itself as a regional leader. Israel sees itself as isolated in the region, increasingly threatened and increasingly concerned with security issues."" Prior to the report about Erdogan's comments Tuesday, Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defense official, told Israeli radio that despite the reports, Turkey is not disengaging from Israel. Contrary to what is being reported, he said, the Israeli military attache to Turkey is continuing his work there. CNN's Watson and Comert reported from Istanbul; Flower reported from Jerusalem. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy in Cairo contributed to this report.","Tensions between the two countries are rising .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- One day while driving with her father, Hannah Salwen noticed a Mercedes stopped next to a homeless man sitting on the curb. The Salwen family of Atlanta, Georgia, has decided to sell this house and give half the proceeds to charity. ""I said to my dad, 'If that guy didn't have such a nice car, then that guy could have a nice meal,' "" the 15-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, recalled. And so began the tale of what the Salwen family calls ""Hannah's Lunchbox.""  Watch why family wants to give away $800K » . It started as family discussions about what they needed versus what was enough. Hannah's father Kevin, an entrepreneur, is on the board of the Atlanta Habitat for Humanity and is no stranger to community work, but he said this family conversation was life-changing. ""We stopped and paused and thought about what are the things in the world that could really make a difference, a little bit of difference in the world,"" he said. They talked about selling their cars or other things, but it was Hannah's mother, Joan, who came up with selling their 6,500-square-foot house, donating half the proceeds and then moving into a house half the size. For nine years, the family lived in a historic 1912 mansion near downtown Atlanta. It boasts five bedrooms, eight fireplaces, a kitchen that would make any cook jealous and even an elevator.  See the new and old houses, side by side » . When Hannah would bring friends over, she said, often their jaws would drop and they'd gasp, ""Wow, you live here?"" Like most teens, Hannah loves to shop, and she jammed every space of her massive walk-in closet full of clothes. But she also knows many people are less fortunate; she volunteers at a local community food bank and other relief agencies. Joan Salwen, a teacher, said the mansion was her dream home. ""It was a challenge,"" she said of giving up that house. ""It was a test, almost, to see: How committed are we? I mean, how serious are these kids about what we should do? And they all nodded and there we were."" So the Salwens put the house up for sale in May 2007 and started figuring out what they would do with half the proceeds, which would amount to more than $800,000. They spent six months researching charity organizations before deciding on the Hunger Project, an organization dedicated to helping end world hunger through people helping themselves. Hunger Project Vice President John Coonrod said the family met with organizers in New York and notified them months later that the charity was the winner. When the Salwen house sells, the money will be channeled through The Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta over a six-year period and end up in Ghana, Coonrod said. ""This will underwrite a process in more than 30 villages to enable people to meet all of their basic needs on a sustainable basis,"" he said. ""They will be able to grow enough food, to build clinics and schools, and the villagers will be doing the lion's share of the work."" Coonrod said he'd never heard of a family donating in this way. ""Hannah's awakening to social injustice, and her family's ability to make a difference in that issue will make a profound difference in the lives of tens of thousands of people,"" he said, estimating the money could affect more than 20,000 people in Ghana. Hannah's 13-year-old brother, Joseph, was so impressed with his big sister's ideas that he made a three-minute video of the family's project.  Watch Joseph's video . The video won the grand prize in the 2008 ""My Home: The American Dream"" contest, sponsored by Coldwell Banker and Scholastic Publishing. In the video, Joseph tells viewers, ""We're showing you can redefine the American dream."" But the Salwens' house has sat on the market for more than a year. It's a tough time to sell any house, let alone one with an asking price of nearly $1.8 million. Real estate agent Sally George said she's shown the house 40 or 50 times, and there have been nibbles but no buyers. See the house's real estate listing . Many people are interested in the house's rich history but often don't know anything about the philanthropic aspects of the family's project. ""I've never handled a house selling for this reason,"" George said. ""I didn't learn about what the family was doing until early this year."" Hannah and Joseph said most of their friends at school don't know about it. ""We didn't do it for the fame or the glory,"" said Joan Salwen. ""This was something Hannah sort of yanked us into."" Even though it was Joan Salwen's idea to sell the house, it has been tough for her to give it up. ""I have to admit,"" she said, ""I loved living in this house. Does that make me an evil person? I hope not because it's a beautiful place."" The family recently moved to a house less than half the size of their mansion four blocks away. While Hannah's friends called her old home the ""wow house,"" this one is more ordinary and that's fine with her. Lately the family has spent a lot of time around the kitchen table talking about an upcoming two-week trip to Ghana. The Salwens will spend six or seven hours a day visiting the villages where their money will be put to work. Kevin Salwen said the new house is great, it's just smaller. ""We as Americans have so much,"" said Salwen, a former Wall Street Journal writer. ""We love the concept of half. We are going from a house that's 6,000 square feet to a house that's half the size, and we're giving away half the money. ""And we do think everyone can do something if they think through half.""","Family tries to sell $1.8 million mansion and give half the proceeds to charity .

"London (CNN) -- British government ministers secretly advised Libya on how to get convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi released from a life sentence in a Scottish prison, American documents published by WikiLeaks allege. A Foreign Office official explained to the Libyans how to apply for compassionate release for Megrahi after he was diagnosed with cancer, according to an October 2008 U.S. Embassy cable newly published by WikiLeaks. The British government believed Scotland would be inclined to grant the bomber compassionate release, the cable says. Megrahi, the only person convicted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103, which killed 270, was released in 2009. He is now living in Libya. Then-Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell wrote to Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdulati al-Obeidi in October 2008 to explain how to apply for compassionate release, a British official told the U.S. Embassy in London, the cable says. The Foreign Office in London and the office of Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond in Edinburgh did not respond immediately to CNN requests for comment. The British government has always said it was not its decision whether or not to release Megrahi, but that of the Scottish authorities because the bomber was imprisoned in Scotland. Scotland has some control over its own affairs, including justice, but London runs British foreign policy. Some American senators, led by New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez, have been furious about Megrahi's release. They said in a report in December that his medical condition did not justify setting him free. The leaked U.S. Embassy cable says Megrahi had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and that the average life expectancy for someone with his condition was 18 months to two years. It noted that he could have as long as five years to live. The October 2008 American cable is broadly consistent with hundreds of documents about the case declassified by Scotland after Megrahi was released in August 2009. Those documents and American diplomatic cables published earlier by WikiLeaks show that Libya was determined to win the release of Megrahi, warning London that it would react badly if the bomber died in jail. The British have consistently denied that commercial considerations -- such as oil giant BP's desire to drill in Libya -- played a role in Megrahi's release.","NEW: The British Foreign Office has no immediate comment .

"(CNN) -- Shaquille O'Neal filed a motion Thursday to dismiss a lawsuit in which a former worker accuses the NBA star of hacking into his personal accounts and attempting to frame him for using child porn. Shawn Darling, who was O'Neal's personal computer consultant from 2008 to 2009, said the NBA center acted in retaliation because Darling had proof that O'Neal cheated on his wife with several women. But O'Neal's lawyer claims in the motion that Darling illegally obtained the supposedly incriminating e-mails, text messages and voice mails to support his ""baseless"" lawsuit in an effort to ""extort"" O'Neal and sully his name. ""Darling reveals his true intent and methodology in using the stolen material,"" O'Neal's Miami-based lawyer, Benjamine Reid, writes in the motion. ""The Complaint's rambling, unsupported allegations, through which Darling alleges that he possesses substantial knowledge that would harm the Defendant both in a separate and unrelated lawsuit, as well as in the public eye at large, render Darling's nefarious motive clear."" The 13-page response, filed Thursday in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, also argues that Darling's claims of privacy invasion, racketeering and intentional infliction of emotional distress are unsupported by any legal theory. ""Even if everything he was saying were true, we believe there is no basis in the law to bring the case,"" Reid told CNN Thursday. ""But in this case, none of it's true."" The salacious 15-page complaint describes O'Neal's alleged dealings with three women and his ex-wife, whom he was divorcing at the time. Darling claims he was drawn into O'Neal's tangled affairs as a computer consultant, eventually acquiring enough information to make him a liability that O'Neal then sought to have arrested, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in August and reported Wednesday for the first time on RadarOnline.com. Reid said the lawsuit came about after O'Neal refused to pay Darling $12 million in return for copies of physical and electronic files that Darling, a convicted felon, stole from O'Neal while he was working for him. Darling's lawyer, however, said the e-mails, texts and pictures in his possession came from accounts in Darling's name that O'Neal asked him to set up for him to use to contact his various mistresses. When O'Neal realized the damning nature of the evidence Darling had, he began working with associates and contacts in law enforcement to have Darling arrested for possessing child porn on his computer, Darling's attorney, Menachem Mayberg said. Darling filed the lawsuit out of a real fear that O'Neal would act on his alleged plans, the lawyer said. ""I don't need anyone to take my client's word for it. I have the evidence: Text messages from Shaq, e-mails complaining about how my client is going to ruin him, "" Mayberg said Wednesday. ""Anyone who says the evidence is not there, he'll eat those words."" O'Neal, who this summer signed with the Boston Celtics, employed Darling while O'Neal lived primarily in Miami. During that time, Darling performed various odd jobs that gave him access to O'Neal's e-mail and cell phone accounts, the complaint states. Darling's lawyer claims he was hired as an independent contractor for the specific purpose of helping him retrace all the e-mails and texts he'd sent to Alexis Miller, a woman who claimed to have a relationship with O'Neal, and who'd accused him of harassment. ""In the end, my client couldn't get AOL to give him all the information from [O'Neal's] account without getting lawyers involved,"" Mayberg said. ""After that, Shaq used my client and his personal property to send text messages and e-mails to contact his mistresses."" The lawsuit contains allegations that O'Neal used law enforcement contacts to obtain information about Alexis Miller, and that he hacked into a phone belonging to Vanessa Lopez, erasing messages and changing her password. The lawsuit also accuses O'Neal and an associate of throwing his computer into a lake after Darling performed a "" 'Defense Department' type wipe"" of the computer. Darling also claims that O'Neal believes he has pictures of him with Dominica Westling. As a result, the lawsuit alleges, O'Neal has attempted to ""control"" Darling's actions through threats of violence and attempts to frame him for possession of child pornography and to have him arrested using O'Neal's extensive law enforcement contacts. ""O'Neal knows that Darling not only has knowledge of his bad acts that might be used against him in litigation, but O'Neal also knows that Darling has evidence that shows he cheated on his former wife [Shaunie O'Neal] with many more people than just Vanessa Lopez,"" the lawsuit states. ""Darling is in apprehension and fears for his safety,"" the lawsuit says. O'Neal's lawyer issued a statement after the lawsuit was reported on Wednesday that described Darling as an ex-con who has served time in a federal prison in Wisconsin for misusing Social Security numbers, and said Darling failed to disclose the prison record to O'Neal. An online inmate search of the Federal Bureau of Prisons showed that a man named Shawn Darling was released on March 22, 2002. Darling's lawyer acknowledged his criminal history. ""But that doesn't make him liar,"" he said. O'Neal's lawyer, however, said the case would come down to credibility of the parties involved. Reid said Darling used his position to copy O'Neal's e-mails and communications. Over the past 12 months and through three separate lawyers, he has demanded $12 million for their return, Reid said. When O'Neal refused to cooperate with Darling, he filed the lawsuit, Reid said. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. ""It doesn't take much to file a suit and unfortunately, this seems pretty common in our society. People target celebrities,"" he said.","NEW: Shaquille O'Neal files motion to dismiss privacy invasion lawsuit .

"Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Members of a Colombian leftist rebel group released two more longtime prisoners Wednesday afternoon, bringing the total released since February 9 to six, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the Spanish acronym FARC, freed Police Maj. Guillermo Solorzano and Army Cpl. Salin Antonio Sanmiguel Valderrama on Wednesday afternoon in a rural area located in the departments of Cauca and Valley of the Cauca in southwest Colombia, the Red Cross said in a news release. Solorzano had spent three years and eight months in captivity; Sanmiguel had been held for two years and eight months, it said. Both men were handed over to former Sen. Piedad Cordoba, ICRC representatives and a member of the group Colombian Men and Women for Peace, the Red Cross said. The freed men were being taken to the city of Cali in a helicopter donated by the government of Brazil. From there, they were to travel to Bogota to reunite with their families. ""It pleases us that the relatives can be with their loved ones whom they have been waiting for for a long time,"" said Christophe Beney, the International Red Cross's chief in Colombia. ""We are very satisfied that, in the end, the agreements assumed by the sides, as much by the Colombian government as by the FARC, have been carried out."" With the handover, the number of people freed by the FARC since February 9 rises to six, the Red Cross said. The releases came three days after an initial attempt to retrieve the hostages failed when coordinates for their location proved to be inaccurate. Solorzano, Sanmiguel, and police patrolman Carlos Alberto Ocampo were to have be released Sunday, but only Ocampo was freed. Colombian authorities were upset at what they said were wrong coordinates given by the Marxist guerrilla group. In December, the FARC pledged to release five hostages as a humanitarian gesture. Wednesday's releases surpassed that number by one. Some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed negotiations between Colombia's government and the rebels. One of the freed hostages called for dialogue between the government and insurgents. ""Humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding, which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty,"" politician Armando Acuna said last week after his release. But Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has sharply criticized the FARC, accusing the group of having a ""double standard"" and creating an ""absurd media show"" in order to draw sympathy to its cause. He said last week that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped the night before in southwestern Colombia.","The two men were released in southwestern Colombia .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- A rocket fired by Palestinian militants fell on a Gaza home and killed two children, Palestinian sources said Friday, the same day Israel opened three Gaza border crossings for the first time in 10 days. A truck carrying grain enters Gaza from Israel on Friday at the Karni crossing point, one of three Israel reopened. A third child was in critical condition. The children, all girls, were cousins -- the two who died were 7 and 12, and the injured child is 5, Hamas security and Palestinian medical sources said. The rocket struck a house north of Gaza City. In a separate development, the Israeli military said it allowed a Palestinian who was badly wounded by rocket fire Wednesday to enter Israel for treatment. The Palestinian entered Israel through the Erez Crossing between northern Gaza and Israel. Israel closed the crossing for all but humanitarian reasons because of rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel by Palestinian militants. But it opened three other crossings Friday, allowing fuel and commodities into the Palestinian territory for the first time in more than a week. About 80 trucks filled with commodities were expected to cross into Gaza. Among the goods were 400,000 liters of fuel and 120 tons of cooking gas. The decision to open the crossings at Kerem Shalom, Karni and Nahal Oz came after requests from international aid groups and Egypt, said Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. In addition, he said, Israel has no desire to hurt the civilian population in Gaza. Lerner said whether to keep the crossings open would be a daily decision. United Nations assistance programs in Gaza have run out of flour and several essential pharmaceuticals, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. A tenuous six-month truce between the Hamas government in Gaza and Israel expired a week ago. Under the Egyptian-brokered deal, Hamas agreed to end militant attacks on Israel from Gaza, and Israel agreed to halt raids inside the territory and ease its blockade on humanitarian goods. In reality, the truce started breaking down two months ago. Rocket attacks by militants became more frequent, and Israel resumed airstrikes inside Gaza. Since then, dozens of rockets have been fired by Palestinian militants into Israel. Israel Defense Forces said about nine rockets have been launched from Gaza since midnight, pushing the three-day total to more than 110. There are no reports of casualties in Israel. The crossings opened a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met in Cairo and Egypt expressed concern about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Livni criticized Hamas after her meeting with Mubarak. ""Hamas needs to understand that Israel's basic desire to live in a tranquil region doesn't mean that Israel is willing to accept ongoing shooting at its population,"" she said, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ""Enough is enough. We cannot accept this situation, and the situation will change."" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has threatened to respond to the escalating violence. He warned Hamas again Thursday in an interview on the Al Arabiya television network and seemed to suggest that time was running out. ""We do not want to fight the Palestinian people, but we will not allow Hamas to strike our children,"" Olmert said. ""I did not come here to declare war,"" he continued. ""But Hamas must be stopped -- and so it will be. ""I will not hesitate to use Israel's strength to strike at Hamas and Islamic Jihad. How? I do not wish to go into details here.""","NEW: Militants' rocket hits Gaza house, killing Palestinian cousins .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two U.S. customs agents were arrested on charges they helped smuggle drugs and other contraband through New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The DEA says two customs officials at JFK International Airport helped smuggle drugs and contraband. Customs supervisor Walter Golembiowski and officer John Ajello face narcotics, bribery and conspiracy charges in the case, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Golembiowski and Ajello regularly solicited and accepted bribes to allow contraband to pass through undetected, the DEA said. Two airport workers and two others were also charged with importing counterfeit goods. Some of those items included Rolex, Cartier and Chanel watches and designer sunglasses, the DEA said. On several occasions, Golembiowski was captured on audio and video taking bribes to aid his co-conspirators in bringing in illegal drugs and counterfeit goods. ""Smuggling any kind of illegal commodity raises troubling issues at a time of deep concern over national security,"" said Michael J. Garcia, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. ""The threat is heightened when a government official accepts bribes to help smugglers breach our borders."" The arrests came as a result of a lengthy sting operation by a state, local and federal task force. Prosecutors said numerous recorded meetings and phone calls captured the suspects talking about plans to smuggle hashish, ecstasy and other illegal items. The investigation has led to the indictment and prosecution of more than 20 people -- ""from distributors to overseas sources of supply"" -- and the seizure of more than 600 pounds of imported hashish and other drugs from the United States and France, according to the statement.","DEA says two agents regularly accepted and solicited bribes .

"(Mashable) -- There's no denying that Facebook has had an impact on the way the younger set flirt, fall in love and break up. Now, Seventeen magazine has released a study that depicts just what kind of repercussions the social networking site has had on modern courtship. ""Teens are incredibly social, and Facebook plays a huge role in their love lives,"" says Ann Shoket, editor-in-chief of Seventeen magazine. According to the study -- which polled 10,000 guys and girls ages 16 to 21 -- Facebook plays an important part in how amorous teens make a connection. Within one week of meeting a new person, 79 percent of people click ""friend,"" and after adding a new friend; 60 percent of people stalk their crush's profile once a day (40 percent check in on their would-be soulmate several times a day). Moreover, contrary to beliefs that social networking is erroding interpersonal communication, 72 percent of those surveyed said that talking to someone online brings you closer to them IRL. As we have already seen in other studies, Facebook also plays a role in how we fall out of love. Mashable writer Samuel Axon wrote a detailed feature about how Facebook has changed dating for the worse, Facebook dating app AreYouInterested released a study in which 21 percent of respondents said they would break up with someone via changing their statuses, and, most recently, infographic wizard David McCandless came out with a chart that shows popular breakup periods by way of status updates. Seventeen, for its part, reports that 10 percent of people have been dumped over Facebook, and the same number would just change their relationship status to ""single"" to cut a lover loose. The report also depicts the anguish the site can cause after a breakup, citing that 27 percent of people change their connection to their exes after a breakup via blocking (getEx-Blocker for that extra push), hiding him or her on the News Feed or unfriending. Surprisingly, 73 percent of people keep their exes in the friends list. I'd like to see some stats on how many of those 73 percent stalk said ex after the breakup. A couple of other interesting tidbits from the study: . Girls are more judgmental: 43 percent of girls would decide not to date someone based on their Facebook profile, compared to 33 percent of guys. Guys are more likely to keep relationship statuses under wraps: 17 percent of guys don't share their status, compared to 12 percent of girls. Girls think it's exciting to change their relationship status: 50 percent of girls get a kick out of the status change -- one-third of guys agree; 24 percent of guys find it unnecessary, compared to 17 percent of girls.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thirteen people were killed and 90 wounded in clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims in Cairo, state-run Egyptian television reported Wednesday. The clashes broke out Tuesday after Copts took to the streets to protest last week's burning of a church. Earlier, Egypt's health minister, Dr. Ashraf Hatem, said the death toll was at nine. Coptic Church spokesman Father Abdelmaseeh Baseet reported six deaths previously Wednesday and said all the victims were Christians. The Egyptian military has launched an investigation into the violence, said Mohamed Askar, armed services spokesman. Those involved in ""the incitement of sectarian hatred or involved in the acts of violence"" will be held accountable ""to the full extent of the law,"" he said. A feud between a Muslim and a Coptic family is said to have led to the church burning in Helwan province last week. In recent weeks, tensions have been high between Egypt's Muslim majority and its Coptic minority. A Coptic church in the town of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people. The Palestinian Islamic Army, which has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for what was the deadliest attack on Christians in Egypt in some time -- but far from the only one. Ten days later, a gunman killed a Christian man and wounded five other Christians on a train in Egypt. Also in January, a man was sentenced for his part in an attack on another Coptic church a year ago, Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported. About 9% of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity. The religion split with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ.","NEW: The death toll is at 13, according to state-run television .

"(CNN) -- One video showed the tiny face of the slain girl wrapped in a shroud. Someone pulled back a bandage to show her bloodied right eye. Her mouth was frozen, slightly ajar. Her vacant face and lifeless head conjured the image of an alabaster bust. Another more gruesome video showed the girl before she was cleaned for burial. She lay sprawled on a pavement, bloodied and disheveled, like a crime victim caught in a tabloid snapshot. The images surfaced Sunday and Monday in Syria, where more than 2,000 people have died in five months of bloody conflict between security forces and anti-government demonstrators. The victim was O'laa Jablawi, a 2 1/2-year-old girl from the besieged port city of Latakia, shot in the eye and killed when she and her parents attempted to flee the besieged city on Sunday in a car that came under fire, activists said. They were among those who fled as security forces cracked down on al-Ramel, a Latakia neighborhood that has been the center of anti-government demonstrations. Syrian security forces told residents to get out during the military offensive, which occurred by sea as well as land. According to human rights activists and anti-government protesters, that's exactly what the girls' parents tried to do -- flee. Activists said she was shot by security forces. The Syrian government has yet to comment. The activists believe her father was shot in the shoulder and possibly detained. The mother's fate is unknown. On one video, a voice shrieks, ""She's just a child. He killed her, the evil Bashar al-Assad,"" a reference to the nation's president. On another, a voice says, ""Look, these are Bashar al-Assad's reforms."" CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos and the reports about them, so it is very difficult to find out how the child died. The United Nations, global leaders, and human rights organizations all have urged the Syrian government to allow humanitarian workers, U.N. representatives and the media access to the country. Those pleas have had no effect. But the videos are the latest in a series of grisly and disturbing images to emerge from the country. Protesters consistently say the government is responsible for the conflict and bloodshed. Syria has consistently blamed the violence in the country on armed gangs. Nevertheless, O'laa was an innocent, caught in the crossfire of an intensifying battle between those calling for freedom and a regime intent on staying in power. Back in May, the U.N. Children's Fund, or UNICEF called on the government to spare civilians, particularly women and children, amid reports of youthful casualties. ""While UNICEF cannot verify the reported cases and events, we are particularly disturbed by the recent video images of children who were arbitrarily detained and suffered torture or ill-treatment during their detention, leading in some cases to their death,"" the agency said. Asked for an update, a UNICEF spokesman said there is ""nothing really to add"" from the May statement. Arwa Damon reported from Beirut, Lebanon; Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","The girl was killed in Latakia, activists say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Which is scarier? Letting Greece go bankrupt? Or saving Greece from bankruptcy? If you're a European businessman or banker, the answer is obvious: Bankruptcy is scarier. If Greece cannot pay its debts, Greece will likely quit the euro. By quitting the euro, Greece would regain the power to print its own money and inflate its way out of its debt. Now think what that would mean for your business. If Greece quit the euro, people would begin to worry: Who's next? Will Portugal quit? Spain? Italy? France? Do you own a 1000 euro deposit in a Spanish bank? Tomorrow that account could be denominated in new pesetas, at who knows what exchange rate. Better cash out today. Likewise: Better sell your Portuguese and Italian bonds -- not only government bonds, but bonds issued by any agency sponsored by government: water, electricity, transit authorities, and so on. A Greek default would trigger, in effect, a bank run on every governmental institution in southern Europe, the biggest bank run perhaps in the history of the world, bigger even than the run triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. As I said: scary. But now think like a politician. It's been obvious for some time now what has to be done to avert the bank run: a European Super TARP, a version of the Troubled Asset Relief Program that was used to bail out Wall Street in 2008 . The European Union will have to assume responsibility for the debt of southern European countries. In return, the EU will have to take control of the finances of those countries -- cutting their spending and raising their taxes. The debt assumed by the EU will have to be serviced somehow. That means the EU will need its own revenue stream sufficient to pay for and ultimately retire the southern European debt. In other words, what we're looking at is: . -- A transfer of Greek and other southern European debt to all the people of Europe. -- Big government spending cuts especially in southern Europe, but also everywhere else. -- Higher taxes everywhere to support the southern European debt. -- All of it imposed by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. How'd you like to be the politician who has to explain that to the voters of Bavaria? So now you see why action is so slow. The trouble is, the longer the action takes, the more expensive it gets -- and the less likely the action is to be successful. If the action comes early and if it is decisive and orderly, then it may be possible to force creditors to eat some of their losses. But in a panic, governments will not have time or leeway to negotiate. They'll face a starker alternative: pay in full or default, the same stark alternative the United States faced back in the fall of 2008, which led to unappealing actors such as Goldman Sachs being made whole in backroom deals at the expense of the taxpaying public. And if markets get the idea that the politicians of northern Europe will flinch from the Super TARP, then the bank run could start very fast. Last week, the German parliament voted 440 billion euros in bailout funds. (That's almost $542 billion in U.S. dollars.) Bigger would have been better. The supreme need is to overwhelm the problem -- to show markets that the resources are at hand to pay all obligations -- and thus to gain credibility for tough negotiations so that lenders bear some of the costs of rescue. Americans had better hope that these negotiations succeed, because it's very doubtful that the United States can avoid being dragged into an emergency euro rescue. In 2008, we worried about banks that were too big to fail. In 2011, we have to worry about countries that are too big to be saved by European action alone. If the crisis comes, it will require funds from the International Monetary Fund and very possibly the U.S. Treasury too, like Mexico in 1994 only much, much bigger. And remember how popular that was with the Congress. Better to anticipate -- and to prevent. Act big. Act fast. Act now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: If Greece defaults, all of Europe's debts would be suspect .

"(CNN) -- A children's show host who was born with one hand is facing criticism from parents over her disability. The BBC is receiving complaints about kids' show host Cerrie Burnell, who was born with one hand. BBC spokeswoman Katya Mira said the corporation has received at least 25 ""official"" complaints recently about Cerrie Burnell, new host of two shows on the BBC-run CBeebies television network, which is aimed at children younger than 6. The official complaints do not count the dozens of negative comments lodged in Internet chat rooms, Mira said. In one chat room, a father lamented that Burnell being on the show forced him to have conversations with his child about disabilities. However, there have also been messages of support for Burnell. What do you think about the complaints? ""We have also received 99 appreciations of her,"" Mira said. Burnell started as a presenter of the shows in late January after acting with theater companies in Manchester, England, and Brazil. A BBC news release in January introducing Burnell made no mention of her disability, but a publicity photo showed the right sleeve of her sweater pulled up, showing her arm stops just below her elbow. The issue has spurred a debate in England among newspapers, columnists and bloggers. Burnell said she has heard the criticism and will not let it bother her. 'It can only be a good thing that parents are using me as a chance to talk disability with their children. It just goes to show how important it is to have positive, disabled role models on CBeebies and television in general,"" Burnell said. Michael Carrington, BBC controller of CBeebies, said the company is standing by Burnell. ""Cerrie is warm and natural and we think that, in time, all moms and dads and children will love her as much as we do,"" Carrington said.","BBC says it is receiving complaints about TV host Cerrie Burnell .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities have arrested a 78-year-old man on charges he killed a woman he believed was a witch who had put a spell on him. Santiago Iniguez Olivares is accused of bludgeoning Modesta Navarro Nieves and her husband at their home in the mountainous Guadalupe del Cobre community in April 1998, the Michoacan state attorney general's office said Thursday. The husband survived. Olivares had been on the run until recently, when he returned to Guadalupe del Cobre because he thought the 11-year-old murder had been forgotten, the attorney general's office said. Authorities arrested him while he was walking to a bus station, the Apatzingan Valley Information Agency said on its Web site. According to officials, Iniguez Olivares went into the woman's home, accused her of putting a witch's spell on him and started to beat her with a stick. The woman's husband then came home and Iniguez Olivares turned the club on him before fleeing, the attorney general's office said in a release. Guadalupe del Cobre is a remote village in western Mexico. This is second case in 18 months involving the slaying of someone accused of witchcraft. Authorities arrested a woman in June 2008 in central Mexico on charges that she had killed another woman for similar reasons, La Voz de Michoacan newspaper said.","Santiago Iniguez Olivares accused of bludgeoning Modesta Navarro Nieves because he thought she put a spell on him .

"Beijing (CNN) -- In China -- home of manufacturing companies central to global production of Apple iPhones and iPads -- the death of Steve Jobs' death brought immediate reaction from Chinese netizens and captains of industry. ""When I head the news, I could not hold back my tears,"" wrote Yu Minghong, founder and CEO of New Oriental Education, one of the largest private education service provider in China. ""Because of him, the world has become different. Because of him, the boring world has become alive, the glum world has become creative, because of him a drab world has become colorful.""

But his life was complete because he had been looking for and found what he loved. I haven't committed whole heartedly to my life like Jobs had been doing. So, next to him, I feel more ashamed than being sad."" Wrote @ QUENTIN_SHIH: ""Only those who are so crazy as to think they can change the world can truly change the world."" ""Certainly Apple has achieved cult-like status amongst young, urban Chinese consumers,"" said Duncan Clark, chairman and founder of BDA, a Beijing consultancy company focused on telecom, media and technology sectors. ""Beyond the general public there is a vast, aspiring entrepreneurial class particular focused on understanding what makes successful business people like Steve Jobs tick."" To be sure, Apple's relationship with China is complicated. The revelation in recent months that as many as 22 fake Apple stores had cropped around China set new standards for piracy -- even in a nation known for counterfeit technology. ""The fact that Apple stores, not just its products themselves, have been copied, shows that it is not just about hardware. The whole Apple experience is something that consumers aspire to,"" Clark said. ""The world has lost a true hero and I have lost a friend whose dedication to his company, his customers, and our industry is reflected in the fact that he continued to work while dealing with such a devastating illness,"" said Terry Gou, chairman of Foxconn Technology Group, a leading manufacturing partner of Apple with 800,000 employees in China. ""Steve's spirit will live on forever with those who, like me, had the honor to know and work with him,"" Gou said. ""However, everyone has been touched by his genius and, because of this, he has left the world a better place. He will be missed, but never forgotten."" Yang Yuanqing, the CEO of China's computer powerhouse Lenovo, said, ""As a competitor, he helped ensure all of us pushed even harder. I am confident his legacy will continue to energize the industry for many years to come."" ""Jobs said, 'Remember that you will be dead soon',"" said Lee Kaifu, venture capitalist and founding president of Google China, referring to Jobs' famous 2005 Stanford University commencement speech. ""It helped me through making the most important choices in my life. Because all the glory and pride, embarrassment and fear will all vanish when confronting death. What I see that's left with me is the truly crucial one. When you are worried that you will lose something, 'Remember that you will be dead soon' is the best remedy. If you can empty yourself, you have every reason to follow your heart."" In Hong Kong, admirers plan an ""i-Vigil"" for Jobs -- using iPhones with a flickering candle app -- outside the city's Apple store, which opened less than two weeks ago. ""People have different ways of dealing with it,"" says organizer Casey Lau on the loss of Jobs.

"(CNN) -- Mikey Welsh, most famously known as the bassist for the rock band Weezer, died unexpectedly Saturday, according to the band. He was 40. The cause of death was not immediately known. Darryl Baety, a Chicago police spokesman, said that officers responded at 1:45 p.m. Saturday to a call from the Raffaello Hotel regarding a guest who had been scheduled to check out, but had not. After first knocking on the door, hotel personnel entered and found someone who was ""unresponsive and not breathing,"" according to Baety. Police are conducting a death investigation related to the case, pending autopsy results, Baety said. According to Welsh's official website, he was a painter before he made the the shift to music at age 19. A decade later, he had achieved fame as the bassist for the band Weezer, replacing the band's longtime bassist Matt Sharp. Welsh was part of the band's 2001 ""Green Album"" release, which featured ""Hash Pipe."" The single became one of the band's biggest hits, peaking at No. 2 on Billboard's Alternative songs chart. Welsh left the band shortly after, saying he had suffered a nervous breakdown. The band remembered Welsh as vital chapter to their history and one to never ""shy away from the absurd, dangerous or strange,"" according to a statement on Weezer's website.

"(CNN) -- The stepfather of a missing Maryland boy was charged Thursday with first-degree murder after the boy's mother was found dead, police said. Curtis Lopez, 45, was arrested Thursday morning in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a warrant was issued, said Chief Tom Manger of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police. An Amber Alert has been issued for the boy, 11-year-old William McQuain, who remains missing, police said. Homicide detectives from Montgomery County were on their way to Charlotte on Thursday. ""Our focus and our priority now is locating William McQuain,"" Manger told reporters Thursday. He held up two pictures of the sixth-grader, one a class picture and the other showing him in a baseball uniform. The case began Wednesday afternoon when a friend of the boy's mother reported her missing, saying he had not seen her for about two weeks and that he was concerned for her welfare, Manger said. Police learned her son had not been in school since Sept. 30. When detectives arrived at the woman's home in Germantown, they found Jane McQuain, 51, dead in her bedroom with evidence of trauma to her upper body, Manger said. Her son was not there and the woman's vehicle, a Honda CRV, was gone. Lopez was McQuain's husband and had been known to frequent her residence but did not appear to live there, Manger said. Witnesses told police they saw him recently at the home, removing property and loading it into McQuain's Honda, he said. The car was found Thursday morning, but police would not reveal where. Detectives contacted Lopez on Wednesday night, before they found McQuain's body, Manger said. Once the body was found and the case was ruled a homicide, Lopez, based on his inconsistent statements, became a person of interest, he said. ""We were hoping that we would find (William) with Mr. Lopez and we did not, so we are asking for the public's help in locating 11-year-old William McQuain,"" Manger said. ""My hope is that he may be with a family member or a friend that perhaps has no idea what's occurred with his mother, but as time goes on it becomes, I guess, more and more of a long shot that that's the case,"" he said. Jane McQuain was probably dead for 10 to 12 days before police found her, Manger said. Police believe Lopez may have had a residence in North Carolina, Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County police told CNN, but they have few other details linking him to the area. William McQuain is described as a light-skinned African-American, about 5 feet tall and weighing about 85 pounds. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to call 911, police said. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","NEW: Police charge boy's stepfather with murder of his mother .

"(CNN) -- Talk with two people who have been to Marrakech and you'll get very different views on what a trip there is like. One person will speak of the allure of wandering through a warren of market streets; the other will complain of getting lost over and over again. One will tell you that people there are among the friendliest they've met, if you can meet them halfway on the language. The other will say that the locals are only out to make money and not even directions are free. The food is exotic yet easy on the palate, or restaurants serve up bland clichÃ©s that still manage to turn you inside out. And they would both be correct. Bottom line: Marrakech is not for the timid traveler. My wife and I visited last November. We had heard it had much of what we look for in a travel destination: Centuries of history coupled with a very modern vibe. The city has a European feel, from the brand-name stores to the widespread use of French as a second or third language. The crowded souks and calls to prayer from the mosque minarets are what you would find at the heart of a Middle Eastern country. It is the outline of the High Atlas Mountains that reminds you that this is North Africa. Share your Morocco tips and photos . The city's origins stretch back to the 11th century. Back then Marrakech was a key trading route with sub-Saharan cities. And like other hubs -- Bruges as a European port, Samarkand on the Silk Road -- Marrakech had its golden epoch before falling from favor. The result is that parts of the city within the rose-colored walls and imposing gates surrounding the medina, or Old City, have a sense of being frozen in time. The massive Jemaa el Fna is likely to be the focal point of your time in Marrakech, both as a destination and as a much-needed reference point. It is one of Africa's largest squares, and as long as the city has existed it has been a place where storytellers, musicians, healers and just about everyone else has gathered. During the day you can't walk through it without some snake charmer or henna tattoo artist offering to make your stay more memorable. At night, they push aside to make way for innumerable food stalls offering as genuine a selection of Moroccan cuisine as you'll find at any restaurant. Grills sizzle beneath tiny merguez sausages and fish and skewers of vegetables. For the more adventurous, there is boiled goat head or bowls of snails. More than once we were brought food that we didn't order, like the deep red harira soup and a basket of bread, maybe some fresh olives. We paid for it anyway, and frankly, it was worth it. It exposed us to foods we may not have tried otherwise. Just plan on paying a bit more than you might have expected. Later, you'll walk it off as you wander amid the chaos, moving to incessant drum beats and chants, trying your best to take it all in. Just north of the Jemaa el Fna you'll find the myriad alleyways of the Marrakech souk, or traditional market quarter. No map will help you navigate these passages; just accept that you are going to get lost and enjoy yourself along the way. While souvenir stalls are everywhere, you can still find shops selling items of remarkable craftsmanship that reflect local designs -- whether it is in the intricate patterns and colored glass of the hanging lamps, or leather goods from the tannery in another part of the city. And trust me, the shop owners are always ready to make a deal. Make eye contact with a market trader, and before you know it you're haggling over the price of something that you may or may not need, but will provide a terrific story when you get back home. Nothing here has a set price, and shopkeepers can be aggressive when they think you are interested in something. But no trip to Marrakech would be complete without trying your hand at negotiating. At some point you realize that the hardest thing about visiting Marrakech is that you are usually moving at someone else's pace. The streets of the souk are jammed with people who are either jostling to get past you or quite content standing in your way. You and the other pedestrians will be on the lookout for young people on motorbikes heading in both directions. And everyone will try to maneuver around donkey-pulled carts. But anywhere you go -- and this is what makes a trip to Marrakech so special -- is an assault on the senses. It could be the vibrant colors of the shops selling mounds of rich spices or hand-tied rugs, the smell of food cooking, the press of the crowd, or the calls of the souk. When all the bustle gets to be too much, there are plenty of sites that give you a chance to relax. South of the Jemaa el Fna stands the 19th century Bahia Palace and gardens, originally built for a high-ranking official and his concubines. You won't find a palace in the sense of Versailles or the Hofburg. Instead, you'll meander through a series of rooms with little more than lavishly decorated floors, walls and ceilings, leading to courtyards with fruit trees and fountains. We walked through the palace on our own, though I suspect a proper tour could be organized. The Ben Youssef Medersa, a former boarding school where for hundreds of years young men studied the Quran, will amaze you with its intricate stucco and cedar carvings. Or just sit in the shadow of the Koutoubia Mosque minaret, an important example of the region's Islamic architecture. Or simply hop on one of the tour buses at the far end of Jemaa el Fna and check out Marrakech's modern Gueliz district. Staying in Marrakech is best experienced at a riad, a traditional Moroccan home built around a central courtyard. The whole idea was originally to create as private a dwelling as possible, so even finding the entrance to one can be a challenge (always ask your hosts if someone can meet you, if not at the airport, at least at the edge of the Old City to get you there). The best have only a few rooms, each uniquely decorated and appointed. Your hosts will be more than ready to offer suggestions on where to eat, what to see, or just to offer a soothing cup of tea on the rooftop terrace. Soothing tea aside, when you get back from Marrakech, don't expect to feel relaxed. Exhausted is more like it. You will have navigated more alleyways, gotten lost more times and told more people ""no, thank you"" for one reason or another than you should on a vacation. But a few weeks later, when you are looking back over the pictures you took, none of that will matter much. All you'll remember will be the sights and sounds that make Marrakech so special. And you'll be thinking about when you might go back.","Marrakech is not for the timid traveler. But if you're up for an adventure, it's a great destination .

"(CNN) -- This year's Nobel Peace Prize is divided between three women, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee of Liberia and Tawakkul Karman of Yemen, the Nobel committee announced Friday. Since it was introduced at the beginning of the 20th century, the Peace Prize has become the preeminent award honoring individuals and organizations that work for peace, justice and financial and political stability, according to the Nobel Committee. Here are some facts, figures and history behind the award: . The process . ** Nominations come from lawmakers around the world, university professors, previous Nobel laureates and members of the Nobel committee. ** That committee -- made up of five distinguished Norwegians chosen by the country's parliament -- picks the winner. ** This year, a record 241 candidates were nominated. The winner is announced Friday, but the names of the other nominees won't be revealed for another 50 years. The award . ** The award consists of a medal, a personal diploma and a cash prize (10 million Swedish kronor, or about U.S. $1.4 million). ** The Peace medal has the inscription ""Pro pace et fraternitate gentium,"" which means ""For the peace and brotherhood of men."" ** A person must be alive to be nominated. If they die during the consideration period, their name will be removed. Only if a person is announced as a winner and dies before the ceremony will a posthumous award be given. The history . ** The Nobel Peace Prize was created by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish scientist, industrialist and inventor of dynamite. ** Ninety-one Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded since 1901. It was not awarded 19 times, most notably during World War I and World War II. ** Sixty-two Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded to a single laureate; 28 prizes have been shared by two laureates. One time, the prize was shared between three people: Yasser Arafat, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. Recent winners . ** Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo won last year but could not attend. The political activist and longtime critic of communist rule in China is serving an 11-year prison term for what the Chinese government calls ""inciting subversion of state power."" ** In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama won for what the committee called ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples."" ** Martti Ahtisaari of Finland was the 2008 winner. It was his ""important efforts, on several continents and over more than three decades to resolve international conflicts"" that got him the prize, according to the committee. ** The year before, Al Gore and the U.N.'s International Panel on Climate Change shared the prize for their ""efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change,"" according to the committee.","Three women share 2011 Nobel Peace Prize .

"(CNN) -- Back in the day, Shakespeare enriched the English language by pumping out neologisms like a maniac. Fast forward 400-plus years, and we don't really have an official bard, per se -- at least not in corporeal form. Nope, if you want to put your finger on the entity that's currently shaping and torquing our lexicon like a game of drunken Twister, you're already there: Look down at your keyboard, and then at the screen and down at your keyboard again. Yup. Our bard would be the internet, breeding ground of such gems as ""BRB,"" ""tweet,"" and, sadly, ""OMG!!!!!"" Some may call the advent of internet-speak the demise of the English language, and to them we would say, ""STFU."" Last year, ""unfriend"" was deemed the word of the year by the Oxford American Dictionary. So, much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many G&Ts, this new slang is here to stay. Besides, Shakespeare coined the word ""puke,"" so it wasn't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s, anyway. Still, there are some internet terms that don't quite translate when applied to real-life situations (or, OK, any situation other than the original and intended one), because they're too obtuse, redundant or just plain stupid. Here's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene: . # . Ah, the hashtag. First introduced into the Twitter lexicon by Chris Messina in 2007, the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation (e.g., Follow Friday, tweets relating to events, news about natural disasters). Now, however, the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site (""This weekend has completely murdered my soul #whiskeyandheartache), and, more recently, to denote sarcasm and caustic wit (""Wow, I really enjoyed that show. Etch-a-Sketch art is totally dope. More free wine, however, would have made the experience much more tolerable. #JustSayin'). That's all well and good in the Twitterverse, but when taken into the real world, the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out. You see, the majority of society -- you know, the people who don't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how ""Eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that I'm 30 #notakidanymore"" -- doesn't understand what the hell you're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence/word in your correspondence (e-mails, etc.). In fact, they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke. Listen, we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm (despite lofty efforts by the folks over at Sarcmark), and the hashtag is no exception. So, for now, stick to being caustic and dry, and even then, watch your mouth. Not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it. #JustSayin'... @ . MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design may have added the ""@"" sign to its collection in March, but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm. Look, it makes sense to add an @ to your name on Twitter, and Facebook now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke, but referring to your friends as ""@Tom"" or ""@T-Bone"" in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just ... well ... redundant. You already said their name, so why do you need a directive? Even more egregious is rattling off your Twitter handle in any person-to-person situation (Exception: At tech and social media events this rule is a little less hard and fast, given that your Twitter handle is akin to your phone number). Not only does it reek of self-promotion, it's just weird. And take it from us, tech and social-media experts' behavioral standards should not exactly be your yardstick of appropriateness. LOL . Hey, did you know that before ""LOL"" came to mean ""laughing out loud,"" it was code for ""little old lady"" in the medical world? Well, unless you're a doc alerting your compatriots to the arrival of a particularly ornery blue-haired broad, never should you stir your vocal cords to utter the phrase ""LOL."" Why? Because you're not actually laughing. The day that LOL becomes common parlance, my friends, will be the day that this whole internet Bard-penned comedy will become a complete and utter tragedy.","Some internet terms do not translate when applied to real-life situations .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian negotiators put forward proposals on security and borders during talks with Israeli representatives in Jordan, Palestinian media reported Tuesday. Israel's special envoy, attorney Yitzhak Molcho, and chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat met in Amman with representatives of the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- in an effort to relaunch negotiations after more than a year of deadlock. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told reporters that ""serious and constructive talks"" had taken place, the official Palestinian Authority news agency WAFA said. He said the talks focused on the two-state solution, according to the Jordanian state news agency Petra. The Israelis said they would consider the Palestinian proposals, and the two sides agreed to meet again in Jordan, the agency cited Judeh as saying. However, no significant breakthrough was made, Judeh acknowledged. ""The gap is wide between the two sides on all issues,"" he is quoted as saying by WAFA. ""The issues are complicated and we do not expect to resolve them in a day or two."" Petra quoted Judeh as saying, ""We don't want to raise the expectations about this meeting and we don't want to underestimate its importance in the same time."" Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians fell apart more than a year ago over disagreements on the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. In September, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas made a bid for the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state, a move Israel called premature without direct talks to address its long-standing security concerns. Filling the vacuum created by the removal of Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Abdullah has taken a more active role in trying to bridge the gulf between Israelis and Palestinians. In November, King Abdullah made a rare visit to the Palestinian political capital of Ramallah in the West Bank, followed by a meeting in Amman a week later with Israeli President Shimon Peres. The United States has voiced its support for the new initiative. ""We are hopeful that this direct exchange can help move us forward on the pathway proposed by the Quartet,"" Hillary Clinton, the U.S. secretary of state, said Sunday night in a statement. ""The status quo is not sustainable and the parties must act boldly to advance the cause of peace."" But while both sides thanked the Jordanian government for its role in bringing about the meeting, few expected any serious breakthroughs. Speaking to Voice of Palestine radio beforehand, Erakat said the meeting would not constitute the resumption of negotiations, but rather would be one that could lead to the restarting of talks. Former Quartet participant and American diplomat Robert Danin wrote Sunday for the Council on Foreign Relations that, while the resumption of contacts between the two sides would be a positive development, it ""inadvertently makes the situation on the ground riskier."" ""Abbas is returning to talks without attaining his long-standing demand that negotiations resume with an Israeli settlement freeze,"" Danin wrote. ""Unless he can demonstrate quickly that talks produce tangible benefits for the Palestinians, he will feel compelled to break them off."" This, Danin said, could add impetus to Abbas concluding ongoing talks with Hamas about forming a Palestinian unity government -- an idea vehemently opposed by representatives of Israel and the United States, who consider the Islamist group a terrorist organization. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Hamas, said Monday he was surprised by the meetings. He said Hamas considered them a repetition of a failed initiative and called on the Palestinian Authority to cancel the meeting Tuesday with Israeli representatives. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told CNN that the meeting of the Palestinians with the Israeli occupying forces ""is a mockery."" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN last week that ""if Mahmoud Abbas walks toward Hamas, he is walking away from peace."" CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: Hamas spokesman calls the meeting ""a mockery""

"Boston (CNN) -- Out of sheer boredom, Susumu Ito, in World War II, became a forward artillery observer, one of the most dangerous jobs available. ""I lied to my mom and told her it was assigned,"" he recalled. ""I didn't want to tell her I thought it was exciting."" Forward artillery observers are among the first to go behind enemy lines, scouting for enemy installations and troop formations, targeting them for artillery strikes. In combat, he used an artillery periscope to spot enemy positions and direct cannon fire. Ito had been in the Army since 1940, but after the attack on Pearl Harbor, many Japanese-American soldiers were discharged, and even those kept on were disarmed and reassigned. ""They took our rifles away, they didn't know what to do with us,"" Ito said. At first, the Army made him a mechanic, a job he found tedious. ""Except for reveille at 6 o'clock in the morning, we had duties that were entirely like civilians."" In 1943, the creation of the segregated 442nd Regimental Combat Team allowed Japanese-Americans to prove their loyalty to the United States. Ito and thousands of other Asian-Americans welcomed the chance to demonstrate their courage in combat. ""The majority got into the infantry, and that's what I expected, but I was happy to be in the artillery,"" he said. On Wednesday, Ito, along with more than 1,000 members of the 100th Battalion, 442nd RCT, will be honored on Capitol Hill with a Congressional Gold Medal for their extraordinary accomplishments in World War II. The Congressional Gold Medal is the nation's highest civilian award. Japanese-American WWII vets awarded special medal . During World War II, Ito watched as hundreds of men, including dozens of his friends, fell in battle. He witnessed prisoners in striped uniforms look back at their liberators with sunken eyes. He even got to walk around the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's residence near his famed ""Eagle's Nest"" retreat in the Alps. Before deploying to Europe, Ito had seen and been behind the barbed wire that surrounded his family's barracks at Rohwer Relocation Center in southeast Arkansas. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans were labeled ""enemy aliens,"" and more than 110,000 were sent to internment camps across the United States. Though he was concerned, Ito says that he and his family accepted this as something that had to be done. ""It was a strange feeling to have an armed guard give me a pass in order to be let in,"" he said. Ito captured many of his wartime experiences with his small Argus camera. Under orders not to bring cameras, he brought one anyway, as he wanted to keep a record. ""It was quite unique because no one to my knowledge had a camera, they all obeyed orders. I bent them whenever possible."" Ito is now 92 years old, a retired Harvard Medical Emeritus professor who spends his days inside a laboratory using high-tech microscopy equipment to view his cell specimens. His photographs still generate a range of emotions. Many are group shots of smiling war buddies, posing near their howitzers or against scenic backdrops. Some feature the capture of German soldiers or the damaged buildings of the Berghof, and others contain more solemn reminders of the concentration camps, which evoke a sense of indignation. Ito's unit, the 522nd Field Artillery, liberated concentration camp prisoners from a subcamp of Dachau, a town in southern Germany. ""It was an awful feeling, hearing a Lithuanian teenager, in his gray uniform, translate what had happened,"" he recalled. As he snapped photos of the survivors, he thought of his parents and the stark difference in treatment between the German and American camps. ""I have objected to Americans calling the U.S. relocation centers 'concentration camps,' because in my mind, they were nothing compared to the emaciated bodies and crematoria we found in Germany,"" he said. The 442nd motto was ""Go for Broke,"" a saying that rings true for the regiment's battle-hardened soldiers. Most notably, it related to the famous rescue of the Lost Battalion in France in October 1944, when around 230 men in the 141st Regiment, 36th Texas Division, were surrounded by German forces in the Vosges Mountains. Ito still gets goose bumps talking about it. The 442nd dug foxholes in the dense woods, as trees burst and casualties mounted from shrapnel. ""It was so dark, you couldn't see the man in front of you,"" he said. Artillery continued to rain down on them. On the fifth day, two infantry companies, plus 2nd Lt. Ito and his three men, were ordered to charge the hill and reach the 141st. The hill was later renamed Banzai Hill. "" 'Banzai' was a Japanese battle cry,"" Ito explained. The Japanese were notorious for massed suicidal offenses, and now the Americans were directing the same charge at the Germans. Ito and the three men under his command were part of the K and I companies that sent up 371 men. Only 25 soldiers reached the battalion unhurt; including Ito and his three artillerymen. ""I lost so many colleagues in the rescue,"" Ito recalled, his voice hoarse. The 442nd suffered 800 casualties in less than a week. ""I don't know why I was so fortunate. I'm very grateful for the time given to me. I aim to make the most of it."" Needless to say, Ito is proud of his regiment's accomplishments and humbled by the recognition after all these years. He believes this unit's dedication to American patriotism is finally being noticed. ""Despite the fact that we were rounded up, segregated and interned, I think the message I would like to spread is that our loyalty to the United States is unquestioned.""

"(PEOPLE.com) -- CBS's ""Two and a Half Men"" is now actually one man, played by Jon Cryer, one near-man, played by Angus T. Jones, and one manchild. That would be Ashton Kutcher, who made his debut Monday night on the de-Sheened sitcom as Walden Schmidt. Walden is nearly the opposite of Charlie Sheen's now-dead sleaze king Charlie Harper: Sweet, unsarcastic but -- here we stay true to the show's gawping bawdiness -- possessed of an astounding anatomical endowment that he soon puts to use. The instant verdict: Kutcher was not at all bad. He was quite likable. First, though, we must dispose of the corpse. I think if creator Chuck Lorre could have had all the cast and crew come out shrieking and tear apart a lifelike effigy of departed star Sheen, with blood and viscera and intestines tossed into a vat of hot oil, he would have. It's not as if anyone would blame Lorre: Sheen's outrageous behavior earlier this year left a top-rated sitcom without a completed season, without an anchor -- and, regardless of how you regard Sheen personally, without one of the best sitcom actors in prime time. And so the first half of the episode practically danced with sadistic, vengeful glee in explaining how Sheen's character, the irredeemably low-life womanizer Charlie Harper, had perished: At a memorial service, crazy Rose (the very funny Melanie Lynskey) hinted that she had shoved him under the Paris Metro after she caught him cheating during their honeymoon. ""His body just exploded,"" she said, ""like a balloon full of meat."" The only memories Charlie's many lovers shared were about the sexually transmitted diseases he'd given them, and one woman regretted not being able to spit on the body. None of this was funny. It probably wasn't supposed to be. It was a shiv, and it was being stuck in Charlie Sheen. Enter Ashton . Then Kutcher showed up as Schmidt, sopping wet from having tried to drown himself over a broken heart. (He gave up, he said, because the water was too cold.) With his long hair, scruffy beard and hippie-dippy, somewhat stupid sincerity, he seemed at first to have wandered in from a production of Godspell. Except that, as mentioned, he is apparently better endowed than Young Frankenstein and, unlike Mr. Sheen, possesses a body that can be paraded around naked with a preening, unembarrassed confidence. He's very nearly a character out of porn. Did you think you were tuning in to ""Downton Abbey?"" And the fact is that Kutcher, despite having spent so much time over the past few years branding and Tweeting himself, is a good comic actor. Not great. His limit may be that he knows how to play a doofus while subtly reminding us that he really isn't -- he likes to clown, but he probably doesn't want to BE a clown. His self-love may not allow that. Sheen, on the other hand, had the cold toughness of loathing, anger and regret, a comic style almost radical (for prime time) in its thin ash of contempt. True comedy doesn't require a smiley face. How else could Sheen have managed to sell tickets for something called the Violent Torpedo of Truth Tour? But you see where we are now: Kutcher on Sheen's old sitcom. Sheen, appearing on the Emmys, wishing all the best for ""Two and a Half Men,"" seemingly purged of his acidic irony. It was like watching the rebel Winston from Orwell's ""1984"" after Big Brother got through with him. Kutcher is the one known for punking. Sheen, one might say, is the one who ended up punk'd.

"(CNN) -- The spotlight will soon shine on three granddaughters of South African and global icon Nelson Mandela, as the women become focal points of a new reality TV show. The program possibly will air in the United States starting in January, said David Manaway, who is married to one of Mandela's granddaughters involved in the production. It hasn't been announced on what channel it will appear, with Manaway saying only ""negotiations"" are ongoing. The show came about after Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway -- 34 and the oldest granddaughter being featured -- managed to arrange a meeting with Dr. Robert Rey, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who is the subject on an E! reality show, when he came to South Africa. Dlamini-Manaway, her sister and a cousin met Rey's executive producer, Rick Leed, according to information provided Thursday by Cutting Edge Communications, which is working with two South Africa-based production companies on the program. Leed also is known for feature films including ""Where the Heart Is"" and ""Company Man."" The sisters and cousin -- all granddaughters of Mandela and all raised in Boston -- set up Leed with two South African companies, New Vision Pictures and Out of Africa Entertainment. They discussed crafting a reality show following the trio's personal and professional lives. ""The pieces of the puzzle just fitted, the decision was fast, one Skype call and the rest, as they say, is history,"" said Leed. Dlamini-Manaway, described as the ""mother figure,"" is the child of Mandela's daughter, Zenani, who was born to Mandela's second wife, Winnie. Dlamini-Manaway is married to David Manaway, an American businessman she met while studying psychology at Clark Atlanta University, and has a 10-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter. Her third child is due in January. Her 32-year-old sister Swati Dlamini is a single mother with a 3-year-old daughter. She works in the communications field, as well as in setting up a charitable foundation focused on housing, education and health, according to show producers. The youngest granddaughter to be showcased on the show is Dorothy Adjoa Amuah, 27, whose grandmother was the South African leader's first wife, Evelyn. She has a law degree and recently earned her master's in business administration -- specializing in luxury management -- from a school in Monaco, according to show producers. Described as sociable and fun, she lives with her brother and dog, Pan. The description of the show describes all three women as ""refreshingly authentic"" and ""positive role models to women all over the world."" The Mandela family supports ""the right for their children to choose their own destiny and their own path,"" the Cutting Edge release said. CNN's Nadia Bilchik contributed to this report.","Two sisters and a cousin, ages 27 to 34, will be showcased on the program .

"(CNN) -- Airline passengers left stranded by a freak snowstorm that pounded the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states were waiting to get to their destinations Sunday, many after spending a restless night on cots or airport floors. ""Whatever kind of system they had, it completely and utterly broke down,"" said passenger Fatimah Dahandari, who spent a night in Hartford, Connecticut's Bradley International Airport while trying to get to New York. ""It looks like a refugee camp in here."" More than 4 million people in at least five states were without power Sunday as the storm moved offshore. Up to five deaths, some in traffic accidents, were blamed on the storm. Dhandari said her Boston-to-New York flight diverted to Connecticut after being told there was a problem on a runway at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and the JetBlue plane did not have enough fuel to continue circling. ""We land in Connecticut and then it was one series of problems after another,"" she said. Her flight spent nine hours ""literally sitting on the runway"" with no food and water, she said. Passengers were told the plane was waiting to refuel, then was waiting for a gate, then had to get behind another plane that had an emergency on board, she said. By the time it was her plane's turn, the plane was snowed in and could not move, she said, so there was another wait to get a truck to tow it to the gate. Once she got into the airport, Dahandari said everything was closed, providing passengers with no food options. They were told that the hotels were booked, she said, and if they left the airport they could not come back in. She spent a night on the floor, and Sunday morning was standing in line with hundreds of others, hoping to receive a boarding pass and a spot on board a flight. Cell service inside the airport was spotty, she said, and ""everybody's phones are dying. People are trading chargers and laptops."" Overall, she said, passengers have been calm. ""I keep waiting for somebody to freak out, but nobody is."" She said people were being courteous to airline employees, despite their irritation, as ""they're kind of stuck here too."" The fashion consultant had hoped to attend two private Halloween parties in New York Saturday night that were important to her business, and planned to wear a $400 custom-made costume. ""Not only is this the worst traveling experience I've ever had, it's also the worst Halloween I've ever had,"" she said. JetBlue spokeswoman Victoria Lucia said in a statement Sunday that 17 flights were diverted on Saturday ""due to a confluence of events, including infrastructure issues in New York/JFK and Newark (New Jersey)."" Six of those flights were diverted to Hartford, the statement said. ""We worked with the airport to secure services, including remote deplaning and (lavatory) servicing,"" Lucia said. ""Obviously, we would have preferred deplaning much sooner than we did, but our flights were six of the 23 reported diversions into Hartford, including international flights."" In addition, Bradley Airport ""experienced intermittent power outages, which made refueling and jetbridge deplaning difficult,"" she said. ""We apologize to the customers impacted by this confluence of events, as it remains JetBlue's responsibility to not simply provide safe and secure travel, but a comfortable experience as well."" Passengers will receive a refund on their flight, as well as a voucher for the same amount as their round-trip fare, Lucia said later Sunday. The airline said on its web site that it was waiving change or cancel fees, along with fare differences, for travelers in a handful of airports -- Hartford; Newark, New Jersey; Newburgh, New York; New York from JFK or LaGuardia airports; and Westchester County, New York. Passenger Mara Dhaerman was also stranded in Hartford and said her JetBlue flight, initially from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Newark, New Jersey, spent nine hours on the tarmac in Connecticut. Passengers were told the plane was refueling, then de-icing, and that it was going to try to get back to Newark, but eventually a stairway was brought in and firefighters and troopers helped passengers deboard. She said she received a cot to sleep on about 1 a.m. Sunday. ""It's just very annoying,"" she said. CNN's Richard Roth was among those stranded in Hartford. ""It's been a tough night for everyone,"" he said Sunday. JetBlue planned to fly three flights to JFK Sunday and one to Newark, he said passengers were told, along with at least one to LaGuardia. The storm prompted the closure of Newark International Aiport. Also in New Jersey, Teterboro Airport closed Saturday afternoon but reopened hours later, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The FAA also reported major delays of up to 5 hours or more at New York's John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports on Saturday. As of 10 a.m. Sunday, the FAA was reporting no delays. Other forms of travel were also impacted. An Amtrak train with 48 passengers on board was stuck for nearly 13 hours when a rock slide resulting from the snow storm blocked the tracks near Palmer, Massachusetts, said Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham. The train, which originated in Chicago, was headed for Boston when it was forced to stop about 10 p.m. Saturday, she said. A bus was sent to pick up the passengers, but did not arrive until nearly 11 a.m. Sunday. The buses took so long because of the weather and road conditions, she said. The train cars never lost heat or electricity, Graham said, and passengers were given complimentary food and beverages. ""It's like a blizzard -- you can't see far at all,"" Alban Ajro of Watertown, Connecticut, said Saturday night. ""This is the first time that I can ever recall this kind of storm happening before Halloween."" The early onslaught meant heaps of wet snow fell on trees still heavy with leaves -- adding to the risk of falling branches and downed power lines. In Philadelphia, Interstate 95 was closed Sunday morning after black ice caused some 30 cars to crash, authorities told CNN afiliate KYW. Two people were killed, the station said. At least three deaths on Saturday were linked to the unusual October snowstorm. An 84-year-old man was napping on his recliner in Temple, Pennsylvania, on Saturday when a part of a large, snow-filled tree fell into his house and killed him, according to a state police report. With numerous downed trees in the area, rescue crews took two hours to safely remove the victim, police said. A motorist died in Hebron, Connecticut, state emergency spokesman Scott Devico said. A third person was killed in Springfield, Massachusetts, when a man in his 20s ignored police barricades surrounding downed power lines and touched a metal guard rail, which was charged, said city fire department spokesman Dennis Legere. Snow buried parts of New Jersey and New York on Saturday, including 15.5 inches in West Milford, New Jersey, and 12 inches in Harriman, New York. Cities in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland saw more than 9 inches of snow in less than one day. iReport: Winter weather near you . But the storm did little to deter Occupy Wall Street protesters, who camped out in tents coated with a layer of snow in New York's Zuccotti Park. A day earlier, dozens of firefighters removed the group's propane tanks and six generators, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, citing fire hazards. That left the demonstrators to battle the cold weather seeping through their tents, blankets and sleeping bags. ""Occupy"" demonstrators face bite of wintry storm . The governors of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts issued emergency declarations for their states. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Sunday that some 40 shelters are open, in addition to places where people can go to warm up, take a shower or charge their phones. ""We are expecting record lows tonight ... which means we're going to have some freezing conditions in the morning,"" he said. Malloy added that authorities have left it up to municipal officials whether or not to postpone Halloween celebrations because of the storm. Sunday evening, the state's largest utility -- Connecticut Light and Power -- reported nearly 788,000 customers were still without electricity. A total of about 807,500 households were in the dark in Connecticut. Elsewhere, about 1.9 million customers were without power Sunday in Pennsylvania; 639,000 in Massachusetts' 584,000 in New Jersey; and 299,000 in New York, according to figures from power companies in those states. Thousands also lost power in Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.

"CNN (CNN) -- The FBI interrogator who bluffed al Qaeda detainees into giving up significant intelligence began his career in an unusual way. Ali Soufan's fraternity brothers bet him that the agency would never hire a guy like him. A Lebanese-born American studying international relations at a Pennsylvania college, Soufan had just returned to his frat house after talking with a school official about what he should do with his life. It was 1994. His buddies gave him some good-natured ribbing. They said the agency would mark his application, ""return to sender."" He laughs at the memory, joking that he thought the idea was crazy, too. But Soufan's nature has always been to take the dare, he writes in his new memoir ""The Black Banners: The Inside Story of 9/11 and the War Against al-Qaeda."" ""I did some research (about the FBI) beyond 'The X-Files,' "" he told CNN.com. He sent in his application. And to his shock, got a letter asking him to report to FBI training. It was the beginning of a storied career in intelligence. During his FBI stint from 1997 to 2005, Soufan was the lead investigator on major terror investigations such as the October 2000 attack on the Navy's U.S.S. Cole which killed 17 sailors. He helped the agency investigate the attacks on U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in the late 1990s, and was a key interrogator of al Qaeda detainees after the 9/11 attacks. Read more about the global security firm he now leads. Soufan's book details some of those interrogations of al Qaeda operatives, which he says led to the naming of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of 9/11 and led to the arrest of alleged dirty bomber Jose Padilla. ""The Black Banners"" opens with his earliest memories of growing up in Beirut, Lebanon, clinging to his family's staircase as bombs exploded outside his home. ""Everybody is scared of things,"" he told CNN.com. ""I'm not scared of the dark. ... I'm talking about growing up and you don't have (security) most of the time. You're not going to be scared of the dark. On a human level, I have a lot of fears, but you live with these fears everyday."" The book weaves vivid, inside details about the war on terror, and asserts that playing ""mental poker"" with terrorism suspects is far more effective at making them give up their secrets than being physically aggressive. ""There is a difference between compliance and cooperation,"" he said. Compliance can result from torture -- a detainee will do anything to make the rough treatment end. But real cooperation, says Soufan, comes from engaging the detainee after learning everything possible about them. Soufan's opinion contrasts with the Bush administration's assertion that waterboarding and other harsh tactics was their best option with several al Qaeda operatives. When Soufan finished training at Quantico in November 1997, he was assigned to one of the FBI's busiest field offices in New York. He was the only agent in the office who spoke Arabic at the time; one of only eight agents in the country who was fluent, he says. A new job is an exciting time for anyone, and Soufan was thrilled and nervous. ""You want to talk about fear? I was scared, I was nervous on my first day,"" he said. ""I thought, really, my God, how the heck did I end up here? It was fear mixed with excitement, mixed with adventure."" In his first months on the job, Soufan relied on his language ability and his personal interest in the Middle East and North Africa to keep close watch on what mattered in the region. At the time, a Saudi millionaire named Osama bin Laden was consistently making news with his calls for jihad against the West. In early 1998, the young agent wrote a paper urging the FBI to focus on bin Laden. His bosses noticed and told him about bureau investigations of bin Laden. ""Unfortunately, politicians in Washington didn't want to discuss (bin Laden),"" Soufan said. The young agent attracted the attention of Special Agent John O'Neill, a legendary figure well known in the FBI who ran the New York office. O'Neill took Soufan to dinner. It became a tradition for the rookie and the veteran. They would talk late into the night about al Qaeda and what seemed to both of them to be America's most significant threat. ""He was the boss of the boss of the boss. John could be a very intimidating individual,"" Soufan recalled. ""He saw of me a person who was genuinely hard working. ... These are the things, at least I hope, that he saw in me. He took me under his wing. He taught me a lot, and I am forever grateful."" O'Neill left the FBI in the summer of 2001, and became the chief of security at the World Trade Center. He died in the 9/11 attacks. By that time, Soufan had been working the Cole case. On September 12, the agent opened a manila envelope from the CIA containing secret information on men involved in the Cole attack, he said. Soufan said he'd been asking for the intelligence in the Cole attack repeatedly for more than a year and had not gotten it. And now it was September 12, 2001. The information in the envelope linked the Cole attack to 9/11 hijackers. Soufan was stunned. He ran to the bathroom and vomited. ""It wasn't easy. It was very hard moment. I hope I will never feel like this again in my life,"" he said. He couldn't talk to anyone that day about his anguish. His wife only knew that he was in Yemen working the Cole. He couldn't tell her anything more. He couldn't share anything with his family. But he was haunted. He wondered: If the FBI and the CIA had been more open with sharing intelligence, could the 9/11 attacks been thwarted? In the years ahead, as the U.S. ratcheted up its campaign against al Qaeda and went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, Soufan felt more determined than ever. Soufan handled a key interrogation of Osama bin Laden's bodyguard. Through what Soufan calls ""mental poker,"" he got Abu Jandal to unwittingly give up the names of several 9/11 hijackers, he writes in his book. Jandal, Soufan said, opened up to him after the agent engaged him in a long debate about theology. Read an excerpt about the Jandal interrogation . ""I never liked any of them (the detainees he interrogated),"" Soufan said. ""I think you have to put your emotions and feelings (aside). ...You have to have the empathy and knowledge of human nature. That's No. 1. No. 2 is you need to learn a lot about your cases and your target. If you'd put me in an interrogation room with a Chinese spy, I would go nowhere with it because I don't know the language, the threats."" Soufan said he wants a detainee to think he already knows what they're hiding, a tactic he learned from watching experienced interrogators. In 2002, Soufan found himself in another al Qaeda interrogation, this time playing his hand against training camp chief Abu Zubaydah, who had been captured in a Pakistan firefight. Zubaydah was injured in the battle, and Soufan and his partner worked over many weeks to soften the detainee. It wasn't working. The terrorist continued to try to lie to his interrogators. So the agent referred back to a detail he had read in intelligence files about Zubaydah. ""I said, 'OK, what if I call you Hani.'"" That was a nickname Zubaydah's mother called him, according to the terrorist's files. It seemed like a big turn in the interrogation. Zubaydah believed that his interrogators knew a lot about him. His ability to lie was significantly diminished, but Soufan didn't betray the victory on his face. ""You cannot have your ego take the best of you in an interrogation because you have to keep all options on the table,"" Soufan said. Zubaydah, Soufan writes in his book, would go on to accidentally give up Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. The revelation came after Soufan's partner mistakenly printed a picture of Mohammed. Soufan showed the photo briefly. Zubaydah saw it and startled Soufan when he indicated Mohammed was behind the attacks. Soufan, once again, kept a stoic face. In ""The Black Banners,"" much of the chapter Soufan devotes to his time with Zubaydah is blacked out. And for those who might be concerned that the information in his book could be valuable to al Qaeda, it's important to note that much of what he reports is already extensively published in public record, in the ""9/11 Commission Report,"" and in the book ""The Looming Tower,"" which won a Pulitzer. ""The Looming Tower"" author Lawrence Wright wrote about Soufan in the story ""The Agent"" in the New Yorker in 2006. After the FBI approved a copy, that copy was sent to the CIA which Soufan says ordered the redactions. Most of a chapter called ""The Contractors Take Over"" -- which Soufan said details how Zubaydah's interrogation was taken out of his hands and given to a less experienced interrogator who used torture -- has been blacked out. ""It's unfortunate,"" Soufan said of the CIA's choice to redact. The redactions don't change the narrative, said Soufan. ""They didn't take away from the points I'm trying to make in the book."" Blacking out passages, Soufan suggested, only gives his story more legitimacy. ""You only classify and redact stuff that's true. You don't classify and redact stuff that's not true.""","One of the FBI's former leading agent's new book argues against torture as a technique .

"(CNN) -- Charges of bribery against former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and Halliburton by Nigeria's anti-corruption police may be dropped after an agreement to pay a $250 million fine. ""Discussions focus on the possibility of a plea bargain arrangement,"" said Femi Babafemi, a spokesman for Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. ""Allowing the company and former officials to pay heavy fines in lieu of prosecution ... they would pay $120 million as fines and $130 million from bad money stored in Switzerland from the original deal -- so $250 million in total."" This month, the commission charged Cheney -- who ran Halliburton in the 1990s -- and nine others with ""conspiracy and distribution of gratification to public officials."" The investigation is part of a long-running case involving Halliburton and a subsidiary firm, Kellogg, Brown and Root, over alleged bribes paid to Nigerian officials to secure $6 billion worth of contracts for a liquefied natural gas project in the Niger Delta. The bribes are said to have amounted to $180 million between 1994 and 2004. The firm pleaded guilty to foreign bribery charges in the United States last year and paid a $402 million criminal fine, the U.S. Justice Department said. KBR and Halliburton also paid $177 million to settle civil complaints related to the bribery, the Justice Department said. Investigations in Nigeria, however, have been ongoing, and there are allegations that the bribes went all the way to the top, to aides, officials and possibly then-President Olusegun Obasanjo. Many observers in Nigeria regard the move as a publicity stunt by the commission ahead of national elections in April and as a symbolic effort to display resolve against government corruption. The agency has had limited success in getting successful prosecutions and hasn't charged any high-profile people since its top commissioner was removed from the body in 2007. Cheney's atttorney has said that there is no reason to suspect that his client is guilty. ""This matter involves the activities of an international four-company joint venture (which included KBR, then a subsidiary of Halliburton) well over a decade ago,"" Terrence O'Connell said. ""The Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission investigated that joint venture extensively and found no suggestion of any impropriety by Dick Cheney in his role of CEO of Halliburton."" The latest discussions on reaching a settlement ended this weekend in London, Babafemi said. The arrangement is now waiting for Nigeria's Minister of of Justice to officially agree to the deal, a decision that is expected by the end of the week.","Energy firm, former vice president charged with bribery .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate faced off Monday in a federal appeals court in California, as a panel of judges heard arguments about the constitutionality of Proposition 8. In August, a federal judge ruled that the voter-approved measure, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, violated the U.S. Constitution. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered an appeal of that judge's ruling Monday. The three-judge panel opened Monday's hearing with tough questioning of parties seeking to appeal the decision, including ProtectMarriage.com and Isabel Vargas, who's a deputy clerk and deputy commissioner of civil marriages for Imperial County, California, where voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 8. ""What's your best case to allow for your standing in federal court?"" one judge asked attorney Charles Cooper, representing ProtectMarriage.com. ""Your honor, I don't have a case,"" Cooper responded, referring to relevant court cases. Cooper later urged the panel to consider how the California Supreme Court earlier ruled in favor of the voter-approved Proposition 8. ""If you don't agree with me that we have standing,"" Cooper told the court, ""then I do urge you to answer the California Supreme Court decision."" Then Judge Stephen Reinhardt questioned attorney Robert Tyler, who represented Vargas, about how a deputy clerk, instead of the clerk, could have legal standing in the appeal. After a lengthy exchange, Reinhardt appeared frustrated and stated: ""If you don't know the answer, say so, as the prior attorney did."" In asserting that his client has standing in the appeal, Tyler told the court that the county clerks are local officers, but they perform state functions such as civil marriages. Monday's arguments in San Francisco, California, were being divided into two hour-long sessions -- one over the legal standing of those appealing the decision, and one over the constitutionality of Proposition 8. Monday's hearing is the latest in a lengthy legal battle over same-sex marriage in California. The state's high court had allowed same-sex marriage, but then the 2008 Proposition 8 voter referendum passed with 52 percent of the vote. The California Supreme Court subsequently allowed that initiative to stand, saying it represented the will of the people. Two same-sex couples filed a federal challenge, saying the law violated 14th Amendment constitutional protections of due process and equal protection. On August 4, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker agreed, ruling that the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. ""Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license,"" Walker, who was appointed to the federal bench by former President George H.W. Bush, wrote in his 136-page opinion. ""Indeed, the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California Constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples."" Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five states and in the District of Columbia. The five states are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire. Walker's landmark ruling led to a swift federal appeal that could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.","NEW: Judges ask tough questions to side opposing same-sex marriage .

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- A 16-year-old Hong Kong boy makes two phone calls for delivery: One for pizza, the other for the drug ketamine. Two teenage girls are found semi-conscious in a car park after overdosing on ketamine. A 13-year-old boy joins a gang and is given free ketamine. Glass capsules containing ketamine, which has become the drug of choice for Hong Kong's youth. These are anecdotes told to CNN by police, a family doctor and a former gang member. Ketamine has become the drug of choice among young people, as the number of people under 21 taking drugs has surged 57 percent in the last four years in Hong Kong, said Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong. ""We started off with a very small number of young people taking drugs. We are now more worried about the trend,"" Wong said. ""We don't want a runaway trend; that's why we are stepping up action."" Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer, can put users in a dazed stupor for about two hours, doctors said. Long-term use of ketamine can impair cognitive function and damage internal organs. An oversupply of the drug in Hong Kong and the fact that it is cheaper than other narcotics makes ketamine popular with young people, said Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau. One gram of ketamine sells on the street here for $13 and is enough to be shared with two other people, while cocaine, for example, sells for $103 a gram, Fok said. The drug is legal for medical use, but it is trafficked into Hong Kong from other parts of Asia, such as India and mainland China, and sold on the streets illegally, Fok said. Police have recently stepped up their efforts to crack down on drug use at clubs and bars in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a city in mainland China just across the border. Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong, mostly under the age of 30, were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here. However, narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse. ""Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds. That's what our recent data from last year shows,"" Fok said. ""They want to find some other places to take drugs."" The problem has gotten so bad that authorities have decided to do something never done here before: random school drug tests. Beginning in September, some two dozen schools will conduct tests, as part of a trial program. Officials say the drug screening will most likely be in the form of urine tests, though they are still working out the details. Ketamine can be detected in urine for at least three days, doctors said. Dr. Cheng Chi Man, a family practice doctor, runs a seminar that trains doctors to detect the signs of drug abuse in young patients: drowsiness, skin problems, frequent urination (ketamine can affect bladder function) and frequent sick leave. ""When we were 10 years old, we were still in primary school watching TV and eating candy. But they are now taking drugs."" Alman Chan, principal of Hong Kong's only drug rehab school for youth, the privately-run Christian Zheng Sheng School, said he has watched as drug use has grown.  See photos of the rehab school in remote Hong Kong » . ""Just look at our school development. I was here 14 years ago. At that time, I was the only teacher. I had 18 kids. I only had one student who was 15,"" he said. ""But now, I have one third -- about 40 of them -- who are 15 years old or younger. That shows you the number of students getting into drugs is bigger and also getting younger and younger."" There were a few reasons why children were getting involved with drugs, such as troubled homes and difficulties at school, he said. ""People are more concerned about material things and they are getting lost,"" he added. Hong Kong Police have arrested children as young as age 13 for drug offenses, according to Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong. Police last week reportedly busted a network that allegedly recruited teenagers to sell illegal drugs-- mainly to students. One of those arrested -- a 14-year-old school dropout -- was found with 28 grams of ketamine, according to the South China Morning Post. But ketamine abuse is not limited to young people. It is the second-most popular drug among all age groups in Hong Kong, Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau said. Many young drug abusers end up in Alman Chan's drug rehab school for youth, which is located in a remote part of Lantau Island west of Hong Kong. CNN visited the campus, which is home to 99 boys and 24 girls. The closest road is a three-hour hike through the woods. Chan calls the school ""the last stop before jail"" for drug abusers. That was the case for Tai Ming Hung's son Keith, a former gang member. She learned he was using ketamine when he ended up in the hospital after taking the drug a few years ago. ""I was in denial. I just didn't believe it was true. When I first heard about it, we all didn't know how to react, because we hadn't heard of those drugs before,"" she said. ""I didn't really understand why we have these harmful drugs in the world. And I was so afraid that it would kill my son."" 18-year-old Keith, who said he began using ketamine at the age of 13 when he joined a gang, has recovered and is now living at Chan's school. ""I have a feeling that he's really growing up, he keeps improving,"" his mother said. The school's curriculum involves regular school subjects and chores. The goal is for each student to finish their court probation and either sit for the university exam or continue on to a vocational school. Many of the students have become interested in video editing and photography. There is a video lab on campus and the students showed CNN some video projects they have done. Other students run a pizza parlor and tea shop on a neighboring island. The average stay at the school is three years and students are encouraged to plan for life after rehab. ""We have vocational training. We help them get some marketable skills; therefore, they may get a job or continue training afterward,"" Chan said. ""I believe everyone deserves a second chance.""","Police: Ketamine is the top drug of choice among young people in Hong Kong .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Security forces in Iran on Thursday confronted thousands of protesting Iranians across the city, first at a cemetery and later at a prayer venue and near a government building, witnesses and news reports said. Mourners gather around the grave of Neda Agh-Soltan in Beheshte Zahra Cemetery. Clashes erupted at the cemetery as two of Iran's main opposition leaders tried to join the several thousand people at a memorial for the slain woman who became the symbol of Iran's post-election violence, witnesses said. The gathering was banned, but participants ignored the government strictures. However, security forces barred opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi from the gravesite of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old woman shot in election protests on June 20, witnesses and news reports said. More than 3,000 people were gathered at Agha-Soltan's grave, a witness said. Mourners arrived on the religiously significant 40th day after the fatal shooting in Tehran. For Iranians, a predominantly Shiite Muslim population, the 40th day after a death marks the last official day of mourning. At the cemetery, security forces used tear gas to clear the area of demonstrators and mourners. A witness said riot police and Basij militia were at the scene, but the confrontations with people in the crowd involved the militia.  Watch a report on the memorial clashes » . The witness spotted instances of the baton-wielding militia charging the gathering, and said as many as nine beatings were seen. Other people  appeared to have been beaten as they ran from police, the witness said. One of the mourners had a bloody head and one woman said she was struck on the back of the neck. One security force member sustained some sort of injury to the head and was bloodied. It is unclear exactly how that person was injured. A confrontation between women protesters and police also was seen. The women shouted, ""Don't beat up our young people. You, our Muslim brothers. It is a shame to beat up our young people."" The crowd chanted ""Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein,"" the first a reference to the revered Shiite imam and the second a reference to Moussavi. Then there were more chants of ""Allah wa Akbar,"" or God is great. iReport.com: Share your photos, video, stories . Despite reports of arrests, none were seen on the mourning day. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said using force to ""break up a group of people who were trying to exercise an important ritual in Islam, the mourning after 40 days,"" was ""particularly disturbing."" ""We stand by the Iranian people who are exercising their universal right to self-expression and demonstrating peacefully,"" Kelly said. Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, reported that the mourners ""disrupted the order"" in the city and damaged public and private property and that security forces were merely trying to control the ""illegal activity"" of the group. IRNA also reported that Tehran residents in the area were angry with the constant protests and wanted a stronger response from the security forces. Another witness told CNN that police directing traffic at the cemetery were helpful and friendly, in stark contrast to the riot police and Revolutionary Guard members who were at the gravesites. From the cemetery, the mourners arrived at the Mossalla, a building under construction that is expected to be the main venue of Tehran's Friday prayers, witnesses said. A couple thousand people demonstrated and police worked to disperse the crowd -- which also was defying a ban on such a gathering. ""The police tried to discourage drivers from driving the main highway that would lead to central Tehran, but very few listened,"" one witness said. ""Soldiers standing along the streets flashed the peace sign back at the honking cars with large smiles on their faces. It was obvious the soldiers and police forces were with the people."" Thousands also marched and chanted along a prominent thoroughfare called Vali Asr Street, chanting slogans such as ""Death to the dictator"" amid the honking of car horns, a witness said. Amateur video posted Thursday on several Web sites and submitted to CNN's iReport showed a security officer swinging a baton at a demonstrator. CNN cannot confirm the circumstances of the images. Protesters gathered near the Interior Ministry building and trash cans were set ablaze, another witness said. Police on motorcycles attempted to break up the gathering, and one security officer was seen wielding a gun. Moussavi was the chief challenger of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June presidential elections, which the government said Ahmadinejad won in a landslide but many Iranians think was rigged. Moussavi had said on his Web site that he and fellow reform candidate Karrubi would commemorate Agha-Soltan's death with her mother at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery. At the cemetery, a witness said a car identical to a vehicle belonging to Moussavi drove through the area. It was not clear if Moussavi was in the vehicle, but people were sitting atop and around the car as if to protect it. The car left the scene. In the days after the June vote, thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the results. The government cracked down. Hundreds were detained in prison, among them 50 ""political figures"" accused of playing key roles in the street demonstrations that turned violent, Iranian media reported Wednesday. Among those still reportedly detained is Shahpour Kazemi, Moussavi's brother-in-law, according to Moussavi's wife. Others include Behzad Nabavi, a Moussavi ally, and Mostafa Tajzadeh, who served under Iranian President Mohammad Khatami -- a Moussavi supporter -- the Iranian Labor News Agency reported Tuesday.","Security forces confront protesters across Tehran .

"(CNN) -- In brief remarks to the media just after returning to her hometown of Seattle, an emotional Amanda Knox thanked those who believed in her and supported her fight to overturn her murder conviction in Italy. ""I'm really overwhelmed right now,"" said a tearful Knox, who arrived to cheering supporters at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. ""I was looking down from the airplane, and it seemed like everything wasn't real."" ""What's important for me to say is just thank you, to everyone who has believed in me, who has defended me, who has supported my family,"" she said, her voice shaking. Being with her family, she said, is ""the most important thing to me right now."" ""Thank you for being there for me,"" she said. Knox and her family were on a British Airways flight that landed in Seattle about 8:12 p.m. ET. Before beginning her remarks, Knox smiled and said, ""They're reminding me to speak in English, because I'm having problems with that."" An Italian appeals court on Monday overturned Knox's murder conviction in the 2007 death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. Knox initially was sentenced to 26 years in prison. Knox's mother and stepfather, Edda and Curt Mellas, also thanked those who have supported their family, as well as the Italian attorneys who fought on her behalf. ""Meredith was Amanda's friend,"" said Philadelphia attorney Theodore Simon, who spoke at the news conference. Knox wants the Kercher family to be remembered, Simon said as Knox nodded and appeared to fight tears. Knox supporters in Seattle said they planned a rousing welcome. ""To Amanda herself, we say, 'Way to go, kid,' "" Tom Wright, founder of the group Friends of Amanda Knox, said Monday night. ""We look forward to welcoming you home with open arms and open hearts,"" Wright said, reading a statement. ""You have well deserved, and will well deserve, all the joy and warmth and fun of your normal life returned to you."" The statement also said that it was ""primarily a sad occasion,"" and that the group's ""deepest sympathies"" were with Kercher's family. CNN affiliate KOMO-TV reported that Wright was among a group of more than a dozen supporters who gathered at a hotel suite to watch the jury return its decision about Knox more than 5,000 miles away. Afterward, Margaret Ralph was among those crying tears of joy. Asked what she'll say when she sees Knox, Ralph told KOMO, ""I won't say anything. I'll just give her a big hug and kiss."" ""It was incredible,"" fellow supporter Kellanne Henry told KOMO, adding that it took a minute to absorb the news. ""They finally got it right,"" she said. Many Seattle residents took to social media to post messages. ""I am so happy this nightmare is over for you,"" Seattle resident Jenn Whitney wrote in a posting on one of several Facebook pages devoted to Knox. Whitney said she ""cried with joy"" when Knox's conviction was overturned. ""I pray that God brings you home safely,"" she added. ""If I had the chance to greet her when she lands back here in Seattle, the only thing I would do is hand her a rose, give her a hug and say 'welcome home!' "" Jeff Bamby posted. On another Facebook page, Tamara Slater wrote, ""Amanda you have been in the prayers of so many people, it must be heart warming to know you were never forgotten. Welcome home!"" CNN affiliate KIRO-TV reported that when staff went out to gauge reactions to the news out of Italy on Monday, ""We met just a few people in West Seattle who disagreed with Monday's ruling and thought that Knox was guilty."" Jordan Adams said he thought Knox was guilty, but he was willing to accept the decision to overturn the conviction. ""I did think she was guilty, but I guess, good luck to her since she's been freed and cleared,"" he told KIRO. Early Tuesday morning, a jogger who spotted a CNN crew in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill neighborhood stopped and yelled, ""Yay Amanda! Welcome home!"" But later, another resident walked up to a CNN crew to say that she could not ""care less about Knox returning home"" and that she believed Knox committed the crime.

"London (CNN) -- Fans and friends of Paul McCartney gathered in central London Sunday to watch the ex-Beatle walk down the aisle for the third time, as he married girlfriend Nancy Shevell. The couple arrived together just before 3:30 p.m., the groom in a blue suit and the bride in a long-sleeved white gown with a white flower in her hair. Both wore outfits by McCartney's fashion designer daughter Stella, said Monique Jessen of People magazine. The crowd of hundreds went wild when they appeared, with one well-wisher saying of the match: ""It just seems right."" McCartney, 69, and his 51-year-old bride left Marylebone Town Hall about an hour later and waved to crowds while being showered with confetti, before arriving at McCartney's home. Ringo Starr, the only other surviving former Beatle, was there, as was iconic U.S. television host Barbara Walters, who reportedly played a role in introducing McCartney and Shevell, an American trucking heiress. Walters is Shevell's second cousin, she said on her show ""The View"" in 2007. McCartney and Shevell got engaged in May, a McCartney representative told CNN at the time. The wedding took place at the same venue where McCartney married his first wife, Linda, in 1969. She died of breast cancer, aged 56, in 1998. A memorial service for her two months later was the first time McCartney, Starr and George Harrison appeared together in public since the Beatles split in 1970. John Lennon, the fourth member of the band, was shot dead in New York in 1980. Shevell, the bride, is the daughter of a New Jersey trucking magnate. She is an executive at her father's company, New England Motor Freight, and a 10-year member of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. She was married once before, to lawyer Bruce Blakeman, who is active in Republican and Jewish circles in New York state. He ran unsuccessfully for Senate against Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand last year. Her father's company has annual revenues of about $400 million, says Blakeman's biography on his law firm's website. Press reports say they have a 19-year-old son. Alison Cathcart, who performed McCartney's third wedding, called the venue ""a rock 'n' roll place to tie the knot."" Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit married there, as did Melanie Griffiths and Antonio Banderas. Cathcart has conducted marriage services for celebrities including Sylvester Stallone and Joan Collins, Westminster City Council says. McCartney's second marriage -- to model Heather Mills -- ended in a bitter divorce in 2008 after four years. They have a daughter, Beatrice. Mills fought for a large divorce settlement, saying McCartney had limited her ability to work as a model during their marriage and that she had acted as a psychologist to him as he grieved for his first wife. Judge Hugh Bennett all but laughed both assertions out of court, saying her testimony was not only ""inconsistent and inaccurate but less than candid."" He awarded her 24.3 million pounds ($48.6 million at the time) -- less than one-fifth of the 125 million pounds she had asked for. Sunday would have been John Lennon's 71st birthday. CNN's Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Paul McCartney and Nancy Shevell leave their wedding in London .

"(CNN) -- The Jacksonville, Florida, man accused of hacking celebrities' online accounts for nude photos and other private information said Friday, ""I am very sorry for all of this."" A federal judge ordered Christopher Chaney, 35, to appear in a California courtroom on November 1 to answer charges, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said. ""What I'm most sorry about is that I had to drag my mom into all of this, and my family and my neighbors and they just want to live their lives,"" Chaney told reporters. He did not respond to questions. Chaney is accused of hacking into the accounts of more than 50 celebrities, including movie stars Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera. A grand jury indicted Chaney on nine counts of computer hacking for gain, eight counts of aggravated identify theft, and nine counts of illegal wiretapping. If convicted of all 26 counts, Chaney would face a maximum of 121 years in federal prison, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said. The aggravated identity theft charge alone carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence, he added. The suspect's attorney, Christopher Chestnut, said his client ""remains very remorseful"" and understands the importance of privacy. Still, Chestnut indicated the potential sentence appeared harsh. ""People who murder kids don't get 120 years in prison,"" he said. Earlier this week, Chaney told a reporter that he had became ""addicted"" to the intrusion and ""didn't know how to stop."" ""I know what I did was probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience,"" Chaney told CNN affiliate WAWS/WTEV in Jacksonville, Florida, on Wednesday. ""And these people don't have privacy to begin with. And I was in that little sliver of privacy they do have."" The FBI's Los Angeles office said he was arrested as part of ""Operation Hackerazzi,"" which looked into computer intrusions targeting individuals associated with the entertainment industry. ""Unfortunately, Mr. Chaney was able to access nude photos of some of the celebrities and some of them were uploaded on the Internet,"" Birotte said Wednesday. A recently circulated nude photo of Johansson is part of the investigation, he said. Chaney allegedly ""also took financial information, movie scripts and conversations that the celebrities believed to be private,"" Birotte told reporters. In the interview with WAWS/WTEV, Chaney said the hacking ""started as curiosity and it turned into just being, you know, addicted to seeing the behind-the-scenes of what's going on with these people you see on the big screen every day."" ""It just happened and snowballed,"" he said, adding that he wishes it had never begun. Chaney said he felt ""almost relieved months ago"" when authorities seized his computer because ""I didn't know how to stop doing it myself. I wasn't attempting to break into e-mails and get stuff to sell or purposely put it on the Internet. It just -- I don't know."" Authorities allege that Chaney distributed the photos he obtained illegally and offered them to celebrity blog sites. Some of the files, including private photographs, were posted online ""as a result of Chaney's alleged activities,"" authorities said in a statement. ""I've had like six months to think about it,"" Chaney said, ""it eats at me. ... When you're doing it you're not thinking about what's going on with who you're doing it to."" According to the FBI's Los Angeles field office, investigators believe that Chaney used publicly available sources to mine for data about his targets. Once Chaney gained access and control of an e-mail account, ""he would obtain private information, such as e-mails and file attachments, according to the indictment,"" the FBI said in a statement. Authorities allege that once Chaney hacked into a celebrity's e-mail account, he would use the contact lists to find other celebrities' e-mail accounts. This allowed him to add new victims, authorities charge. He allegedly set his victims' accounts to automatically forward their e-mails to his account, Birotte said. This allegedly allowed Chaney to continue to receive celebrities' e-mails even after a password was reset, authorities said. Chaney made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Jacksonville, Florida, on Wednesday afternoon, and was released on a $10,000 unsecured bond with the conditions that he can't use any computer or other device with Internet access and he can't have any controlled substances or excessive use of alcohol, said Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles. CNN's Michael Martinez, Josh Levs, Carey Bodenheimer and John D. Sutter contributed to this report.","NEW: Suspect says, ""I am very sorry for all of this""

"Washington (CNN) -- As the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial was officially dedicated Sunday, speakers called for carrying on King's ideals and values and confronting issues including bullying and social and economic justice for all Americans. ""Nearly 50 years after the March on Washington, our work -- Dr. King's work -- is not yet complete,"" President Barack Obama said at the dedication ceremony. The nation faces many challenges, he said, including an ailing economy, substandard education, war and tragedy. Progress, he said, can often be a slow and painful process. During the civil rights movement, ""progress was purchased through enduring the smack of billy clubs and the blast of fire hoses. It was bought with days in jail cells and nights of bomb threats."" Every victory was met with setbacks and defeat, Obama said. Today's America can draw strength from that struggle, from King's belief that we are one people and from his refusal to give up, the president said. ""Let us not be trapped by what is,"" Obama said. ""We can't be discouraged by what is. We've got to keep pushing for what ought to be."" He noted that King ""will stand for all time, among monuments to those who fathered this nation and those who defended it. A black preacher, no official rank or title, somehow gave voice to our deepest dreams and our most lasting ideas."" ""I know we will overcome,"" the president said. ""I know there are better days ahead. I know this because of the man towering over us."" The monument to the slain civil rights leader was due to have been dedicated on August 28, the anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington when King delivered his world-altering ""I Have a Dream"" speech, but Hurricane Irene forced the event to be postponed. Perhaps, said the Rev. Bernice King, one of King's daughters, that postponement was due to divine intervention. ""Perhaps God wanted us to move beyond the dream into action,"" she said. ""As we dedicate this monument, I can hear my father saying that oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever,"" she said. ""The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself ... I hear my father saying what we are seeing now, all across the streets of America and the world, is a freedom explosion."" She called for ""a radical revolution of values and reordering of priorities in this nation."" She urged attendees to also pay homage to her mother, Coretta Scott King, who even as a grieving widow with four children ""raised a nation in my father's teachings and values. It was vitally important to her that his life and principles become institutionalized."" The memorial site, which features a striking 30-foot statue of King gazing out on the iconic Tidal Basin, lies between the Lincoln Memorial and the Thomas Jefferson Memorial on the National Mall. The statue, representing a ""Stone of Hope,"" sits forward from a ""Mountain of Despair."" Visitors pass through the mountain on their way to King's statue and an expanse along the basin rimmed with an inscription wall covered with stone carvings of some of his most famous quotes. The four-acre area will also feature the iconic cherry blossom trees that draw thousands of tourists to the Mall each spring. ""The very first time that I came to the site, I was almost overwhelmed,"" Martin Luther King III said. ""I really was impressed by this artist. He was able to capture the essence of my dad."" On Sunday, he described his father as ""a champion of human rights and social justice for all people,"" regardless of race, gender and ethnicity. ""Let us not forget that he paid the ultimate price for our civil rights,"" he said. But, he said, ""we've lost our souls,"" noting the recent killing of a black man in Mississippi; child bullying; wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the lack of social and economic justice. The American dream, he said, has ""turned into a nightmare for millions."" Former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather said that while King's main battle was racial injustice, today's fight is against greed and for economic justice. ""This time we judge people, not on the content of their character, but the color of their money,"" he said. ""Once again, we have Americans on the outside looking in."" ""There is heavy lifting to be done again,"" Rather said. ""And in the spirit of Dr. King's lasting legacy, we need to start now."" If King were here today, said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, he would tell the Occupy Wall Street protesters to ""keep protesting. Remain nonviolent. Stay disciplined. Stay focused."" U.S. Rep. John Lewis recalled protesting in Washington 48 years ago. Of those that spoke near the Lincoln Memorial that day, ""I'm the only one still around,"" he said. He recalled that King never asked protesters to do anything he would not do himself. ""He was arrested, jailed, beaten and constantly harassed. His home was bombed. He was stabbed. He suffered the slings and arrows of hate."" He said he's heard talk that nothing has changed. ""Come and walk in my shoes,"" he told attendees. ""Dr. King is telling you that we have changed. We're better people. We're a better nation."" Other speakers at the dedication included the Rev. Al Sharpton; the Rev. Joseph Lowery; actresses Cicely Tyson, Diahann Carroll and 12-year-old Amandla Stenberg; and Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of the Children's Defense Fund. Singer Aretha Franklin sang ""Take My Hand, Precious Lord,"" a tune she said King often requested. The Obamas listened intently as she sang. Michelle Obama applauded in spots, while the president closed his eyes. The Obama family toured the memorial before the president's speech. Controversy still lingers around the statue and a quote from King. Sculptor Ed Dwight, who has made seven statues of King, objects to the memorial's depiction of the icon -- and to the artist chosen to create it. ""This idea of having this 30-foot-tall sculpture of this man, and this confrontational look, he would not appreciate that, because that was not him,"" Dwight argues. He also objects to the choice of Chinese artist Lei Yixin. ""I feel strongly that the whole thing should've been done here in America,"" Dwight said. Harry Johnson Sr., head of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Foundation, said: ""We got the best man for the job."" And Lei, for his part, said America did not have sole claim on King. ""Martin Luther King is not only a hero of America, he's also a hero of the world,"" he said. Celebrated poet and author Maya Angelou has a different objection to the memorial, saying that one of the quotes has been edited to make King appear arrogant. It reads: ""I was a drum major for justice peace and righteousness."" Angelou says an important clause was taken out of the passage from a 1968 sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. King's original words were: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" Leaving out the ""if"" changes the meaning, Angelou said. ""It should not be seen like he was so full of himself. Because he was not. He was a very humble man,"" she said. ""It is not an apt reportage of what Dr. King said. It is an edited statement."" The memorial's executive architect Ed Jackson stood by the wording and said there are no plans to alter the structure. Jackson, who oversaw the memorial's design and construction, said in a statement that the memorial foundation ""feels comfortable with the choices we needed to make based on the space available and the messages that we wanted to convey to visitors."" He said a ""council of historians"" had been consulted, adding they suggested 14 quotations and two statements for possible inclusion on the monument's granite walls that ""best characterize and reflect"" King as a leader as well as his values. ""In no way do we believe that this paraphrased statement diminishes Dr. King's intent of the words he delivered,"" Jackson said. ""The inscription on the Stone of Hope comes directly from Dr. King's words."" Former U.N. Ambassador, former Atlanta mayor and civil rights leader Andrew Young said King was sensitive about his small stature, as he stood only 5 feet 7 inches. ""Now he's 30 feet tall, looking down on everybody,"" Young said. CNN's Athena Jones, T.J. Holmes and Roland Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama: ""We've got to keep pushing for what ought to be""

"(CNN) -- With lessons learned from previous titles and a sense of finality to the franchise, ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"" exceeds expectations with a wonderful storyline, dynamic action and witty dialogue from its characters. The latest in the franchise from Naughty Dog, ""Uncharted 3"" returns to follow hero Nathan Drake on yet another historical adventure that promises fortune and glory but invariably involves a lot of danger. As in games past, Nathan is a treasure hunter who follows clues to find lost riches in far-off lands and gets help from other characters in his missions. The game's storyline follows the path of ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom,"" the T.E. Lawrence book that inspired the epic movie ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Amy Henning, the writer for the ""Uncharted"" series, pulls elements from Lawrence's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about Nathan's search for a lost city called Iram of the Pillars. Keith Guerrette, lead visual effects artist from Naughty Dog, said Henning really opened up the characters in the game and delves deeply into Nathan's past as well as his connections to his companions. While some of the story is told in flashbacks, it never feels disjointed or out of place and flows with the action in the game. The pace, for the most part, is quick and occurs over several different types of environments. From a vast desert to historical chateaus, the scenes are beautifully rendered and help deepen the moment. There were a couple of missions that bogged down the story in places, but those were few and far between. Many times, I felt like I was in an ""Indiana Jones"" movie. There were moments when the gameplay was very similar to what I've seen on the big screen. For example, one mission had me chasing after a caravan transporting my longtime friend, Victor Sullivan, through a narrow cavern in a scene that was reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Like Dr. Jones, Nathan has to solve puzzles and use his journal to reference solutions. The puzzles were not extremely challenging once the clues in the journal were deciphered. There are other little touches that are Jones-esque, but they add to the story rather than taking away from it. The action is high adventure with a twist of humor and whimsy along the way. The dialogue helps keep the mood light as character banter flows naturally and feels like what it is -- conversations between people who don't take themselves too seriously but have experienced life-changing events. There is humor, caring, concern and sarcasm that one would expect from longtime friends. It feels natural and gets the player emotionally involved. ""We've been building up to this one,"" Guerrette said. ""We went in thinking, 'How can we take our tech and art and make them even better?' "" There are subtle effects in the environment, like shadows from a fire, ripples in water and disappearing footprints in sand. But the most dynamic action fills the screen during intense missions in which Nathan takes on his enemies while the background moves. Much of Nathan's movement occurs along the sides and rooftops of buildings, like the ""Assassin's Creed"" games. That motion becomes more challenging when floors and walls are also moving around. The game's combat has been fine-tuned but still seemed uneven at times. Guerrette said the development team worked hard to eliminate some of the cover problems that were evident in previous titles. Melee was improved (I enjoyed getting up close and personal with my enemies) and moving while firing is nearly mandatory. Stealth has become a more effective tool in some missions. There was one mission, however, where I used stealth to eliminate all the bad guys and avoid raising the alarm -- only to discover two bandits guarding a door that I could not stealth kill. It was a little bit frustrating to work so hard on being stealthy when there was no way to avoid having to be obvious to advance. Targeting specific areas on enemies also didn't seem to matter. There were times when I shot an enemy multiple times in the head before he would fall down. Yet it would take the same number of shots to an enemy's arm to get him to collapse. Nathan can also throw back grenades that are tossed his way. The audio is funny, but the effects are devastating. A split-screen co-op version (a fan request) offers a unique story with the chance to unlock multiplayer bonuses and skills. This version can be played either on or offline. The multiplayer version also features improved cinematic techniques, boosters and the ability to upload great (or not-so-great) gameplay moments into social media platforms. A buddy system can be used for cooperative play in multiplayer mode, or you can go it alone during competitive play. ""Uncharted 3"" is an outstanding adventure game that gives you a feature-film feeling. The environments are open and interactive. The story is unique and fresh. And the characters are portrayed in ways that make them feel real and emotional. While developers wouldn't say if this was the final act for Nathan Drake, there are moments in the game that answer lingering questions from previous games. Those are the ""aha"" moments that put an extra shine on a wonderful game. If this is the end, ""Uncharted 3"" provides a fitting conclusion with an immersive game that keeps players invested until the final treasure is obtained.

"(CNN) -- An early goal from Theo Walcott gave Arsenal a vital 1-0 victory over Udinese in the first leg of their Champions League final qualifying round tie at The Emirates. England international Walcott timed his run into the area perfectly to volley home Aaron Ramsey's fourth-minute right-wing cross from close range, to give Arsene Wenger's side a vital advantage to take into the second leg in northern Italy next week. Arsenal came into the match on the back of a trying week, which saw captain Cesc Fabregas leave for Barcelona and more rumors surface of Samir Nasir's impending transfer to Manchester City. What now for Arsenal and Fabregas? The Gunners had to field a make-shift side with Nasri and new captain Robin Van Persie both suspended and key midfielder Jack Wilshere injured. To compound matters, Wenger himself had to watch from the stands because of a one-match UEFA ban. But despite a few nervy moments, primarily when Udinese captain Antonio Di Natale struck the crossbar with a long-range strike, Arsenal held on. And Walcott nearly added a second goal late on, forcing a superb save from goalkeeper Samir Handanovic. There were four other matches played on Tuesday evening, with Lyon coming from behind to beat Russian side Rubin Kazan 3-1 at the Stade de Gerland. Rubin are looking to reach the group stages for a third successive year and they took a third minute lead when Vladimir Dyadyun turned in Bebras Natcho's right-wing corner. However, the French side levelled seven minutes later when Bafetimbi Gomis got in between two defenders to finish a Michel Bastos cross. And they went ahead five minutes before half-time when a Gomis cross-shot from the left found the net off defender Saba Kvirkvelia. Lyon sealed their victory 19 minutes from time when Jimmy Briand headed home a Kim Kallstrom corner. Meanwhile, an entertaining match in the Netherlands saw FC Twente draw 2-2 at home to Benfica, a result that leaves the Portuguese giants favorites to reach the group stage. Luuk de Jong fired the hosts in a sixth minute lead, but Benfica leveled when Paraguay striker Oscar Cardozo curled home a superb equalizer. Benfica led at the break after a fine flowing move saw Nolito score from close range but, with 10 minutes left, Bryan Ruiz headed home for Twente as the match finished all-square. The other two matches saw BATE Borisov of Belarus draw 1-1 at home to Austrian side Sturm Graz, while Czech champions Viktoria Plzen secured a superb 3-1 win at FC Copenhagen of Denmark.","Arsenal defeat Udinese 1-0 in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier .

"Washington (CNN) -- Lithuania's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday rejected a report from lawmakers saying the country had hosted secret CIA prisons as part of the ""war on terror."" ""There are neither facts nor information that secret CIA detention centers existed in Lithuania,"" the ministry said in a statement, contradicting Amnesty International statements a day earlier based on a report by Lithuanian lawmakers. ""It has neither concluded that the territory of Lithuania was used to transfer persons under suspicion of terrorism nor that such persons had been brought in or transported from the territory of Lithuania,"" the Foreign Ministry said of the parliamentary report. Amnesty International said a day earlier that the former Soviet republic, now a NATO member, had become the first country to admit it hosted secret CIA detention centers for terror suspects. The tiny country on the Baltic Sea contained two ""black sites,"" the group said -- the first holding a single prisoner in 2002. In 2004, a former riding school outside the capital, Vilnius, was converted to hold up to eight detainees, according to the Lithuanian parliamentary report, Amnesty International said. The Bush administration came under fierce criticism for the alleged practice of ""extraordinary rendition"" -- capturing suspected terrorists in one country, moving them to another country without proper legal protections, and using ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" on them. Opponents of the practice say the interrogations amounted to torture. Former CIA agent Bob Ayers explained Tuesday how it worked. ""There were flights coming in from the battlefields and Iraq or Afghanistan. There were flights that were coming in from other nation-states which were not at war but we were collaborating with -- for example, Egypt or Jordan -- where suspected terrorists were picked up and brought to the interrogation centers where they were interrogated,"" he said. ""And then the information gained from those interrogations was then shared among the participating nations."" The Obama administration says it no longer operates black sites, but has not formally ended the process of extraordinary rendition. A CIA spokesman declined to confirm or deny the Lithuanian lawmakers' report. ""The agency's terrorist detention program is over, and the CIA has not commented publicly on where facilities associated with that effort may or may not have been,"" said Paul Gimigliano of the CIA Office of Public Affairs. He added that the allegation that Lithuania hosted black sites was ""not new."" Amnesty International said it was not important whether the allegation was new or not. ""Confirmation of the existence of a secret prison in Lithuania marks a modern low point for human rights protection in Europe,"" said Julia Hall, Amnesty International's expert on counterterrorism in Europe. ""But the Lithuanian inquiry signals a turning point in the quest for the truth about what role European states played in helping the United States in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Other European governments should take note and commit to full investigations of similar serious allegations."" Other European states, like Poland and Romania, have also been accused by human rights groups -- and even the European Parliament and the Council of Europe -- of housing secret CIA prisons and colluding in extraordinary renditions. Lithuania's parliamentary report may put more pressure on other states to come clean. But there are lingering doubts about aspects of the report by the Lithuanian parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense. It accuses the Lithuanian security services of providing the CIA with the facilities without the knowledge of the country's political leadership. Analysts say that seems unlikely. ""To think that any national government would have foreign aircraft flying into its airspace, people being taken from aircraft and moved to control facilities somewhere within their sovereign territories -- and neither the central government, police, customs or air traffic control, no one knew anything about this except for the head of the security service ... that's just not believable,"" said Ayers, the former CIA officer. It would be a violation of Lithuanian law if true, Amnesty pointed out. ""The Lithuanian government should have known what its own agencies were doing and is ultimately responsible for the secret prison and any human rights violations that may have taken place there,"" the advocacy group said. ""The inquiry's findings are only a first step toward accountability,"" said Hall. ""The investigation in Lithuania should continue and those persons responsible for any involvement in the secret site must be identified and prosecuted."" CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow, Russia, and Jim Barnett in Washington contributed to this report.","Lithuanian lawmakers reported Tuesday the country hosted CIA ""black sites,"" group says .

"(CNN) -- A little earlier this year the art world made an extremely rare discovery -- a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Only some 15 paintings by Leonardo still exist, including the ""Mona Lisa"" and ""The Last Supper."" So, this newly discovered painting -- known as ""Salvator Mundi"" or ""Savior of the World"" -- is a truly remarkable find. The 500-year-old painting depicts the head and shoulders of Christ and is in sparkling condition after cleaning and restoration. It will be included in a-once-in-a-lifetime Leonardo da Vinci show at the National Gallery in London from November 9th -- the first time ""Salvator Mundi"" will have shared space with other Leonardos for many centuries. CNN has been given rare access to this newly discovered work. In a half hour special program, Nick Glass travels to New York to meet Robert Simon, an Old Masters dealer, who is acting on behalf of the owners of ""Salvator Mundi,"" and gets to see the painting first hand. During his time in New York, Glass also talks with restorer Dianne Modestini, who brought the painting back to its original state. Intrigued, Glass heads to Florence to learn a little more about the life and work of da Vinci, the ultimate Renaissance man. Further interviews with world renowned da Vinci experts shed more light on the man, his paintings and his contributions to science and medicine. Finally, Glass returns to the National Gallery where the ""Salvator Mundi"" will be on show to the public until February 2012. Will another painting like this ever be discovered and is the adjective ""priceless,"" accurate in this instance? This program will attempt to answer these questions, while telling the story of the most talked about piece of art unveiled this century.

"(CNN) -- Hunter S. Thompson's slim early novel -- written in 1959, when he was 22, but only published 40 years later -- gets a dream screen treatment courtesy of producer-star Johnny Depp and ""Withnail and I"" writer-director Bruce Robinson. By rights Depp -- who already played Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke in Terry Gilliam's grandly grotesque ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" -- should be too old to play the latest recruit on a failing American newspaper in San Juan, Puerto Rico. But even when he's hung over and wretched (which is often) he easily passes for 30, the age of the book's ""Paul Kemp."" Of course the fact that this engagingly left field movie has spent three years on the shelf helps. When Kemp washes up in San Juan, his greatest literary achievement is his resume. He's promptly put on the astrology desk. But he's hungry to make a name for himself, which gives him an edge over his pickled colleagues. It's enough to attract the patronage of local wheeler-dealer Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a property developer who has big plans for the island -- and his eye-catching girlfriend, Chenault (Amber Heard). It would be an exaggeration to call ""The Rum Diary"" a dry run for ""Fear and Loathing"" (and ""dry"" wasn't really in Thompson's vocabulary, though Kemp does make vain promises to cut back on the hard stuff from time to time). Still, in Depp and Robinson's hands you can't miss the roots of Gonzo. This is more than ever the portrait of the artist as a young man -- fermented, refined and distilled from the book. Compared to his cartoonish Raoul Duke (or his Jack Sparrow) Depp's agreeably deadpan performance is scaled back several notches, though it's hard to think of another movie heartthrob who uses his body to such clownish effect when the occasion arises. Frequently shuttered behind a slick pair of shades, Kemp is a stranger in paradise and not quite sure of his bearings yet. He's an avid observer trying to figure out where a real writer might fit between the stinking shantytowns and the shiny luxury beach houses. Robinson has no doubts about which side he's on in that fight, and smuggles in pertinent asides on the parlous state of today's heavily mortgaged newspaper business. Vibrantly photographed by Dariusz Wolski, the movie lays on the local color with gusto -- we get fighting cocks, voodoo and carnival - but we also see broken down plumbing, simmering racial tension, permanent flop sweat and killer lines like Sanderson's, after Kemp marvels at the beauty of the place: ""It's God's idea of money."" Admittedly Kemp's picaresque misadventures don't add up to much of a plot -- the wheels come off in a climax that slouches off miserably in search of some future happy ending -- but there's so much to enjoy along the way, the movie's delayed release is hard to fathom. Depp's easy rapport with Michael Rispoli, as photographer/sidekick Sala, is a low-key delight. I loved the way Aaron Eckhart's imperious uber-confidence slips where Chenault is concerned; and even anomalies like a jewel-encrusted tortoise... ""I got the idea from a book,"" Sanderson explains -- as if it did. Bruce Robinson has never topped the riotous comic miserabilism of his first film, the cult classic ""Withnail and I"" -- he's never even come close -- but ""The Rum Diary"" might be considered hair of the dog after a 24-year-long career hangover. He's back in his debauched and debunking element, which is reason enough to celebrate.","Depp's agreeably deadpan performance is scaled back several notches .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Flash floods killed at least 20 people in the southern French region of Var, French authorities said Wednesday. The flooding began Tuesday, and more storms were expected Wednesday evening, the Var prefecture said in a statement. Authorities warned of ""possible intense rain and thunderstorms, sometimes violent in the coastal area."" Eleven helicopters worked overnight to rescue people and 1,000 people have been placed in shelters, the prefecture said. Some 1,200 firefighters and 650 police officers were taking part in the rescue effort, it said. All schools in the region were closed Wednesday and more than 96,000 people were without electricity. Authorities earlier said 12 people were missing, but by the end of the day they said all the missing had been found, either alive or dead. Var includes the Cote d'Azur, a popular tourist destination along the French Riviera. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne and Pat Thompson contributed to this report.","More storms expected Wednesday night in flood-stricken region .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If you can tolerate the junkies on the stairwells or the rats that sometimes scale the 12 floors of her building on the external electrical wiring, Lui's penthouse shack ticks all the boxes for a multi-million dollar property in Hong Kong. It's light, it's well ventilated and it has sweeping views of Kowloon's Lion Rock Hill. Constructed from recycled materials, the design is customized to her lifestyle down to the last detail. ""This is my washing machine,"" says Lui, pointing proudly to a small stainless steel basin on the terrace side of her rooftop house in Sham Shui Po. ""I do my tai chi exercises here in the morning, and on moonlit nights I like to sit out here and look out on the mountain."" Anywhere else in Hong Kong, luxury apartments can often fetch HK$100 million (US$12.85 million), and a house with these features could easily cost the average transaction price of HK$13.25 million (US$1.7 million), according to data released by agency Midland Realty earlier this year. The only difference is that as an unprepossessing corrugated iron shack that forms part of Hong Kong's extensive network of sky slums -- technically illegal rooftop structures barnacled onto the roofs of tenements built in the 1950s and 60s -- the market is sluggish. Nevertheless, a gray market in these slum dwellings does exist. ""Of course the agent never explicitly says it's a rooftop dwelling. The listing will say something like small apartment with a unique view or interesting features,"" says Dr. Ernest Chiu of Hong Kong University who has studied informal housing. ""I've heard anecdotal evidence of them changing hands for HK$40,000 (US$5,000) but that was three years ago when I was doing my research."" In the volatile world of Hong Kong property prices, says realtor Janice Chan of Y&L Properties, they could now be worth a lot more. ""Even if a dwelling has an illegal structure status, I would say that it was absolutely impossible to get anything in Hong Kong for under $HK1 million (US$129,000),"" Chan says. World's most expensive luxury city is... She contends prices could even exceed this, making Lui's hand-built shanty one of the most expensive slum dwellings in the world. According to the latest Hong Kong census from 2006, there are 3,962 rooftop dwellers in 1,556 households in Hong Kong. Mostly found in old urban areas in Kowloon -- Sham Shui Po, Kwun Tung and Tai Kok Tsui -- the houses are crammed together so tightly that they form their own above-ground streetscapes, complete with gardens, playgrounds and places of worship. The slums are a hangover from the housing crises of the 1950s and 1960s when successive waves of refugees from mainland China set up squatter cities in Hong Kong. Many of the residents have lived in the slums for more than 30 years, and new arrivals tend to be underprivileged migrants from either mainland China, Pakistan, Nepal or other parts of Asia. Since 2001, when 16,359 people lived on Hong Kong's rooftops, the number of illegal dwellings has reduced dramatically. While government policy has played a part, more often the tenements -- under constant pressure due to the shortage of land in Hong Kong -- are torn down to make way for new shopping and residential developments. For the government, which supplies these rooftop communities with a postal service, water and electricity; collects rates; and even levies stamp duty on their sale and purchase, the sky slums operate under an established practice of ""tolerance versus demolition,"" says Chiu. Their existence, while not ideal, keeps almost 4,000 people off a crowded public housing queue, he adds. Fire restrictions are strict (those with a single rather than double fire exits are earmarked for demolition as a top priority), and building codes rigidly enforced (adding an extra floor to a non-structural building is forbidden), but the Building Department's normal practice is simply to issue a notice that slates the illegal structure for eventual demolition. Under this system, illegal rooftop dwellings often survive for decades and are bought and sold with the demolition notice as part of the negotiated price of the transaction. Despite their quasi-legal status, Chiu explains, authorities will act promptly, if they receive complaints from third parties, making the residents vulnerable to abuse. ""There have been reports of some owners, living on the floor immediately below the rooftop huts, making complaints to the building authority to get their rooftop neighbors evicted,"" he says. ""In other cases, the landlord renting these huts may make complaints to evade their responsibilities as stipulated in the landlord-tenant contract."" As for Lui, she says she has owned her house for decades. The double fire exit on the roof has made her structure safe from demolition, and she has no plans to move from Sham Shui Po. ""If they moved me to public housing it would shorten my life,"" she says, pointing to the nearby tower blocks. ""Those flats are too small."" While there are disadvantages -- she says the house rocks in typhoons, the dark stairwell attracts drug users, and the rats are too clever to be trapped -- she says there's nowhere else she'd rather live. ""My neighbors are great, the police are quick to come if we have any trouble with drugs, there's no crime, the shops are downstairs and everything is just so convenient,"" she says. ""People may look down on me, but I certainly don't look down on myself.""

"Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A second typhoon in a week pounded the Philippines over the weekend, weakening Sunday only after prompting evacuations, causing severe flooding and contributing to one death. Typhoon Nalgae, known locally as Quiel, had lost some strength by Sunday morning. But it still had maximum sustained winds of 130 kph (80 mph), with gusts recorded 30 kph stronger, according to a 4 a.m. Sunday advisory from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Administration. At that point, its center was 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Baguio City. The storm follows Typhoon Nesat, which left at least 52 people dead and caused damage in 34 provinces since it hit Tuesday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. The two typhoons will or have already affected about 3 million Filipinos, the nonprofit World Vision group estimated in a news release Saturday. The second typhoon -- Nalgae -- made landfall in Dinapigue, in Isabela province, on Saturday morning, the disaster council said. It is expected to have moved past the east Asian island nation by Sunday, forecasters said, after having brought rain of 15-25 millimeters per hour (0.6-1 inch) in many locales. Over the course of the weekend, the storm had made several roads impassable in the cities of Calasiao and Dagupan on Luzon island, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. Affected residents are being evacuated from those communities and others, including Santa Barbara. The disaster council, in a Sunday morning update, said that a 35-year-old man was killed and a 22-year-old woman injured in landslides triggered by the storm the previous day. At least 850 families, or roughly 3,500 people, in the provinces of La Union and Pangasinan have been directly affected by flooding, according to the council. Also Saturday, the San Roque Power Corporation opened two gates at one of its dams along the Agno River in north Luzon, due to high waters there related to the storm, the news agency said. Presidential spokesman Abigail Valte earlier Saturday urged residents of low-lying and mountainous areas that could be hit hard by the storm to evacuate, the state news agency said, citing an interview conducted on a government radio station. World Vision, the Christian humanitarian organization, said Saturday that it had to postpone some of its relief efforts due to Nalgae, with two of three emergency teams set to deploy once the storm passes. Another team is in Bulcan province, most of which is ""still submerged"" because of Nesat. The group is focusing its post-Nesat efforts on two communities in Manila and three in the northern Isabela and Zambales provinces. Vouchers are being distributed so people can buy needed items, some emergency supplies are being given out directly to citizens and 3,000 Manila children will receive school supplies. Sherbien Dacalanio, a CNN iReporter in the Philippines, described one area of Manila as being devastated by Nesat. ""The damage is shocking. It's like a damage brought by earthquake and tsunami,"" Dacalanio said. CNN's Ivan Cabrera and journalist Arlene Samson-Espiritu contributed to this report.","NEW: Typhoon Nalgae weakens, with sustained winds of 130 kph (80 mph)

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Miffed by a visa delay that led the Dalai Lama to cancel a trip to South Africa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday, saying it had acted worse than apartheid regimes and had forgotten all that the nation stood for. ""When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was,"" Tutu said at a news conference. ""Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government. ""I have to say that I can't believe this. I really can't believe this,"" Tutu said. ""You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here."" The Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said. Visa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said. However, South Africa's foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa. ""South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision,"" according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration. The Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. Tutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa's government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994. ""You are disgraceful,"" Tutu said about the government. ""You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood."" The ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter. But he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair. This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend. In refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting. ""We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,"" presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy. Speculation surfaced Tuesday that this year's visit was also affected by South Africa's relationship with China. South African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties. Motlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. But Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China. ""We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest,"" Monyela said. The Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: ""Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so."" Kim Norgaard, CNN's Johannesburg bureau chief, contributed to this report.","NEW: The African National Congress says Desmond Tutu should calm down .

"(CNN) -- An earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Bali early Thursday, rattling buildings and sending dozens to hospitals with minor injuries. The 6.0-magnitude quake hit 100 km (62 miles) southwest of Bali, the U.S. Geological Survey said. At least 43 people were taken to local hospitals, including five who suffered serious injuries, medical officials said. A few suffered broken bones and are undergoing treatment, said Wayan Sudanti, an official at a local hospital. Another medical official at a nearby hospital said several others were undergoing treatment for minor injuries, but did not specify how many. The quake had a depth of 38 miles, and no tsunami alert was issued, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in 14 countries. The tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations. Indonesia was among the hardest hit nations.","NEW: Dozens of injuries reported, medical officials say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah ""knows our position loud and clear"" on the punishment of the victim of a gang rape. President Bush said he would be angry with a state that did not support a rape victim. However, Bush said he did not recall having raised the issue during a recent telephone conversation with the king. The woman was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for violating the kingdom's strict Islamic law by being alone with an unrelated man before the rape. The president said during a White House news conference that upon learning of the case, ""My first thoughts were these: What happens if this happened to my daughter? How would I react? And I would have been ... I would have been very emotional, of course. ""I'd have been angry at those who committed the crime. And I would be angry at a state that didn't support the victim. ""And our opinions were expressed by [White House press secretary] Dana Perino from the podium."" Asked whether he personally had pressed King Abdullah about the matter, Bush responded, ""I talked to King Abdullah about the Middle Eastern peace. I don't remember if that subject came up. ... He knows our position loud and clear."" Last month, the Saudi Ministry of Justice said the woman had had an ""illegitimate relationship"" with a man who was not her husband, and that she was raped by seven men after she and the man she was with were discovered in a ""compromising situation, her clothes on the ground."" The woman, now 19, was initially sentenced to 90 lashes for meeting with the man -- described by the woman's attorney as a former friend from whom she was simply retrieving a photograph. When she appealed her sentence, a Saudi court more than doubled it. The rapists initially received sentences ranging from 10 months to five years in prison. After the woman's appeal, the Qatif General Court also increased the sentence for the rapists, to two to nine years in prison. The Justice Ministry had previously said the woman's sentence was increased after evidence came to light against her when she appealed her original sentence. The attacks took place in the eastern city of Qatif in March 2006, when the woman was 18 and engaged to be married. Her husband has told CNN that ""from the onset, my wife was dealt with as a guilty person who committed a crime. She was not given any chance to prove her innocence or describe how she was a victim of multiple brutal rapes."" Under Saudi Arabia's Islamic law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or undergo surgery. The rape victim's husband, who has not been identified publicly in order to protect the identity of his wife, said he considered his wife's decision to meet with the man ""a bad choice on her part,"" but denied that she had admitted meeting with the man illicitly.

"(CNN) -- Twitter was abuzz Thursday with the death of Apple visionary Steve Jobs but another topic was gathering steam as the day progressed. Who will win this year's coveted Nobel Peace Prize? Not Jobs, though many among his huge global following posted messages that he should. The Nobel is never awarded posthumously and that rule also eliminates Mohamed Bouazizi, the unemployed college graduate whose self-immolation in Tunisia sparked a popular uprising that led to the fall of Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali's government. The Tunisian revolt began this year's so-called Arab Spring. Some years, there are clear frontrunners -- Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi. This year, it's anyone's guess with a record number of nominations -- 241 -- received by the Nobel committee. Of those, 53 are organizations, including WikiLeaks -- the website founded by Julian Assange that facilitates the publication of classified information and made headlines for leaking documents and videos related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also released thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables. ""Liu Xiabao was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his struggle for human rights, democracy and freedom of speech in China,"" blogged Norwegian lawmaker Snorre Valen of the Socialist Left Party, who nominated WikiLeaks. ""Likewise: WikiLeaks have contributed to the struggle for those very values globally, by exposing (among many other things) corruption, war crimes and torture -- some times even conducted by allies of Norway."" Liu's win upset the Chinese and set off a diplomatic squabble. The year before, the world gasped collectively at Barack Obama's win, a shocker that the U.S. president had won even before he had completed his first year in office. Despite the controversy that has swirled around perhaps the world's most prestigious prize, some experts say this year is a no-brainer, given the seismic events that have gripped the Arab world. Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of Norway's Peace Research Institute Oslo shortlisted men and women who did their share in fomenting peaceful revolts against repressive regimes. Harpviken's top choice is Israa Abdel Fattah, who helped organize Egypt's online April 6 Youth Movement in 2008. She was arrested by Egyptian security that year and soon became a symbol of defiance against Hosni Mubarak's government. She has earned the monikers ""cyber dissident"" and ""Facebook girl"" and was named one of Arabian Business Magazine's 100 most powerful women in 2011. The peace research institute's website said that Fattah is a good choice because the Nobel committee ""has emphasized its wish to be relevant, to speak to dominant themes of the present, and to see the prize giving leverage in unfolding processes. Secondly, Harpviken believes that the prize is likely to be awarded to a female leader or activist who has been an innovator of new tools for bringing about peace."" Another potential winner is Wael Ghonim, the former Google executive who used social media to jump-start social change in Egypt. Ghonim fired off a steady stream of messages on Twitter and Facebook and worked behind the scenes to galvanize thousands to march on the streets to demand change. Tunisian blogger Lina Ben Mhenni is also on many top lists. Censored in her own country, she criticized the regime long before the uprisings began, dispersing information to the outside world. ""A prize to Mhenni would be a prize to independent reporting, in the form of social media, as well as recognition of the peaceful protests of the Tunisian people at large,"" the peace institute website said. Some experts think that Gene Sharp, an American scholar who founded the Albert Einstein Institution in Boston, could be recognized for his work on the principles of non-violence, including ""From Dictatorship to Democracy."" The downloadable writings in many languages have proved a source of inspiration around the world, including the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. Harpviken also named Memorial, a Russian civil rights group known for its fight for to protect refugees and victims of political persecution and human rights violations in war zones. Natalya Estemirova, Memorial's lead researcher in the Chechen republic, was abducted and killed in July 2009. Human Rights Watch said it ""appeared to be clearly connected to her work uncovering human rights violations in Chechnya. "" Bookmakers Paddy Power listed Sima Samar, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, as a favorite at 5/4 odds. A physician and trailblazer for women's rights, Samar was named deputy premier after the toppling of the Taliban in 2001, the first woman to win such a high government post. She has been threatened with death and harassed for questioning conservative Islamic laws and practices, including the burqua, the head-to-toe garment Afghan women have been forced to wear. Paddy Power picked the right winner last year. That bodes well for Samar. Other names on global shortlists include: . -- Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese pro-democracy leader who was released from house arrest last year. Suu Kyi is already a Nobel laureate -- she was awarded the peace price in 1991. No individual has won it twice, though two organizations -- the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees -- are repeat winners. -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . -- Cuban dissident Oswaldo Payas Sardinas . -- Ghazi bin Muhammad, a Jordanian advocate of interfaith dialogue . The winner will be announced Friday. Until then, the speculation continues to heat up. Twitter user Alu Abunimah (@avinunu) offered one last candidate for consideration to his more than 16,000 followers. ""Maybe the Nobel Peace Prize will go to The Markets, to help Calm them and make them Feel Better,"" he said. ""Also they need the money."" The Nobel Peace prize laureate will win about $1.5 million. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Many experts say an Arab Spring nominee will win the peace prize .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A Japanese power company restarted a nuclear reactor this week, the first to come back online since a March earthquake and tsunami in the nation. The March 11 disasters sparked a nuclear crisis and a backlash that postponed plans to reopen reactors shut down because of damage, inspections or unrelated technical problems. Kyushu Electric Power Co. said it has started generating electricity from the No. 4 reactor late Tuesday at the Genkai nuclear power plant in western Japan. The reactor was taken offline in October after technical problems. Company officials won approval from a local governor and a mayor to bring the reactor online, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported. Nuclear safety critics criticized the reopening, with the power company receiving more than 200 calls Tuesday from citizens who opposed the move. Another power company said it may have suffered a setback in its efforts to handle damaged nuclear reactors. Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Wednesday it detected the chemical element xenon in a nuclear reactor at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a sign that nuclear fission may have occurred. The power company said it began injecting boric acid into the cooling system and has not seen a temperature change that would suggest nuclear fission has occurred. The reactor, No. 2, was one of several damaged in the wake of the historic March 11 disaster. Recently, Japanese officials said it may take 30 years to decommission the four damaged reactors at the power plant. A draft report, released by Japan's Atomic Energy Commission of the Cabinet Office last week, said the removal of debris -- or nuclear fuel -- should begin by the end of 2021.","The reactor went offline in October after technical problems .

"(CNN) -- Powered by the same energy produced by a toaster, this weekend 39 solar-powered cars are preparing to race across the Australian outback reaching speeds in excess of 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour) along the way. Setting off from Darwin on Saturday, many of the cars taking part in the biennial, 3,021-kilometer (1,877-mile) Veolia World Solar Challenge to Adelaide look more like ping-pong tables on wheels rather than conventional cars. However, the spirit of adventure and quest for more energy efficiency is what drives the teams of volunteers, university students and organizers. ""We think about it in terms of the land-based version of ocean yacht racing,"" says Chris Selwood, the event director. ""Really it's about how much you can do with how little. We're looking for the ultimate efficiency in electric cars."" This year is the 11th race and Selwood is happy to point out that while most of the cars don't resemble anything else that will be rumbling down the Australian highways this weekend, some of the innovations pioneered by the vehicles over the years have made it into the mainstream. Energy-efficient, ""low-rolling resistance"" tires that are on the market now were used by Michelin in World Solar Challenge events of the early 1990s, and since the inaugural event in 1987 the electric motors have improved in efficiency by at least 30%, says Selwood. Some of the motors being used by teams have been engineered to work at 98% efficiency in turning electricity into motor power. ""That could drive a washing machine, ceiling fan or even electric vehicle,"" says Selwood. ""There are many uses for a motor like that in our daily lives across a range of applications."" For the top teams, though, the aim is to get to Adelaide first and worry about the legacy of the technology later. Nuon Solar Team's Nuna6 car is one of the favorites to win this year's competition. As winners of the events from 2001 to 2007, Nuon Solar Team, made up of students from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, hope to claim back the crown they lost in 2009 to Japan's Tokai University's team. To aid their attempt, Nuna6 is made of a carbon fiber also used by some Formula 1 cars, making it 10% lighter than its predecessor in 2009. And like Formula 1, strategy is expected to be important in giving each team the edge. Each team has to extract enough power from a battery with just 5 kilowatt hours of capacity (10% of the power competitors are anticipated to need to complete the race), while also judging when to charge it up for the next day. ""The biggest challenge is to drive non-stop, but we've got a good chance,"" says Nuon Solar Team's Nadine Rodewijk. For others, making a solar car more appealing to the public is a greater priority than seeing the checkered flag first. To highlight that solar cars are getting closer to the real thing, Bochum University in Germany's SolarWorldGT has shunned the sleek, aerodynamic design seen by Nuna6 and others in favor of something more recognizable with two doors and two seats. That the SolarWorldGT can still effectively compete the race is thanks in part to improvements in solar and motor technology in recent years, and a new competition rule that has reduced the solar panel capacity allowed on each car by 25% compared to 2009. ""They've got to use that energy wisely to get up hills and get out from under clouds,"" says Selwood. ""By keeping some reins on some of these keys factors, we're seeing some very clever ways in addressing them."" But for all the goodwill and innovation on offer, when the rubber hits the road it will still be a race. ""Our aim as a team is to win,"" says Nadine Rodewijk from Nuon Solar Team. ""Although personally, for each of us, it's about the experience and adventure, learning and preparing for the future.""","Solar-powered car race from Darwin to Adelaide .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will be looking for nations around the world to get tougher on Iran in the wake of the alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States, a senior State Department official said Tuesday. The official said that although Iran is under multiple sanctions, many countries are not enforcing the restrictions, and sometimes if they have problems with Iran, they don't speak out publicly. The official said the United States is going to be looking for countries to enforce existing sanctions, implement new ones and cut ties with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, to basically match what the United States has already done. To make the case, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other senior officials in the department are going to be placing calls to leaders and foreign ministers, U.N. Security Council members and others with influence on Iran, the official said. The official said the United States is looking for what Clinton calls a ""chorus of international condemnation"" of Iran. A senior administration official, asked if there will be sanctions on more individuals related to this particular plot, responded, ""We've done what we think is the network here."" Asked what actions the United States would take next, the official said, ""We are continuing to look for additional ways to apply financial sanctions on Iran. We are very much in the business of increasing pressure on Iran through sanctions so Iran understands they have a clear choice to be made between coming to the table seriously (and) meaningfully, and facing further isolation and sanction. ""We're continuing on that course."" Meanwhile, Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns plans brief the diplomatic corps Wednesday at the State Department on the alleged Iran plot, a second senior department official said Tuesday. The official described it as an ""informational briefing"" and said that Burns will explain the details of how it went down, how the Obama administration handled it and the need to hold Iran accountable. A third senior State Department official told CNN that the briefing will also try to allay any concerns that were raised in diplomats by word of an assassination plot against an ambassador in Washington. The official said the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security is working with the Secret Service and ""taking all appropriate measures"" to protect foreign diplomats and diplomatic facilities. Saudi Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir has always had his own State Department Diplomatic Security detail, as have previous Saudi ambassadors.","The U.S. will be looking for countries to do more on Iranian sanctions, a top official says .

"(CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan's father jumped from a third-floor balcony Thursday to try to escape re-arrest, police said, but officers soon caught up with him and took him into custody -- again. Officers detained Michael Lohan after his girlfriend, Kate Major, said he violated terms of his release from jail earlier this week by calling her, the Tampa Police Department said in a statement. Investigators arrested Lohan on suspicion of domestic violence after an incident on Monday night, but they let him out of jail after he posted bail. Just after 1 a.m. Thursday, Lohan's girlfriend called police to say Lohan had violated the terms of his release by calling her, the police statement said. Lohan called his girlfriend again while she was talking with police, and she put him on speakerphone, it said. After prosecutors authorized Lohan's re-arrest, officers went to a hotel, the Tahitian Inn, where he was staying. ""Upon seeing officers, he jumped out of a third-story balcony in an attempt to escape arrest,"" the police statement said. Officers took him into custody after a short chase and discovered after taking him to jail that he may have broken his foot, police said. Doctors were evaluating him. Lohan is not expected to be released from Tampa General Hospital Thursday and has been admitted for overnight observation, said Tampa police spokeswoman Andrea Davis. Police responded to a domestic violence call at Michael Lohan's home Monday and arrested him for the battery of his live-in girlfriend, police said. Lohan told reporters Wednesday he ""didn't lay a hand"" on his girlfriend. ""I did not hurt her,"" he said. Lohan also said he never was served with a restraining order to stay away from the woman. According to CNN Tampa affiliate WFTS, a Sarasota County judge issued a temporary restraining order Tuesday. Lohan, 51, was arrested in Los Angeles in March in connection with alleged domestic violence and was charged with one misdemeanor count of corporal injury to a cohabitant. The relationship between Lohan and his daughter has been publicly strained for years, although the two did undergo family counseling together during her treatment at the Betty Ford Center. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: Lohan has been admitted for overnight hospital observation, police said .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, who has enjoyed Apple's products along with millions of other Americans, Wednesday night hailed Steve Jobs as one of America's greatest innovators, a man ""brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it."" ""The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented,"" the president said in a statement. Praising Jobs' breadth and the impact of his work from personal computers to iPhones to movie production, the president added, ""Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: He changed the way each of us sees the world."" This week, Obama, known for his affection for the BlackBerry, revealed he actually was a recipient of an advanced copy of the iPad 2 directly from Jobs. ""Steve Jobs actually gave it to me, a little bit early,"" he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. ""Yeah, it was cool. I got it directly from him."" In March, CNN photographed the president holding an iPad. The president and Jobs met several times, including at a dinner in San Francisco in February with Silicon Valley executives and last year when they discussed issues revolving around technology and the economy. Many politicians also praised Jobs as the truest example of the American dream, an icon. House Speaker Rep. John Boehner, who also uses an iPad, tweeted: ""Steve Jobs changed the world for the better w/his innovations and genius."" House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, tweeted, ""There is not a day that goes by, and often not an hour, that a Steve Jobs invention does not better my family's life. Thank you Steve."" Fellow Californian Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, called Jobs ""a visionary who changed the way we live, an innovator whose products brought joy to millions, a risk-taker who wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo,"" and also said in a statement, ""His sage advice was respected by policymakers on both sides of the aisle. His courageous fight against cancer brought strength to many."" CNN Congressional Producer Deirdre Walsh contributed to this story.","Obama on Jobs: ""He changed the way each of us sees the world""

"(CNN) -- Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described Moammar Gadhafi's crush on her as ""weird and a bit creepy,"" saying she breathed a sigh of relief when she realized a video he made of her was not raunchy. In her new book, ""No Higher Honor: A Memoir of My Years in Washington,"" Rice said the ruler once played her a video montage of herself set to a tune called ""African Flower in the White House."" A Libyan composer wrote the song, she said. Earlier this year, anti-Gadhafi fighters ransacking his compound in Tripoli found an album of photos of the former top Bush administration official. ""Quite extraordinary, weird and a bit creepy, "" Rice told CNN's Piers Morgan on Wednesday night about the scrapbook. ""I had actually known that he had this fixation on me."" Rice said when Gadhafi showed her the video montage years ago in Libya, she tried to keep the conversation on business. ""My job was to go there and do diplomatic business and get out, so that's what I did,"" she said. ""But I have to say I did have that terrible moment when he said that he had the video. I am just glad that it all came out all right."" Gadhafi was captured and killed in October, ending a Libyan revolution that started in February against his regime. Rice also weighed in on GOP presidential contender Herman Cain's claims that racism is behind the recent surfacing of old sexual harassment allegations against him. ""I actually don't like playing the race card on either side,"" Rice said. ""I don't like it when people say that the criticism of President (Barack) Obama is because he is black. The criticism is because he is the president, and we tend to criticize our presidents."" Rice said Cain is ""an interesting person. He has an interesting background.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's judicial system faced an uproar this week after one of the country's highest courts upheld a decision to reduce sentences against 26 men convicted of having sex with a 13-year old girl. Public outrage stemmed from a court ruling that the 13-year old girl had willingly engaged in ""consensual"" sexual relations with the 26 men. Among the growing chorus of critics was Turkey's President Abdullah Gul. ""I take particular care not to make any direct statements on issues that are in the judicial process,"" Gul wrote in a series of statements on his Twitter account on Friday. ""[But] the decision about reducing the punishment related with what happened to a young child of ours made me deeply uncomfortable... there is still the possibility for an appeal. I am hoping for an outcome that will comfort the public conscience."" The case in question dates back to 2002, when 26 men from the southeastern Turkish town of Mardin were accused of repeatedly having sex with a 13-year old girl identified only by the initials ""N.C."" According to Turkish media reports, the men, who included village 'muhtars' [mayors] and a gendarme officer, were accused of paying money to two adult female intermediaries during a 7-month period for repeated access to the girl. Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals has now found itself under fire from women's rights groups, lawyers' associations, and senior government officials. In response, the head of the Supreme Court's 14th Criminal Office adopted a somewhat contradictory position. ""The evaluations of the court were correct. We made a decision. This decision is not definite, it is also not possible for this decision to be changed by making noise,"" said Fevzi Elmas of the Supreme Court of Appeals, in an interview with the semi-official Anatolian Agency on Friday. The courts sentenced the 26 accused rapists' according to an earlier version of the country's penal code, which underwent significant revisions in 2005. The older penal code entailed lesser punishments for defendants found guilty of sexually assaulting children. ""In the old penal code there was a very clear article which said it didn't matter if you were under 15 [years of age] or over 15... if any rape or sexual assault happened with the consent of the girl or the woman, then the sentence would be reduced,"" said Pinar Ilkkaracan of the group Women for Women's Human Rights, who lobbied for the 2005 revision of the Turkish criminal code. ""In the new Turkish penal code there is no question of consent, that is incredibly important for us,"" Ilkkaracan added. ""In terms of girls and boys under 15 it says very clearly any violation of the body for sexual purposes is defined as sexual abuse in the new code. Which means that sexual assault or the violation of the body should have a higher sentence."" According to Turkish media reports, some of the 26 defendants were acquitted, while others received jail sentences of one to four years. ""This decision is an outright scandal,"" said Ilkkaracan, the women's rights advocate. In his statement to Anatolian Agency, Elmas, the official from the Supreme Court of Appeals, argued that the court had no choice but to sentence the defendants according to the pre-2005 version of the penal code. ""We don't have any other option,"" Elmas said. ""This is an undebatable rule of law."" But that decision was challenged by the Union of Turkish Bar Associations on Friday, which called the ruling ""legally inappropriate."" Meanwhile, in a written statement released on her ministry's web-site, Family and Social Policies Minister Fatma Sahin argued the ruling violated not only the current criminal code, but also the older version which had been in force in 2002 at the time when the 26 men were accused of having sex with the 13 year old. ""I find the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals 14th Criminal Office to approve the verdict of the local court that a 13-year old child 'got together with the defendants of her own free will' unacceptable and worrying,"" Sahin wrote. ""I would like to remind the judiciary that its primary task is to protect the victim and the rights of the one who was sexually abused,"" she added.","Sentences for 26 men convicted of having sex with a 13-year-old were reduced .

"(CNN) -- Violence in the United States is not related to illegal Mexican immigrants, but violence in Mexico is connected to vast shipments of weapons from the United States, Mexico's foreign minister told CNN Thursday. Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa pointed to efforts by Mexico to stop the flow of weapons, the great majority of which come from the United States. ""Since 2006,"" she said in a wide-ranging interview with CNN's editorial board in New York City, ""the Mexican government has seized over 85,000 weapons in Mexico."" She noted that it's not just ""regular weapons,"" but also machine guns, grenades and other high-power arms. Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s, pointed out last year there were at least 6,600 U.S. gun shops within 100 miles of the Mexican border and more than 90 percent of weapons in Mexico come from the United States. In contrast, Espinosa said, there's no evidence linking high crime rates with illegal immigration, as some U.S. politicians have contended. The two largest Latino populations in the United States are in the New York City and Los Angeles areas, she said, but both locales have seen a ""dramatic drop in the crime rate."" Government and police statistics show that the crime rate has been decreasing in New York for the past 15 years. Similarly, statistics show that rate for most major crimes in Los Angeles also has fallen in recent years. ""This clearly shows that linking immigration directly with violence is not connected,"" Espinosa said. Others make the case, however, that illegal immigration and high crime are strongly linked. Supporters of SB 107, the controversial Arizona immigration law, parts of which were struck down in federal court in July, used that argument to pass the bill this year. ""Border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state,"" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said earlier this year. ""There is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of Arizona. We cannot sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels. We cannot stand idly by as drop houses, kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life."" But statistics from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and the FBI indicate that both the number of illegal crossers and violent crime have decreased recently. According to the FBI, violent crimes reported in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 incidents between 2005 and 2008. Reported property crimes also fell, from about 287,000 incidents to 279,000 in the same period. These decreases are accentuated by the fact that Arizona's population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008. According to the non-partisan Immigration Policy Institute, proponents of the bill ""overlook two salient points: crime rates have already been falling in Arizona for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants, and a century's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native-born."" Espinosa also addressed comments by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this month comparing Mexico's drug war to an ""insurgency"" similar to the problem Colombia faced more than 20 years ago. ""[W]e face an increasing threat from a well-organized network, [a] drug-trafficking threat that is, in some cases, morphing into or making common cause with what we would consider an insurgency, in Mexico and in Central America,"" Clinton said at a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's looking more and more like Colombia looked 20 years ago."" Mexican officials, from President Felipe Calderon on down, took exception to that characterization. Espinosa reiterated the point Thursday. ""The realities are very different,"" she said. Colombia, she said, was fighting drug-producing and drug-trafficking organizations that also were working with an entrenched Marxist guerrilla movement. ""In Mexico,"" she said, ""the situation is very different. In Mexico, we are dealing with very powerful and strong transnational criminal organizations."" Espinosa also addressed the issue of drug cartels spreading south to Central American nations, which seems to have become a bigger problem in recent years. ""The world is becoming smaller every day,"" she said, adding that ""transnational organized crime does not recognize any borders."" And while the problem is not particularly new, she said, ""What has changed is the power of these transnational crime organizations."" Espinosa said some governments in Central America have gotten weaker or don't have the technological capabilities to fight crime, and the drug cartels have taken advantage. ""They have found a place to develop their activities,"" she said. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Crime rates have decreased in Latino areas of the U.S., says Mexico's foreign minister .

"New York (CNN) -- Nine Septembers have come and gone and yet, the many days that separate America now from a chilling day in its history did not dull remembrance Saturday. Once again, the nation paused in silence to mark the times when hijacked jets crashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and nearly 3,000 lives were lost in a matter of minutes. But this year, a national debate over a proposed Islamic center near ground zero hovered over the day's heart-stopping sorrow, and the president once again pleaded for the tolerance that has come to define America. Rallies in favor of and against the center were held later in the day. At Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, adjacent to the September 11 memorial site, thousands gathered, wanting to be as close as they could to hallowed ground. As has become customary, the names of the 2,752 who perished at the World Trade Center were read out aloud -- each belonging to a mother or father, son or daughter, husband or wife, a friend, or even a stranger. ""We have returned to this sacred site to join our hearts together with the names of those we loved and lost,"" said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg at the start of the ceremony. ""No other public tragedy has cut our city so deeply,"" he said. ""No other place is as filled with our compassion, our love, and our solidarity."" Silence befell New York at 8:46 a.m., the time when the first plane struck the North Tower. Another moment of quiet followed a few minutes later, at 9:03 a.m., when a second jet pierced through the South Tower. Shortly after the second moment of silence, Vice President Joe Biden read a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. ""Build today, then strong and sure with a firm and ample base; and ascending and secure shall tomorrow find its place. "" With each toll of the bell, an emotional chord struck hearts. Family members stepped forward to talk about those who were lost. And with each word, hot tears rolled down cheeks. A woman remembered her mother, Larissa Ceylon Taylor. ""Although I was 11 years old when you passed, you were my best friend and the greatest mom. We all love you and we miss you. God bless you, Mom. I love you."" Another spoke of her sister, Deborah Ann Dimartino. ""We will hold you close to our hearts."" And a brother, Christopher Epps, who was a Star Wars fan. ""Christopher, so handsome and, oh, so fine. With a heart of gold, why, oh why did you have to leave us behind? And I said to myself, I know why. God was looking for a captain of a ship, someone who qualifies as a jedi. So go on, dear brother, don't be shy. Your ship awaits you with 2,000 and more to stand by your side, to travel with you on your journey into the sky. May the force be with you, Christopher Epps. We love you and you are embedded in our hearts forever."" In his weekly address, President Barack Obama highlighted the scope of America's loss. ""We think about the milestones that have passed over the course of nine years -- births and christenings, weddings and graduations -- all with an empty chair,"" he said. ""On this day, we also honor those who died so that others might live: the firefighters and first responders who climbed the stairs of two burning towers; the passengers who stormed a cockpit; and the men and women who have, in the years since, borne the uniform of this country and given their lives so that our children could grow up in a safer world,"" Obama said. Later, Obama laid a wreath at the Pentagon, where American Airlines Flight 77 struck and killed 184 people, and sounded again a message of tolerance, keenly aware that this anniversary was cast under a different light. Beyond the outpouring of grief on this day lay rising anti-Muslim sentiment and furious controversy over a proposed Islamic center two blocks away from where the World Trade Center once soared. It's an issue that has even split the families and survivors of the 2001 attacks. New York police beefed up security as Americans voiced their opinions Saturday afternoon at rallies over the site. Speakers in favor of the location reminded the nation that Muslims, too, were among the victims of the September 11 attacks and that anti-Islamic sentiment in America is the result of misguided wrath. ""Unity yes, racism no,"" the demonstrators chanted. Shortly afterward, opponents held their own gathering, chanting ""No Mosque"" and ""USA"" as speakers decried the plans and said the nation shouldn't forget the terrorist attack on September 11. Attorney General Eric Holder vowed the Justice Department would continue ""working tirelessly to combat terrorism in all its forms and to hold accountable all those responsible for the September 11 attacks in a manner that is consistent with our nation's values."" Holder spoke Saturday at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington. He paid tribute to the 72 law enforcement officers killed that day. ""This work goes on, and it will always remain my highest priority,"" Holder said. ""Let us take their dream of a world that is better, safer and more just and make it our own."" Obama reiterated that America is not at war with Islam but with al Qaeda's ""sorry band of men which perverts religion."" ""They may wish to drive us apart but we will not give in to their hatred and prejudice,"" he said. ""The perpetrators of this evil act didn't simply attack America, they attacked the very idea of America itself. ""And so the highest honor we can pay those we lost, indeed our greatest weapon in this ongoing war, is to do what our adversaries fear the most -- to stay true to who we are as Americans, to renew our sense of common purpose, to say that we define the character of our country and we will not let the acts of some small band of murderers who slaughter the innocent and cower in caves distort who we are,"" he said. Fueling further controversy, a Florida pastor had threatened to burn a Quran on this fateful day. But just before the ceremonies began, the Rev. Terry Jones said he was canceling the Quran burning planned for 6 p.m. ""We will definitely not burn the Quran,"" Rev. Terry Jones told NBC's ""Today"" on Saturday. ""Not today, not ever."" In Shanksville, first lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush led the commemoration for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the U.S. Capitol. ""I come here as an American, filled with a sense of awe at the heroism of my fellow citizens,"" Michelle Obama said. ""I come as a wife, a daughter, and a sister, heartbroken at the loss so many of you have endured."" Laura Bush said the hijackers of United Flight 93 had other targets in mind, but the crash spot near Shanksville ""was chosen by the passengers, who spared our country from even greater horrors."" Before his wife's comments, George W. Bush issued a statement recalling the day that came to shape his presidency. ""On September 11, 2001, Americans awoke to evil on our shores,"" he said. ""We recall the many acts of heroism on that day, and we honor those who work tirelessly to prevent another attack."" In New York, the ninth September 11 anniversary was also different in another way: for the first time people gathered amid signs of rebirth rising from the ashes. Next year, on this day, a new memorial is expected to open and on Saturday, the families of those who died were able to see some tangible progress of the structures that are being erected to honor their loved ones. The planned memorial includes six skyscrapers, a museum, two waterfalls in the footprints of the twin towers, a performance center and a rail terminal. The first 16 oak trees of more than 400 that will line the memorial have already been planted. They will surround the acre-size waterfalls around which will be the names of the dead, etched in bronze. Earlier this week, workers installed two 50-ton steel columns that once ringed the north tower at what will be the entrance to the memorial and museum. And there is a reflecting pool, around which police, firefighters and dignitaries gathered, and later throngs of people stopped to toss a solitary long-stemmed rose. By the time the ceremonies came to a close Saturday, it had turned into to a plush blanket of bloom.

"(CNN) -- While the coastal town of Savannah, Georgia, fills with spectators on Saturday for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon, Chris Fenton and Laura Devrieze will be focused on the finish line. For Fenton, crossing that line means completing his 10th marathon in six months. For Devrieze, it means finishing her first. For both, it's about running 26.2 miles for a parent with cancer. Fenton and Devrieze are a part of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Team in Training program. As the world's largest endurance sports training program, Team in Training has raised $1.2 billion for blood cancer research. The program started 23 years ago when Bruce Cleland formed a group to run the New York City Marathon in honor of his daughter, a leukemia survivor. Approximately 45,000 runners are signed up this year for the New York marathon, which takes place on November 6. Many are associated with one of the 200 registered charities; in 2010 the race raised more than $30 million for different causes. Train with Sanjay: 2012 Fit Nation Triathlon Challenge . Leukemia & Lymphoma Society communications manager Kristin Hoose says having a cause helps athletes focus on a goal, and having an athlete to support helps donors open their wallets. ""When people share their personal stories, and those of their heroes ... people see that their $10 can make a big difference."" A mother's strength . Chris Fenton was on a business trip in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, when he got a message from the secretary. His sister had called from Manhattan. Fenton looked at his watch and realized it was close to midnight in the States. Something was wrong. ""You hear those words for the first time: 'Mom has cancer.' You just kind of drop the phone and go into shock and say 'Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god,'"" he said. His mom, Barbara, is the matriarch of the Fenton family. As the second oldest of 14 children and a mother of six, Barbara received an outpouring of love after her non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis. She had always taken care of everyone else, now they would take care of her. Treatment was hard. Barbara endured four courses of chemo and four of radiation therapy. In October 2001, she went into remission. Fenton's left Achilles tendon is screaming at him as he talks about his mom -- now the picture of health at 78 -- from home in Kohler, Wisconsin. ""She's settling in, loves to be a grandmother and spoil the grandkids, and (is) just kind of enjoying the golden years,"" he says with a laugh. A long-time runner, Fenton started his journey to honor his mom in May. He's running 10 marathons (to celebrate her 10th anniversary of going into remission) in six months -- the time it took from diagnosis to remission. Since May, he has logged more than 200 official miles. Saturday marks his final race. ""I'm still a middle-of-the-pack plodder,"" he says, ""but I'm able to find my way around a marathon course."" He has raised close to $100,000 over the last 10 years and hopes to continue supporting blood cancer research with Team in Training. ""My mom's story had a positive outcome. There are a lot of people who don't."" A father's joy . People loved Harry Devrieze. With thinning dark hair and bright blue eyes, he had a smile that lit up a room. Friends and family were his priority and he never hesitated to lend a helping hand. The owner of a construction business, he often came by his daughter Laura's house in Carrollton, Georgia, to make repairs. It was from him that she learned plumbing, drywall and her way around the Home Depot store. ""He loved doing that -- he loved fixing things, he loved gardening, he loved working around the house."" Two years ago, Harry developed a rare, aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After chemotherapy, he was giving a clean bill of health, but the cancer returned and was discovered in January. The Devrieze family was almost surprised by the intensity of the disease the second time around. The toll it took on Harry's body was more menacing. ""This was a full attack on his bones, his lungs, his muscles,"" Devrieze remembers. It was during this time that she went to her first Team in Training meeting and signed up for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon. Running gave her time to clear her mind and be by herself. Her dad supported Devrieze's decision to race and to raise money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. ""It was always important for him for me to be involved and kind of have a cause,"" Devrieze says. ""He's the reason I was doing it, but he didn't want to be the reason I was doing it."" While she ran 5 miles, then 10, then 15, her dad started preparing for a stem cell transplant. He spent the month of May at Emory University Hospital. On Saturdays, Devrieze joined Team in Training in Atlanta for a run and then went to visit him. Harry was released from the hospital in late June after the transplant didn't take. He passed away on August 16, 2011 at age 70. For a couple of weeks, Devrieze refused to run, clutching to the friends and family Harry had held so close. Then she picked up her shoes and moved with the pain. For Devrieze, Saturday will be yet another reminder of her loss. Her dad won't be there to watch her cross the finish line. That's why she's all the more determined to do exactly that. ""He was very proud and very excited. This is the longest I've ever run. It's mind over body, and having a greater purpose ... makes the mind part work better.""","The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's team raises money for blood cancer research .

"(CNN) -- The growth of the Hispanic population in the United States is outstripping pre-census estimates, the Pew Hispanic Center report released Tuesday says. ""The number of Hispanics counted in the 2010 Census has been larger than expected in most states for which the Census Bureau has released detailed population totals so far,"" the report says. The Census Bureau has released its tally of Hispanics in 33 states. ""Those states' combined Census 2010 total of 38.7 million Hispanics was higher by 590,000 people,"" the report says. Data on the remaining states will be released by the end of March. Last month, a Pew Hispanic Center report said a two-year decline in the unauthorized immigrant population in the United States had leveled off. A rebounding economy may be a counteracting force, one of the study's authors, Jeffrey S. Passel, said. ""What we've seen historically is that when employment opportunities have increased, we've seen increased flows"" to the United States, he said. The economy in 2009 was better than in 2008, and indications are that the numbers will be even better for 2010, hinting that illegal immigration numbers could potentially creep back up, he said.","The number of Hispanics is 'larger than expected' in most states .

"QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Motorcycle accidents have killed more Marines in the past 12 months than enemy fire in Iraq, a rate that's so alarming, it has prompted top brass to call a meeting to address the issue, officials say. Despite crashes, Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker rides a sport motorcycle. ""I enjoy it. ... It relaxes me,"" he says. Twenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. In that same period, 20 Marines have been killed in action in Iraq. The 25 deaths are the highest motorcycle death toll ever for the Marine Corps. Gen. James Amos, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, told CNN that commanders are trying to drill down on what ""we need to do to help our Marines survive on these sport bikes."" ""The Marines are very serious about it,"" he said.  Watch these aren't your father's Harleys » . Marine Gunnery Sgt. Art Tucker knows all too well about the dangers of sport bikes. An owner of a Kawasaki Ninja, Tucker has had two crashes, and the second one nearly killed him. ""I sustained a broken collar bone; I tore the shoulder out of the socket; I tore three ligaments in the shoulder, the rotator cuff; I broke three vertebrae,"" said Tucker, a drill instructor for new officers. ""The worst was a head injury I received: a bruised brain. And it caused hemorrhaging, and from that I had partial paralysis of the left leg, full paralysis of the left foot and toes, and that was for approximately six months."" Amos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday ""focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues."" The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, and other senior leadership will attend the meeting at the Quantico, Virginia, Marine base, he said. About 18,000 of the nearly 200,000 Marines are believed to own motorcycles, Amos said. The Marines have taken some measures. The Marine Corps has had a long-standing policy for all Marines who ride motorcycles to take a mandatory basic riding course. More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes. Any Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say. On a recent day at the Quantico training track, Marines whizzed by on their bikes. ""I think the basic rider course has been great,"" said Cpl. Austin Oakley. ""Here, they put you in situations you want to be wary of out in that open road."" Oakley said he recently returned to the United States from Japan, and he immediately jumped at the chance to buy a sport bike. He said it's not uncommon for Marines to have motorcycle clubs within their units. ""We'll go out on rides together. Fridays for lunchtime, we'll all meet up and go to lunch,"" Oakley said. ""When I get on my motorcycle, it's me and the motorcycle. I don't need to go fast. I don't need to do anything like that. It's just being free."" The rise in motorcycle deaths isn't confined to Marines. The Navy says it's had 33 deaths on motorcycles over the past 12 months, a 65 percent jump from the previous time period. And authorities say motorcycle deaths have been a problem in the civilian world, too. Military officials say they're not sure why the deaths are on the rise. They initially believed that the accidents might involve mostly young Marines and sailors about 18 or 19 years old. But Navy statistics show that five of the victims were 25, the most prevalent of any age involved in the crashes. And two 40-year-old sailors were killed in motorcycle crashes. Amos said the Marines have seen a similar trend. But he says the new training seems to be working: Of the 300 young men and women who have gone through the sport-bike course, only three have had accidents. The safety course instructors said some Marines who go through the training decide the sport bike is not for them. But even some Marines who've survived past crashes still want to ride again, even after they get the new training. ""I enjoy it,"" said Tucker. ""I can actually get on my motorcycle and ride, and it's just like if I were to do bowling or rock climbing or scuba diving. It's something for me. It relaxes me.""","25 Marines killed on motorcycles in past 12 months, compared with 20 killed in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Four days of heavy rains triggered a landslide that killed 12 children and eight adults near Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania, authorities said Friday. Five of the children were under six, said Suzan Kaganda, a police department spokeswoman. The death toll could go up as rescue crews search the area for people reported missing, Kaganda said. Most victims of the late Tuesday landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name, Kaganda said. The mountain is the highest peak in Africa and is a major tourist attraction. U.N. officials warned last month that east Africa is facing mudslides, crop destruction and waterborne diseases as a result of heavy downpour triggered by El Nino weather patterns. Most east African countries have been water-starved in the past few years, exacerbating the results of floods, because a lot of greenery disappeared in the drought.","Most victims of the landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name .

"(CNN) -- Bruno Senna has signed for Formula One constructor Williams 18 years after his uncle, former three-time world champion Ayrton, died driving for the team. The Brazilian will partner Pastor Maldonado when the 2012 F1 season gets underway in Australia on March 18, replacing veteran compatriot Rubens Barrichello. Bruno's uncle Ayrton is one of the greatest drivers the sport has seen, winning drivers' championship crowns in 1988, 1990 and 1991 before he died in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. It was only his third race for Williams. Williams' cars have carried his name ever since the tragedy at the Imola racing circuit, and Bruno, who made his debut for HRT in 2010, says he is excited to follow in his uncle's footsteps. Ferrari's Alonso slams F1 testing rules . ""It will be very interesting to drive for a team that my uncle has driven for, particularly as quite a few of the people here actually worked with Ayrton,"" the 28-year-old told Williams' website. ""Hopefully we can bring back some memories and create some great new ones too. I also want to get some good results in return for the support my country has given me to help get me to this position today. ""I am very proud to be Brazilian and more motivated than ever to demonstrate what I can do. Ever since I first sat in a go-kart I never wanted to do anything else."" Team principal Frank Williams, who was in charge of Williams when Ayrton Senna died, said he was looking forward to seeing Bruno compete at the highest level. The driver struggled with HRT in the team's debut season, then moved to Renault as a reserve driver before replacing Nick Heidfeld for the final eight races of 2011, but scored points in just one of his eight races as he finished ninth at the Italian Grand Prix. ""The circumstances of Bruno's two seasons in Formula One have not given him an ideal opportunity to deliver consistently so it was essential that we spent as much time with him as possible to understand and evaluate him as a driver,"" he said. ""We have done this both on track and in our simulator and he has proven quick, technically insightful and above all capable of learning and applying his learning quickly and consistently. Now we are looking forward to seeing that talent in our race car."" Senna's deal with Williams could spell the end of Barrichello's Formula One career as the 39-year-old is now without a team with the new season two months away. He said on his official Twitter account: ""I won't be driving the Williams car this year. I wish my friend @BSenna all the best..the future is wide open.""

"Paris (CNN) -- Flamboyant fashion designer John Galliano went on trial Wednesday, accused of making anti-Semitic comments against at least three people in a Paris cafe. Galliano, who was fired by fashion giant Christian Dior in March after video surfaced showing him praising Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, testified Wednesday that drugs were to blame. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud read out a list of the abuse Galliano is accused of hurling at Geraldine Bloch and Philippe Virgitti, including obscenities mixed with remarks about their ethnic backgrounds. ""He said 'dirty whore' at least a thousand times,"" the judge said. Galliano said on the witness stand that he had no memory of making the comments. Asked to explain his ""lack of memory,"" he said: ""I have an addiction. I am currently undergoing treatment."" Galliano's attorney said before the trial began the designer ""was a sick person, who was suffering from addiction and this is something we are demonstrating through medical evidence, expert reports."" ""We must not judge a man who for 30 years has been dedicated to diversity, who has been a loving person for all races, cultures and religions ... based on 40 minutes where he was sick through alcohol and medication,"" Aurelien Hamelle said. Galliano testified that he suffered from an increasing workload and no time to mourn after the 2007 death of his alter ego at Dior, designer Steven Robinson. ""With his death, I found I had no protection,"" Galliano said. His body became dependent on drugs, he said. ""I was taking sleeping pills during the day,"" he testified.   ""I've only just discovered since rehab what a lethal mix I was taking."" Bloch testified Wednesday that she encountered Galliano on a crowded cafe terrace, which led to an angry exchange. ""I don't remember his exact wording; there were different phrases,"" Bloch told the court.  ""It's true that I was angry. I insulted him, too."" Virgitti testified the confrontation, which he called ""just an argument in a bar,"" began when Galliano sat down next to his party at the cafe. ""He started speaking to us very quickly after arriving,"" Virgitti said. ""He told Geraldine to speak less as she was disturbing him. We didn't know what to do. The situation got worse. He started touching her hair, saying she had no hair.  I told him, 'Don't touch her.' "" He acknowledged during his testimony that while Galliano ""said things he shouldn't have,"" the incident ""has been so overly played out in the media."" Galliano faces a six-month jail term and a fine of 22,500 euros ($32,410) if he is convicted, according to prosecutors. A verdict in the case did not come Wednesday. Galliano will be judged in one trial over two separate incidents, one in October and one in February. After the second incident, Galliano was taken to a police station where a test revealed he had a high level of alcohol in his blood, authorities said at the time. He was later released. The video is from yet another incident. He is not being tried for the incident because the couple involved chose not to press charges. ""I love Hitler,"" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. ""Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead."" Christian Dior condemned his ""deeply offensive statements and conduct."" French law prohibits the incitement of racial discrimination, hatred or violence based on a person's origin or their membership -- or nonmembership -- in an ethic, national, racial or religious group. Galliano apologized after the video was released. ""I only have myself to blame and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion,"" Galliano said in a statement. ""Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society."" Galliano has kept a low profile since his firing, but Vanessa Friedman, fashion editor of the Financial Times newspaper, said that given time, he could return to the industry. His career is over in its present form, she said. But he could return to Britain, where there is ""residual love for him,"" lay low and make a comeback in a few years, she said. ""People love a redemption story,"" Friedman said.

"Prague, Czech Republic (CNN) -- Presidents and princes paid their final respects Friday to Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president, writer and dissident who helped bring down his country's Communist regime and end the Cold War. Dignitaries inside Prague Castle's towering St. Vitus Cathedal included former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while thousands of admirers stood outside in cold temperatures to watch the funeral on big screens. Havel, a shy but iron-willed intellectual endowed with a playful sense of humor and a powerful moral compass, died Sunday at the age of 75. Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in Prague, praised a man she said was pleased to have had as a friend. ""Few were as Czech as Vaclav Havel, but his wit and kindness, his wisdom and the depth of his thoughts spoke to all,"" she said, addressing mourners in Czech during the funeral. His former political advisor Jiri Pehe called Havel ""a politician who wasn't a politician, catapulted into politics by history. Throughout his presidency he was a dissident politician who liked to do things in a different way."" Speaking before the funeral, Pehe said he would remember Havel more for his personality than his politics, recalling his ""booming laugh"" and saying: ""to work with him was a joy ... To be around him was simply inspiring."" Dissident friends of Havel arrived grim-faced for the funeral Friday. Many hugged each other before going into St. Vitus Cathedral. Havel's picture stood to the side of the altar draped in black ribbon in a state funeral both grand and religious, an irony given his personal modesty and the fact that the Czech Republic is among the least religious countries in Europe. Former dissident and Havel friend Petr Uhl refused to come to the funeral, saying Havel was not a Christian and none of his predecessors had had a state funeral of this kind. Havel was ""a great figure of our modern history. ... A man whom we will remember with thanks and respect has gone,"" Czech President Vaclav Klaus told mourners, who also included French President Nicolas Sarkozy, British Prime Minister David Cameron and his predecessor John Major, and singer Suzanne Vega. Havel's widow Dagmar sat next to Klaus in the front row, a few seats down from Ivan Havel, the late writer's closest living blood relative. Members of the public fought back tears as the Czech song ""My Country"" swelled at the end of the funeral over a gun salute. Then they burst into applause -- as did some inside the cathedral -- as six soldiers shouldered Havel's coffin and carried it out to a waiting hearse. Prague Castle did not announce where or when Havel would be buried, saying it was up to his family. Authorities estimated that 30,000 people lined up to bid farewell to Havel when his body lay in state on Wednesday and Thursday. They waited for hours in freezing weather in the early winter night before the funeral to pay their last respects, holding flowers, candles and notes to lay by his coffin. Many of the messages, from those handwritten by schoolchildren to those printed off computers, bore the same words: ""Thank you, Mr. President."" Alena Sturmova, who came with her husband and son, remembers being at Prague Castle when Havel was elected the first post-Communist president of her country, almost 22 years ago to the day. Seeing him there on a balcony, instead of the Soviet-backed authorities who had governed her country her entire life, meant something special to her, she said: ""Maybe the possibility of freedom."" Her husband, Daniel, called Havel ""a symbol of the Velvet Revolution,"" when Czechs and Slovaks overthrew an ossified regime by pouring into Prague's Wenceslas Square and jingling their key rings as a signal to their leaders to go home. Havel was a symbol of that revolution, Daniel Sturm said by way of explaining why he and his family were waiting to lay flowers by Havel's coffin. ""We just wanted to come here and tell him thank you,"" he said, before pausing and continuing: ""... for the last time."" Havel, a chain-smoking, rock-loving intellectual, became one of the world's most famous dissidents in the 1970s for his public writings against Eastern Europe's Communist regimes. He was jailed for about four and a half years over essays such as ""The Power of the Powerless,"" which urged people to simply stop pretending to believe the lies their government fed them and act on what they knew to be true. ""Truth and love must triumph over lies and hatred,"" Havel insisted. With the Soviet Union saying it would no longer intervene in the affairs of its satellites, and Communist regimes crumbling in Poland and East Germany in 1989, Czechs and Slovaks rose up in answer to the call of Havel and other dissidents around him. In a matter of days, the authorities resigned and a parliament stuffed full of Communist party functionaries elected Havel president of Czechoslovakia. He served as head of state until politicians decided to divide the country in two in 1992, then went on to be elected president of the Czech Republic twice. His country joined NATO and the European Union under his stewardship, but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency, including his effort to keep Czechoslovakia together.","World leaders attend the funeral of Vaclav Havel, who helped end communism in Czechoslovakia .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO forces caught fire Saturday after gunmen attacked in Pakistan's western Baluchistan province, local police said. Unknown assailants attacked 28 vehicles with a machine gun and rockets, said Meeran Bukhsh, a police official in the Bolan district. Two people were injured, police said. The attack is the latest in a series of strikes against vehicles in Pakistan carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers. At least six attacks have been carried out since October 1, leaving at least seven people dead. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for several of the attacks, including one on Wednesday that damaged 54 oil tankers. Ihsan Ullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said Wednesday's attack was carried out by a special squad created especially to attack American assets in Pakistan as a response to the increase in suspected U.S. drone strikes.

"BILOXI, Mississippi (CNN)  -- It's been almost three years since Hurricane Katrina cut a merciless path of destruction across the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing more than 1,800 people and displacing tens of thousands more. Cameron Sinclair on site in Biloxi, Mississippi -- one of many rebuilding projects that Architecture for Humanity is overseeing. The coastal resort of Biloxi was among the hardest hit; hurricane-force winds leveled homes, stripped branches from trees and created a trail of devastation that rendered the popular Casino town virtually uninhabitable. Three years on, homes are still being rebuilt to house people who were forced to seek shelter wherever they could. For some, that's meant spending years living in cramped conditions in caravans until they could afford to rebuild. Cameron Sinclair, Co-founder of Architecture for Humanity, is leading a project to rehouse residents of Biloxi affected by the storm. On July 9, he'll be taking part in a Principal Voices debate on Design for Good: How can clever design conserve precious resources and lead to a greener way of life? CNN caught up with Cameron Sinclair in Biloxi and started by asking him what the difference is between design and design for good? Cameron Sinclair: Design is about creating spaces for people to enjoy and of course, creating moments where you elevate the spirit, but design for good is figuring out a program that not only creates better spaces, but creates jobs, creates new industry and really kind of raises the conversation about how we rebuild. CNN: How many countries are you working in and what are you doing? CS: We are currently in about 26 countries and we have around about 4000 volunteer architects and designers globally. We are working on a whole range of projects whether it be bringing health services into remote Nepal or working on a chocolate factory in the Amazon which is actually a conservation project, or doing low income housing in Cape town, South Africa, so we're pretty global in our reach. CNN: You have worked all over the world, Iran, Africa, and Asia. When you think of people's living conditions, are you surprised that Americans don't realize how tough people have it in their own country? Have you seen things in the U.S., for example, that are worse than in so-called developing countries? CS: Yeah, I mean people find it kind of shocking when I talk about this. You know, there are places in rural America, especially in places like the reservations, we've done a lot of work with Hopi and Navajo and we're about to start work with the Iroquois where I look at the housing stock and it is far worse then I've seen in somewhere like South Africa or you know, in Ghana. You know, Americans are unbelievably open, welcoming and helpful, they donate to everybody. But quite often we don't look at the reality of our own lives. The fact that we have a crumbling school system, that our healthcare in this country is just diabolical, the support for nurses and teachers is just out of control and I look at all these facilities that are happening in the U.S. and I begin to question. This is supposed to be the most powerful place in the world but we can't build a decent school for our kids so you know there is a reality check that needs to happen. CNN: When you look at the big picture of the problems the world is facing, what solutions can you see that cities and their designs can offer when it comes to global issues such as global warming? CS: What worries me the most is you have all these global issues that are out there, whether its lack of education or lack of healthcare or climate change, and people think they are separate compartmentalized issues, but they're all interweaved so that when we're working on structures, we're thinking about how can we make the building energy efficient. How can we make the design open, allowing access to everybody so that you're hitting on all these things. We're working in neighborhoods where sustainability is a matter of life or death for people so climate change is an issue for us, but we may not be putting solar panels on the side of the building we just may be looking at creating a way of getting clean water into the village and that mechanism is important. CNN: How vital is sustainability? CS: It's very vital. I mean, we've never pushed ourselves as a green organization. We've never done that kind of branding, you know, of great green buildings but all our architects and all our designers in the field realize that they have to have an element of sustainability because communities can't maintain things they can't afford and if its not sustainable both materialistic and also financially then the building will be underutilized so it's a waste of everybody's time. If you build something that is out of the reach of the community, then they can't own it. There's no empowerment in taking over that structure. CNN: How do you see your role in all of this? CS: The main thing is, I'm not the architect on this. We have architecture firms in a 100 countries right now, who are working on projects and as a way, we're working as a bridge, so architecture humanity bridges that kind of leg between the community, the design and the funding, so we have to bring in all the funding. We have to make sure that we have the legal and financial constraints in place and understood that the designers are committed to the process so in a way we're acting as that mediator between all those different stake holders. CNN: I'm curious how on a personal level it has impacted your life, I mean you came out of college or university and basically went straight into this. It is your life in a way. CS: Yeah, no. I mean, this really has become my life and a lot of other people that work with me, it's their life but we haven't become financially rich but we've become rich in many other ways. Just in the last month some of the communities that we have sat down and had dinner with and talked about their lives and the things their hopeful about is incredibly inspiring. It's what keeps us going. CNN: So it's not a job, is it? CS: No, I don't think anyone could live if they just had a job. A career is a job you love, right? That's what a career should be. If you're in a job that you hate, you should quit. That's the way I look at it. I'm in a job that I love so I'm going to make it my career. Do you have a question for our panelists?

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- New Orleans police lined up ""like at a firing range"" and fatally shot an unarmed man in the back as he fled from them in the days after Hurricane Katrina swept ashore, a witness to the shooting told CNN. It marks the first time a witness has come forward publicly with information about the shooting of Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old mentally retarded man whose death has sparked a police investigation and a grand jury probe into what happened in and around the Danziger Bridge that day. ""He just fell like he was collapsing,"" Kasimir Gaston told CNN. ""Like something just wiped him out."" Gaston was one of many flood refugees living on the second floor of the Friendly Inn, a low-income motel on the city's east side. On Sunday, September 4, 2005, he says he woke up and stepped onto the balcony of the motel and saw a man running, hands outstretched and being fired upon. Former officer pleads guilty in shooting . Initial police accounts said that Madison reached for his waistband and turned on police, but Gaston said Madison did not appear to have a weapon and that he was running away from police ""hands out, full speed"" when he was shot. Police declined CNN's request for an interview. After the shooting last year, police said officers had responded to reported gunshots on the Danziger Bridge and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects. One teenager was killed near the base of the bridge and three other people were wounded, according to police reports. A police department press release from October 4, 2005, said Madison, described as an unidentified gunman, was ""confronted by a New Orleans Police officer. The suspect reached into his waist and turned toward the officer who fired one shot, fatally wounding him."" When asked if Madison had a gun, Gaston said, ""I didn't see any on him."" No gun was found on Madison's body. An autopsy obtained previously by CNN and verified by the Orleans Parish Coroner said Madison suffered five gunshot wounds to his back and two in his shoulder. Gaston said he came forward now because he is still troubled by what happened. He said he decided to break his silence after watching a ""CNN Presents"" documentary, ""Shoot to Kill,"" about the days after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005. CNN has visited the room where Gaston was staying. From that balcony, it is about 100 feet to where Madison was shot and killed. The police department has said the shooting has been thoroughly investigated. But Gaston said no officer or detective approached him about what he saw. He was not asked for his name or phone number, Gaston said. Gaston said his only contact with police on that day was when officers told him not to touch Madison's body, which was lying behind Gaston's truck, parked in the motel entranceway. CNN has obtained a newspaper photo taken that Sunday morning that shows where the body fell. The back of a truck with a rusted trailer hitch and broken tail light can be seen in the photo. The photo appears to be Gaston's truck, which now sits in a parking lot in Dallas, Texas, where he now lives. ""They notified me that I had two bullet holes in the passenger side,"" he said. Two bullet marks can be seen at the right rear of the truck today. Mary Howell, an attorney suing New Orleans police on behalf of the dead man's family, says there were several potential witnesses living at the Friendly Inn at the time of the shooting. She has accused police of violating procedures by failing to even write down their names. Howell said Ronald Madison and his older brother, Lance Madison, were trying to avoid the shootout between police and others that day when they ran up the Danziger Bridge, toward the other side of the Industrial Canal. Lance Madison has said a policeman pointed what looked like a rifle or shotgun at his brother and shot Ronald near the top of the bridge. Lance said he helped carry his wounded brother to the entrance of the motel and left him there while he ran for help. After being arrested, Lance was brought back to the motel where, he says, he first saw his brother was dead. Howell said police, in the chaos after Hurricane Katrina, failed to properly investigate the fatal shooting and are now trying to put everything behind them. ""There's a lot of things that have been washed away with this hurricane,"" Howell said. ""We are doing everything we can to make sure this is not one of them."" While the family of Ronald Madison presses on with its lawsuit, a grand jury in New Orleans is investigating the case. Gaston said he is willing to testify before the grand jury if it will help get to the truth. ""I'm not trying to say nobody did this and nobody did that,"" Gaston said. ""I'm just saying what I saw and being truthful and honest about what I saw with my own eyes.""","Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old mentally retarded man, was shot on September 4, 2005 .

"(Ars Technica) -- With the planned settlement between Google and book publishers still on indefinite hold, a legal battle by proxy has started. Google partnered with many libraries at US universities in order to gain access to the works it wants to digitize. Now, several groups that represent book authors have filed suit against those universities, attempting to block both digital lending and an orphaned works project. The suit is being brought by the Authors' Guild, its equivalents in Australia, Quebec, and the UK, and a large group of individual authors. Its target: some major US universities, including Michigan, the University of California system, and Cornell. These libraries partnered with Google to get their book digitization efforts off the ground and, in return, Google has provided them with digital copies of the works. These and many other universities have also become involved with the HathiTrust, an organization set up to help them archive and distribute digital works; the HathiTrust is also named as a defendant. The suit seeks to block two separate efforts. In the first, the universities have created a pooled digital archive of the contents of their libraries, maintained by the Hathitrust. No one contests that these works remain in copyright, or that the universities have rights to the nondigital forms of these works. What the authors object to is the fact that the digital works are derived from an unauthorized scan, and will be stored in a single archive that is no longer under the control of the university from which the scan was derived. The suit suggests that the security of this archive is also suspect, and may allow the mass release of copyrighted work. A separate issue in the suit is an orphaned works project started by the Hathitrust that focuses on some of the works within this archive. The group is attempting to identify out-of-copyright books, and those where the ownership of copyright cannot be established. If attempts to locate and contact any copyright holders fail, and the work is no longer commercially available, the Hathitrust will start providing digital copies to students without restrictions. This has not gone over well. The executive director of the Australian Society of Authors, Angelo Loukakis, stated, ""This group of American universities has no authority to decide whether, when or how authors forfeit their copyright protection. These aren't orphaned books, they're abducted books."" The authors' coalition would like to see everything grind to a halt -- Google and the libraries kept from any further scanning, the HathiTrust's orphaned works project shuttered, and the digital copies on its servers impounded. The digital works wouldn't be deleted, but it wants to see ""any computer system storing the digital copies powered down and disconnected from any network, pending an appropriate act of Congress."" (Note that they want them shut down and unplugged, just to be sure.) The Authors Guild was actually a party to the Google book settlement, so it's not like it objects to the effort per se. However, the university libraries had not been a party to it, so this may be the Guild's attempt to tie up loose ends when it comes to nailing down digital rights. Alternately, they may simply be sending a message that, until the settlement is approved, none of Google's efforts should be reaching even a limited segment of the public. In either case, this suit could go a long way towards establishing how many digital rights are granted with the ownership of a book. More on Law & Disorder from Ars Technica .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Muslims staged rallies across Indonesia on Sunday to protest U.S. President Barack Obama's planned visit to the southeast  Asian nation this week. The protests -- organized by Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir -- included women and children. ""We don't see the differences between Obama and Bush, they both oppress Muslims, they both have blood on their hands,""  said Ismail Yusanto, a spokesman for the Muslim group in Indonesia. ""That's why we reject Obama and we don't believe that he's reaching out to Muslims."" The spokesman said about 20,000 people attended the rallies. With about 205 million Muslims, Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington, D.C. More than one in 10 of the world's Muslims live there. Although it has a reputation for being home to a relatively tolerant and easy-going brand of Islam, a Pew Forum analysis rates it as having high levels of legal restrictions on religion and religious social tension. Government restrictions on religion are tighter in Indonesia than in Russia or Turkey, and social tensions are higher than in Nigeria or Egypt, the think tank says. Obama is scheduled to arrive in Jakarta on Tuesday as part of a 10-day visit to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan. He is expected to finalize a comprehensive partnership with Indonesia. Obama spent part of his childhood in Indonesia. On Wednesday, the president will visit Istiqlal mosque. He will also address the biggest Muslim nation from an undetermined location. However, Muslims in Indonesia remain pessimistic. ""Obama can talk all he wants in Cairo and in Jakarta, the fact is that he still has his troops in war with Muslims,"" Yusanto said.  ""It's all lip service."" Protesters chanted ""No Obama"" and held up posters that said ""Stop oppressor."" Obama's visit to Asia started Saturday with a three-day visit to India. His visit to India -- the third largest economy and one of the world's few growth markets -- also includes meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi and addressing the nation's parliament.","NEW: Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim country, a think tank says .

"(CNN) -- David Goldman says he can't understand why he can't have custody of his son following his ex-wife's death in Brazil. The U.S. government agrees. David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth. Goldman told CNN's Larry King he had no idea when he dropped off his wife and 4-year-old son at Newark International Airport in 2004 for a two-week vacation to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that he was about to become embroiled in an international custody battle. Shortly after Bruna Bianchi Goldman arrived in her homeland she called to say she wanted a divorce, which she obtained in Brazil, and would stay there with their son, Sean. The running custody battle has taken many twists and turns and has gained the attention of the Department of State and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""A child belongs with his family, and there is no reason why David Goldman should not get his child back,"" Clinton said in a recent interview on NBC's Today show. ""And we're hoping that that will be resolved very soon. Obviously, if not, we will continue to raise it with the Brazilian government."" For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son. It's a case that has been complicated by Bianchi Goldman remarrying, getting pregnant and dying during childbirth last summer. Sean Goldman is said to be living with his stepfather, who has been granted provisional guardianship. ""I went down ... to bring my son home,"" Goldman said on CNN's Larry King Live Wednesday, figuring his ex-wife's death had made the custody issue a moot point, and ""we find out that this man doesn't file custody, but he files to remove my name from a Brazilian birth certificate that they had issued for my son, who was born in Red Bank, New Jersey."" Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government. ""The Department of State is working diligently to ensure that David and Sean Goldman are accorded their rights under the Hague Convention of 1980 on the civil right aspect of International Child Abduction,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We'll continue to insist that the Brazilian government fulfill its obligations under the treaty and international law."" The convention, to which Brazil is a signatory, ""is a multilateral treaty, which seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return,"" according to the Hague Convention Web site. Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings that New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened. As a result, the case remains a stalemate. ""I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him,"" Clinton said in the NBC interview. ""His son is the most precious person in the world to him and he has gone not just the extra mile, but mile after mile, back and forth, trying to make it clear that his son Sean deserves to be returned to him."" But on Larry King Live, Helvecio Ribeiro, a Bianchi family spokesman, questioned Goldman's fitness as a parent. ""I don't question the biological right,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is that in order to be a parent, you have to be more than just a DNA donor, Mr. King. Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice. It's about providing support to your child. It's about being there even when you're not there. ""And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so,"" Ribeiro said. Goldman visited his son for the first time in more than four years last month -- a bittersweet experience that was heartbreaking when it was time to return to the United States. ""He asked me why I haven't come to see him in all this time,"" Goldman told Larry King, ""and that was very, very painful -- and the anguish on his face when he asked me that question. I didn't want to tell him that ... they're holding him."" International custody fights are common and were supposed to be simplified by the 1980 Hague agreement, but conflicting court systems and conflicting accounts of relationships can trump international law. The next step in this case is uncertain.","David Goldman dropped off his wife and 4-year-old son at airport in 2004 for vacation .

"(CNN) -- The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China called for the hastening of reform that would give these emerging economies more power in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. ""The IMF and the World Bank urgently need to address their legitimacy deficits,"" the leaders said in a statement released at the second summit of the so-called ""BRIC"" economies meeting on Thursday in Brasilia. ""Reforming these institutions' governance structures requires first and foremost a substantial shift in voting power in favor of emerging market economies and developing countries to bring their participation in decision making in line with their relative weight in the world economy,"" the BRIC communiqué said. The countries urged for voting power reform to give developing countries a larger say in the World Bank at the upcoming ""Spring Meetings"" on April 24 and 25 in Washington and similar quota reform of the IMF completed by the G-20 Summit scheduled for November. The BRIC summit -- the second since the group met in Russia last year -- was moved up a day, as Chinese President Hu Jintao cut his trip short to return to China after the earthquake in Qinghai province near the Tibetan border killed more than 700 people. The BRIC nations -- a term coined by Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs in 2003 as the group of the fastest growing world economies -- comprise 40 percent of the world's population and about a quarter of its landmass. Together their GDP is roughly two-thirds that of the United States.","The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China called for reform of the IMF and World Bank .

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Rio de Janeiro's special forces moved quickly and didn't stop to chat Monday as they peered in windows and knocked on doors in Rocinha, the city's biggest shantytown. In a predawn raid the day before, 3,000 troops seized control of the hilltop favela, wresting from the hands of drug traffickers. They declared victory in just two hours, without firing a single shot. ""Today a lot of the drug dealers are gone,"" said Luis Machado, one of the officers in charge of the door-to-door searches. ""Others are hidden. And it's now that we're going to find them and the weapons."" The massive operation was part of efforts secure Rio de Janeiro and eliminate bloody drug gangs ahead of the 2014 World Cup and the Olympic Games two years later. For many of Rocinha's 100,000 residents, it was business as usual on Monday. Food stalls displayed strings of garlic and onions while motorcycle taxis zipped up and down the winding roads. ""Thank god it's over,"" said Giovani, a food vendor. ""It's 100% better. It's better than normal."" Rocinha's top drug trafficker, Antonio Francisco Bomfim, known as Nem, was captured by police last week, days before the invasion. According to residents, a three-story house overlooking the shantytown and beachside condominiums below had been his home until his arrest. Inside, all appliances and even bathroom fixtures had been ripped out, but the signs of luxury are evident, including a small pool and private gym. An empty bottle of Black Label whiskey sits on the glass bar. Still, in many ways, the hard work has only just begun. Mountains of trash line the streets, and tangled masses of electrical wires dangle over houses. ""Before this was called a favela because it was full of criminals,"" said Juliete, an 18-year-old physical trainer. ""Now things have to be done to call it a neighborhood. We need running water, proper sewage and things for young people to do."" Raimundo Cesario, who has lived in Rocinha for 40 years, agreed. ""The system trapped young people in a life of crime. But it's also true that they helped people when they needed it,"" he said. ""We'll have to see if things are better or worse under the police.""","A door-to-door search follows a raid to take control of a Brazilian favela, or shantytown .

"(CNN)  -- Emergency teams on Sunday were assessing damage from deadly storms that devastated parts of Missouri, Kentucky and West Virginia this weekend -- even as the threat of more severe weather continued. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin tours Mingo County to assess damage caused by extensive rain and flooding. The storm that tore through Madison County, Kentucky, on Friday was a category EF-3 tornado, the National Weather Service said Sunday. An EF-3 is the third-strongest category of tornado, with winds of 136 to 165 mph, strong enough to destroy large buildings and lift cars off the ground. At least one person was killed by that storm, with several other serious injuries. A waste water treatment plant was destroyed, two fire departments sustained major roof damage and some manufacturing facilities were damaged, local authorities said. Three people were killed in southern Missouri during high winds, thunderstorms and flash floods. A couple was killed when a tree fell on their car on a highway near Poplar Bluff. A man died of a heart attack near Springfield when winds tossed him and his wife into an open field, officials said. A weekend of storming in West Virginia destroyed as many as 400 buildings and severely damaged an additional 1,000, said Rob Jelacic of the West Virginia Office of Emergency Services. ""We are in recovery mode,"" Jelacic said Sunday. There were no known deaths in West Virginia from the storms. After the storms came floods. On Sunday, parts of the Meramec and Big rivers were rising feet above flood levels, causing residents already hit by the storms to seek higher ground. Forecasters expected the Meramec to crest Monday 4 to 8 feet above flood state in St. Louis County. The big river was expected to crest a half-foot higher on Monday than it did Sunday.","Tornado hits Kentucky with 136 to 165 mph winds, kills one .

"(CNN) -- Connectivity was the name of the game at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, held last week in Las Vegas -- especially when it came to health-related products. From cloud-connected scales to music-connected sex toys, these gadgets rose above the rest as those that might really help you keep your New Year's resolutions. Sleep soundly . A small, lightweight band users wear on their heads during sleep, the Zeo Sleep System measures brain waves while you're in dreamland, and will sync via Bluetooth with your smart device. Zeo's free app plots out how many hours of quality snooze time you're getting each night. Great feedback for our highly caffeinated, tech-obsessed society, it also plots out sleep quality based on behaviors you input. How much did those three glasses of vino affect your sleep? How about that late night fast-food run, or actual run? Zeo gives you concrete tips for improving your sleep routine based on your habits, and will even wake you up at the optimum time in your sleep cycle. The Zeo is available for a one-time purchase price of $99. (No monthly subscription required.) Body bands . A bevy of body bands made a splash at CES this year, among them the BodyMedia Fit and the Basis Band. BodyMedia's Fit monitoring system consists of a small electric band the user wears on his or her arm, that works in conjunction with a software interface that's available on your smartphone or online. Users input their daily calorie intake, and the device monitors calories burned. The band uses sweat sensors, an accelerometer and skin temperature monitors to figure out how much exercise you're doing, and for how long. It compares that to your food intake to give a picture of your daily health. The accelerometer knows when you're lying on your back for hours at a time (presumably sleeping), and adds that to your fitness picture as well. The Fit CORE is available for $149, but requires plugging in to synch your data. The new Fit LINK is Bluetooth-enabled for wireless synching, and is available for $179. Both products require a $6.95 monthly subscription to BodyMedia's online dashboard. Similar to the BodyMedia's Fit, the Basis Band adds real-time heart rate monitoring to the mix by using a optical engine that ""looks through the skin to see actual blood flow,"" similar to the technology used in pulse oximeters (those little things they put on your finger at the doctor's office.) The Basis Band is also worn on the wrist rather than on the arm, and looks more like a trendy watch than a fitness monitor. The Basis is available for pre-order, shipping sometime this quarter; and will be $199. The price includes lifetime access to the cloud service and online interface -- no monthly subscription required. Smart medical devices . Smart medical devices abounded on the expo floor this year. The Withings Wi-fi Body Scale, a sleek device that looks like an iPhone you can step on, connects with your iPhone, or other iOS or Android-capable phone. The scale measures your weight, lean and fat mass and calculates your BMI almost instantaneously. To keep things simple (and less depressing), the display only shows your weight -- the rest of the information floats up to the cloud, and is available on your smartphone. The free app interface also lets you invite friends, family members or your doctor to view your progress; and it will keep track of data for up to eight users. The Withings Wi-fi Scale is available for $159, which includes lifetime access to the web and phone service. Unfortunately, just because this scale is cloud-connected, doesn't mean you're going to be any lighter. Withings also had another smart medical device: the iPhone Blood Pressure Cuff. Wrap it around your arm and then plug this bad boy into your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. A small compressor in the device inflates the cuff, using power from your device. Once the reading is complete, the information is logged in a free app, and is available to send to your doctor for analysis and tracking. The cuff is available for $129 with no recurring monthly fees. California-based iHealth Labs also brought a Wi-Fi scale and blood pressure cuff to the table; but a third product really caught our attention: the Smart GlucoMeter. As more of the connected generation starts dealing with diabetes, this high-tech tool may encourage diabetics to check their blood sugar more often. The device is simple: Plug a pack-of-gum-sized accessory into the bottom of your Apple device, insert a test strip, prick your finger (unfortunately, they haven't been able to eliminate that step). Put a drop of blood on the strip. Within a few seconds, the device measures your blood sugar, and catalogs it for you and your doctor to track. The GlucoMeter is pending approval with the FDA, and should be available in the latter half of 2012. The price has not yet been set. Health apps . Just as cool as some of the hardware at CES was the software. ""Gamification"" of health was a popular phrase on the show floor, and several companies weighed in with entries to that category. Among the coolest were ... UnitedHealth Group's OptumizeMe is a social fitness app that lets you challenge friends and family to get healthy. The app allows users to make their own health challenges or select from a list of popular challenges. Among them: competitions to see who can walk the most steps in a day, who can be the first to run 100 miles, and who can eat their daily servings of fruits and veggies. The app allows you to add a prize for the top dog and share your results on social networking sites with friends. OptumizeMe is a free app, and it allows you to sync fitness information with your employer's benefits plan if your company has United Healthcare coverage. (TimeWarner, CNN's parent company, is a member of United Healthcare insurance coverage.) This app isn't a new entry into the category, but a much improved one. Lose It! is a weight-loss management tool that allows users to keep track of food and exercise on the go. The app has a catalog of thousands of the most popular foods, and all of the nutrition information for each of them. Popular new additions to the app include bar-code scanning of your favorite prepackaged food items, the ability to create and share custom foods and recipes with your friends, and a FourSquare-like badge-earning system, that rewards users' daily entries, weight loss milestones, and sharing activities. Lose It! is a free app, and will integrate data from many of the connected medical devices listed above into your health picture. The cool stuff . There are a few other notable additions to the list, though they only sort of qualify as health devices. The 4Moms Origami Stroller is so cool, it might make you want a baby! This ""iPhone of baby strollers"" both collapses and rebuilds itself at the touch of a button, using on-board motors that are charged when the user pushes the stroller. It also features daytime-running lights, a cupholder, and a smartphone-charging pouch (using the same charge-as-you-push technology). An onboard LCD screen monitors the weather, battery level and whether or not your child is in the seat -- critical info if you're considering pushing the ""fold"" button. But rest assured, the device isn't as scatter-brained as new moms tend to be, and won't fold if your bambino is inside. The origami is available for $849. The Nest Thermostat gives some much needed love to the oft-neglected category of home heating and cooling interfaces. This $249 piece of wall art automatically learns your temperature preferences, and your comings and goings to make sure your house is cool when you want it to be. Users can also control the Wi-Fi connected device remotely via smartphone; and special plastic technology enables it to pick up the color of the wall it's on to blend in with your decor. And for those of you whose New Year's resolutions included having more, uh, fun in the bedroom, the OhMiBod musical vibrators use an audio-enabled microchips to vibrate to the beat of your favorite music. The line features personal-use and partner-friendly devices; even a wearable model to take with you to the clubs. This product was a little difficult to test on the show floor, though.","Zeo Sleep System gives you concrete tips for improving your sleep routine .

"(CNN) -- It has been nearly a year since Haiti held elections, but it was not until late Tuesday night that the troubled nation finally was able to form a new government. Garry Conille, a United Nations development specialist and aide to Bill Clinton, was ratified by the Haitian Senate after debate that lasted more than seven hours. President Michel Martelly, who took office in May, congratulated his new prime minister, saying that the installation of new leadership was a step forward in implementing change in Haiti. Martelly's two former prime ministerial nominations -- businessman Daniel Rouzier and lawyer Bernard Gousse -- were rejected by the Senate. The inability to form a working government had raised concerns about Haiti's ability to move forward after a devastating earthquake in January 2010. However, Conille was welcomed in many corners as someone knowledgeable on development challenges and someone who had experience in working with the global community. Conille, 45, a gynecologist, earned a master's degree in health administration from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. He worked for the United Nations Development Program and was a protege of economist Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University. ""You need someone like Garry Conille who understands the international community because this is a country which depends on the largesse of the international community,"" said Garry Pierre-Pierre, editor and publisher of the New York-based newspaper The Haitian Times. Most recently, Conille served as chief of staff for former President Clinton, the special U.N. envoy in Haiti. In that role, he was involved in international aid delivery to Haiti. Martelly and Conille have a tough road ahead. Critics say post-quake progress in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, has not been swift enough. Thousands of people remain displaced from their homes, many still in vulnerable makeshift camps. The new government has to take on recovery. Pierre-Pierre said it will be important for Haiti to choose a finance minister who has experience in the private sector, whose partnership with the government will be key to Haiti's future. ""I just hope (Conille) is able to bring in someone who is as high-powered in the financial world as he is the development world,"" Pierre-Pierre said. ""Too often in Haiti, we have loaded the government with good bureaucrats (and) not enough people with private sector experience.""","Senators ratified Garry Conille as Haiti's next prime minister .

"(CNN) -- Beyond the noise of raucous crowds and angry protesters who have turned town hall meetings into shouting matches is genuine concern from ordinary citizens who are afraid that President Obama's health care proposals would only make things harder for them, experts say. The battle over health care reform has energized people on both sides of the debate. ""The reason that we see these protests and people asking tough questions at town hall meetings is because they feel like the president is going to take something away from them. That motivates people. That gets them out,"" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Those fears were heard Tuesday at Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter's town hall meeting in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. ""This is going to take away my freedom,"" charged one man who wanted assurance from Specter that the private option for health insurance would stay viable. Specter repeated Obama's pledge, telling the crowd, ""If you like your policy, you can keep it."" Acknowledging the skepticism at a town hall meeting Tuesday, Obama tried to alleviate fears that reform would take something away. ""I recognize there's an underlying fear here that people somehow won't get the care they need. You will have not only the care you need, but also the care that right now is being denied to you, only if we get health care reform. That's what we're fighting for,"" he said at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire, event. Since his days on the campaign trail, Obama has promised the public that those who like their health insurance plans won't have to give them up, but he's stopped short of saying at what cost. ""I think that's the fear,"" said Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and the director of American studies at Georgetown University. ""Even though they are going to keep the plan, the plan is going to be at a much greater cost. And he's not been able to really allay that fear.""  Watch what happened at Specter's town hall meeting » . The themes coming up at town hall meetings across the country are broadly the same as doubts expressed during the campaign. Critics are voicing fears about socialism and the dismantling of the government they are used to. And those who have sufficient health care coverage worry they'll have to foot the bill for reform, echoing concerns heard during the presidential campaign that Obama would ""spread the wealth around."" ""That was one of the campaign critiques of Obama that seemed to work well, that seemed to resonate well,"" Owen said. ""I really do think that it was an issue, and I think the opponents of the health care plan, by bringing that back up again ... I think that it could be an effective obstacle to what he's trying to accomplish."" Obama originally asked Congress to send him a health care bill before the August recess, but neither chamber met the deadline. As lawmakers spend the break in their home districts, they've been met with sometimes fierce opposition to Obama's proposals. ""It's not anti-reform -- it's anti-bad reform,"" Cannon said. ""I think the public is reacting to what's in the legislation. And I think that's why the president wanted the House and the Senate to pass their versions before the August recess, because the president knew that the public would object to a lot of what is in these bills."" The White House, however, said that Obama ""asked Congress to move quickly because we can't wait any longer to begin fixing what's wrong with our system."" iReport.com: Are you attending a town hall? Share photos, video . Obama's health care battle has been compared to former President Clinton's failed effort more than 15 years ago, but lawmakers didn't experience the same backlash during the Clinton years. Part of the reason was because of the calendar, CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider said. Clinton proposed his plan in September 1993, and by the time Congress went on recess in August 1994, the plan was dead. People also didn't use the Internet the way they use it today, ""so you didn't have the viral communications that rally people to attend town halls,"" Schneider noted. Today's hypersaturated media, where rumor is picked up as fact and disseminated to millions via blogs and discussion boards, has contributed to the misinformation being lobbed at lawmakers, Owen said. Coming out of one of her town hall meetings Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said that ""people are just getting information that's flat wrong."" But as unfounded as some of the claims may be, such as charges that Obama will set up death panels to decide who will live or die, the emotional appeals resonate with the public. ""I don't think that this is debate that is going to go away,"" Owen said, noting that given the outpouring seen at the town hall meetings, Congress can't just pick up where it left off when it returns from break. ""I think the public is going to remain engaged and energized."" Cannon said the debate has ""stunted the president's momentum"" and will make it harder for his administration to get through the types of reforms they were hoping for. Cannon predicted that Obama's plan will fail, but advocates ""are going to try more incremental reforms to improve the health care sector."" The same thing happened after the Clinton plan failed. Congress passed less sweeping reform like the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). iReport.com: Share views on health care reform .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's president on Wednesday declared three days of national mourning for the victims of a suicide truck bomb that killed more than 70 people in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. According to the Health Ministry, 72 were killed Tuesday and 103 remained injured, 38 of those in serious condition. A majority of the victims were students and their parents who were registering for an education program at a government complex. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist movement that has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility. President Sharif Ahmed visited the scene and some of the hospitals where the victims were, the government said in a statement. Some of the injured who cannot be treated in Somalia will be flown to other countries. ""At this time, when the country is in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis, the terrorists could not have attacked the Somali people at a worse time,"" said Abdulkadir Hussein Mohamed, the country's minister of information. According to the government, Tuesday's bombing was the second Al-Shabaab attack in two years that specifically targeted students. In December 2009, a suicide bomber attacked a university graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, killing more than 20 people. Al-Shabaab is a group in Somalia that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States government in March 2008. It is waging a war against Somalia's government to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. Federal and African Union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. Many analysts believe that Al-Shabaab has been severely weakened by the African Union Mission in Somalia, targeted strikes against foreign members and the weakening of al Qaeda.","A suicide truck bomb killed more than 70 people Tuesday .

"MUNICH, Germany (CNN) -- Alleged Nazi camp guard John Demjanjuk had no choice but to bring Jews to their deaths in extermination camps, Demjanjuk's defense argued Monday as his long-awaited trial got under way. Demjanjuk, 89, faces charges of being an accessory to about 27,900 murders during World War II. But his defense attorney, Ulrich Busch, said Monday the court was imposing a ""moral and judicial double standard."" The retired auto worker from Cleveland, Ohio -- a native Ukrainian -- was a prisoner of war during the conflict, and would have been killed had he not done what the Nazis ordered, the defense team argued. The defense line that Demjanjuk was forced to help the Nazis represents a change for the defendant, who has denied in the past that he was a camp guard. The guards forced to help the Nazis were ""victims, not culprits -- survivors, not murderers,"" defense lawyer Busch said. Higher-ranking German SS officers in a similar situation have been found not guilty of war crimes, the defense argued. The Munich state prosecutor brought the charges against Demjanjuk for his alleged role at the Sobibor death camp in Poland, where the Nazis and their accessories killed at least 167,000 people, according to the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum. About 30 relatives of victims have joined the prosecution case. In Germany it is possible for the families to join the prosecution case as co-plaintiffs, representing named individuals who died in the death camps. If Demjanjuk is found guilty, it will not be only for 27,900 anonymous murders, but for the murders of victims specifically named by the co-plantiffs. There are very few remaining survivors of Sobibor. Demjanjuk's defenders say he was a Soviet prisoner of war at the Trawniki camp, where Nazis trained prisoners to assist with the extermination of about 2 million Jews in occupied Poland. Those prisoners of war had no choice but to assist, the defense said. Demjanjuk was brought into the court in a wheelchair, accompanied by medical personnel and a German-Ukrainian translator. He did not speak in the opening phase of the trial, and had his eyes shut most of the time. The trial is expected to last until May of next year. He was deported in May from the United States to Germany. The German court originally accused him of complicity in about 29,000 murders. The prosecutor's office said it revised the number because some of those who had allegedly died in the camp when Demjanjuk was there were already dead during the transport to Sobibor. Demjanjuk lost a U.S. Supreme Court case against his deportation. His lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he was too ill and frail to be sent overseas. They also raised human rights and other legal issues. The Munich State Court ruled earlier this year he was fit to stand trial. But doctors have restricted the time he can be tried each day to two sessions of 90 minutes each, said Anton Winkler, Munich state prosecutor. The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s, when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as ""Ivan the Terrible."" His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981, and he was extradited to Israel in 1986. Demjanjuk was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was ""Ivan the Terrible."" A federal court restored Demjanjuk's citizenship, ruling the government withheld evidence supporting his case. But his citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard. CNN's Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker from Ohio, denies any role in the Holocaust .

"(CNN) -- A lengthy investigation into the erratic behavior of a Brazilian accused of ordering the murder of a 73-year-old American nun led to his recent arrest, a Brazilian prosecutor in the state of Para told CNN. U.S. missionary sister Dorothy Stang as seen in 2004 working in the Amazon forest in Para, Brazil. Regivaldo Pereira Galvao was recently seen at what authorities say is the site of the 2005 slaying of Sister Dorothy Stang to pressure peasants there into giving him the property rights, said federal prosecutor Felicio Pontes Tuesday. The site is located in a 7,400 acre plot known as ""Lot 55"" that is under dispute in the Amazon. Police arrested Galvao Friday on charges of land fraud and slavery. He is already facing a conspiracy to murder charge in connection with Stang's death. Before her death, Stang had defended the right of landless peasants by giving them access to public land and promoting sustainable farming practices that would help halt deforestation. Her land distribution project, the Project for Sustainable Development (PDS), has received praise by officials with the Brazilian government. ""Sister Dorothy's PDS project is the very most successful land reform project in the Amazon,"" said Pontes, adding, ""It has helped more than 300 settlers make a living in a sustainable way."". A recently released film called, ""They Killed Sister Dorothy,"" narrated by American actor Martin Sheen, has won international acclaim for its original, in-depth investigation of Stang's life and the details surrounding her murder. The film contains exclusive interviews and information that will be used against the suspects, Brazilian investigators told CNN. ""This film has been very important for us. It not only explains the dilemma Brazilians are facing in protecting the Amazon, but it also contains interviews with the suspects which we will certainly use against them,"" said Pontes. Aside from Galvao, five people have been accused in Stang's killing. Four have been convicted, and one has been acquitted. Stang was gunned down along a muddy road near Lot 55 as she worked with the peasants. Galvao's presence at Lot 55 adds to evidence against him in the murder case, Pontes said. ""We have been keeping an eye on him since he left prison, since he has always said he had nothing to do with that land, and therefore was not behind the murder of Sister Dorothy,"" Pontes told CNN. ""Now we nailed him, we know he lied and he did have a lot of interest in that allotment,"" he said. Galvao sat in prison for a year after Stang's death while awaiting trial. He was released by Brazil's high court in 2006, though he is still awaiting trial. Galvao has consistently denied illegally obtaining land and being involved in Stang's murder. He has also denied any involvement with Lot 55, which has been divided among poor settlers for Stang's sustainable farming projects. ""I'm deeply sorry about this whole tragedy, but I am also a victim of it,"" Galvao said in a statement from jail after his arrest in 2005 which was posted on a Web site that proclaims his innocence. ""I'm innocent. I never stained my hands with any crime, or ordered anyone else to stain theirs."" Prosecutors accuse Galvao of forging land titles and forcefully seizing public lands under the government's law reform program. Elizabeth Dowyer, a nun with the Sisters of Notre Dame where Stang was ordained, told CNN she was happy when she heard the announcement of Galvao's arrest. ""We are relieved in a sense because we knew he was also involved in slavery and he was an illegal land grabber,"" she said. ""We also strongly believe he was involved in a consortium to grab that plot."" Dowyer, who also was involved in Stang's land reform movement in the Amazon, said Stang knew her would-be killers and even prayed for them. ""In her letters, she named the people she tried to mediate with. On the night before her death, she invited her own killers who bragged to the community of what they were about to do,"" she said. ""She really believed people could change."" The day after the meeting, hired killers murdered her, Dowyer said. Land reform is the crux of many of Brazil's social problems. Most agricultural lands rest in the hands of a few wealthy landowners, who are engaged in export-crops like soy and sugar cane as well as cattle ranching, according to the Landless Peasant Movement in Brazil.","Prosecutor: Galvao's recent presence at murder site adds to evidence against him .

"(CNN) -- France and Britain plan to abstain from a Security Council vote on the Palestinians' bid for statehood, two U.N. diplomats said Thursday. France told members of the U.N. Security Council about its intentions at a Thursday afternoon meeting of the admissions committee for new U.N. membership, a Security Council diplomat told CNN. Another U.N. diplomat told CNN that Britain will also abstain, with one of its representatives likewise announcing its intentions at the same closed-door meeting. The U.N. Security Council is set to meet November 11 to discuss a report about whether or not to admit a Palestinian state as a member of the international organization. The membership bid has been controversial, with Israel among those opposed. Diplomats have said it appears unlikely the Palestinians will succeed in their bid, given that the United States -- one of five permanent security council members -- has warned it will veto the attempt. However, a veto may not be necessary if a minimum of nine nations -- out of 15 on the U.N. council -- don't support the Palestinians' bid.","France tells U.N. members about its plans at a Thursday meeting, a diplomat says .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for 16 Indiana National Guard soldiers on Wednesday sued the largest U.S. contractor in Iraq, alleging the company knowingly exposed the soldiers to a cancer-causing toxic chemical. 16 Indiana National Guardsmen have sued the Houston-based company Kellogg Brown and Root, known as KBR. The lawsuit against Houston-based KBR, which seeks an unspecified amount, alleges that the soldiers were exposed to sodium dichromate, an inorganic compound containing a highly toxic form of chromium known as hexavalent chromium. The soldiers say that they, along with other American civilian contractors, were exposed to the chemical at the Qarmat Ali water pumping plant in southern Iraq shortly after the U.S. invasion in 2003. KBR was tasked with getting the plant up and running using civilian contractors. The National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the civilian workers. The Guardsmen and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant. The chemical was believed to have been left behind by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein. Some of the Guardsmen already suffer from nasal tumors or respiratory system problems and other health problems, according to the lawsuit. One of the guardsmen may have died from the exposure, though the exact cause of his death earlier this year is still not clear. The odorless sodium dichromate was used at the plant as an anti-corrosive, the lawsuit says. The chemical contained nearly pure hexavalent chromium, the toxic substance that poisoned homeowners in Hinkley, California, and was made famous by activist Erin Brockovich, according to the suit. For the Guardsmen, KBR's ""knowing acts and omissions"" resulted in ""months and months of unprotected, unknowing, direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man,"" the lawsuit alleges. A spokeswoman for KBR said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit, but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant. ""We are not providing comment on the suit at this time. The company does intend to vigorously defend itself,"" KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said. The Guardsmen say the company knew about the dangers of exposure to the chemical as far back as 2003, but did not act to protect the soldiers. ""KBR managers knew full well long ago that this stuff was incredibly dangerous. But there was no information about it for years. And now these soldiers are facing some pretty serious health concerns. They're going to be stuck with this the rest of their lives,"" said Doyle. ""The most frustrating thing is that these guys are finding out years later that they were exposed to something,"" said Mike Doyle, one of the Houston attorneys representing the Guardsmen. KBR took issue with the allegation that the company knowingly exposed the soldiers or anyone else and did nothing to help. ""KBR's commitment to the safety and security of all employees, the troops and those we serve is the company's top priority,"" the statement read. ""KBR appropriately notified the Army Corps of Engineers upon discovery of the existence of the substance on the site and the Corps of Engineers concluded that KBR's efforts to remediate the situation were effective. Further, the company in no way condones any action that would compromise the safety of those we serve or employ."" Mark McManaway, a father and grandfather, was an Indiana National Guard sergeant at the water plant from May through September 2003, when the worst exposures are believed to have occurred. He is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. ""The worst part is that the military has only just recently advised us that the stuff we were exposed to was much worse than they thought while we were out there,"" said McManaway. ""It's in our bodies, but we don't know how bad it is. Maybe within the next five years cancers could start showing up. You've got a ticking time bomb in you -- and when's it going to go off?"" The U.S. military is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. The toxic chemical made famous by Brockovich in California was a diluted form of hexavalent chromium that caused serious illnesses after being ingested by homeowners through their water. The chemical the Guardsmen were exposed to in Iraq was a nearly  pure form of the chemical and could have been inhaled directly by anyone working at the plant. The U.S. Senate held hearings in August on emerging concerns about the exposure to the toxic chemicals after reports of civilian contractors and their exposure to the chemicals at the water plant. But officials of the National Guard -- and most of the Guardsmen who worked at the plant -- were not even aware of the possible dangers at the time of the hearing. Some heard about for the first time during the televised hearings. Only then did the National Guard begin efforts to find the men, some of whom had already been back in the United States for four years. An estimated 275 American soldiers may have been exposed to the chemical at the water plant, over a period of months through mid- to late-2003.","Suit says Guardsman, contractors exposed to cancer-causing chemical at Iraq plant .

"(CNN)  -- The brief detention in Havana, Cuba, last week of a Portland, Oregon, church group comes on the heels of the detention of an American contractor and could indicate an increasingly chilly reception for some American visitors, according to the church travelers. The December 26 trip for 14 members of the First Unitarian Church of Portland is a reminder of the entrenched tensions between Cuba and the United States despite the Obama administration's loosening of previous restrictions. The church group was traveling on a U.S.-issued license and planned to do humanitarian work. The group was denied entry to Cuba. Part of the group spent the night detained inside the Havana airport before being put on a plane to Mexico, the church's social justice minister, the Rev. Kate Lore, told CNN. The most recent trip was under a religious license, but the bulk of the mission was to be devoted to projects such as an AIDS clinic and teaching women how to make baby clothes . The church made three trips in November without incident, but things went sour almost immediately after the 14 volunteers exited the plane in December, one of the participants, Jacquie Jones, told CNN. Most of the group passed through customs without a problem, but five members of the group were stopped and had their passports and licenses checked, Jones said. Jones said she told the Cuban officials, ""We love the Cubans. We have many friends here; there is no reason to keep us out of the country."" The Cuban authorities told the five that they were not allowed inside Cuba because they were there for religious reasons and forced them to wait for almost an hour and a half before putting them on a commercial flight back to Mexico, from where they had traveled. Jones pointed out the U.S. gives travel permits to Cuba for religious work, but the island, at least in this case, rejected the group for the same reason. ""It's a total Catch-22,"" she said. The reason for the brusque treatment is likely because of the detention of another American earlier this month, several church members said. The detained man, whose name has not been released, is a subcontractor for Development Alternatives Inc., an international development group on contract with the U.S. government to promote human rights in Cuba. Cuban leader Raul Castro said that the man was detained because he was distributing satellite communications equipment in order to destabilize Cuba. For nearly a half a century, the United States has maintained a trade embargo against Cuba that many on the island nation have blamed for their country's woes. ""I don't blame the Cuban government, or our government, but I truly believe something has to be done to normalize relations,"" Jones said. The nine others who had already passed through customs faced additional questioning and were detained inside the airport overnight, Carol Slegers, who was part of that group, told CNN. Later, it was learned that Cuban authorities considered imprisoning them, she said. Instead, they were left to find a place to sleep on the floor of the airport. The group ended up sleeping underneath a staircase, using fabric they brought for the clothes-making project as sheets, Slegers said. The next morning, they were put on a plane to Mexico. The Cuban officials ""were rude and cold and indifferent,"" Slegers said. ""It was very psychologically disarming."" But, Slegers and others made clear, they were not mistreated by the Cubans. ""We're upset because of the treatment, but ultimately, we want the policy to change,"" she said. ""I hope goodwill and improvement of relations will come out of this incident, moving the two countries beyond the my-belt-is-bigger-than-your-belt diplomacy of the last half century.""","Incident could indicate an increasingly chilly reception for some American visitors .

"Washington (CNN) -- Finding al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and rolling back a resurgent Taliban are necessary steps toward winning the war in Afghanistan, the top U.S. commander there told a Senate committee Tuesday. Bin Laden remains at large more than eight years after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington that triggered the Afghan war, and is widely believed to be hiding along the rugged border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said the world's most wanted terrorist is ""an iconic figure"" whose survival ""emboldens al Qaeda as a franchising organization across the world."" ""It would not defeat al Qaeda to have him captured or killed, but I don't think we can finally defeat al Qaeda until he is finally captured or killed,"" McChrystal told the Senate Armed Services Committee. But he said if bin Laden is hiding across the border, ""It is outside of my mandate."" In addition, he said, pushing back the Taliban -- which allowed al Qaeda to operate from Afghanistan before 9/11 -- is a ""prerequisite"" for destroying the terrorist network. ""To pursue our core goal of defeating al Qaeda and preventing their return to Afghanistan, we must disrupt and degrade the Taliban's capacity, deny their access to the Afghan population, and strengthen the Afghan security forces,"" he said. McChrystal's appearance before senators was his second round of testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, following a session with the House Armed Services Committee earlier in the day. Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, joined him in both hearings. Both men were called to testify about President Obama's new plan for the Afghan war, which involves the deployment of another 30,000 U.S. troops and a July 2011 date for the beginning of an American withdrawal. McChrystal said the next 18 months will be ""critical"" to the war effort and said U.S. forces must convince Afghans that ""we are going to win."" The United States and its NATO allies must reverse the Taliban's actual and perceived momentum and establish ""contiguous security"" around the country rather than the pockets that currently exist, McChrystal said. One advantage U.S. troops have is that the Taliban -- which ruled most of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks -- remain largely unpopular among Afghans and draw support only through the threat of violence. ""I have never seen evidence that the Taliban have popular support like a political liberation movement,"" he said. In August, the general had cautioned that a failure to reverse Taliban gains within 12 months could make defeating the insurgents impossible. But his testimony Tuesday lengthened that timeline. ""The sober fact is that there are no silver bullets,"" he told the House committee. ""Ultimate success will be the cumulative effect of sustained pressure."" McChrystal said he ""participated fully in the president's assessment and decision-making process"" and fully supports Obama's decision. And Eikenberry, whose leaked cables to Washington indicated that he opposed sending large numbers of troops to the conflict, told the Senate he is ""100 percent"" behind the new strategy ""with the refinement of the mission."" His initial questions, Eikenberry told the House, were about the number of troops, the timeline for those troops, and the context in which those troops would operate. ""The mission was refined, the ways forward were clarified, and the resources now have been committed to allow us to achieve the refined mission,"" said the ambassador, a retired general who held a senior post in Kabul before retiring from the Army. ""With that, at this point in time ... I am unequivocally in support of this mission and I am exactly aligned with Gen. McChrystal in moving forward now to vigorously implement the assigned mission."" Both Eikenberry and McChrystal went out of their way to minimize the differences in their views after reports of an Eikenberry cable advising the president that McChrystal's plans to send more troops would be ill advised because of a lack of confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In their opening statements, both said they were honored to testify together and each called the other a friend. But more of those differences were seen when the men gave their predictions about the final outcome of the war. ""I believe we will absolutely be successful,"" McChrystal responded when the committee chairman, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, asked the general point-blank about the chances for success of the U.S. mission. Earlier, in his opening remarks, the general had said, ""The mission is not only important, it is also achievable. We can and will accomplish this mission."" Eikenberry was more cautious, saying that ""success is not guaranteed but it is possible."" But McChrystal emphasized that the July 2011 date is only a marker in the broader picture, and not a ""major factor"" in U.S. military strategy. ""I don't view July 2011 as a deadline. I don't believe it is a deadline at all,"" he told lawmakers, later adding that he assumed a U.S. troop withdrawal will begin at that time. ""It is a solid decision the president has made and I operate under the assumption that we will begin to decrease our forces beginning in July 2011,"" the general said. McChrystal said that the influx of additional troops should bring ""significant progress"" in the war by next summer, and by next December he should be able to ""lay out progress"" and show evidence of success in a report he will present. ""My expectation is the insurgency will be less robust in the summer of 2011, significantly so, and it is also my expectation that the Afghan security forces will be more robust,"" McChrystal said. ""I see confidently in the summer of 2011 that beginning the reduction of forces will be appropriate, the pace and scope of which needs to be conditions-based on how strong is insurgency at that point."" He said the Taliban must not become ""an existential threat"" to the Afghan government, ""and thus to the Afghan people."" ""So rather than wipe out every Taliban member, what we need to do is lower their capacity to the point where -- within their own means -- Afghanistan can hold them from being a major threat to either their way of life or their government. ""I think that, over time, that will cause the Taliban to go away, to become irrelevant, and cease to exist,"" he explained. At present, 68,000 U.S. troops are operating under both NATO and U.S. commands in Afghanistan, and around 42,000 non-U.S. forces are under NATO. The Pentagon announced 1,500 more Marines would be deploying this month as part of the new strategy. Last week, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that Britain, Italy, Poland, Slovakia and non-NATO member Georgia are among at least 25 countries offering to send a total of 7,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: ""I don't think we can finally defeat al Qaeda"" without getting bin Laden, McChrystal says .

"(CNN) -- Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi and their wives were placed in a ""safe house"" for their own welfare, but they have not been arrested, Iranian government sources told CNN Saturday. ""The opposition movement is very much looking for martyrs so if this is true it's for their own safety,"" one source told CNN. The pro-reform opposition movement ""is always looking for an excuse to create something, so this may be done to keep someone from doing something to them,"" the source added. But the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran expressed concern for the safety of the leaders and their wives. ""Moussavi and Karrubi and their wives have been disappeared; they are being held incommunicado in an unknown location, a severe breach of Iranian and international law,"" Aaron Rhodes, a spokesman for the campaign, said in a statement. ""Given the lynch mob-like calls for their execution by numerous Iranian politicians and clerics, there is reason to be deeply concerned for their safety and well-being,"" Rhodes said. State-run Press TV aired video of Iranian lawmakers earlier this month chanting, ""Moussavi, Karrubi ... execute them."" The human rights organization also pointed out that ""a 'safe house' is considered a place for the secret detention of high security-value detainees, which is not under the control of the judiciary or any other monitoring mechanisms. The Revolutionary Guards and Iranian intelligence agencies are well-known for using safe houses for all methods and techniques to get confessions from detainees without scrutiny or pressure from other legal bodies."" ""Given the use of so-called safe houses to mistreat opponents of the government in the past, the campaign finds it deeply disturbing that Moussavi and Karrubi have reportedly been removed to such a facility,"" the statement said. Iranian authorities began rounding up many government opponents this month amid calls for protests like those that have swept across North Africa and the Middle East. Iranian leaders have praised the revolution that overthrew Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, but when protesters in Iran took to the streets of Tehran on February 14, the government cracked down hard. The Iranian government rounded up activists ahead of the protests after Karrubi and Moussavi called for supporters to gather at Azadi Square -- the site of mass protests by Iran's opposition movement after the disputed 2009 presidential elections. Despite the security crackdown, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched in Tehran. Dozens of demonstrators were detained during those protests, while videos posted on YouTube showed others had been chased and beaten. One person was shot and killed during the protests, according to Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency. Several others were injured and listed in serious condition as a result of the shooting, which the Iranian government blamed on ""agitators and seditionists."" The Iranian government source claimed Saturday that Iranians are disturbed by the opposition's demonstrations. ""The people are not happy with these protests and these people (Moussavi and Karrubi) making announcements for more protests. The people believe their peace is being disrupted and they want these protests to stop,"" the source said. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday accused Iran of a repressive crackdown on protesters and political opponents in the past 10 days, including the killing of peaceful demonstrators by security forces. International journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran, where the government has cracked down on the media and maintains tight control of state-run news organizations. During the protests earlier this month, foreign journalists were denied visas, accredited journalists living in the country were restricted from covering the demonstrations, and internet speed slowed to a crawl in an apparent attempt to restrict information from being transmitted out of the country.","Iranian government sources say the ""safe house"" is for the leaders' welfare .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Three Japanese lawmakers were denied entry at a South Korean airport Monday after they announced they would attempt a visit to an island near disputed territory in what Korea calls the East Sea and Japan calls the Sea of Japan. The lawmakers arrived at Gimpo International Airport near Seoul at 11:20 a.m. but were denied entry by the immigration service, according the Ministry of Justice. The trio is expected to return to Japan on a later flight, but details were not yet available, the Ministry of Justice said. The Japanese politicians announced they would visit Ulleung Island -- adjacent to the disputed Dokdo islets -- after the two countries clashed over a civilian aircraft running a test flight over the area. The islets in the sea to the east of Korea, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan, have been a prickly issue for both countries. Japan has long claimed the islets as its territory, but Seoul said all Korean territory was returned after the country won independence from colonial rule by Japan in 1945. The South Korean Foreign Ministry warned Friday that the government would not allow the three politicians to enter the country, saying it cannot guarantee the safety of the lawmakers and that the decision is out of consideration of bilateral relations. Monday's visit is widely viewed as an act of protest by right-wing politicians after the two countries clashed over the islets last month. The Japanese government issued a ban on flying with South Korea's flagship airline, advising Japanese officials to refrain from flying with Korean Air in July. Korean Air had conducted a test flight over the islets twice to celebrate the launching of its new aircraft in June. Seoul demanded Tokyo withdraw the ban, but with no success. South Koreans view the islets as a source of national pride and have taken various measures to reassert its ownership of the islets. The land is largely uninhabited with only seven registered residents.","The politicians announce their intent to visit an island near disputed territory .

"(CNN) -- Retired army Gen. Otto Perez Molina won Sunday's runoff presidential election in Guatemala, seizing on voters' concerns about growing insecurity in the Central American nation. Perez Molina led with more than 53% of the vote, Guatemala's election authority said. His opponent, businessman Manuel Baldizon, garnered 46% of the vote. ""I want to tell you that we are happy, that we are very excited by this decision, but at the same time we have a big responsibility not to fail the Guatemalans in the next four years,"" Perez Molina told a crowd of cheering supporters. Perez Molina said unity across party lines would be a key step in solving the country's security problems. ""Let's put these elections behind us ... and come together in the the things we have in common, to pull Guatemala out of this crisis that we are living,"" he said. In Guatemala City Monday, Perez Molina's supporters celebrated the news. ""I am very happy because we are going to have a change in our country,"" Jazmin Dominguez said. Perez Molina, a retired army general who pledged to take a tough stand on crime, was the front-runner heading into the election. He won the most votes in the first round of voting in September. Low voter turnout was reported in Sunday's election, according to the state-run AGN news agency. Concerns about violence in Guatemala, which has worsened as Mexican drug cartels have stepped up operations in parts of the country, dominated the vote. In a Vox Latina national survey in July, more than two-thirds of Guatemalans said violence was what concerned them most, far outpacing the combined totals for the economy, unemployment, poverty and lack of education. ""Let's hope that it's not like it's been with the government in the past, that they aren't just lies. The truth is that it's important that we return our country to the right path. We need security, education, health. We really hope the new president does all this,"" Guatemala City resident Juan Diego said Monday. Campaign posters for Perez Molina, who led in polls before Sunday's election, featured a clenched fist. The 60-year-old retired general pledged to bring a ""mano dura"" -- firm hand -- to Guatemala's highest office. In a debate co-hosted by CNN en EspaÃ±ol this year, Perez Molina called for ""elite units of the army"" to play a larger role in the nation's battle against gangs and drug cartels. But that proposed approach -- and Perez Molina's high rank in the military during Guatemala's decades-long civil war -- worries human rights groups both in Guatemala and abroad. Concerns stem from the fact that the Guatemalan military committed multiple atrocities during the civil war, though Perez Molina has never been directly implicated in any of them. The former general campaigned for president a second time this year. He was defeated in 2007 by incumbent President Alvaro Colom. First-time candidate Baldizon, 41, who ran under the banner of the Leader Party, energized young voters. He promised to continue social and economic programs that he warned would be at risk, if Perez Molina won. Like the former general, Baldizon championed a crime-fighting plan. Poverty is endemic in Guatemala, and the country has one of the worst crime rates in Latin America. Forty-three percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished. And the murder rate last year was 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world. While supporters praised his tough stance on crime, others said they feared the president-elect's platform did not adequately address poverty. ""I think that he is going to make a government of the rich. I do not think that they are thinking about the poor and they are going to leave us forgotten again,"" Guatemala City resident Nelson Guzman said. This is only the fourth time that Guatemala has held presidential elections since peace accords were signed in 1996, officially ending a civil war that devastated the country for 36 years. The conflict left more than 100,000 people dead and a million refugees. Perez Molina will take office in January.","President-elect: ""We have a big responsibility not to fail the Guatemalans""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Archaeologists excavating a site in East London have made an ""extremely rare and unprecedented"" find -- a delicately detailed dish made of hundreds of pieces of tiny glass petals, the Museum of London Docklands announced Wednesday. The dish unearthed after about 2,000 years. The ""millefiori"" dish (the name means ""thousand flowers"") was found buried in the grave of a Roman Londoner, the museum said. Based on the other grave goods found at the site, archaeologists believe the person buried there was wealthy, the museum said. The dish was highly fragmented when archaeologists unearthed it, the museum said, but it had been held together over the centuries by the earth around it. A conservator at the museum reassembled the dish, which is now on display at the Museum of London Docklands. ""Piecing together and conserving such a complete artifact offered a rare and thrilling challenge,"" said conservator Liz Goodman, who did the work. ""We occasionally get tiny fragments of millefiori, but the opportunity to work on a whole artifact of this nature is extraordinary. The dish is extremely fragile but the glasswork is intact and illuminates beautifully nearly two millennia after being crafted."" The glass petals are blue with white borders and are each indented. They were originally embedded in opaque red glass, the museum said, and while the red coloring has diminished across most of the dish, it can still be seen around the edge. ""The complexity of its manufacture indicates that the dish was a highly-prized and valuable item,"" the museum said in a statement. Such beautifully crafted vessels were in vogue in the 1st and early 2nd centuries, the museum said. Dating is under way to determine the precise period of the find. The excavations that uncovered the dish are part of an ongoing dig at the extensive eastern cemetery of Roman London, which was then called Londinium. The site now lies in the neighborhood of Aldgate. The cemetery -- which, by law, lay outside the city walls -- spanned more than 400 years of Roman occupation from the late 1st to early 5th centuries, the museum said.","Archaeologists in London find rare, valuable dish at Roman cemetery .

"(EW.com) -- Although the tower in question in the gimcrack action comedy ""Tower Heist"" is fictional, many New York tourists will recognize the aggressive nouveau-riche opulence of the building's exterior as that of an actual Manhattan hotel condominium owned by aggressive nouveau-riche Donald Trump. The aesthetic pairing of The Donald and director Brett Ratner is a natural. This brassy production, an imitation ""Ocean's 13Â½,"" features the name-brand talents of Ben Stiller (as an honorable Tower manager named Josh) and Eddie Murphy (as a con man called Slide) leading rookie thieves in an elaborate Robin Hood-style heist. Their target? The oversize penthouse of one Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), a shady billionaire who keeps a rare 1963 Ferrari in his living room. In other words, ""Tower Heist"" is the cinematic version of a Trump property: overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky. For a movie that claims its heart is with the masses -- the 99 percent! -- there's an awful lot of production-design admiration lavished on the trappings of the effin-rich 1 percent. (Ratner had specific ideas about which pedigreed modern-art reproductions he wanted on the walls.) Shaw is a fictional variation on Bernie Madoff: Entrusted with the retirement savings of the multicultural low-wage employees who keep the Tower running, he takes their money and ruins their lives. And so, rallied by egalitarian friend-to-all Josh -- the guy takes the subway to work from Queens, so you know he's a mensch -- and hastily educated in criminal technique by Josh's less honorable Queens neighbor Slide, these blue-collar little people rise up in triumph to steal their money back. By the moral standards of Occupy Hollywood, the crime earns an ethical thumbs-up. You may think I am picking too much on what's built to be a fun, diverting, New York-state-of-mind caper comedy -- a joke-filled cavalcade that marks 50-year-old Eddie Murphy's welcome return to the edgier stuff that made him famous. Alrighty, let's talk about Murphy: He's nowhere to be found in the first half of the movie! And he's only there to illuminate selected scenes in the second: He's like the spot lighting supplied by a big-a** chandelier in an ostentatious Trump lobby. That's too bad, because when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor -- reminiscent of Chris Tucker's jive-talk mania in Ratner's ""Rush Hour"" movies but with a blast of Murphy-specific danger -- gooses the movie's energy level. I've missed that guy. But whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other to the rest of the cast. Josh's drippy in-house recruits include Matthew Broderick as a broke ex--Wall Streeter and Tower resident (and the kind of fretful nebbish he perfected on Broadway in The Producers); Michael PeÃ±a as an uncouth rookie bellhop; and ""Ocean""'s alumnus Casey Affleck as an unreliable concierge who happens to be Josh's stressed-out brother-in-law. (The band of gentlemen credited with the story and screenplay includes Ted Griffin, who worked on Steven Soderbergh's 2001 ""Ocean's Eleven."") Two female characters also join the increasingly frantic male-driven mayhem. (Here's where I mention with an eye roll that, in what I hope is a quickly passing trend in male- as well as female-driven comedies, vaginas are briefly discussed, this time by Affleck.) TÃ©a Leoni, who worked with the director 11 years ago in ""The Family Man,"" gamely plays a no-nonsense FBI agent with cute rough edges. And Gabourey Sidibe, the striking plus-size Oscar-nominated star of ""Precious,"" makes her Hollywood leap as a feisty Jamaican chambermaid who gets in on the heist action. (The girl's got mad safecracking skills.) I don't know why Ratner and cinematographer Dante Spinotti felt compelled to push the camera in close, as if gawking at Sidibe's dramatic coloring and size. But then, I also don't know why she wasn't used more: Murphy never looks more alive and excited by a fellow actor -- challenged to peak performance -- than during ribald, flirtatious banter with Sidibe's self-possessed working girl. She's something new; Murphy in ""Tower Heist"" is something rebooted. Together they build something with more visual interest than any Trump Tower on any tourist map. EW.com rating: C+ .

"(ArsTechnica) -- Amazon has clarified that the next generation of its 3G Kindle, the Kindle Touch 3G, will not be able to browse the Internet without a WiFi connection. Users will still be able to use 3G to sync book and document purchases, but anything beyond Wikipedia will be off-limits. Browsing was (and still is) an experimental feature on the last iteration of the Kindle, now known as the Kindle Keyboard 3G. The experiment appears to have failed as far as Amazon is concerned, as it will restrict the 3G access of the Kindle Touch 3G to browsing Wikipedia and downloading books and periodicals. The Kindle Touch 3G's webpage does not directly note this restriction, stating only that it has ""free 3G wireless"" that ""works globally,"" but a post in the official Amazon forums states that ""experimental web browsing (outside of Wikipedia) on Kindle Touch 3G is only available over WiFi."" Since Amazon subsidizes all Kindle owners' 3G use, the company may have determined the model isn't cost-effective enough to support the use of the entire Internet. The 3G version of the Kindle Touch with special offers costs $149, 50 percent more than the $99 WiFi version, so this restriction may make the jump from WiFi to 3G much harder for customers to justify when both models become available November 21. The announcement doesn't affect the new Kindle Fire announced last week and due for launch November 15, since it is WiFi-only. The Kindle Keyboard 3G, while it is still available, will continue to have unfettered Internet access through the experimental browser. We asked Amazon for confirmation of this policy, but have not received a response as of yet. COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM .","The new Kindle Touch 3G will have limited access to the Internet .

"(CNN) -- It's the worst-kept secret since Adam Lambert's sexuality: Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone on Tuesday. There are a bunch of reasons you already knew this. For one, every tech journalist on earth has been writing about the new-now-next-generation iPhone since the company's last ""Jesus phone"" -- the iPhone 4 -- graced us with its presence in June 2010. You've seen the gossip here, and on countless Apple-focused blogs with apt and obvious names like MacRumors and TheAppleBlog. The rumor mill, you'll likely recall, revved to full throttle in early September when CNET reported that an Apple employee lost a prototype of the next iPhone -- likely called the iPhone 5 -- in a Mexican restaurant and bar in San Francisco. To cap it all off, Apple sent out an e-mail on September 27 teasing reporters with phone-related pictures and this not-so-cryptic tagline: . ""Let's talk iPhone."" So, yeah, we pretty much know what's coming. And at the same time, we don't. The tech specs of the new phone are still hotly debated, as reporters scour Apple patents, SKU codes and, of course, Bay Area bars for any remaining iPhone-rumor morsels sure to grab the public's attention. All will become clear at 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday when Apple hosts its iPhone ""launch"" event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. But for those of you who are drooling for the details, here's the wisdom du jour from the People of the Internet: . -- The phone will be called the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4S. Or both (see below). -- It likely will cost $200 with a 2-year wireless service contract from AT&T or Verizon. -- The iPhone may come to Sprint, too. The Wall Street Journal was reporting Monday that Sprint Nextel has entered into an eye-opening agreement with Apple to buy more than $20 billion worth of iPhones over the next four years. (But the phone won't be coming yet to T-Mobile, as Mark Milian reports). -- It will be ""skinnier, shorter and wider"" than before, according to Gizmodo, which is basing these assumptions on supposed leaked cases for the phone and on ""informed renderings."" -- PC World (irony noted) expects the iPad's faster processor to squeeze its way into the iPhone. -- The phone will have a ""teardrop"" back, meaning it's fatter at the top than the bottom, according to the blog This is My Next. The iPhone 4 is flat on both sides. -- It may have a ""world mode,"" meaning it could transition onto other cell networks easily. -- It will have an upgraded, 8-megapixel rear camera. -- It may employ new voice-recognition features, says Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. His evidence? That e-mail Apple sent to journalists: ""Let's talk iPhone."" Voice-recognition. Get it? -- It's possible Apple will unveil not one -- but TWO iPhones. -- If so, the second likely will be cheaper and will have less storage capacity. Some bloggers have taken to calling it the iCloud Phone, because it could tie in with Apple's new cloud-computing services. (Side note: Al Gore, an Apple board member, gave some credence to the second-iPhoners when he mentioned ""the new iPhones coming out next month"" during a speech in South Africa). -- Based on Apple's past iPhone release patterns, the phone (or phones) will likely go on sale later this month (most bloggers predict mid-October). Of course, as is the case with any Apple product, die-hard fans will buy whatever the new thing is -- no matter what it is exactly, and no matter how much it costs. The other mysteries surrounding the Tuesday event are all about Apple's leadership. This is the first product announcement for Apple -- the world's most valuable company -- under the direction of its new CEO, Tim Cook. There's speculation about whether Cook, who is reported to be a private person, will take center stage at the event or yield the spotlight to his deputies. And there are rumors that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who handed over the company to Cook in August following a medical leave of absence, will make an appearance at the event. It seems likely that Cook will run the show, and BusinessInsider and plenty of others expect as much. It wouldn't be the first time Cook helped with an Apple presentation -- he appeared onstage in January when the company unveiled an iPhone on Verizon's network -- but it would be his first time as headliner. But, like the rest of you, we'll just have to hang on until Tuesday -- when all these rumors get zapped with a dose of reality.","Apple is expected to debut a new iPhone on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a missing 10-month-old Missouri girl late Thursday indicated they are cooperating with detectives, counter to what police said earlier in the evening, a relative said. A woman who identified herself as Ashley Irwin, sister of Jeremy Irwin, read a statement on behalf of her brother and Deborah Bradley, parents of missing infant Lisa Irwin. ""We have never stopped cooperating with the police. We've been cooperative from day one and we continue to assist the police with the investigation,"" the statement said. ""The main goal has always been to find Lisa and bring her home. That remains the sole focus of the parents."" Ashley Irwin said the parents, who will release another statement Friday, wanted to thank police and the community for their efforts and prayers. Kansas City, Missouri, police Capt. Steve Young had said earlier that the pair had stopped assisting police in the investigation. ""I don't have to illustrate how that affects the investigation,"" Young said of the development. ""It speaks for itself."" Young, who said ""our door is always open"" to the parents, told reporters that there are no suspects in the case. Earlier Thursday, the parents told reporters about how they discovered Lisa to be missing. ""She's everything,"" Bradley said of Lisa. ""She's our little girl. She's completed our family, and she means everything to my boys. We need her home. I can't be without her."" Irwin urged anyone with information to call police. ""Anything, even the smallest information, could help lead to her return,"" he said. Lisa Irwin was last seen around 10:30 p.m. Monday, asleep in her crib, police said. They were called to the home at about 4 a.m. Tuesday. ""It appears the suspect entered/exited through a bedroom window,"" authorities said in a statement. ""Evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted."" Jeremy Irwin told reporters that he found Lisa missing when he got home from work. ""The front door was unlocked,"" he said Thursday. ""Most of the lights were on in the house, and the window in front was open -- all very unusual."" The couple claimed three cell phones were missing at their home, Young said, but the information has not turned up anything. Police have said the parents are not considered suspects in Lisa's disappearance. Young on Wednesday told reporters the family had been cooperative, but ""everything is still on the table. We haven't ruled anything out."" He said then that investigators ""really haven't developed any good, hard information that we can go forward with."" Nearly 50 tips have been received through a hotline, he said, but not all of them have been pursued, as some of them have been vague -- a person calling to report a child seat seen in a car, for instance. ""I know everybody's hearts are in the right place, but that's not anything we can do anything with,"" Young said. Police have conducted more than 300 ""knock-and-talks"" and searches of residences in the area, and more than 300 officers were searching for Lisa. There have been three searches of a wooded area near the family's home, he said. ""I promise you, if there's anything we think we can be doing, we've probably done it two or three times already,"" Young said. An Amber Alert was issued for Lisa early Tuesday but has been canceled. ""Although the investigation and search for Lisa Irwin continue, an active Amber Alert is no longer necessary in this case,"" police said. However, Lisa is still considered missing and endangered, according to authorities. Lisa is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, police said. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds. She was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. She has two bottom teeth, a small bug bite under her left ear and a ""beauty mark"" on her right outer thigh. She currently has a cold with a cough, police said.","NEW: Parents say they are cooperating with police, relative says .

"(CNN) -- An Arkansas TV station has officially replaced former weatherman Brett Cummins, a month after he was found in a tub next to a dead body, the station's news director said. KARK has named Keith Monahan, who had been working at KIAH in Houston, as its new chief meteorologist, said news director Rob Heverling. ""As soon as we watched Keith, we knew he was a very good fit,"" said Heverling. On the morning of August 7, Christopher Barbour said he awoke in his home outside Little Rock and found the body of 24-year-old Dexter Paul Williams in an empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain around his neck, a Maumelle Police Department report said. Cummins, 33, was asleep next to the corpse, whose head was lying behind the meteorologist's shoulder, Barbour told police, according to the report. The witness said that he awakened Cummins, who screamed after noticing Williams' discolored face and cold skin and ran to the living room, where he vomited next to the couch. Days later, Cummins resigned from his job at the Little Rock-based station, his attorney Mark Hampton said. Pulaski County Prosecuting Attorney Larry Jegley said Thursday that his office should know in the coming weeks if any charges will be filed in relation to Williams' death. The night before the incident, Williams and Cummins arrived together at Barbour's house, Barbour told police. Once there, the three had drunk alcohol and snorted illegal narcotics, though Barbour could not identify the drugs, according to the report. Maumelle police Lt. Jim Hansard said the manner of Williams' death remains ""undetermined."" He added that the medical examiner cited several contributing factors, including intoxication with methamphetamine and amphetamines. The investigation remains open, and there is ""no indication (from the medical examiner) in any way that there was a strangulation,"" said Hansard.","Keith Monahan to be KARK's new chief meteorologist, the station says .

"(CNN) -- American Amanda Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, won their appeals of their convictions in the killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher. Here is a guide to the Italian appeal process. On what grounds did Knox and Sollecito appeal their convictions for murder, sexual assault, possession of a weapon, interfering with a crime and theft? The defense sought to discredit DNA evidence linking the two of them to the killing, in which British exchange student Meredith Kercher's throat was slashed. Her partially clothed body was found in the house she shared with Knox in Perugia, a central Italian university town. Two experts argued that DNA evidence found on the knife used to kill Kercher and on her bra clasp was unreliable and contaminated by poor handling. Prosecutors in 2009 had said there were traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested Rudy Guede, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for the murder, could have been the sole killer. The case against Knox and Sollecito . Who made the decision? Eight jurors -- six members of the public and two judges -- decided the case. The judges take part and vote as part of the jury: their role is to guide but not to instruct the other jurors how to vote. The presiding judge, Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, who was also one of the jurors, read out the verdict. What were the possible rulings in the appeal? There were three possible outcomes for the defendants: . 1. Verdict is upheld: In this case, Knox and Sollecito would have continued serving their respective 26- and 25-year jail sentences. However, prosecutor Manuela Comodi had called for their sentences to be increased to life. 2. Verdict is overturned . 3. Verdict is partially overturned, with a decrease in sentence (verdicts can be upheld on some counts but not others; this would result in a decrease in their sentences, which is what happened). Does Monday's ruling mean the case is closed for good or could there be further appeals? There will most likely be appeals by the prosecution. Both the defense and prosecution can take their case to Italy's highest court. Both Knox and Sollecito returned to prison to complete paperwork and collect their belongings. But Knox was freed within an hour; CNN understands Knox will leave the country Tuesday morning. Knox, 24, need not remain in Italy pending a possible appeal by the prosecution. After the ruling, the judge has 90 days to write a report on why the court reached its conclusions. The parties then have 45 days to file an appeal to the High Court, which then must schedule it, according to Luiss University law professor Nicola Di Mario. So there'll be at least four months between the verdict and any possible High Court appeal. A High Court hearing would be very short and dependent on key technical issues and arguments, not a review of the actual trial itself, according to Di Mario. Where would an acquittal of just Knox and/or Sollecito have left the case of the other? That was the big question. The co-defendants appealed together, and while different verdicts could theoretically have been delivered for each of them, this was highly unlikely. A third person convicted of the murder, Rudy Guede, has already appealed to the High Court and had his sentence reduced to 16 years. Can the defendants ever be tried again for the same crime? After the case goes to Italy's highest court and assuming it does not overturn the appeals ruling, Knox cannot be tried again for the same crime under the ""double jeopardy"" rule. What will happen if a possible appeal by the prosecution to Italy's highest court is successful after Knox has returned to the United States? If Italy's highest court overturns the lower court's decision, it effectively revalidates the trial court's sentence, which means 26 years in prison for Knox. Italy would then have to put in a request to U.S. authorities for extradition, and it would remain to be seen if that would granted or not. Deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told CNN: ""Questions regarding Italian law and process are not ones we can answer. They need to be addressed to Italian authorities. ""The United States and Italy do have a bilateral extradition treaty, which has been in force since 1984. Questions about possible return to the U.S., extradition request, etc. are too speculative for us to be able to comment."" Does Italian law allow for any civil action by the defendants or by Meredith Kercher's family following a criminal case? Yes, a civil action for damages took place alongside the original criminal trial. The family of Kercher sought $36 million in damages from the three co-defendants if they were convicted on the criminal charges. Their acquittal on the criminal charges frees them of civil liability as well. Did the defendants face any other charges? Knox also appealed an additional charge for which she was convicted: Defamation of Patrick Lumumba, the club owner whom Knox accused of killing Kercher. He was arrested but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. The appeals jury upheld that conviction and ordered Knox to pay Lumumba. It also sentenced her to three years in prison, but because she has already been held for four years, she was freed immediately. Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Defense worked to discredit DNA evidence linking defendants to killing of Meredith Kercher .

"(CNN) -- A Texas man convicted of murdering a San Antonio police officer before turning his gun on his wife was put to death Thursday evening, soon after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his last-minute appeal. The time of death for Frank Martinez Garcia was 7:02 p.m. CT (8:02 p.m. ET), said Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokeswoman Becky Blanton. Garcia was 28 on March 29, 2001, when San Antonio police officer Hector Garza responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at the home Garcia shared with his parents, his wife, Jessica, and their children. Garza, 49, died first after being shot three times by Garcia, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said on its website. Garcia's wife died after he shot her six times. He also fired several shots at others outside the home, wounding his wife's uncle, according to authorities. The couple's 5-year-old daughter witnessed the murders, according to the Department of Criminal Justice. The office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott stated, on its website, that Garcia -- who had been arrested with gang members in 1992 -- also fired his weapon at the vice principal of a nearby elementary school, hitting the front door of the school. Garcia eventually surrendered to police, later admitting in a formal written statement that he had intentionally killed both the police officer and his wife, according to the attorney general. A Bexar County grand jury indicted him in September 2001 for capital murder. During his trial, jurors saw photos from inside Garcia's home showing him and his wife brandishing weapons. Prosecutors also noted that his wife Jessica sought help from a battered women's shelter in 1994, after alleging physical and emotional abuse, while her co-workers had seen marks and bruises on her. In February 2002, Garcia was convicted and sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction two years later. And in 2007, the same court denied his application for habeas corpus relief -- in other words, claiming the state didn't have a right to hold him -- according to the attorney general. A U.S. district court turned down a similar petition in 2009, and a U.S. Circuit of Appeals court rejected his appeal the following year. In March 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court denied his writ of certiorari review, a legal term related to a higher court reviewing a lower court's decision.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's floodwaters inched toward downtown Bangkok Saturday, threatening some subway stations as leaders urged residents not to open defenses set up to divert the waters from the capital. At least six subway stations are on the floodway, authorities said. Residents have threatened to open the defenses to drain water from their flooded neighborhoods, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said. ""The main problem of solving flood is no longer technical but people,"" Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said during the weekly radio address. The flooding has killed 442 people, the Interior Ministry said. Of Thailand's 64 provinces, 25 have been affected. Bangkok's central business district is still dry but other parts of the bustling metropolis of 12 million people are inundated. The flooding has had an enormous business impact as many factories and offices have been under water for more than a month. Affected businesses include Hi Tech Industrial Park, where Canon and Sony own assembly plants. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Interior Ministry: Flooding has killed 442 people .

"(CNN) -- Cholera has already killed almost 3,000 Haitians. Now it is threatening to cause misery in another vital way. A chunk of Haiti's rice harvest will probably be lost because of farmers' fears of cholera contamination, the United Nations said Wednesday. On top of that, consumers are afraid to buy rice grown in areas affected by the cholera outbreak. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the Haitian Ministries of Agriculture and Health are providing hygiene information to farmers who are reluctant to step into rice paddies, fed by rivers and canals, to harvest the crops. The U.N. food agency, concerned that lost crops may lead to food shortages, urged more outreach and hands-on training in rural communities. The effects of the cholera outbreak were magnified by floods in November caused by Hurricane Tomas. ""Without a timely response to the damage caused by floods and cholera to Haitian agriculture, food security could plunge, worsening the effects of last January's earthquake on the poor rural population,"" the FAO said in a statement. Cholera has sickened more than 130,000 people in Haiti and 2,761 have died. But those numbers from the Haitian health ministry are from December 18. Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF or Doctors Without Borders), which has been operating cholera treatment centers throughout Haiti, warned that the disease is still spreading. Symptoms of the acute, bacterial illness, which is caused by drinking tainted water, can be mild or even nonexistent. But sometimes they can be severe: leg cramps, profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration, shock and death. Some aid groups, including MSF, have criticized the cholera response in Haiti as woefully inadequate, given the fact that about 12,000 aid groups operate within the country. ""I recently went to Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and found my Medicins Sans Frontieres colleagues overwhelmed, having already treated more than 75,000 cholera cases,"" MSF International President Unni Karunakara wrote in a commentary published this week in a British newspaper, the Guardian. ""In the 11 months since the quake, little has been done to improve sanitation across the country, allowing cholera to spread at a dizzying pace.""","Farmers are afraid to harvest in paddies they believe are contaminated .

"(CNN) -- Up to 30 million people are facing ""a humanitarian disaster"" as one of Africa's biggest lakes shrinks, a United Nations agency warned Thursday. Porters remove goods from a boat on Lake Chad in 2007. Lake Chad was about the size of Maryland -- bigger than Israel or Kuwait -- in 1963, satellite images show. By 2001, it covered less than one-fifth of that area -- making it smaller than Delaware or Mauritius. The drying-up of the shallow lake is fueling conflict and migration, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said. Once one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, it could disappear entirely in about 20 years, the FAO said, citing forecasts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ""If that happens it's going to be a disaster,"" Parviz Koohafkan, director of the Land and Water Division of the FAO, told CNN by phone from Rome. The Lake Chad basin is ""one of the most important agriculture heritage sites in the world -- the biodiversity, the migratory birds, not to mention more than 20 million people living out of Lake Chad -- fisherpeople, farmers."" ""It would be a human disaster, a tragedy,"" he said. ""In this case we have people who are the poorest of the poor."" ""In addition to an approximately 60 percent decline in fish production, there has been degradation of pasturelands, leading to a shortage of animal feed estimated at 45 percent in certain places in 2006, reduction in livestock and biodiversity,"" the agency said. The disappearance of the lake is being caused by climate change, population pressure and natural variations in climate, the FAO said. Two rivers which feed the lake, the Chari and Logone, have been significantly reduced in the past 40 years, the agency said. The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, ""Saving Lake Chad,"" in Rome, Italy, on Friday. ""Water transfer is not a new thing,"" Koohafkan told CNN. ""The major problem is that this is water transfer among different countries. ""These options cost money, and need policy work, need technical work,"" he said. ""Some kind of public-private partnership would be needed"" to pay for any solution as ambitious as diverting a river. The lake borders on Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, one of Africa's most populous countries. It measured about 25,000 square kilometers (9,652 square miles) in 1963 and 1,500 square kilometers (579 square miles) in 2001 -- just under 17 percent its size 38 years earlier. Lake Chad is only one of many inland bodies of water which are drying up. Similar warnings have been issued about lakes in Mexico, Russia and elsewhere.","Lake Chad could dry up in 20 years, U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization says .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- At least two car bombs exploded Friday near the television studios of Televisa in Ciudad Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas state in northeastern Mexico, authorities said. One blast occurred outside the TV station while the second happened next to the municipal transit service offices, said the state attorney general's office. No fatalities or injuries were reported. The nearly simultaneous blasts occurred shortly after midnight. The explosion in front of Televisa, a CNN affiliate, damaged the building and knocked out power on the block, the station said. The station also was knocked off the air locally, Televisa said. Images of one of the blasts show the carcass of a car, the explosion leaving only the vehicle's mangled frame but not causing much damage to nearby buildings or trees. The wreckage lies next to a wooden street pole that is slightly tilted and holds a stop sign. The car that exploded in front of the television studio was a red Chevrolet Corsica with Texas license plates, the attorney general's office said in a news release. The car in front of the transit office was a white Mazda, also with Texas license plates, officials said. Tamaulipas is the state where authorities discovered 72 bodies this week on a ranch believed to be used by narcotraffickers. Authorities are investigating whether the 58 men and 14 women, who were migrants from Central and South America, were killed by the Zetas cartel. Televisa previously came under attack August 15 when a grenade damaged apartments near the TV station's office in the city of Monterrey in neighboring Nuevo Leon state. There were no reports of injuries in that attack. A similar attack occurred the previous day, when a grenade was launched against the Televisa offices in the city of Matamoros, in Tamaulipas. The building was damaged but there were no reports of injuries. It was not clear Friday why Televisa is being targeted. Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon have become a bloody battleground between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, which ended an alliance earlier this year. The Zetas used to be the armed branch of the Gulf Cartel but have split off into a separate drug-trafficking organization. Journalists have come under increasing attack in Mexico, as drug cartels try to limit the information being distributed about their activities. The Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent, nonprofit organization, criticized this month's grenade attacks against Televisa. ""No journalist is safe in Mexico when criminal groups feel free to wage grenade attacks on a national broadcaster,"" said Carlos Lauria, the organization's senior program coordinator for the Americas. ""Drug traffickers are increasingly terrorizing the press and defining what is news and what isn't. We urge the Mexican authorities must fully investigate these incidents and bring those responsible to justice."" Eight journalists were killed in Mexico in 2009 and another eight have been killed so far this year, the Committee to Protect Journalists said this month. In total, 54 journalists and media workers have been slain in Mexico since 1992, the group said. Car bombings by Mexican cartels are a new phenomena. Among the first was a July 15 explosion in Ciudad Juarez that killed four people.","One car bomb targeted Televisa, a CNN affiliate .

"(Mental Floss) -- We all know about the Confederate states leaving the Union. But that was far from the only secessionist movement in American history. Here are some rebellious regions you won't find in too many history books. This map shows some rebellious regions that have tried to seceed from the United States. 1. The Kingdom of Beaver Island . Beaver Island, a small island in Lake Michigan, became the home of Mormon leader James Strang and his followers -- called Strangites -- in 1848. Two years later, Strang declared himself king of the church -- complete with crown, scepter, robe, and a harem of 15 wives. However, most of the island's inhabitants were his followers, so he essentially became King of Beaver Island. The power got to his head, and he began forcing his rule onto the non-believers, causing some violence between the two factions. In 1856, the USS Michigan pulled into the harbor and invited Strang aboard. As he was walking towards the ship, he was shot in the back by disgruntled followers, who then ran up the gangplank and escaped. Adding to the mysterious circumstances, the assassins were set ashore on nearby Mackinac Island and never charged for their crime. Shortly after the assassination, angry mobs from surrounding islands eventually forced the Strangites from their homes, thus ending the short-lived Kingdom of Beaver Island. 2. The state of Superior . Concern over a perceived lack of interest from the Michigan state government, the people of the Upper Peninsula (U.P.), affectionately known as ""Yoopers,"" have been trying to secede and form the State of Superior since as far back as 1897. The movement gained momentum after 1957 when a bridge connecting the U.P. region to Lower Michigan made it easier for southern ""Trolls"" (people who live ""below the bridge"") and Yoopers to mingle. This animosity continued into the mid-1980s, when 20,000 signatures were collected and submitted to the state for a secession request. However, the number was shy of the 36,000 required, and the request subsequently denied. The secessionist drive lives on today, as numerous grassroots organizations are trying to muster support for another official attempt at an independent U.P. Until that day comes, though, the Yoopers and Trolls will just have to try to get along. 3. The Great Republic of Rough and Ready . Rough and Ready, California, was a mining town founded in 1849 by the Rough and Ready Company of Wisconsin. As the town's population rapidly exploded to 3,000, lawlessness was on the rise -- and the U.S. government was not much help squelching the rampant crime. Mental Floss: Three controversial maps . Additionally, a new federal tax on mining operations added fuel to the region's civil unrest. Seeing little support from Washington, on April 7, 1850, the townspeople voted to secede from the Union. But just three months later, as the Fourth of July approached, The Great Republic of Rough and Ready wanted to have a celebration (which seems odd considering they were no longer technically Americans). When nearby Nevada City wouldn't sell liquor to ""foreign miners,"" it was decided that maybe America wasn't so bad after all. The townspeople voted themselves back into the Union on the very same day and the party went off as planned. 4. The Conch Republic . In the early-1980s, the U.S. Border Patrol set up a checkpoint at the entrance to the Florida Keys in an effort to stop illegal drugs and immigrants. The time to check everyone's identification at the checkpoint resulted in a 20-mile traffic jam that turned tourists away, thus damaging the economy in the Keys. After numerous legal attempts to have the checkpoint removed, on April 23, 1982, Key West mayor Dennis Wardlow declared the Florida Keys were seceding from the Union. Moments later, now-Prime Minister Wardlow symbolically declared war on the U.S. by breaking a stale piece of Cuban bread over the head of a man dressed in a U.S. Navy uniform. One minute later, Wardlow turned to the Admiral in charge of the U.S. Naval Base at Key West and surrendered, thus ending the Conch Republic's Civil Rebellion. He then immediately asked for $1 billion in federal aid to help rebuild his war-torn nation's economy. While officially the Republic only existed for one minute, the tongue-in-cheek spirit of the rebellion lives on. Today you can buy Conch Republic citizen and diplomatic passports (both of which have been used for international travel, though they are not intended to be official documents) and even an official flag of the republic (complete with the awesome motto, ""We seceded where others failed""). The community has even minted a series of limited edition one-conch dollar coins that can be used as legal tender while in the Keys. 5. The State of Absaroka . Feeling that the Democratic southern half of Wyoming was not working in conjunction with the rest of the state, a secessionist movement was launched by northern Republicans in 1939 to create a new state that would better serve its more conservative population. This state, Absaroka -- so named after the nearby mountain range -- was to be made up of northern Wyoming, southeast Montana, and the western region of South Dakota. While the secessionist movement was never very large or pursued through legal channels, that didn't stop A. R. Swickard, the street commissioner of Sheridan, Wyoming, from appointing himself governor of the ""state."" The movement went so far as to press Absaroka license plates and crown a Miss Absaroka beauty queen. Absaroka could even brag about a visit from a foreign dignitary, King Haakon VII of Norway (though he was officially visiting Wyoming and just happened to be in Absaroka). Despite all of the hoopla, the state never came to be, and now, so many years later, the intent of the secessionist movement is in question. Some believe there was a genuine attempt to create a new state, while others say it was just a fun way for cowboys to distract themselves during tough economic times. 6. The State of Jefferson . Northern California and southern Oregon have been trying to merge since 1852. The attempts have been met with mixed results, though the ""State of Jefferson"" movement of 1941 came closest to making it happen. The region felt it was being ignored by their respective state legislatures, so in response the people created the ""State of Jefferson Citizen's Committee"" to explore the possibilities of secession. The group began stopping cars on Highway 99 to hand out the state's ""Proclamation of Independence,"" a pamphlet outlining the grievances they held and the solutions they proposed. To help rally their cause, they developed a state flag made up of a gold miner's pan with two black X's inside, representing the double-cross they felt the Oregon and California state governments had pulled. Mental Floss: Thomas Jefferson . On December 4, 1941, Judge John Childs was elected governor of Jefferson in the state's temporary capital of Yreka, California. The event was filmed by numerous newsreel companies who were set to air the footage during the week of December 8. History had other plans, as the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor the day before the big premiere. Driven by a sense of national obligation, the Jefferson secession was put aside and never really regained momentum. While the official movement might have died out, the residents of this region still hold the concept in their hearts, with many identifying themselves even today as the population of the great state of Jefferson. 7. The McDonald Territory . Noel, Missouri, located in McDonald County in the far southwest corner of the Show Me State, has been a popular tourist destination for many years. Therefore, when the Missouri State Highway Commission left Noel off their annual ""Family Vacationland"" map in 1961, the region was not happy pleased. To display their dissatisfaction, McDonald County drew up papers of secession and presented them to the state legislature, declaring itself the independent McDonald Territory. The county went so far as to elect officials, form a territorial militia, and even printed up visas that were issued to visitors so they could travel throughout the territory. Perhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of McDonald Territory stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area. While most agree that the secession was done purely for publicity, the state of Missouri wasn't necessarily happy about the type of publicity it was garnering. So in order to end this mock rebellion, the state declared that state employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for McDonald County, all current state employees would be fired, and all state funding would be withheld. Needless to say, McDonald Territory surrendered and returned to being simply McDonald County, Missouri, once again. And here's one more secessionist movement that's been in the news this year. From 1995 to 2002 (except for a few months in 2000), Alaska's First Dude Todd Palin was a member of the Alaska Independence Party. Fellow Mental Floss writer Jeff Fleischer has the story on the AIP: . 8. Alaska . For decades, a well-organized separatist movement has campaigned to turn America's largest state into its own nation. The bitterness dates back to 1958, when Alaska's citizens were given a simple yes-or-no vote on statehood. Many Alaskans felt they were denied more options on the issue, prompting a land developer named Joe Vogler to organize a re-vote that would offer Alaskans four possibilities -- remain a territory, become a state, take commonwealth status, or become a separate nation. Using the vote as his platform, Vogler ran for governor in 1974 -- and soon made a habit of it. With colorful slogans such as, ""I'm an Alaskan, not an American. I've got no use for America or her damned institutions,"" Vogler spearheaded the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP), and his campaign has twice topped 5 percent of the vote.  Mental Floss: Nine modern-day independence movements . More surprisingly, former U.S. interior secretary Wally Hickel got elected governor on the AIP ticket in 1990. Unfortunately for the party, Hickel only ran on the ticket because he lost the Republican primary. Never a supporter of the plebiscite idea, Hickel left the AIP and rejoined the Republicans in 1994. Today, the AIP continues to draw about 4 percent of voters statewide. And in 2006, Alaska took part in the first-ever North American Secessionist Convention, joining other groups from Vermont, Hawaii, and the South. As for Vogler, he was murdered in 1993 -- reportedly the result of an argument over a business deal. On a brighter note, honoring his wish to never be buried in U.S. soil, Vogler was laid to rest in Canada's Yukon Territory. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Ras Lanuf, Libya (CNN) -- The military forces of Moammar Gadhafi on Friday pounded Ras Lanuf, the key oil port once in the hands of rebel forces, with its leadership confidently vowing to retake all territory from the opposition despite growing international pressure. Even as it targeted its domestic enemies, the Tripoli government continued to parry with leaders around the globe. Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim, for instance, said Friday that Libya has suspended diplomatic relations with France, one day after the French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country. In Ras Lanuf, pro-Gadhafi forces cranked up an intense and steady bombardment of the city, believed to be by rocket, artillery and tank fire. A storage tank at an oil refinery was on fire after an air raid there. ""We saw a bomb fall about a kilometer to the southwest of the refinery, and moments later saw thick black smoke rising from the refinery. We don't know, and no one we spoke to could say with any level of certainty or veracity, what caused the fire,"" said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman. Dozens of pickup trucks and cars belonging to the opposition were heading away from the city amid fear that Libyan forces were advancing as the bombardment continued. The rebels evacuated to a checkpoint outside the town, but that and other rebel positions also were targeted by airstrikes. Rebels said the eastern city has been essentially empty as civilians fled and opposition forces retreated from sustained attacks. On Thursday, state media said the town was ""cleansed"" of the fighters. This reflects the turn in fortunes for Gadhafi's well-equipped military, which has gained an upper hand after rebel fighters seized ground across Libya. Along with its offensive in Ras Lanuf, government soldiers beat back rebels Thursday in Zawiya east of the capital, Tripoli. Zawiya's Martyrs' Square was littered with the bombed-out, scorched carcasses of army tanks and other military vehicles. Workers swept up the evidence as Gadhafi supporters chanted slogans and waved green flags. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, one of Gadhafi's sons and a spokesman for the regime, vowed Thursday to retake other areas in eastern Libya that were controlled by the opposition and warned the international community that Libyans won't welcome NATO and Americans. NATO is contemplating the establishment of a no-fly zone, but says it needs a clear U.N. mandate to do it. ""I receive hundreds of calls from the east daily, and they are saying, 'Save us.' They are begging us and pleading for us to save them, and my answer is two words. Listen to me, and I want those armed groups to listen to me real well, and I want our people in the east to hear this as well: We're coming,"" he said. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is one of two Moammar Gadhafi sons who share the first name Saif. On the diplomatic front, meanwhile, opposition to Moammar Gadhafi continues to gain momentum. U.S. President Barack Obama reiterated Friday that he wants the Libyan leader to ""step down."" He added that he ""won't take (the) decision lightly"" to decide whether to use military force, including helping enforce a no-fly zone, saying it is critical to ""balance costs versus benefits."" Obama noted that NATO officials will meet Tuesday to consider whether to implement a no-fly zone. He said U.S. actions so far, including freezing assets and other sanctions, are ""slowly tightening the noose"" on Gadhafi. ""We have moved about as swiftly as an international coalition has ever moved to impose sanctions,"" he said. The U.S. Treasury Department beefed up those sanctions Friday, freezing the assets of nine more individuals. Among them are the wife and four sons of Libya's leader, including Saadi, Hannibal, Muhammad and Saif Al-Arab Gadhafi. Libya's defense minister, military intelligence director, external security organization head and public works coordinator are also included. Also Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon introduced former Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib as his new special envoy to Libya. Khatib will leave New York over the weekend, accompanied by humanitarian and U.N. officials, to ""convey, in no uncertain terms, the concerns of the United Nations and the international community,"" Ban said. ""I (hope) that this effort ... will succeed in stopping the killings and ending the suffering of the civilian population, in addressing their humanitarian needs and in preserving the unity of the Libyan people and the territorial integrity of their homeland,"" Khatib said, adding that Gadhafi's government ""welcomed"" the visit. In Brussels, Belgium, the European Council, a body of the European Union, issued a declaration saying Gadhafi ""must relinquish power immediately."" ""His regime has lost all legitimacy and is no longer an interlocutor for the EU. The European Union has adopted restrictive measures against the country's leadership and against entities holding sizeable assets controlled by the regime and stands ready to adopt further sanctions. ""The objective is for Libya to rapidly embark on an orderly transition to democracy through a broad-based dialogue. The European Union welcomes and encourages the interim transitional national council based in Benghazi which it considers a political interlocutor."" Some members are clearer than others in their support for the National Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said in his news conference that ""we consider the National Council based in Benghazi as the proper interlocutors for Libya and they need to be recognized as such and encouraged."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel was more cautious in her approach to the council and called them a possible interlocutor. Sarkozy said the European Council decision is a very strong one, and he stressed that a U.N. mandate and a request from the region are needed for intervention. ""We are considering and examining all necessary options to deal with the situation,"" he said. ""We cannot stand by and watch this happen."" He wouldn't say whether France or Britain would take unilateral military action if a U.N. mandate wasn't achieved. British Prime Minister David Cameron said in Brussels that authorities are tightening ""the net"" on Gadhafi and ""his henchman"" with tougher financial sanctions. ""We have added the Libyan Central Bank and the Libyan Investment Authority to the Libyan EU asset freezing list and, in doing so, the UK has frozen a total of 12 billion pounds of Libyan assets,"" Cameron said. On Friday, the Libyan ambassador to the United States and to the United Nations will call on the United States to follow France's lead and recognize the opposition as the legitimate representative of Libya. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has announced plans to meet with opposition leaders when she visits Tunisia and Egypt next week. She said the United States was suspending relations with the Libyan Embassy in Washington, and an administration official added that the embassy ""must shut down."" Protests against the 68-year-old Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought his ouster after nearly 42 years of rule, and the discontent devolved into a fierce and bloody civil war. Death toll estimates earlier this week ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000. As of Thursday morning, the war had forced out nearly 250,000 people, many of them poor migrant workers who have been stranded at both the Tunisian and Egyptian borders, the U.N. refugee agency said.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Workers at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station returned to the plant Friday after a strong aftershock forced them to leave a day earlier, the plant's owner said. The quake forced crews at the plant to evacuate as it rattled northern Japan late Thursday night. They returned to the plant about eight and a half hours later, and no fresh damage to the facility had been reported Friday afternoon, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said. Before the quake, engineers had been injecting non-flammable nitrogen into the No. 1 reactor containment shell to counter a buildup of hydrogen in the chamber. That process continued while the plant was evacuated, and so did the pumping of fresh water into that reactor and units 2 and 3, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, a spokesman for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency. Hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the cores of the reactors, which plant workers have been struggling to keep under control since the earthquake and tsunami. The nitrogen injections are aimed at displacing oxygen in the reactor shell, reducing the possibility of an explosion -- a chance Tokyo Electric called ""extremely low."" A hydrogen explosion blew the roof and upper walls off the No 1. reactor building two days after the quake, and another blast two days later blew apart the No. 3 building. A suspected hydrogen explosion is believed to have damaged the No. 2 reactor on March 15 as well. Both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the U.S. Geological Survey have rated Thursday's quake a magnitude 7.1, though the Japanese initially rated it at 7.4. It was centered in the Pacific Ocean about 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of the plant, near the epicenter of the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that knocked out the plant's coolant systems four weeks ago Friday. It also caused radioactive water to spill from the spent fuel cooling pools of another nuclear power plant, Tohoku Electric's Onagawa plant, the Sendai-based utility and NISA reported Friday. About 15 liters (3.9 gallons) of water spilled, and the concentration of radioactive particles was far below levels that would pose an immediate threat to human health, the company said. The three reactors at the Onagawa plant, about 140 kilometers (88 miles) north of Fukushima Daiichi, shut down automatically when the March 11 earthquake struck and have not been restarted. Workers at Fukushima Daiichi have been struggling to keep the reactors from overheating for four weeks, pouring tons of fresh water an hour into the reactors and trying to contain the spread of radioactive contamination that has been pouring out. About 78,000 people who live within a 20-kilometer radius of the plant were ordered to leave their homes in the days following the quake, and another 62,000 within 20 to 30 kilometers have been told to remain indoors. But government readings show that people beyond the current restricted zone may be exposed to dangerous long-term doses of radiation even though the readings fall below levels that now require an evacuation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Thursday. Edano, the Japanese government's point man on the crisis, said the country may set standards for long-term radiation exposure that would effectively extend the evacuation zone around the damaged plant. ""It is time for the government to consider setting another category for accumulated exposure,"" Edano told reporters. ""The safety of the people is the first priority, and social needs come after that."" There is no timetable for a decision, Edano said. Readings released Thursday by the country's science ministry from areas outside that zone indicated that long-term exposure could top the government's one-time standards for an evacuation within a few months. Some of those are in towns to the northwest, where prevailing winds have blown radioactive particles released from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The recorded doses are far below those that would cause radiation sickness but could pose a long-term risk of cancer, according to medical experts. The anti-nuclear group Greenpeace and the International Atomic Energy Agency raised alarms about the spread of radioactivity beyond the 30-kilometer zone in late March. Hiroo Saso and Ailing Chang contributed to this report for CNN.","No damage has been reported from Thursday night's aftershock .

"(CNN) -- Zuccotti Park is not Tahrir Square, because the United States is not Egypt. In case this is not obvious to those camping out near Wall Street and in various other cities around the country, consider the following: In about 13 months, all 435 members of the House of Representatives must stand for election. In addition, 33 Senate seats and residency at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will be up for grabs. And this is just at the federal level. So if the ""Occupy Wall Street"" crowd wants to peacefully overthrow the government, there is no need to gather in a public square. The demonstrators can work for a candidate or run themselves. Unfortunately, those who are part of this movement seem to have dismissed this option. The New York group has produced a manifesto of sorts, entitled a ""Declaration of the Occupation of New York City."" Among the grievances listed (which they helpfully note are not ""all-inclusive"") is ""that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power."" So are we to conclude that since corporations control American politics, the best thing for us to do is to sit outside in a park and issue manifestos? Writing in the pages of CNN.com, Douglas Rushkoff chastises those of us who don't understand the point of all this, explaining that Occupy Wall Street is ""the product of the decentralized networked-era culture, it is less about victory than sustainability. It is not about one-pointedness, but inclusion and groping toward consensus."" Well, in the U.S., groups made up of disparate individuals ""network"" themselves together to make collective decisions all the time. We call it democracy. As for ""victory"" being exchanged for ""sustainability,"" how is it that these are interchangeable nouns? Political processes tend to be ongoing and aimed at ""sustainability."" Congress does not just take a vote and then dissolve. ""Victory,"" as Rushkoff terms it, is just a way of saying that we have reached a decision. It is probably not our first, and let's hope, not our last. And though it is not always pretty, President Barack Obama, U.S. House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Harry Reid spend most of their time ""groping toward consensus."" They must do so, however, in the real world, where people disagree. But let's get back to that idea about democracy not being possible because corporations run everything. This feeling, I think, is at the root of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Now, no one is going to say that money doesn't play a role in politics. It always has, and it always will. What does this mean? Well, if you want to influence the nation's politics you have to raise money. So raise some money. In this sense, Rushkoff is right to talk about how, in a networked and wired world, politics is different. It is now much cheaper to get your message out. Where 20 years ago a candidate would have to raise hundreds or thousands of dollars to fund a mass mailing, voters are now just a mouse click away. Not enough money to buy traditional advertising? There is the Internet -- Facebook and Twitter, for example. Ron Paul, hardly a favorite of corporate America, has managed to use this new technology to raise several million dollars in just a day. Technology has leveled the political playing field. Still, as they say about the lottery, you have to be in it to win it. So if you want to change America, you have to get in the game. But here's the rub: Occupations and rallies are fun. Electoral politics is hard. The rules are complex, and so are the voters. A gathering in the street has a lot in common with a party. Running for office and working for a candidate is like a 9 to 5 job. And getting involved in the political process forces you out of your comfort zone. Instead of hanging out with a few hundred -- or a few thousand -- people who basically agree with you, you have to confront and perhaps persuade those who don't agree with you. In the process, however, you will learn more about democracy then you will at any teach-in. So my suggestion to Occupy Wall Street and their affiliates throughout the country is to pay as much attention to their 15th Amendment right to vote as they do to their 1st Amendment right to peaceably assemble. In other words, get out of your sleeping bags and onto the ballot!

"(OPRAH.com) -- Can an innocent Christmas present plunge a normal family into consensual madness? Yes, it can, especially if the catalyst is a three-foot My Size Barbie, the first exceedingly popular toy that my daughter, Gaby, ever asked for insistently. Her obsession meant I ended up in some remote Toys ""R"" Us (in another state!) one Christmas Eve about ten years ago, vying with other desperately doting dads for the last few items on well-looted shelves. But I managed to bag my first Big Gift. The next morning, Gaby exuberantly unwrapped the My Size Barbie, immediately and inexplicably christening the doll Jessica Lynn Cohen. Why that oddly specific appellation, with its country-western triple cadence, we'll never know. It was Christmas, and it was her doll, and it stuck. Gaby and Jessica Lynn Cohen became instant BFFs. Gaby lent Jessica Lynn Cohen her clothes, they played school, hosted tea parties, went to the park, sat on the stoop together, reenacted scenes from Disney movies. But then came the inevitable cooling off. Kids tire of gifts. And they abruptly and blithely cast them into oblivion. No big deal. We put Jessica Lynn Cohen in the basement, in a spare room we use as a catchall storage space. Oprah.com: How to stretch your dollars this Christmas . In the beginning, we'd each move her around just to scare one another. But then she seemed to move around on her own. She'd appear in various rooms without anyone having touched her -- or at least without anyone admitting to having touched her. I'd go downstairs to attend to a blown fuse and there'd be Jessica Lynn Cohen in the boiler room. We'd find her in the pantry with her arms outstretched in a sort of pious Joan of Arc gesture of supplication or in the bathroom with one leg raised high over her head like a Folies Bergère dancer. Coming upon her this way could be frightening. She had taken on the stricken phantasmal look of a ghost from a shipwreck. She also started terrifying other people. I could always tell by the ashen face of some poor plumber or cable guy that he had accidentally stumbled upon Jessica Lynn Cohen in a dark corner of the house. So we decided to get rid of her. But very bad things happened to us whenever we tried to throw her out. Oprah.com: Get organized and tame the holiday madness . Within hours of the first time I left her out on the street for the garbage men, my wife, Mercedes, who'd never had a single related symptom, had a severe gallstone attack and needed to be rushed to the emergency room. I reluctantly brought Jessica Lynn Cohen back inside. A couple of months later, I was hit by a car as I crossed a street in Culver City, California. At the moment of impact, I did not have that common experience of seeing my life passing before my eyes; I had the unmistakable feeling that Jessica Lynn Cohen was angry. I called Mercedes and asked if anything unusual had occurred in the days preceding my accident. She admitted that she'd taken Jessica Lynn Cohen to the Salvation Army. Get her back, I said. We tried finding a new home for her. A friend -- a single guy without kids -- finally agreed to take her in. Within two weeks, he'd developed a pilonidal cyst and his brother in Florida was arrested for embezzlement. Our friend returned her and asked that we never again discuss her in his presence. We eventually had to reach an accommodation with Jessica Lynn Cohen and accept her as a permanent member of our family. She is now the unrivaled centerpiece of our Christmas tradition. On Christmas Eve we keep her in a special ""secret detention room."" (We worry that Santa, because of his facility for seeing into the souls of all things, might discern in Jessica Lynn Cohen something irredeemably bad, and be frightened off before he has a chance to deliver our presents.) But on Christmas morning, there she stands, in her honored place of precedence, next to the tree. Oprah.com: How to start a new holiday tradition . Yes, I suppose you could say she's an evil zombie doll who led our family to madness. But, damn it, she's our evil zombie doll. We adore her. And we're never, ever going to abandon her.

"(CNN) -- Penn State students and supporters of head football coach Joe Paterno rallied Tuesday evening outside his home amid growing calls for him to resign related to his response to child sex abuse allegations brought against a former assistant. The crowd in State College, mostly young people, greeted and cheered Paterno hours after his weekly news conference was canceled. Speaking outside and from a window at his residence, the 84-year-old Nittany Lions legend said he was praying for victims in the case. Paterno, a longtime coach with a largely spotless record, is under pressure because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant who said he had seen retired defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in the shower at the campus football complex. Paterno reported the allegations to his boss, and Pennsylvania's attorney general said it appeared that the coach had met his obligations under state law. Still, some critics have said that he should have reported the suspected abuse to police. ""We don't yet know who is legally guilty,"" SI.com columnist Michael Rosenberg wrote on the website. ""But several prominent employees at the state university are morally guilty. And one of them is Joe Paterno."" On Tuesday, Paterno's son, Scott Paterno, said on Twitter that reports in the New York Times, citing people briefed on the matter, that university officials were planning an end to Paterno's 46-year coaching tenure were ""premature."" ""No discussions about retirement with JVP,"" Paterno said, using his father's initials. He said the decision to cancel the news conference was not his father's. ""Due to the ongoing legal circumstances centered around the recent allegations and charges, we have determined that today's press conference cannot be held and will not be rescheduled,"" the university said in a statement. Joe Paterno said Tuesday afternoon that he hopes to hold another news conference soon. ""I know you guys have a lot of good questions, and I'd like to answer them, but I can't do it now,"" Paterno said after practice. A preliminary hearing for Sandusky, originally set for Wednesday, has been rescheduled for December 7, officials said Tuesday afternoon. Sandusky's attorney has said more time was needed to bring in witnesses. On Sunday, Penn State announced that two university officials accused by state authorities of failing to report suspected abuse had stepped down, one of them returning to retirement and the other taking administrative leave. Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that the alleged failure of Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley, 57, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, to report abuse claims ""likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years."" Curley and Schultz, who are each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse, were released Monday on $75,000 bail each. At the arraignment hearing, their attorneys said the men were innocent of the charges and would fight to clear their names. Sandusky is accused of sexual offenses, child endangerment and ""corruption of a minor"" charges involving eight boys, most or all of whom he met through the Second Mile, the charity he founded to help troubled youth, according to prosecutors. Sandusky's involvement with the group provided him with ""access to hundreds of boys, many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations,"" the grand jury said. The former coach is said to have engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys over at least 15 years, according to the investigative grand jury's summary of testimony. A source with direct knowledge of the investigation confirmed to CNN's Jason Carroll that a man walked into a Montoursville, Pennsylvania, state police station and claimed he was victimized by Sandusky. Interviews with the man will determine whether he's a ninth victim, the source said. Sandusky, who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the Nittany Lions football team before retiring in 1999, is free on $100,000 bail. His attorney, Joseph Amendola, has not returned a message from CNN seeking comment. Overheard on CNN.com about Joe Paterno . The grand jury investigation that led to the charges began with the claims of one alleged victim who said Sandusky had ""indecently assaulted"" him and engaged in sex acts while he was a guest at the coach's home, according to the attorney general. The victim met Sandusky through the Second Mile, and Sandusky allegedly used expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games, golf clubs, a computer and money, Kelly said. The relationship, which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008, included overnight stays at Sandusky's home, where touching led to sexual acts, according to Kelly and grand jury testimony. However, the most explosive charges in the grand jury report involve a 2002 incident in which a graduate student reported seeing Sandusky in the shower performing anal sex on a young boy, according to the grand jury and prosecutors. ""One of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late-night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in March of 2002, in the locker room of the Lasch Football Building on the University Park Campus,"" Kelly said. ""Hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty, a graduate assistant reportedly observed Sandusky sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old."" The assistant reported the incident to Paterno, who in turn alerted Curley. Paterno said in his statement that he had done his duty in informing Curley. ""It was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw, but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report. Regardless, it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving Mr. Sandusky. As Coach Sandusky was retired from our coaching staff at that time, I referred the matter to university administrators,"" Paterno said. But instead of reporting the incident to authorities, Curley and Schultz took Sandusky's locker room keys and banned him from having children from Second Mile visit the football building, Kelly said. In his statement, Paterno called the charges ""shocking."" ""While I did what I was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention, like anyone else involved, I can't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred,"" he said in the statement. Prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility of additional charges or victims in the case. CNN's Jason Carroll and Kiran Khalid contributed to this report.","NEW: Paterno says he is praying for victims .

"(CNN) -- Chuck Klosterman's seventh book and second novel, ""The Visible Man"" (Scribner), is out Tuesday. Its story is told by an Austin, Texas, therapist named Victoria Vick and centers around one of her clients, Y___, a man whose name we never learn and who, more importantly, has an unusual talent. Thanks to a suit and some cream he helped develop, Y___ can basically render himself invisible to the untrained eye. But more than simply a book about a guy with a special ability, ""The Visible Man"" is about how people act when they're not being watched, and the sketchy moral line that's crossed by the watcher. CNN spoke with Klosterman about the inspiration for the book, writing about and participating in the interview process, and how no one is going to relate to the two main characters in his new novel. CNN: What was the inspiration for ""The Visible Man""? Chuck Klosterman: I think it was probably when I was writing the previous book, the essay collection (2009's ""Eating the Dinosaur""). I had to reread H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" for an essay I was writing. I was living in Germany at the time, teaching for the University of Leipzig, so I got it through Amazon Europe or whatever, and it was an edition of the book that was ""The Time Machine"" and ""The Invisible Man."" So I decided I would read ""The Invisible Man"" too, since I hadn't read it since fifth or sixth grade. It was a totally different book than I'd remembered (which is what happens when) you're an adult. The thing that was most interesting to me was that the invisible man was such a jerk. He was just this kind of egocentric, weird person. Of course, as I thought it over, what type of personality would pursue something like invisibility? It would have to be someone who was both very smart and really sort of egocentric -- would lack the normal boundaries a person would have. At the same time, I was thinking a lot about the process of interviewing. Sort of the unreality of being interviewed. I started to wonder, if you really want to understand what someone's like, how would you do it? Interviewing or surveying or anything when a person is around other people is so impacted by the experience. So those two things together sort of ended up becoming this book. CNN: You like to talk about interviewing while being interviewed. Having written this book, which includes a lot of interview-based conversation, was your position on interviewing altered? Klosterman: No. The more you profile people and the more you try to learn things from people through asking them questions, the shortcoming and failures of this process become more and more present in your mind. I can't imagine that, as I grow older, I'm going to reverse my thinking and start believing the interviewing process is more valuable than I think now. It will probably just keep eroding. But here's the trick, or, I guess, the paradox: Even though interviewing is this incredibly flawed process, it's still the best means we have for understanding people we don't know. It's completely imperfect, but still better than every other option. CNN: Do you think your opinion of interviewing will erode to the point where you no longer interview people or get interviewed? Klosterman: What else would I do? I mean, I'm a journalist. There's certainly a thinking, and I didn't see this as much when I worked in newspapers, but when I moved to New York and ended up being surrounded mostly by critics, I came to the realization that a lot of people sort of work under the impression that not only is interviewing not helpful, but that it's mostly detrimental. That if you want to write about the band Wilco, it's a disadvantage to meet Jeff Tweedy, because that's going to warp your real perception of the music. You're going to hear his music through these things you learned in the interview. Maybe he charms you, maybe you see something in him, maybe you don't like him. I understand that, and I think that's why a lot of pretty smart writers, as they age, do tend to do less reporting. I don't know that that'll ever happen to me. CNN: One of the two main characters in the book, and the one who tells the book's story, Victoria, admits on Page 1, ""I am not a writer."" Did writing in this person's voice allow you to free yourself of writerly conventions, or was there a pressure to authentically write in an unwriterly fashion? Klosterman: To me, that was totally a decision based around verisimilitude, I guess is the word? To me, if someone had never written a book before and was now attempting to write a book based on the fact that they had one metaphysical encounter, that would be their fear. That's one of the weird things about this book. There are two primary characters, obviously, and the one character, because he's this psychopathic scientist, he is this kind of unlikable, egocentric person. But what kind of therapist would allow themselves to almost become (involved with) this person? Well, it would be someone who is insecure, and someone who is just smart enough to be kind of dumb. As a product, neither one of these two characters are very relatable to people. I can't imagine someone reading this and going, ""I really relate to this man or this woman."" But that's just how it goes. CNN: There's a battle between actual sense of self and pop-culture-produced sense of self in this book, especially with regards to reality television. Do you worry that pop culture is taking too strong of a hold on our daily lives? Klosterman: The short answer is yes. The long answer is that it's an extremely complicated question which often collides with this classic problem of, ""Is this idea bad or is it just new?"" I'm just thinking about it constantly. In probably all of my books, except maybe the very first one, but even that one probably, is this idea of, ""What is reality?"" I mean, it's kind of a cliche thing; it seems like something you worry about when you're 17, but I've never stopped worrying about it. It's the main thing I think about in my life. (laughs) CNN: Does writing about a guy like the one in this book help, or does it confuse the issue? Klosterman: Both. You start with a core problem, and maybe you answer that question to what you've decided is an acceptable degree, but of course, that just creates a new question. If you think about reality, and you think about the problems of reality, there's never going to be a point where there's no more questions to ask. The questions just get harder and less clear. But at the same time, if you keep going on that, eventually you end up writing a book where the whole premise is, ""This book exists."" Like, ""Am I really writing a book?"" is sort of a zero-sum game. CNN: In describing the book, are you hung up on the semantics of invisibility, like its main characters? If someone says, ""'The Visible Man' is about a man who becomes invisible,"" does that bother you? Klosterman: Well, it's a very good question, I guess, would it bother me. If somebody asked me, ""What is this book about?"" and I know that I only have one sentence to tell them, I would say, ""Well, it's how it would be to be the invisible man's therapist."" But if I read a review that said that and simplified it down, I would be like, ""That's totally wrong!"" It might bother me if someone else said it, but it doesn't bother me when I think it. The simple fact is that people can't be invisible. I think that, in general, when I write nonfiction, I want it to seem like hyperreality, for it to feel like you're reading fiction. But when I write fiction, I want it to seem like journalism.","Klosterman says he was partially inspired by the classic ""The Invisible Man""

""We saw a flash of light ... and heard the explosion sound,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon on Saturday. ""It was scary."" ""You just heard the whole crowd gasp simultaneously and everybody just kind of went silent and was just watching what was going on,"" she said. Event organizers on Sunday urged those who witnessed the crash ""to seek out support if they feel that viewing the accident traumatically affected them."" The West Virginia crash came one day after another deadly air crash. A pilot lost control of his vintage plane during an air race in Reno, Nevada, on Friday, plummeting toward thousands of spectators before narrowly missing a grandstand and slamming into box seats.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- iSad. That was the reaction of many as millions took to the web with the news of the death of 56-year-old Steve Jobs. Facebook and Twitter messages were filled with links and anecdotes about the impact technology -- and more specifically, Apple -- had on users' lives. Apple invited people to email their thoughts, memories and condolences after announcing Jobs' death Wednesday, saying the company lost a ""visionary and creative genius and the world has lost an amazing human being."" CNN's iReport is also collecting reactions. Jobs' death jolted a generation that has never known a world without a cellular phone, and it elicited reactions from those who watched Apple grow from a Silicon Valley garage startup in 1976 to today's leading tech company. ""RIP, Steve Jobs,"" read many Facebook messages. Still others invoked the visionary's signature stage pitch, ""And one more thing ... Thank you."" Many tweeted simply: iSad or iHeaven. ""Oh my God, dad. Steve Jobs has died. He's my generation's Walt Disney,"" 20-year-old Lauren Harrington of Atlanta told her father upon learning Wednesday night that Jobs had died. Celebrities, corporate executives and politicians, including President Barack Obama, paid tribute to Jobs. ""Our parents had JFK, we had Steve Jobs. Edison gave us electricity, Jobs gave us the Jetsons in real life,"" tweeted director and actor Kevin Smith. ""We lost an icon today. Mourn him."" Actor Ashton Kutcher tweeted: ""Sending love & light to everyone @Apple & the entire Jobs family. Today we lost a Giant who will be missed even by those who didn't know him. I never thought I could be so busted up about the loss of someone I never met."" Obama hailed Jobs as one of America's greatest innovators, a man ""brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it."" ""The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve's success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented,"" Obama said in a statement released Wednesday. Obama, an avowed BlackBerry fan, revealed this week to ABC's George Stephanopoulos that Jobs personally gave him an advanced copy of the iPad 2. House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) tweeted: ""There is not a day that goes by, and often not an hour, that a Steve Jobs' invention does not better my family's life. Thank you Steve."" The flood of messages slowed Twitter to a crawl at times or produced error messages saying the site was over capacity. On the social networking sites, many quoted from Jobs' heartfelt commencement address at Stanford University in 2005, where he first detailed his battle with pancreatic cancer. Actor Hill Harper, paraphrasing the speech, tweeted: ""Do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do! ... Don't settle."" Apple flew the flags at its Cupertino, California, office at half-staff, and an impromptu memorial sprang up at the venue as people arrived with flowers, letters and mementos, CNN affiliates reported. Several employees tweeted messages containing only the Apple logo. The many websites devoted to Apple rumors and products placed large banners in memory of the company's co-founder. The alternative-culture blog Boing Boing revamped its design in honor of Jobs to resemble retro Macintosh software. Wired painted its front page black, with a shadowed picture of Steve Jobs in the center. Google's co-founders posted statements about Jobs' importance to them personally and to the industry, and underneath the search box on Google.com, the company added: ""Steve Jobs, 1955 - 2011."" Research in Motion, from its BlackBerry Twitter account, called Jobs ""a great visionary and respected competitor."" Microsoft's Bill Gates, who once worked with Jobs and later competed against him in the mobile world, said on his Twitter account: ""For those of us lucky enough to get to work with Steve, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely,"" â€” Bill Gates. And two men, whose social networking sites gained in popularity thanks in part to Jobs' mobile-computing revolution, paid their respects to Apple's mogul. In a message, Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg said: ""Steve, thank you for a being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you."" Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey wrote simply: ""Thank you."" CNN's Mark Milian, Douglas Hyde, Ed Payne, Chelsea J.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An actor who played a wannabe mobster in ""The Sopranos"" was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for a botched burglary that left an off-duty New York police officer dead. Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on ""The Sopranos"" and played alongside Robert De Niro in ""A Bronx Tale."" The Bronx County District Attorneys Office had sought the maximum of 15 years for Lillo Brancato Jr., who was convicted last month of attempted burglary stemming from a fatal encounter with police officer Daniel Enchautegui. Before the sentencing, Enchautegui's sister addressed the court to deliver a victim impact statement. Enchautegui, 28, was shot in the chest when he interrupted an alleged break-in at a neighbor's home in the Bronx but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying. Brancato was cleared in Enchautegui's death, but his accomplice, Steven Armento, 51, was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. During the trial, lawyers for Brancato argued that there was not a break-in. Brancato testified that he knew the owner of the home, a Vietnam veteran who had given him permission to enter the house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted. Brancato testified that he and Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium. He admitted breaking a window at the home but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and was trying to wake up his friend to get drugs. Brancato appeared on six episodes of the hit HBO series ""The Sopranos"" in 2000. As a teen, he starred alongside actor Robert De Niro in ""A Bronx Tale.""","Prosecutors sought 15 years for Lillo Brancato Jr. for attempted burglary .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Ryan Brunn, the man who this week was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to murdering a Georgia girl, apparently killed himself in his prison cell Thursday, a corrections spokeswoman said. Georgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kristen Stancil said that Brunn was found unresponsive at 4:15 p.m. in his cell at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. Brunn was pronounced dead at a hospital at 5:37 p.m. due to an apparent suicide, she said. The case since has been referred to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, according to Stancil. Brunn had entered a guilty plea Tuesday at a hearing in a Cherokee County courthouse, during which he described in detail how he enticed, molested and killed 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole, avoiding a potential death sentence by lethal injection. The girl's father, Ricardo Galarza, told CNN en Espanol that news of Brunn's death partly made him ""feel good but, on the other hand, it doesn't because my daughter will never be with me again."" Galarza said that he felt that a lifetime of Brunn being watched after, ""eating three times a day (and) sleeping with air conditioning"" while in prison was not enough. ""What I wanted was for them to put him in the electric chair and burn him,"" the father said. ""I would have taken him there myself and prepared it, so he would burn."" Jorelys' mangled body was found in a trash compactor three days after she went missing on December 2 from an apartment complex in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta. According to the indictment, Jorelys was severely beaten and stabbed repeatedly in the face, neck and chest. Brunn, 20, who worked as a maintenance man at the same apartment complex, was arrested on December 7 and charged with the crime. Last week, Brunn was indicted on 13 counts including murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to children, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes, false imprisonment, abandonment of a dead body, making a false statement and sexual exploitation of children. He told the court Tuesday that he had never talked to Jorelys before the day of her murder. He said he devised a plan after he found one of her skates. Brunn took a picture of the skate and approached her with it, asking if the skate was hers. She said yes, and Brunn promised to take her to it. Instead, he took her to an empty apartment and instructed Jorelys to pull down her pants. He then put tape over her face and cut her throat with a razor. At this point, she was still alive, he told the court. He said that he then took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate. He said he did not have sex with the girl. Increasingly, Brunn told the court, he grew concerned about what he had done. So he took a receipt, wrote on the back of it, ""She is in the trash can,"" and taped it to the compactor. He admitted lying to investigators who had questioned him about the case. Brunn said he knew right from wrong, adding he ""never had an idea of killing a child in my life."" ""I'd like to apologize for everything I've done, and I do deserve everything that you're about to give me,"" he said in court.","Victim's father says he would have preferred Brunn die ""in the electric chair""

"Washington (CNN) -- Few issues divide the Supreme Court -- and the country at large -- more than church-state matters, and arguments before the Supreme Court on Wednesday involving a workplace discrimination lawsuit against a Lutheran church proved especially touchy. At issue is whether the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to hiring and firing decisions involving ""ministerial employees"" like teachers who may have primarily secular job duties. The justices appeared at odds over whether this is substantive discrimination or simple retaliation against a Michigan teacher, after she complained to government authorities over her treatment on the job. ""You're asking for an exemption (to lawsuits) so these issues can't even be tried"" in a government hearing on the merits, said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""She was fired simply for asking for a hearing."" ""It's none of the business of the government to decide what the substantial interest of the church is,"" countered Justice Antonin Scalia. ""There, in black and white in the text of the Constitution, are special protections for religion."" Court records show Cheryl Perich went on medical leave for narcolepsy in 2004. When she tried to return several months later to the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School, officials refused to accept her, saying a substitute had been hired to complete the school year. After weeks of often acrimonious discussions between her and the school, Perich was fired for insubordination and ""regrettable"" conduct toward church leaders. She then complained to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sued the church on her behalf. Federal courts have upheld an exception in the Americans with Disabilities Act blocking government intrusion in the employment decisions between religious institutions and ministerial workers. The church said Perich was just such an employee and therefore the institution could not be sued. Perich had been hired five years earlier, and eventually became a ""called"" teacher, meaning she could not be fired without cause. Assigned to third and fourth grades, she led instruction in math, language arts, social studies, gym and music, with much of the curriculum identical to that of the local public schools. Perich also taught a religion class four days a week, and engaged in daily prayers and devotionals with her students. The religion-based activities typically took up about 45 minutes of the seven-hour school day, according to court documents. She also led chapel services with her class twice a year, on a rotation basis with other instructors. The faculty has two types of teachers: ""lay"" employees, who are on one-year contracts, and called teachers like Perich, who have completed a formal colloquy, receiving a certificate of admission into the teaching ministry. Those parochial instructors are hired on an open-ended basis and cannot be summarily dismissed without proper justification. Perich began as a contract teacher, but fulfilled the requirements to be a called teacher, becoming a ""commissioned minister"" in the Lutheran Church. Perich attended the one-hour oral arguments at the high court, saying afterward, ""I can't fathom how the Constitution in any way can be interpreted to deny me my fundamental rights. I hope the court sees it that way."" The Redford, Michigan, school is affiliated with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, but does not require its teachers to be called, or even Lutheran. A federal appeals court in Cincinnati eventually ruled for Perich, saying her primary duties as a teacher were not religious in nature. In the oral arguments at the high court, Douglas Laycock, representing the church, said, ""Government does not set the criteria for selecting and removing officers of the church. That's a bedrock principle."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor jumped in. ""Doesn't society have a right at some point to say certain conduct is unacceptable,"" and deserving of government intervention. ""We know from the news recently that there was a church whose religious beliefs centered around sexually exploiting women and, I believe, children."" She added, ""Once we say that's unacceptable, can and why shouldn't we protect (from retaliation) the people who are doing what the law requires, i.e. reporting it?"" Arguing for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Justice Department lawyer Leondra Kruger said, ""The government's interest in this case is not in dictating to the church-operated school who it may choose to teach religion classes and who it may not. It is one thing and one thing only, which is to tell the school that it may not punish its employees for threatening to report civil wrongs to civil authorities."" Chief Justice John Roberts was incredulous. ""You're making a judgment about how important a particular religious belief is to a church,"" he told Kruger. ""You're saying: We don't believe the Lutheran Church when it says that this is an important and central tenet of our faith."" Kruger later suggested the government could not bring action against the Catholic Church for its historic policy of men-only priests, but that retaliation claims against the Lutheran Church in this case are justified. But Justice Samuel Alito said any such lawsuit would invariably involve questions of religious doctrine, from which religious groups would be constitutionally insulated from any claims. ""I can't reconcile your position on those two issues without coming to the conclusion that you think that the Catholic doctrine is older, stronger and entitled to more respect than the Lutheran doctrine,"" he said. The Constitution's First Amendment bars any government from passing laws ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" The high court in the past has typically dealt with such church-state disputes by allowing Ten Commandment displays in public buildings; the mention of ""God"" on currency and in the Pledge of Allegiance; manger and menorah displays in public parks; and school and legislature prayer. Legal experts say federal courts have been split on the current issue, and it gives the justices a rare opportunity to explore a religious freedom dispute from an employment context. Several dozen supporting briefs supporting both sides have been filed by religious and civil liberty organizations, employment groups, and eight other states. Six members of the high court are Catholic, the other three are Jewish. The case is Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC (10-553). A ruling is expected early next year.","A former teacher wants to sue the church school that dismissed her .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Several thousand opponents of new Internet filtering rules, set to take effect in Turkey in August, marched in protest in Istanbul on Sunday. Demonstrators carried signs in Turkish and English reading ""Don't touch my Internet"" and ""We don't need protection,"" while they chanted slogans against website censorship. Internet users must choose among four filtering options, including family, children, domestic or standard settings, as a part of Turkey's ""Safe Internet Service."" The regulations are designed to protect children from indecent online content, according to BTK, the prime minister's information technology board. Critics argue that it is not clear how the filtering system will work. The marchers stopped several times to stage brief sit-ins during the two-hour route from the Taksim Square to the end of Istiklal Street. Organizers claimed the marcher numbered in the ""thousands,"" which appeared to be accurate to a CNN reporter on the scene. The new filtering rules will be enforced beginning August 22, the government said. A ""Enemies of the Internet"" report issued this month by Reporters Without Borders included Turkey on its 2011 list of ""countries under surveillance."" The BTK was ""not fooling anyone when it claims to be rendering a service to Internet users by giving them a choice between a lot of restrictions and fewer restrictions,"" the report said. Turkey already blocks more than 7,000 websites, ""in most cases without reference to any court,"" the report said.","Turkish officials say filtering is needed to protect kids from Web content .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British police practice of keeping DNA records of anyone they arrest is a human rights violation, The European Court of Human Rights ruled unanimously Thursday. The European Court of Human Rights says the UK should not be keeping DNA records of everyone they arrest. Two Britons took the case to the court after the police retained their fingerprints and DNA when criminal cases against them ended without conviction. Both then requested that the samples be destroyed, but their request was denied on the basis of a British law authorizing them to be retained indefinitely. The court awarded them 42,000 euros ($53,000) to cover their legal costs. The court was ""struck by the blanket and indiscriminate nature of the power of retention in England and Wales,"" it said in a statement announcing the ruling. It ruled the British practice was a violation of the ""right to respect for private and family life"" under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. The two applicants are both from the northern English city of Sheffield. One, Michael Marper, was arrested in March 2001 and charged with harassment of his partner. The case was formally discontinued three months later when he and his partner reconciled. The second applicant, a minor identified in court papers only as S., was arrested in January 2001, aged 11, for attempted robbery. He was acquitted in June 2001, on the same day the case against Marper was dropped. Marper told CNN he was surprised the case went as far as it did. ""It's a shame it had to go all the way to the European Court. It was only a trivial thing in the beginning,"" he said. He was in favor of the police DNA database when it was introduced. ""I wasn't against the principle of it. I'm all for DNA investigation at a crime scene."" He added that he did not object to retaining the DNA of convicted criminals ""so if you committed a crime later it could be traced and checked out."" But, he said, if a case ""has not been to court, then the DNA evidence should be thrown out with it."" The court ruling cannot be appealed, and theoretically requires the British government to change its policies. But British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who is responsible for the police, said she was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and that the existing law would ""remain in place while we carefully consider the judgment."" ""DNA and fingerprinting is vital to the fight against crime, providing the police with more than 3,500 matches a month,"" she said in a statement released by the Home Office Thursday. ""The government mounted a robust defense before the court, and I strongly believe DNA and fingerprints play an invaluable role in fighting crime and bringing people to justice.""

"(CNN) -- The Syrian government resigned Tuesday amid an unusual wave of unrest that has roiled the nation, state TV reported. President Bashar al-Assad accepted the resignations Tuesday, the same day that tens of thousands of Syrians poured onto the streets of Damascus to demonstrate in favor of the government. A new government should be named within hours, said Reem Haddad, a spokeswoman for the Syrian Information Ministry. Meanwhile, the president is expected to address the nation in a speech before the People's Assembly at 11 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) Wednesday, state TV said. The state-run SANA news agency reported the speech would ""reassure the Syrian people."" The pro-government rally on Tuesday followed violent clashes between protesters and security forces in the cities of Daraa and Latakia in recent days. At least 37 people have been killed since last week, according to the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Syria is the latest in a string of Arabic-speaking nations beset with discontent over economic and human rights issues. Syria's discontent is centered in Daraa, a southern city in the impoverished country's agricultural region, where security forces and anti-government protesters have sporadically clashed for nearly two weeks. Many demonstrators at the pro-government rally held posters of the president. Others waved Syrian flags, while some painted their faces and chests in national colors. Crowds filled the square in front of the Central Bank and jammed all roads leading to it, aerial pictures on state TV showed. There were also pro-government rallies in the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Hasaka, the broadcaster said.

The Latino Commission on AIDS issued a news release Monday, saying that deLeon was a ""pioneer"" and a ""visionary,"" as well as a ""tireless advocate for social justice and one of the first openly HIV-positive Latino leaders in the country."" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised deLeon on Monday, saying in a statement that the activist ""demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service."" After being appointed as the director of the mayor's Commission on Latino Concerns in 1986, deLeon went on to serve in other civic roles, including being selected by then-Mayor David Dinkins in 1990 to head the New York City Commission on Human Rights. In 1994, he returned to the private sector and helped found the Latino Commission on AIDS, where he served as its president for 15 years. According to its Web site, ""The Latino Commission on AIDS is a nonprofit membership organization dedicated to fighting the spread of HIV/AIDS in the Latino community."" ""It will be a challenge to pick up the mantle Dennis has left for us at the Commission. Dennis was a friend, a mentor and an example of what a national leader should be. ...

"Cap-Haitien, Haiti (CNN) -- The Christian Motorcyclists Association came to Haiti to distribute motorcycles to pastors. Instead, angry Haitians, some of them on motorbikes, ended up attacking the 11 American missionaries when they tried to flee this city aboard a big, yellow bus. ""We almost made it out of town,"" team member Kerry Gibson told CNN in a phone call after his team survived the attack unharmed. Until Wednesday morning, Gibson and his fellow volunteers had been holed up in a hotel on a hilltop overlooking Cap-Haitien, after demonstrators put up networks of barricades through the streets and began attacking the bases of United Nations peacekeepers with rocks, bottles and petrol bombs. The demonstrators have accused peacekeepers of starting the cholera outbreak. The motorcyclist team is part of an American organization that has hundreds of branches across the country. One of its goals, Gibson said, is to donate motorcycles to Christian leaders. ""We put wheels under indigenous local pastors,"" Gibson explained.  ""We were presenting seven here in Cap-Haitien. Obviously, that won't happen now."" Given the violence that has led to the death of at least one protester, the team decided Wednesday to cut their trip to Haiti short by a week.  A Haitian pastor informed Gibson that the road out of town was open, so the missionaries climbed aboard a commercial bus and tried to make it into nearby Dominican Republic. But on the outskirts of Cap-Haitien, the bus suddenly ran into trouble. ""We saw one guy with a machete raised up and he's running and yelling and screaming and pointing up ahead.  We suspect they put a blockade up in front of us.  That's when we stopped and they busted out the glass on the door,"" Gibson recalled. ""Our driver, he was like a NASCAR driver. He started backing up,"" Gibson said. ""But they put out two burned-out cars on the road in an effort to block us."" Gibson said protesters began hurling rocks at the bus and smashed the windshield. The bus was incapacitated and started spraying oil.  At some point, demonstrators dragged a Haitian employee of the bus company out of the vehicle and began beating him. Gibson said the driver then maneuvered the bus onto the sidewalk and lurched the vehicle forward toward the gate of a nearby U.N. peacekeeping base. ""I feel like God protected us,"" Gibson said. ""Just the fact that the bus stopped, died right in front of the U.N. compound, is confirmation that he's looking out for us."" Peacekeepers from Chile opened the gate and ushered the bus and its passengers inside the compound. The 11 CMA representatives were preparing to spend the night with the Chilean military and pondering their next step for escaping Cap-Haitien. Gibson insisted that, throughout the adrenaline-packed attack on the bus, he never felt he was in danger. The man who was dragged off the bus escaped without serious injury, Gibson said.  ""Of course it's a nerve-wracking situation, but I never got the impression that there was any real effort to do physical harm to us."" Asked what he planned to do Thursday, he said, ""Pray a lot.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Five security guards from Blackwater Worldwide have been indicted on charges related to a 2007 shooting in which 17 Iraqis were killed in a Baghdad square, two sources said Friday. An Iraqi woman looks at a blood-stained car of two women killed in the 2007 Nusoor Square shooting. A sixth security guard is in plea negotiations, the sources told CNN. The exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury were not revealed. The sources requested anonymity because the indictment remains under court seal. It is expected to be made public by Justice Department officials as early as Monday. The Justice Department had no comment on the development, and defense attorneys for the men could not be reached for reaction. The State Department, which employed Blackwater to protect U.S. diplomats and other employees, also had no comment. Blackwater said it wouldn't comment until there's an official announcement. Iraqi authorities accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the September 2007 shootings in Nusoor Square in western Baghdad. Blackwater said its guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents. The guards returned fire, Blackwater said. But an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder"" and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately. The first U.S. soldiers to arrive on the scene also told investigators they found no evidence the guards were fired upon, sources told CNN. The complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors. Among the potential problems is the uncertain limit of a law passed by Congress that prevents prosecution of military personnel or others working for the military and leaves open the question of those working for other U.S. government departments and agencies abroad. The incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors have from Iraqi laws. Security contractors have had immunity from Iraqi law under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq. But starting next year, under a U.S.-Iraq security agreement that Iraq approved Thursday, Iraq will have the ""primary right to exercise jurisdiction"" over U.S. contractors and their employees. The State Department renewed Blackwater's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government.","Sources: Five Blackwater guards charged in 2007 shooting that killed 17 Iraqis .

"(CNN) -- She is only 37 years old, but violinist Midori Goto has already spent 25 years taking center-stage with the world's best orchestras. Midori first hit center-stage when she was just 11-years-old. Born into a musical family in Osaka, Japan, in 1971 -- her mother and brother are both accomplished musicians -- her own prodigious talents were spotted at an early age by Zubin Mehta, the conductor and one-time musical director of the New York Philharmonic. Inviting Midori to play with the New York Philharmonic in 1982, he helped to propel her onto the world stage which has been such a large part of her life ever since. She moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School of performing arts and has lead a life entwined with music. Unlike some prodigiously talented people there is no hint of resentment directed toward her and the life she has led. Nor is there any notion of a stolen childhood, despite her admission that she did harbor dreams of being all sorts of other things, from an archeologist or diplomat to a zookeeper or a nun. ""This was my life, I didn't know any other. I took it and I was very happy. Being a child performer opened up opportunities. From a fairly early age I was exposed to different cultures and was traveling round the world. It was a great education,"" she told CNN. Being given the opportunity to learn more about different people and experience different places was only one part of this education. While Midori has been practicing and honing her own skills, she has also been given the opportunity to give something back. In 1992 she set up Midori & Friends, a non-profit organization that brings musical education to young people in New York City. ""I was always interested in education; not just receiving, but also helping others and being part of the community,"" she said. From Midori & Friends came Music Sharing, a similar organization in Japan, offering programs in public schools and children's hospitals. While continuing to perform across the world with renowned orchestras she took some time out to further her own education with a degree in psychology in 2000 and in 2005 received her Masters in Psychology from New York University. But music is and remains her first love and the way in which it connects people and stirs emotions is something she believes is one of the most powerful aspects of music. The world today might be unrecognizable from the world of Bruckner or Bach, but for Midori the way people feel and respond to music and emotions remains the same. ""The very basics of being human hasn't changed. We may express ourselves differently, but the fact we do respond and do feel that is something very basic,"" she said. And while there are hardships involved in being one of the world's finest violinists, it still remains a pure pleasure. ""As musicians we're trained to be self critical so we can get better. But fundamentally we love music. It's a love that drives us to practice and keep working at it. It's something I love so much and gives me so much joy. ""With that comes hardships... there's never a state of perfection. You try and you try and you try, but at the end you know you can't be perfect. It's humbling, so that it becomes a motivating force,"" she told CNN. Continuing her work outside of the concert hall, Midori was made a UN Ambassador for Peace in 2007, a role she relishes. While it presents her additional opportunities to talk about issues close to her heart, it's also a position that nourishes her inquisitive mind and another means to connect with people indirectly through her music. These experiences make the world a little more vivid than it was before. And I'm grateful for that; it's also something that motivates me to continue to do it,"" she said.","Violinist Midori Goto was child prodigy; played with NY Philharmonic at age 11 .

"(CNN) -- In Mexico City, the government ran out of surgical masks after handing them out to one of every five residents. A mother and son wear face masks as protection from swine flu at Sydney international Airport in Australia. Manufacturers and pharmacies in Europe are also reporting a surge in demand for face masks. And a Texas-based surgical mask producer says it's ramping up to meet demand and expects a shortage of masks. But their real value seems to be in keeping people who are already ill from spreading the virus, rather than protecting healthy people, experts said. Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday in a press briefing that the ""evidence is not very strong"" for masks' value outside of health care settings, and outside of settings in which people come into face-to-face contact with a person with an infectious disease. ""We would not recommend that people generally wear masks in their workplace as a precautionary measure,"" he said.  Watch for more on staying safe from swine flu » . The World Health Organization (WHO) also warns against relying on face masks, especially for those not infected with the virus. ""They are mainly useful for people who are already sick, to prevent spreading. Not so much to stop people from catching the virus,"" Sarah Cumberland of the WHO told CNN. The United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency also told CNN that the use of face masks was not necessary or recommended for protection against the swine flu virus. Although it's not known for sure how much benefit a surgical mask has in preventing the transmission of swine flu, people who have the illness may consider wearing one as a way to reduce the amount they cough and sneeze onto others, said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the epidemiology division at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. ""I think that this is a perfectly reasonable thing for someone with a respiratory illness to do,"" he said. More effective than soft surgical masks is the N95, which is an example of a ""respirator."" This kind of tight-fitting face covering protects people against breathing very small particles, which may contain viruses. The downside is that it's more expensive, uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and has to be custom fit, Reingold said, so it's suited for people working in high-risk laboratories. Masks carry both physical and psychological benefits, said Dr. Julio Frenk, former health minister of Mexico and current dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. Masks are a ""reminder to people that they should avoid close contact with other persons,"" he said. ""They also have this effect of isolating people and reminding them that they should not be kissing people, shaking hands, things like that."" For health care workers, it's important to have high-efficiency masks, which protect better against infectious diseases, he said. But people in the United States should generally not have to wear masks because the cases are localized, he said. By contrast, it is more of a widespread problem in Mexico, especially in the capital city, a ""huge urban conglomeration."" Measures such as closing schools are the most effective in stopping the spread of the disease, he said. Mexico's schools are closed until at least May 6. By early Tuesday, the swine flu outbreak in Mexico was suspected in 152 deaths and more than 1,600 illnesses, the country's health minister said. Swine flu has reached  phase 4 (out of 6) on the pandemic scale, according to the WHO guidelines, but has not yet attained the status of global pandemic. During a flu pandemic, people should consider wearing a face mask if they are sick with the flu, live with someone who has the flu or need to be in a crowded place, the CDC Web site says. If you are caring for a person thought to have pandemic flu or will be close to someone who may have it, consider a respirator, for example an N95 or high-filtering face piece respirator, the CDC Web site says. Some health care workers, such as nurses and doctors, use respirators when dealing with patients who have airborne diseases, the CDC said. iReport.com: Worried about swine flu? In the current swine flu situation, rather than masks, the CDC is pushing hand-washing, covering coughs and refraining from ""giving somebody that little kiss of greeting,"" Besser said. ""If you're in an infected area or if you have the swine flu, it's probably best not to, to not give a kiss, but we're not recommending an end of affection during the period. It's a period of time when we need a little more affection, but doing it in a way that isn't going to transmit a respiratory disease would be a CDC approach,"" he said.","Manufacturers and pharmacies are reporting a surge in demand for face masks .

"(CNN) -- The top U.N. human rights official deplored the ""devastatingly remorseless toll of human lives"" in Syria and exhorted the world community on Friday ""to take immediate measures"" to protect citizens. ""The onus is on all members of the international community to take protective action in a collective and decisive manner, before the continual ruthless repression and killings drive the country into a full-blown civil war,"" said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, in a written statement describing a dire human rights situation in Syria. Her remarks came as protesters took to the streets Friday in various Syrian cities, a nationwide outpouring supporting the ""free army,"" a reference to personnel who have defected from President Bashar al-Assad's military and to the recently formed Syrian Free Army. At least 12 people were reported dead in the latest protests, according to Syrian Observatory, an activist group. Pillay said the government has ""manifestly failed to protect its population"" and has ""ignored the international community's calls to cooperate with international investigations,"" she said. ""At stake are the universal rights to life, liberty and security of person which must never be brushed aside in the interests of realpolitik. The international community must speak with one voice and act to protect the Syrian people."" Protests erupted in Syria seven months ago, with demonstrators demanding changes to regime policies and/or an end to the regime. Opposition activists have accused officials of killing protesters, but the government has said it is going after armed groups. The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights, a London-based activist group with a network of informants across Syria, estimates that more than 3,100 people have died since the uprising began in mid-March. Most of them are civilians but some are military personnel as well. Pillay also said the death toll has exceeded 3,000 people and at least 187 of them were children. She said more than 100 people have been reported killed in the past 10 days. The government ""has consistently used excessive force to crush peaceful protests,"" she said. ""Sniping from rooftops, and indiscriminate use of force against peaceful protesters -- including the use of live ammunition and the shelling of residential neighborhoods -- have become routine occurrences in many Syrian cities,"" she said. ""In addition, thousands have been arrested, detained, forcibly disappeared and tortured. Family members inside and outside the country have been targeted for harassment, intimidation, threats and beatings. As more members of the military refuse to attack civilians and change sides, the crisis is already showing worrying signs of descending into an armed struggle."" Two months ago, she said there had been ""credible allegations of crimes against humanity in Syria"" and urged the U.N. Security Council to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court. Countries across the globe have expressed outrage over the instability in Syria. The European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions against the regime. The Gulf Cooperation Council, six Gulf Arab states, urged an immediate meeting of Arab League states to discuss the country's violence. The meeting should be at the foreign ministers level, the council said in a statement Thursday without providing details. Syria is a member of the Arab League. Two Obama administration officials provided testimony about U.S. efforts to deal with Syria for a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Friday. Wendy Sherman, undersecretary of state for political affairs, cited ""targeted financial measures to increase pressure on the Syrian regime and its enablers."" She added the administration ""remains committed to pursuing multilateral sanctions at the Security Council."" She said the United States is working to ""ensure expeditious, unfettered and sustained access for international human rights monitors and journalists,"" Also, she said it is working with ""international partners"" to keep Syria from circumventing American and European sanctions."" Noting that Iran has ""long used Syria as a strategic and logistical connection"" to terror groups, she said the United States is working to break those ties with the sanctions. David Cohen, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said, ""The sanctions are having a palpable impact,"" with the regime ""struggling to find buyers for its oil, to access foreign currency, and to maintain economic stability."" ""Echoing an action that we have taken, just this morning the EU announced sanctions on the commercial bank of Syria. By far the largest bank is Syria and it's key remaining link the international financial system,"" he said at the hearing. Demonstrations occur regularly in Syria, but activists mount nationwide demonstrations every Friday after Muslim prayers and those events regularly have labels, like the ""Free Army Friday"" theme. The Syrian Observatory said seven civilians killed and more than 30 wounded in the city of Dael in Daraa province in the south amid sustained gunfire. A woman and a child were killed in the Daraa Province town of Inkhel. A 10-year-old was killed in Damascus, a civilian was killed during clashes in the Damascus suburb of Saqba, and another was killed in Aleppo province, it said. An activist from the Coalition of Free Damascenes for Peaceful Change said security forces fired on demonstrators, and that army defectors, including members of the Free Syrian Army, clashed with security. The activist said the person killed was a passer-by not participating in demonstrations. ""We have lost many lives and our businesses and farmlands are destroyed. We need someone to defend us and stand up for our freedom,"" the activist said. Activists said security forces fired on protesters in the cities of Homs, in the west, and in Damascus, the capital, and besieged worshipers at a mosque in Banias, in the west. More than 4,000 people chanted for the Free Syrian Army in Idlib province, in the northwest. In the city of Douma, in the south, communication lines, including cell phones, were cut off after earlier demonstrations, the group said. In Hasaka in the northeast protesters outside a mosque chanted ""freedom."" The Syrian Arab News Agency, the government news outlet, said ""armed terror groups"" planted an explosive device in Daraa that was dismantled by soldiers. It also reported ""10 army and law enforcement officers"" were killed after they were ""ambushed by an armed terrorist group"" in the Idlib province town of Binnish on Thursday. This narrative directly contradicts that of the opposition, which claims defector soldiers and civilians were killed. At least 15 people were killed Thursday, including two young children, the Syrian Observatory said. Twelve of those killed were in Binnish, which soldiers raided searching for dissidents and army defectors, activists said. Among those SANA reported killed on Thursday in Binnish was Lt. Col. Abdul-Majeed al-Misri from Daraa. But on Friday, Omar Idlibi, a Beirut-based spokesman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees told CNN al-Misri, whom he called a brigadier general, was in fact killed in the city of Hama, in the west. Idlibi told CNN that Syrian security forces fired on al-Misri's car, killing him, after he defected from the military. An opposition video shows people marching and denouncing Bashar and Hafez al-Assad in al-Misri's home village of Atman outside the city of Daraa. Hafez al-Assad was Bashar's father and preceded him as Syrian president . The man filming the video says at the beginning, ""This is Free Army Friday, after the burial of Abdul-Majeed al-Misri."" Thirty seconds into the video, a man holds up a martyr's portrait, purportedly of al-Misri. The crowd is chanting ""God damn you Hafez and Bashar.""

"(CNN) -- An Orthodox Jewish man apparently preparing to pray prompted authorities to divert a Louisville, Kentucky-bound US Airways Express plane Thursday. FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said there appeared to be no threat from the man, who was described as wearing something on his head that included leather pieces. The description appeared to match that of tefillin, or phylacteries, which Orthodox Jewish men wear during prayer. The flight had taken off from New York's LaGuardia Airport, the FBI said, and was diverted to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Transportation Security Administration said it was notified of what it called a disruptive passenger on Flight 3079, operated by Chautauqua Airlines, around 8:30 a.m. ET, and the plane landed without incident at Philadelphia International Airport about 20 minutes later. US Airways spokesman Morgan Durrant said the diversion was a ""security precaution"" for the 50-seat ERJ 145. It was not immediately clear how many passengers were on board. Earlier, Durrant said the flight had been evacuated, but the TSA did not offer any details on whether that had occurred. TSA and law enforcement officials met the flight, interviewed the passenger and did a security sweep of the plane without finding anything of concern, the agency said.

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- An Egyptian real estate mogul and a former police officer pleaded not guilty Saturday to the murder of a rising Lebanese pop singer who was found slain in her United Arab Emirates apartment. Lebanese singer Suzanne Tamim was found slain in her apartment in Dubai in July. Prosecutors allege that Hisham Talaat Moustafa, a Parliament member for the ruling National Democratic Party, paid Muhsen el Sukkari $2 million to kill Suzanne Tamim. Both have denied the charges. Tamim, 30, was found in her Dubai apartment in July with her throat slit. Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer, but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it not unusual for men -- such as Moustafa, a married father of three -- to take on additional wives. The prosecutors say the murder was a ""means of taking revenge"" but have not elaborated.  Watch report on murder trial » . ""It did not happen and I have presented all the evidence that I am not guilty,"" Moustafa said in the courtroom Saturday, according to Reuters. ""It did not happen,"" Sukkari said, according to Reuters. ""By Almighty God, my blood is innocent of her."" Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary is trying the case in Cairo because Egyptian law does not allow its citizens to be extradited for trials in other countries. The defendants appeared Saturday in cages -- as is typical in Egypt -- before three judges in a crowded downtown courtroom. Heavy security surrounded the building, amid a crush of reporters and onlookers. The case, with its high-profile victim and defendant, has captivated Egypt and the region. After his arrest in September, Egyptian authorities indicted Moustafa, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company. The case will resume on November 15. The defendants will remain jailed until then.","Lebanese pop singer Suzanne Tamim found with throat slit in Dubai apartment .

"Editor's note: This story is the second of a three-part series focusing on the FBI as the agency hits the 100-year mark. A lab worker examines a tire tread at the FBI's famed crime lab in Quantico, Virginia. QUANTICO, Virginia (CNN) -- Behind closed doors, the scientists and agents of the FBI scrutinize fibers, poisons, explosives, DNA and just about any other shred of evidence that might help solve crimes. They can't talk about specific cases they're working. Yet the work they're doing can put people behind bars or lead to major advances in crime-solving techniques. As the FBI hits the 100-year-mark and continues to evolve to meet the demands of the world, CNN visited the state-of-the-art crime lab in Quantico, Virginia. It's the same lab that inspired the hit television series ""CSI."" Dozens of experts from an array of fields work under one roof. ""I think that's what really made a name for the FBI lab,"" said Robert Fram, chief of the FBI's scientific analysis section. ""We were able to get involved in a lot of very high-profile cases and get it done completely.""  Get a behind-the-scenes look at the lab » . The lab has played roles in everyday cases as well as some of the most significant crime investigations in the nation's history, from the assassination of President Kennedy to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 to the September 11 terrorist attacks. The lab now employs 500 agents, scientists and other personnel, far from its origins in 1932. Back then, there was only one agent working in a single room in Washington. His name was Charles Appel, a handwriting analysis expert. Appel's background allowed the lab to play an important role in one of its first big cases: the kidnapping and killing of the toddler son of aviator Charles Lindbergh. Appel linked the handwriting from ransom notes to a suspect, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who was convicted. Since then, the lab has been on the cutting edge of crime-solving techniques. The advent of DNA analysis was a revolution in forensic science, and it's a key part of what the FBI lab does.  See photos of the FBI as it turns 100 » . Richard Guerrieri is a chief DNA analyst at Quantico. ""Our unit handles anywhere from 1,500 to 1,800 submissions a year of evidence,"" Guerrieri said during a tour of the lab. Often, that involves examining clothes for bodily fluids that can help identify a suspect or a crime victim. The DNA unit is one of the first areas of the lab to use robotics to speed up the processing of evidence. Another scientific advancement is the Direct Analysis in Real Time machine, which can quickly identify substances such as poisons and explosives. ""The whole premise behind this technology is that almost every chemical we analyze has its own unique weight,"" said Dr. Marc LeBeau, chief of the lab's chemistry unit. Lab officials say their advanced techniques are essential to fighting crime. But they also say that sometimes, those advances can unrealistically raise expectations. Television shows like ""CSI"" show speedy DNA or fingerprint matches and criminals in handcuffs in just one hour, something lab workers say doesn't happen in the real world. ""We work on some cases for years at a time and keep putting more and more evidence together,"" said Carlo Rosati, a forensic examiner in firearms and tool marks. FBI officials say many juries expect DNA and fingerprints to be found at every crime scene. ""Why isn't there a fingerprint; why isn't there DNA?"" Fram asked, describing jurors' expectations. ""And they're going as far as feeling that they can't convict someone because you didn't find A, B or C, where you just don't always find those things."" The FBI lab has had some missteps. In 2004, authorities matched a fingerprint belonging to Oregon lawyer Brandon Mayfield to evidence found at the site of the Madrid, Spain, train bombings. Mayfield was cleared, sued the FBI and received a $2 million settlement. In the 1990s, a Justice Department investigation found flaws in lab analysis and trial testimony in some cases, which led to reforms. ""No one's infallible,"" Fram said. ""A mistake can be made. The idea is to minimize it. And the idea is to act on it if it was made and correct it, and make sure it doesn't happen again."" Officials at the lab say they are strict about handling evidence. When a CNN crew visited in June, it was not allowed into areas where scientists were working with real evidence. CNN was shown demonstrations with test materials. Karen Lanning, chief of the evidence control unit, said evidence has to be dealt with correctly from the second it arrives at the FBI. ""It's critical for every case, whether it's to put somebody who really should be in jail or to help exonerate somebody. It's somebody's life that we're dealing with, so it has to be taken very seriously.""","FBI crime lab began in 1932 with one person; it now employs 500 .

"(CNN)  -- Like thousands of other Iranian women, Parisa took to Tehran's streets this week, her heart brimming with hope. ""Change,"" said the placards around her. Iranian women demonstrate Thursday in the streets of Tehran, the capital city. The young Iranian woman eyed the crowd and pondered the possibility that the rest of her life might be different from her mother's. She could see glimmers of a future free from discrimination -- and all the symbols of it, including the head-covering the government requires her to wear every day. Women, regarded as second-class citizens under Iranian law, have been noticeably front and center of the massive demonstrations that have unfolded since the presidential election a week ago. Iranians are protesting what they consider a fraudulent vote count favoring hardline incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but for many women like Parisa, the demonstrations are just as much about taking Iran one step closer to democracy. ""Women have become primary agents of change in Iran,"" said Nayereh Tohidi, chairwoman of the Gender and Women's Studies Department at California State University, Northridge. The remarkable images show women with uncovered heads who are unafraid to speak their minds and crowds that are not segregated -- both the opposite of the norm in Iran, Tohidi said. She said a long-brewing women's movement may finally be manifesting itself on the streets and empowering women like Parisa. ""This regime is against all humanity, more specifically against all women,"" said Parisa, whom CNN is not fully identifying for security reasons. ""I see lots of girls and women in these demonstrations,"" she said. ""They are all angry, ready to explode, scream out and let the world hear their voice. I want the world to know that as a woman in this country, I have no freedom."" Though 63 percent of all Iranian college students are women, the law of the land does not see men and women as equal. In cases of divorce, child custody, inheritance and crime, women do not have the same legal rights as men. In the past four years, Ahmadinejad has made it easier for men to practice polygamy and harder for women to access public sector jobs, according to CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Amanpour, who has reported extensively from Iran, describes Iranian women as ""very strong."" In 1997, it was women who came out along with young people to put reformist candidate Mohammed Khatami into the presidency, Amanpour said. Increasingly, women's voices are gaining power as their numbers rise and their demands grow louder. Even the granddaughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the architect of the Islamic republic, voiced frustration at the way women are treated. ""Women are just living things,"" Zahra Eshraghi told Amanpour. ""A woman is there to fill her husband's stomach and raise children."" For the first time, women were allowed to register for the presidential race, though none, including Eshraghi, were deemed fit to run by the religious body that vets candidates. But women's issues surfaced in the campaign. That was partly the result of a women's movement comprised of educated, urban, middle-class women that has grown in recent years with the addition of more conservative and poorer women, said Tohidi, a longtime observer of women's rights in Iran. Ironically, traditional women first gained voice under the clerics. ""Khomeini needed their votes, so he encouraged them to be publicly active,"" Tohidi said. The middle-class women who enjoyed certain freedoms in prerevolutionary days refused to turn back, while a new generation of conservatives were awakened to feminism. In 2003, lawyer and women's rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize, providing a ""big boost"" for Iranian women, Tohidi said. At the same time, private organizations and charities that deal with women's issues blossomed under the presidency of reformist Mohammed Khatami, growing by as much as 700 percent, Tohidi said. Marriage age increased as more women opted to marry for love, instead of entering arranged marriages. The One Million Signatures Campaign officially launched in 2006 sprouted new discourse and attention with a petition that asks the parliament to reform gender discriminatory laws. In this year's presidential campaign, Iranian women pressured candidates to agree to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The 1979 treaty has been ratified by 186 nations, including several Islamic states. Two opposition candidates, Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi, vowed to look into parts of the Iranian constitution that defer women's rights to what is regarded as an outdated version of sharia, or Islamic, law. Moussavi had even promised to appoint women as cabinet ministers for the first time. Some women in Iran looked to Moussavi to carry their banner, perhaps because they were inspired by his wife, Zahra Rahnavard, a much-admired academic who told CNN's Amanpour that Iran's 34 million women want civil laws and family laws revised. Author and journalist Azadeh Moaveni, who spent several years working in Iran, said Ahmadinejad's fundamentalism has pushed Iranian women to the edge. ""He has been a catastrophe for women,"" said Moaveni, who wrote ""Lipstick Jihad"" and co-authored ""Iran Awakening"" with Nobel laureate Ebadi. The weight of discrimination against women is felt most profoundly through Iran's legal system, but Moaveni said Ahmadinejad added to the hardship by clamping down on women's lifestyles. He mandated the way women dress and even censored Web sites that dealt with women's health, Moaveni said. A woman would be hard-pressed to conduct a Google search for something as simple as breast cancer. Moaveni was almost arrested because her coat sleeves were too short and exposed too much skin. In that setting, she said, it's striking to see women protesting, especially without their hijabs, or head coverings. ""While it's not at the top of women's grievances, the hijab is symbolic. Taking it off is like waving a red flag,"" Moaveni said. ""Women are saying they are a force to be reckoned with."" Azar Nafisi, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies and author of ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" said she has been watching the footage from Iran with ""inordinate pride."" She marched on the streets during the 1979 revolution because she believed in greater freedoms for her people, only to see her dreams shattered as hardline clerics took hold of Iran. ""Reading Lolita"" is largely a memoir of her harrowing days in Iran until 1997, when she immigrated to the United States. ""The way I walked down the street became a political statement,"" Nafisi said. She recalled her own mother being a devout Muslim who chose not to wear a veil. Her grandmother, like more traditional women in Iran, wore a veil but resented the government ordering her to do so. Covering up, Nafisi said, was a matter of faith, not politics. Nafisi believes that women have become a symbolic statement of the power of the Islamic state. She called Iranian women canaries of the mind -- barometers of how free society is. It's impossible to predict what will transpire in Iran in the coming days. Nafisi believes a regime change will not be enough; that only a change in mindset can lead to greater freedoms for women. Moaveni said the sheer scale of the demonstrations assures her that the political and social climate will never again be the same in Iran. Tohidi is keeping her fingers crossed that the protests won't prompt Iran's hardliners to clamp down and rule by repression. But all of them shared the hopes of the women -- like Parisa -- who are marching on the streets. ""Today, we were wearing black,"" Parisa said, referring to the day of mourning to remember those who have died in post-election violence. ""We were holding signs. We said, 'We are not sheep. We are human beings,'"" she said. Parisa was thankful for all the images being transmitted out of Iran despite the government's crackdown on international journalists. She was thankful, too, that the world cared. ""Today,"" she said, ""I had this feeling of hope that things will finally change.""","Women have been strikingly noticeable in street demonstrations .
Many hope the protests will lead to changes in gender discriminatory laws .

"(CNN) -- She stands just over 4 feet tall and prowls the stage rasping Lady Gaga hits. But come weekends, you won't find Terra Jolé in the nightclubs partying like a rock star. ""Most short people are at boobie or neck range"" with other patrons in the clubs, she explains. ""I'm at ass range."" Such quips are definitive Jolé, a petite chanteuse who is as self-deprecating as she is earnestly committed to her career as ""Mini-Gaga,"" an impersonator. The singer-actress has found success in combining the uniqueness of being a little person with her determination to become a star. Who better to portray than Lady Gaga, who is known for her willingness to traffic in the unexpected? ""Gaga is so exciting to me because she's like an animal,"" Jolé says. ""As long as you are feeling powerful and emotionally driven for the night ... I would say that you are really taking the right steps to becoming 'mini-Gaga.'"" Not that Jolé doesn't consider herself a performer in her own right. Born in San Antonio to an average-sized family, Jolé has dreamed of a career in Hollywood for as long as she can remember. Along with the blond good looks and the big personality one might expect from a Texas rose, Jolé also has achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. The pint-sized performer decided early on not to let size stop her. ""I've grown up saying, 'Lord please, all I want to do is become a singer,' and I believe he has granted that wish,"" Jolé says. ""The fact that it's not exactly what I envisioned doesn't mean that I'm not still envisioning something more grandiose."" She first came to the public's attention in 2003 with an appearance on MTV's ""True Life: I'm a Little Person"" special, which chronicled her attempts to break into show business. After performing as a part of mini-KISS for a few years, she had an offer to perform at a party and was surprised that rather than be asked to come as ""an Oompa Loompa or something like that,"" the client bought into her idea of showing up as ""Mini-Britney Spears."" That launched her career as a Lilliputian look-alike, and soon she was appearing everywhere, from television shows like ""CSI: Las Vegas"" to touring with rapper T-Pain and Lil Wayne and starring in the Las Vegas show ""Little Legends."" On the big screen, Jolé has appeared in films such as ""Jackass 3D"" and ""Tales From Beyond."" She now has her own company, ""Mini-Popstars,"" with other small impersonators, including ""Mini-Beyonce,"" ""Mini-Michael Jackson"" and ""Mini-Vanilli."" And like any big star, she shies away from talking money and fees; she'd much rather focus on how fortunate she feels to be doing what she loves. ""I truly feel like this is so much like the rest of our lives in that if you believe that you can do it, put effort and work into it, then anything is possible,"" she says. Jolé has all the trappings of a celebrity: costume designer, manager, publicist and fans who love to be photographed with her. She has met Britney Spears (who Jolé says couldn't have been sweeter) and a quick search of the Web turns up a picture of Lindsay Lohan hanging with Jolé in her Mini-Britney gear. Jolé has spent hours volunteering with the nonprofit organization Little People of America, and she has written into her contracts a clause that says if the word ""midget"" is used she will walk. Yet there are still some in her community who aren't thrilled by her career. ""A lot of little people question me and state, 'It's so demeaning' and 'I can't believe you would do that; why don't you just do your own show?' "" she says. ""That's just like telling any other person why don't you just become your own famous person and see what kind of press you get. No matter who you are or what you are doing, you are always going to get some negative reaction."" Working the stage clearly gives Jolé a buzz. She's meticulous in her preparations. From the makeup to the outrageous costumes, she works hard to achieve the illusion, though she admits she doesn't look much like Gaga or Britney. As for the sound, Jolé says she sings most of the songs herself -- except for the last number in her act, when she is usually out of breath. Pulling off Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" is fairly simple given that the husky tune falls in Jolé's natural range. Besides, she says, fans get that she is more tribute performer than spot on. The biggest challenge, she says, is trying to replicate Gaga's sense of style. ""Everyone remembers the nude latex outfit that she wore at the Grammys when she came out of the egg,"" Jolé says. ""I couldn't find sheets of latex, but I found these heavy shower curtains that I thought would work. Bad idea. It was the worst costume malfunction known to man."" Even though Jolé sometimes gets confused with other little people like Amy Roloff, the mother on TLC's ""Little People, Big World,"" the singer says she enjoys a healthy fan base, especially in the gay community. Could it only be a matter of time before there is a Terra Jolé impersonator? Absolutely, if she has her way. ""This is like the practice round before I actually become the 'Terra Jolé Show,'"" she says, laughing.","Terra Jolé is an actress and singer who performs as ""Mini-Gaga""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Pentagon is portraying India as a major customer for U.S. military equipment, worth an estimated $6 billion in the past decade, even as U.S. companies are shut out of a multibillion dollar bid for fighter jets that India is starting this week. In the newest edition of a congressionally mandated report, the Defense Department signaled that it was hoping to interest India in its top-of-the-line and most expensive weapon, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, still being tested. Arms sales, as well as more frequent military exercises and exchanges, are seen as an important ways to cement ties between the two countries. But India doesn't always buy American. Recently, India considered and then rejected a major purchase of U.S. F-16 and F-18 fighters, a expensive setback for U.S. arms sales and the U.S. aviation industry. That deal -- now between the Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon -- is a reminder of the vast sums in play. ""With a potential contract price of US$9 billion to US$14 billion, this is the single biggest competition in the global defence aviation industry at the moment and offers both bidders a much-needed opportunity in a major market,"" said James Hardy, Asia Pacific Editor at IHS Jane's Defence Weekly said in a statement. Arms sales, as well as more frequent military exercises and exchanges, are seen as an important ways to cement ties between the two countries. The Defense Department downplayed any suggestion that arms sales and other contacts could backfire and that next-door Pakistan may feel new pressure both in its already-strained relationship with Washington and with its historical enemy, India. ""It's important that none of us think about relationships in this region as a zero-sum game,"" said Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Scher at the Pentagon. ""We have valuable relationships with Pakistan and valuable relationships with India and these things can co-exist."" Scher signaled that he hoped the relationship, and the arms sales would continue to grow. ""I think there is a great potential to do much more,"" Scher said in a briefing at the Pentagon. ""India sees the U.S. as a reliable defense supplier and we have been able to provide some top-of-the-line equipment. Is there some potential for more? Certainly there is. That is for the government of India to decide"" Lisa Curtis of the Heritage Foundation, a long-time observer of U.S. and Indian affairs, said the report should be a catalyst to deepen defense ties and possibly lead to a loosening of present export and licensing controls. ""The Defense Department offer to provide India with information on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter sends a clear signal that the U.S. considers India one of its most important future defense partners and is willing to consider co-production of some of its most sophisticated defense technology,"" Curtis told CNN. The Pentagon's government-to-government program of foreign military sales to India have included C-17 and C-130 aircraft, radar systems, Harpoon weapons and specialized tactical equipment. Any consideration of India's role in the region must include China and U.S. concerns about the Chinese modernization of its armed services especially its navy. ""The attention given to maritime security cooperation in the report should be seen in light of a series of maritime incidents in which Chinese naval vessels have challenged other countries' naval vessels in the South China Sea,"" Curtis said. ""It is clear that the U.S. views India as a leader in helping to maintain freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean region and will likely look for ways to enhance India's involvement in maritime security endeavors throughout the Indo-Pacific in the future.""","The Pentagon tells Congress it hopes to interst India in its most expensive weapon .

"Washington (CNN) -- A House panel voted Thursday to subpoena the White House for documents related to the solar energy company Solyndra. The House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on oversight and investigations voted along party lines, 14 to 9, in favor of issuing the subpoenas for internal documents regarding the decision to issue more than half a billion dollars in federal loan guarantees in 2010 to Solyndra, which later filed for bankruptcy. The decision followed a contentious debate among subcommittee members, with Republicans accusing the Obama administration of stonewalling, and some Democrats calling the subpoena resolution politically motivated. Rep. Cliff Stearns, the Republican chairman of the subcommittee, said the White House Office of Management and Budget earlier this year ""repeatedly failed to cooperate with our investigation and we agreed to put off a vote on that subpoena"" in hopes that engaging the White House could avoid the need for subpoenas. ""Only after repeated failed attempts to engage the White House did the committee notify the White House"" that it intended to discuss possible subpoenas, Stearns said. ""This finally got the attention of the White House counsel,"" who then met with lawmakers Wednesday, he said. ""Unfortunately, the White House was unable or unwilling to answer even the most basic questions."" Democrats slammed the subcommittee's move, though some acknowledged the White House could be more forthcoming with information in the case. Veteran Rep. John Dingell, D-Michigan, said after the vote: ""I've never seen a procedure quite like this."" ""We are protesting here a sweeping subpoena,"" he said. Since Republicans have ""been able to find nothing"" wrong in what they've looked at so far, they have ""increased the size of the net and reduced the size of the holes in the net as they go about this fishing expedition."" The White House accused the House panel of choosing ""a partisan route."" ""This administration has cooperated extensively with the committee's investigation by producing over 85,000 pages of documents, including 20,000 pages produced just yesterday afternoon,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement. ""Administration officials have participated in multiple briefings and hearings, and the White House has also already provided over 900 pages of documents in response to requests we have received. And all of the materials that have been disclosed affirm what we said on day one: this was a merit-based decision made by the Department of Energy."" Schultz called the subpoenas ""unprecedented and unwarranted."" Federal analysts looking at the proposed Solyndra loan in 2009 warned then of possible problems, as well as pressure from the White House to speed up a decision, according to a memorandum released last month by congressional investigators. Approved in May 2010, the Energy Department's loan allowed Solyndra to build a factory in Fremont, California, to produce state-of-the-art solar panels. Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in late August and closed its doors, however, putting more than 1,000 people out of work after it received $535 million in loan guarantees. The bankruptcy leaves the federal government unlikely to get the loan money back. President Barack Obama touted the company in a widely publicized visit last year. A source familiar with the congressional investigation said the White House has provided e-mail communications with details about who at the White House was looped in on the deal while red flags were being raised about the financial soundness of the company. White House Chief of Staff William Daley announced last week that he is ordering a 60-day independent review of the state of the Energy Department's loan portfolio. The review will include recommendations about how to improve the loan monitoring process. The review will be headed by Herb Allison, a veteran of both the Obama and last Bush administrations who oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), among other things.

"(CNN) -- There is no doubt that the three recent fatal shark attacks in Western Australia involve great white sharks. This species is known to inhabit the shallow waters along this coast and are known to migrate south around this time of the year to the seal colonies on the southwest coast. While they may stay around seal colonies -- their natural prey -- for months, they are not noted for sitting off a beach waiting for food to turn up. They are mostly individual, transient, inquisitive animals that will investigate objects in the water. Swimming, surfing or diving alone near aquatic animals (including seals and dolphins) far from the beach early in the morning or late in the evening may well attract a curious shark and increase the risk of encountering one. As the population increases and water-related activities become more popular, the number of people who go into the water every day also increases. But the chance of encountering a shark still remains very low. American killed in shark attack off Western Australia . Most Australians understand the risk when they enter the ocean. Over the past 50 years, only one person has been killed by a shark each year in Australia on average, compared to the 87 people who drown at Australian beaches on average each year, according to Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA). Therefore, the hysteria in the media surrounding a shark attack seems disproportional to other fatal incidents. Historically human-shark interactions predominantly occurred in the summer months. But in recent decades, swimmers, surfers and divers are continuing to pursue these activities outside of the traditional summer season because of improvements in wetsuit technology. This is reflected in the occurrence of shark attacks throughout the year since the 1950s; particularly for surfers, snorkelers and SCUBA divers who can enter the water at any time of the year and extend the time they spend in the water in areas that, in earlier decades, were likely to be too cold for recreational purposes. In the past 20 years, 49% of all shark-attack victims were wearing a wetsuit. There have been 26 attacks recorded in the cooler months (May-August) during the past two decades, resulting in six fatalities compared with 15 incidents -- resulting in four fatalities -- during the same months in the previous 20-year period. There is no suggestion that wetsuits in themselves are the cause of an attack, but rather that their use has allowed people to extend their time in the water, increasing the risk of encountering a shark. The frequency of attacks also reflects the popularity of water-based activities in harbors, estuarine areas and rivers, with people more likely to encounter species such as bull sharks, which have a propensity to inhabit shallow nearshore coastal areas, bays, harbors and rivers in summer months. In the vast majority of cases, sharks involved in an attack on humans do not stay around the area and can swim 80 to 100 km away by the next day. Unfortunately other sharks may later swim into the area and may be blamed for the attack. Hunting down and killing sharks on suspicion of being responsible is unjustifiable. However, if the animal can be identified and has not left the area, it would be appropriate to remove it. But once the animal swims away it would be almost impossible to know which shark was responsible. Shark attacks are a reality of entering the ocean, but it is worth emphasizing that they are very rare events. Even If you do encounter a shark, the chances of being attacked are very small.","A scuba diver became the third fatality from a shark attack in as many weeks .

"(CNN) -- McDonald's probably won't be exclaiming ""I'm Lovin' It"" in this case. McCurry restaurant owners A.M.S.P Suppiah and his wife Kanageswary Suppiah. In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food, McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant. McDonald's claimed that the prefix ""Mc"" in McCurry trampled on its trademark. The country's Federal Court on Tuesday ruled that it didn't. ""We're very relieved -- much, much relieved -- that this eight-year-old saga is finally over,"" said McCurry owner P. Suppiah. ""We're a typical South Asian-Malay cuisine. No way people walking into McCurry can confuse us with McDonald's."" The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare, such as biryani rice and fishhead curry. Its logo: a chicken flashing a thumbs-up. The eatery opened in 1999. McDonald's filed suit two years later. ""We were shocked that such a big giant wants to take us to court,"" Suppiah said. ""We felt that we had nothing in common, because we were not selling any Western fast food."" The hamburger chain, which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia, said McCurry was violating the prefix ""Mc"" and that McDonald's had the right to protect it. McCurry, in turn, said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe. Furthermore, it said, the ""Mc"" in McCurry stands for ""Malaysian Chicken Curry."" A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald's, and Suppiah appealed. An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling, prompting McDonald's to appeal this time. On Tuesday, the Federal Court -- the highest in the land -- held up the appeals court ruling. McDonald's said it accepts the judgment. ""We respect the finding of the court and beyond that have no further comment,"" said Liam Jeory of McDonald's Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations, with its slogan: ""Tasty and so Gooood.""","David-and-Goliath match-up in fast food world sees McCurry defeat McDonald's .

"(CNN) -- As filthy floodwater continued to seep towards central Bangkok, Thailand's Prime Minister laid out a three-point plan to get the country back on its feet after the worst flooding in 50 years. Immediate aid will be issued to people whose homes and businesses have been destroyed by the deluge which has claimed more than 500 lives since July, Yingluck Shinawatra announced Tuesday. ""This disaster is the biggest that we have ever met. We're trying to cope with situation and help as much as we can,"" she said. ""We can't stop all flooding but we will try to reduce the impact."" Aid packages will be offered to people to help restore homes and businesses as part of a short-term recovery plan over the coming year. Details are expected to be announced next week. Longer-term plans include the formation of two committees, one to oversee reconstruction and future development and the other to manage water resources. Yingluck acknowledged criticism of the official response to the disaster by setting herself a deadline of one year to win back public confidence. The prime minister's promises came as murky waters continued to move towards Bangkok's city center. ""The situation is quite serious. The water is making ground slowly but surely towards the heart of Bangkok,"" flood relief co-ordinator Rungsun Munkong told CNN. He said thousands of people were refusing to leave their homes despite orders to evacuate to outer provinces. ""I believe thousands of people are in their homes and are still not evacuating,"" Rungsun said. ""(They) possibly will be stranded with little food and water as time goes by."" Relief workers, distributing aid to evacuation centers in central Bangkok, said they were struggling to reach residents determined to wait out the crisis in tower blocks. ""I think it will be difficult down the road to get help to these people,"" Rungsun said. ""People need clean water, that's the first important thing. Cooked ready-to-eat food is also quite important, baby milk and so on."" Thailand has been inundated with its worst flood in half a century, affecting at least 25 of the country's 77 provinces. More than 500 people had been killed in the deluge according to figures released Sunday by the country's interior ministry. A Thailand Disaster and Mitigation Department report, issued Sunday and reported by MCOT, estimated about 3.1 million people have been affected and 4 million acres of farmland have been damaged. Moreover, the department said two people are believed missing and about 75 highways have closed. In the provinces of Nakhon Sawan and Ayutthaya, cleanup efforts were under way. On Sunday, the Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra visited Nonthaburi, near Bangkok. There, the government provided 100 boats to help transport people and disperse relief supplies after requests by local officials, according to MCOT. Despite public criticism of the government's overall response, Yingluck said she would not shake up her Cabinet -- in the short-term, at least. She explained that the focus first is to address the situation, with a full evaluation and possible shuffling to be done after the crisis abates, reported MCOT. Floods are an annual occurrence in the country but have been particularly acute this year, and some residents and analysts have criticized the government's response. ""Now the government is sending a mixed signal that the situation is fine, but the truth is it the situation far from over,"" political analyst Supong Limtanakul told CNN. ""It is a slow suffocating death of (the) Bangkok business area."" The city's main airport and two large industrial sites are also at risk, Supong said. Supong said the government did not have enough resources to deal with floodwaters, noting that officials had recently asked the private sector for water pumps to help drain water out of Bangkok. M.R. Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Bangkok's governor, told MCOT that it may take up to two weeks to drain water out of Bangkok's main roads, and months to drain water from smaller roads.

"(CNN) -- Political and anti-war activists in the Midwest said they were the target Friday of searches the FBI called part of an investigation into the ""material support of terrorism."" Warrants led to the search of five residences and one office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said FBI spokesman Steve Warfield, who said there were no arrests. Two other searches were conducted in Chicago, Illinois. Activist Tom Burke in Chicago said he and others in Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan were served subpoenas to testify before a grand jury. He also said computer hard drives were taken from locations in both cities, as well as a cell phone in Minneapolis. Warfield would not comment on that statement or provide details of the searches. He also would not discuss the investigation, other than indicating it is the work of a joint task force on terrorism. The Minneapolis searches were concluded by mid-afternoon Friday, Warfield said. Burke said many agents were still at a Chicago location Friday afternoon. A coalition of groups represented on the Fight Back website released a statement condemning the raids as ""harassment."" ""We see them as a way to impair our freedom of speech,"" said Burke, a member of the Colombia Action Network. ""We've done nothing wrong."" The coalition came together after a large anti-war protest at the Republication National Convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul in 2008, Burke said. ""We agree the U.S. should treat neighbors in peaceful ways,"" said Burke, pointing to conflict in the Middle East and Colombia. ""We think they [the FBI] are on a fishing expedition."" Among the groups the activists are involved with are the Palestine Solidarity Group, the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, the Twin Cities Anti-War Committee, and Students for a Democratic Society, which was active during the Vietnam War. One of the apartments searched in Minneapolis belongs to Mick Kelly, an anti-war and government protestor, CNN affiliate KARE reported. Kelly said the search warrant indicated agents were looking for evidence of his travels to Latin America and Palestine. Jessica Sundin of the Twin Cities Anti-War Committee told CNN agents took a hard drive, paper files, photos, a cell phone and her passport during a search of her Minneapolis residence Friday. Denying any wrongdoing, Sundin said she was given a subpoena to appear next month before a grand jury in Chicago. She said she will not cooperate with federal investigators, but will talk to lawyers before deciding whether to appear. Sending American weapons and troops abroad is not the solution to international problems, Sundin said. ""We've been unapologetic in our opposition to U.S. intervention,"" she said. The task force carrying out the raids comprised a number of local and federal agencies, KARE said.

"(CNN) -- A rumored rift between Iran's two most powerful leaders surfaced Sunday when Ayatollah Ali Khamenei overruled President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's acceptance of the resignation of the country's intelligence minister. The Fars semiofficial state news agency reported that Ahmadinejad had accepted the resignation of Heydar Moslehi as the intelligence minister, who oversees the crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran. A later Fars report said Moslehi was reinstated by Khamenei ""because the supreme leader opposed his removal from his post."" ""Following the reports in news websites belonging to the government that said Moslehi's resignation had been accepted by the president, he will remain in his post because the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, opposed the resignation,"" according to Fars. Under Iranian political tradition, the supreme leader appoints or approves the appointments of the ministers of intelligence, interior, defense and foreign affairs. The first indications of a rift between Khamenei and Ahmadinejad came in 2009, when Khamenei forced the president to remove his first vice president, who also is the father of Ahmadinejad's daughter-in-law.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Acts signed for October's tribute concert for Michael Jackson include Christina Aguilera, Leona Lewis, Smokey Robinson, Cee Lo Green and JLS, the promoters told CNN Thursday. Members of the Jackson family taking the stage October 8 in Cardiff, Wales, include several of Michael Jackson's brothers, ""the next generation of Jacksons,"" and 3T, which consists of Tito Jackson's three sons. Alternative rock band Alien Ant Farm and British R&B singer Craig David are also on the bill, while other artists will be added in the next few days, according to promoter Global Live Events. ""This announcement is just the beginning, we have many more to announce,"" Global Live Events executive Paul Ring said. ""This concert will unite various generations and musical genres, reminding everyone of just how amazing a talent Michael was."" With the ""Michael Forever: The Tribute Concert"" lineup now known, fans can start ""registering their interest for tickets"" online at http://www.michaelforevertribute.com/ beginning Thursday, the promoter said. A lottery will determine which fans will be invited to purchase tickets, it said. The concert in the Wales Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which seats 75,000 people, would be at least four hours long, Global Live Events CEO Chris Hunt said. Jackson matriarch Katherine Jackson and the promoter are scheduled to discuss the show's plans in a live broadcast on CNN Monday. The delay produced grumbling and doubts expressed on Jackson fan websites, but promoters hope the revelation of the lineup will satisfy them. ""Fans of Michael's music will get the concert they've been waiting for,"" Hunt said in a message posted on the promoter's website last week. Two of the five surviving Jackson brothers, Jermaine and Randy, objected to the timing of the show, issuing a sharply worded statement last month that reflected a deep division within the Jackson family. ""We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family,"" the two brothers said in a joint statement after their mother and four siblings endorsed the show. ""While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother, we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael's death,"" Jermaine and Randy Jackson said. The involuntary manslaughter trial of Michael Jackson's physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, begins in September and is expected to continue into October. While Katherine Jackson has previously said she would attend every day of Murray's trial -- as she did when her son was tried on a sex charge -- the promoter said the Jackson mother will travel to Wales for the concert. ""In light of this, we feel it is inappropriate to be involved with such an ill-timed event and its promoter, Global Live,"" Randy and Jermaine Jackson said. Their statement said the idea of the October concert was presented to the entire family in April ""as an idea already in its advanced stages."" The decision to go ahead with it ""disrespects opinions and wishes expressed in the strongest terms"" by some members of the Jackson family, they said. The Michael Jackson Fan Club agreed with the two brothers, issuing a similar statement. ""We share their concerns that this concert is taking place at a most inappropriate time when everyone's care and attention should be focused on the matter of justice. We believe that, as stated by Jermaine and Randy, the most important tribute we can give to Michael Jackson at this time is to seek justice in his name."" Jackson fans posted messages on the concert's Facebook page questioning ticket prices and the process for buying them. Fans must register for a chance to buy a ticket. While the website initially said the higher a pledge to a charity they make while registering, the better their chances of getting a good seat. It was later revised to say that donations are not mandatory and all applications will have an equal chance. A portion of the concert proceeds, particularly fan pledges, will go to charities, The Aids Project LA and The Prince's Trust, the promoters said. A spokesman for Michael Jackson's estate said last month that the promoters never sought or obtained permission from the estate's executors to use the late pop singer's name or image. ""The estate has not been contacted and is not involved with Global Live Events in the UK tribute concert announced today,"" spokesman Jim Bates told CNN.","Fans start registering for tickets Thursday .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- President Obama wrapped up an eight-day tour of Asia on Thursday, holding talks with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and speaking to American troops at Osan Air Base. Nuclear negotiations involving North Korea and Iran highlighted a news conference held by the leaders. Obama announced that he will send American envoy Stephen Bosworth to North Korea on December 8 for bilateral talks on dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear program. ""If North Korea is prepared to take concrete and irreversible steps to fulfill its obligations and eliminate its nuclear weapons program, the United States will support economic assistance and help promote its full integration into the community of nations,"" Obama said. ""That opportunity and respect will not come with threats. North Korea must live up to its obligations."" Obama also said the United States and its allies were working on steps to take against Iran after its apparent rejection of a nuclear deal. ""We have begun discussions with international partners about the importance of having consequences,"" Obama said. ""Our expectation is that, over the next several weeks, we will be developing a package of potential steps we could take that will indicate our seriousness to Iran. I continue to hold out the prospect that they may decide to walk through this door. I hope they do."" Iran rejected a key plank of a deal Wednesday designed to ease international fears that Tehran aims to build nuclear weapons. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said his country will not send its partly enriched uranium abroad to be turned into material for medical research, but added that Tehran might allow its nuclear material to be reprocessed inside Iran, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. The deal hammered out in November with the help of the U.N. watchdog agency aimed to reduce the amount of raw material Iran has to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran denies that it wants to do so, saying its nuclear program is to produce civilian nuclear energy and do medical work. During their news conference, Obama and Lee also expressed support for a stalled U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement. The deal was signed in 2007, but has yet to be ratified by the legislatures of either country. South Korea was the final stop on Obama's four-nation tour of Asia. Obama began his trip in Japan before traveling to Singapore, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic forum, meeting on the sidelines with world leaders including Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Obama then traveled to China, where he met with leaders including President Hu Jintao. After their talks, the two spoke of a common vision of shared responsibilities and economic opportunities. Trade, nuclear proliferation, climate change and the sticky issue of human rights were part of their discussions. Obama, whose flight will stop for refueling in Alaska, is due back in the United States on Thursday.","President Obama returning to United States after four-nation tour of Asia .

"London (CNN) -- French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama have come under fire after they were overheard talking rudely about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the G-20 summit. Sarkozy was overheard telling Obama: ""I can't stand him. He's a liar,"" according to French website Arret Sur Images. Obama is reported to have replied: ""You're tired of him; what about me? I have to deal with him every day."" The comments have provoked criticism in Israel and the United States -- but it is not the first time a prominent figure has been caught off-guard, on-mic. CNN looks back at 10 of the most infamous gaffes. Gordon Brown on 'bigoted' voter . Then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's 2010 election campaign was not going well, but he had no idea how much worse it was going to get when he stopped to chat with a voter a week before the poll. Gillian Duffy, then a 66-year-old pensioner, proceeded to berate Brown, explaining why -- despite having backed his Labour party all her life -- she was now ""ashamed"" to admit her political allegiance. Brown kept up a polite conversation with her as the TV cameras looked on, then drove away unaware his microphone was still on. Once inside the car, he complained to advisers: ""That was a disaster. They should never have put me with that woman... Ridiculous... Bigoted woman."" Brown later apologized, but went on to lose the election. George W. Bush to Tony Blair . Brown's predecessor, Tony Blair, was witness to one of the most famous on-mic blunders by U.S. President George W. Bush during a lunch meeting at the 2006 G-8 summit in Russia. Bush hailed the prime minister with the greeting ""Yo Blair!"" and thanked him for a recent gift of a sweater. He then began discussing the situation in the Middle East, offering a not-entirely-diplomatic solution to the difficulties between Syria and Israel. ""What they need to do,"" he told Blair, ""is get Syria to get Hezbollah to stop doing this s--- and it's all over."" George W. Bush on reporter . The 43rd President of the U.S. was no stranger to the gaffe -- entire books were written about his famous ""Bushisms"" -- and they were in evidence even on the election trail. At an Illinois campaign stop in September 2000, Bush was caught on camera referring to New York Times reporter Adam Clymer as a ""major-league a------"" -- to which his running mate Dick Cheney replied: ""Oh yeah, big time."" Bush later said he was sorry his comments -- intended, according to his advisers, as a ""whispered aside"" -- were overheard. ""I regret that the private comments made it to the public airwaves,"" he said. ""I regret people heard the comments."" Prince Charles on royal correspondent . George W. Bush is not the only one to have voiced his frustration and anger at a member of the media in an unguarded on-camera moment. Prince Charles got himself in hot water with the British press when he was caught muttering under his breath about a reporter to his sons William and Harry during a photocall on a skiing holiday in Switzerland in 2005. Taking exception to a question from the BBC's veteran royal correspondent, Nicholas Witchell, the prince complained: ""Bloody people. I can't bear that man. He's so awful, he really is."" The comment did little to repair Charles' fractious relationship with the media, and proved that gaffes can still offend, even when couched in polite language. Joe Biden to Barack Obama . U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is in a class all his own when it comes to putting his foot in it. In one of his most famous blunders, he was caught on tape dropping the F-bomb while congratulating Obama over the signing of the controversial healthcare bill in March 2010. Introducing the President to the media, he turned to hug Obama, and was heard whispering: ""This is a big f------ deal."" Jesse Jackson on Barack Obama . Obama has also been the target of on-camera slip-ups. In the run-up to the 2008 election, veteran civil rights campaigner Jesse Jackson was overheard accusing the then-Illinois Senator of ""talking down to black people."" During the taping of an interview for Fox News, Jackson whispered to a fellow pundit ""I want to cut his nuts off."" Jackson later apologized for his ""regrettably crude"" remarks, which became one of the immortalized soundbites of the campaign. John Major on colleagues -- and himself . Elections are fertile hunting ground for gaffes, as politicians battle for airtime and headlines, but then-UK Prime Minister John Major found himself in trouble in 1993 when he admitted he didn't understand why people kept voting for him. The day after members of his Conservative party had rebelled in parliament over plans to expand Britain's links with Europe, the normally unemotive Major was heard referring to the eurosceptic MPs as ""bastards,"" and threatening to ""crucify"" them. Speaking to a reporter after an interview -- when he thought the microphone had been switched off -- Major said he could not see ""how such a complete wimp like me keeps winning everything."" Jacques Chirac on British food . French President Jacques Chirac also had winning on his mind when he was caught out on tape, criticizing an entire nation in 2005. Chirac was playing a leading role in Paris's quest to host the 2012 Olympics when he tried to make the most of what he saw as a clear advantage over competitor city London: Food. ""The only thing that they have ever done for European agriculture is mad cow disease,"" he told Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. ""You cannot trust people who have such bad cuisine."" Predictably, the comments provoked the ire of the British tabloids, but the Brits had the last laugh days later, when London won the rights to stage the 2012 Olympics. Jean Chretien on U.S. politicians . Chirac is not the only politician to have risked cross-border conflict with an ill-advised on-mic jibe. Speaking to his counterparts from Belgium and Luxembourg at a NATO summit in Madrid in 1997, Jean Chretien, the then-Prime Minister of Canada, was overheard taking aim at his neighbors in the United States. Chretien was taped claiming that U.S. politicians would all be in jail if they worked in Canada or elsewhere, as they all sold their votes. Ronald Reagan on Russia . While Chretien's remarks did not prompt an attack on Ottawa, a joke by U.S. President Ronald Reagan at the height of the Cold War could have had much more serious implications. Taking part in a sound-check shortly before his weekly radio address to the nation in August 1984, Reagan ""announced"" to listeners: . ""My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I have signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. ""We begin bombing in five minutes.""","Nicolas Sarkozy overheard calling Benjamin Netanyahu 'a liar' at G-20 summit .

"Islamabad,  Pakistan (CNN) -- The American accused of killing two Pakistani men isn't a diplomat, as U.S. officials have said, but rather a CIA contractor in the country providing security for CIA officers, a U.S. government official said Monday. The revelation that Raymond Davis was working for the U.S. intelligence agency when he shot two men -- one of them in the back, according to Lahore police -- is a dramatic twist in a case that has already inflamed hard-line clerics and an angry public that wants the American tried in a Pakistani court. In protests since Davis' arrest last month, hard-line Pakistani clerics have condemned the shootings and demanded that the government not release the American. Despite the revelation of Davis' true line of work, U.S. officials on Monday renewed their argument that he enjoys diplomatic immunity and must be released. U.S. officials notified Pakistan that Davis had been posted to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad in January 2010, U.S. officials said. Pakistan's only recourse under international law is to order Davis out of the country, according to a senior U.S. official who briefed reporters on background Monday. ""Any other form of action, including a judicial action or any other proceeding, is inconsistent with his status,"" the official said. Davis was jailed January 27 after fatally shooting two men who pulled up to him on a motorcycle in a bustling Lahore neighborhood. U.S. officials and Lahore police said Davis told them he shot the men in self-defense. Evidence showed the two men may well have been robbers, according to police who found cash and cell phones linked to a robbery reported earlier that day. But Lahore's police chief, Aslam Tareen, has said witnesses told police that Davis kept firing, even when one of the men was running away. ""It was clear-cut murder,"" Tareen told reporters. That Davis was working for the CIA as a contract employee seems to explain the assortment of gear Lahore police reported finding in his rental car following his arrest. According to a Lahore police report, Davis' car contained 9mm pistol, five ammunition magazines, two cell phones, an infrared light, a digital camera, a telescope, a long-range wireless set and a survival kit. While acknowledging that Davis is a CIA contractor, the U.S. official said that Davis is not a case officer or paramilitary officer. ""Davis is a protective officer, someone who provides security to U.S. officials in Pakistan. Rumors to the contrary are simply wrong,"" the official said. The  U.S. official added ""any suggestions  that he was conducting covert operations  or personally leading efforts to target militant groups is  wrong."" But the  official said Davis could have been providing security for  CIA officers  who were engaged in covert operations . Davis is part  of the agency's ""global response staff,"" which is responsible for protecting  the safety of CIA operatives in other  countries. He was doing ""advance work,"" scouting areas of Lahore at the time of the shooting, the official said. Davis' role required him to ""know the environment."" He provided all  facets of security for case workers including  surveillance detection,  route surveillance and protection in potentially hostile environments, said the  official. The  36-year-old Davis is a former member of the  U.S. Army special forces and had  been employed by security firm XE Services, previously known as  Blackwater. Davis began  working for the CIA nearly 4 years ago. He was assigned  to Pakistan in  late 2009. He was living with other security personnel at  a safehouse  in Lahore before  the shooting incident. Until Monday, U.S. officials had described Davis only as an employee who was attached to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and who was working at the U.S. Consulate in Lahore at the time of the shootings. Formally, they continue to describe him only as a member of the ""technical and administrative staff"" of the embassy. The U.S. government has had ongoing conversations with Pakistan's government about Davis' security, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday. ""Clearly, we hold the government of Pakistan fully responsible for his safety,"" Crowley said. A U.S. official said Davis is being held in a facility with 4,000 other prisoners, some of them militants. Pakistani officials have moved Davis to a separate part of the prison and taken away guards' guns for fear one might kill the American, the U.S. official said. Dogs are even being used to taste and smell Davis' food to ensure he is not poisoned, according to the official. Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently traveled to Pakistan in part to express ""our deepest sorrow for the loss of life"" and underscore Davis' diplomatic immunity. Members of Congress have told senior Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid are in jeopardy unless Davis is released. But Crowley said Monday no such action is currently being contemplated. The U.S. supplied more than $1.5 billion in nonmilitary aid to Pakistan in fiscal year 2010.

"(CNN)  -- Attackers firebombed three churches in the southeast Asian nation of Malaysia overnight, assaults that come amid widespread Muslim ire over a court ruling that allowed Christians to use the word Allah as a term for God. Malaysian news reports said no casualties have been reported, and police have promised to step up security for churches and other places of worship. But the acts stirred unease in the diverse society -- where 60 percent of the people are Muslim, 19 percent are Buddhist, 9 percent are Christian and 6 percent are Hindu. ""We regret the irresponsible actions of certain extremist elements for the recent spate of firebombs thrown into church premises. These actions display their immaturity and intolerance toward others within a multi-racial society,"" the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship of Malaysia said in a statement. The violence comes as Muslims protest a recent court ruling that allowed a Catholic newspaper to use the word ""Allah"" for God. Muslims believe Allah, an Arabic word, should only be used by Muslims. A stay has been placed on the order on the grounds of national interest. Muslims took to the streets Friday to protest the use of the word by non-Muslims, and authorities such as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called for the matter to be resolved in court amicably and expressed hope the protests don't deteriorate. ""We should not raise the tension level in this country,"" he said Thursday, as quoted by Bernama, the Malaysian National News Agency. Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, Malaysia's head of state, on Friday called for calm and the spirit of unity, according to a Bernama report. The three churches attacked were in the Kuala Lumpur region. They are the Metro Tabernacle Church, the Assumption Church and the Life Chapel. The attacks occurred late Thursday night and early Friday. ""It's incumbent upon the Malaysian government to investigate the church bombings and to prosecute the perpetrators of this religiously motivated violence,"" said Leonard Leo, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent federal agency that makes recommendations to Congress and the president regarding how to handle violations of religious freedom around the world. ""There are many parts of the world where Christians do use the world 'Allah' in their translations of the Bible,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""So the Malaysian Supreme Court ruling that overturns the government's ban on the use of the word is not inconsistent with what the practice would be elsewhere around the world. The Malaysian ban is what's unusual, not the court's ruling.""","Muslims oppose recent court ruling allowing a Catholic newspaper to use the word ""Allah"" for God .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon moved closer Wednesday to its next military trial on the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the suspected ringleader of the deadly bombing of the USS Cole. Saudi-born former millionaire Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri is charged with the 2000 bombing in the Yemeni port of Aden that killed 17 sailors, wounded dozens and crippled the warship. The ""referral of charges"" by the Defense Department Military Commissions unit sets in motion a chain of events that will lead to the appointment of a military officer as the trial judge in the case and a meeting of the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers in coming weeks. The arraignment will take place within 30 days. A statement from the Defense Department said the charges against al-Nashiri allege that he was in charge of planning the attack, which took place October 12, 2000. ""The convening authority referred the charges to a capital military commission, meaning that if convicted, al-Nashiri could be sentenced to death,"" the Defense Department statement said. The news release also mentions charges against al-Nashiri related to an attempted attack on the USS The Sullivans in Yemen in January 2000 and an attack on a French tanker in 2002 that resulted in the death of one crew member. One of al-Nashiri's civilian defense lawyers said his legal team was disappointed in the government action. ""We are disappointed the United States will now descend further down the path of expedient and secret justice that military commissions have come to represent,"" Rick Kammen said in an e-mail. ""We're not talking about a constitutionally adequate trial, and we are disappointed that the U. S. government will use the constitutionally inadequate military commissions process to seek the death penalty against Mr. al-Nashiri,"" Kammen wrote. He added that the decision to move forward with the case ""regrettably confirms to the world that the United States intends to render second-class justice to the men imprisoned in Guantanamo."" Earlier, lawyers for al-Nashiri argued that his waterboarding and other mistreatment while in U.S. custody and delays in his case should have forced the government to drop any plans for a military trial that could end in a death sentence. ""By torturing Mr. al-Nashiri and subjecting him to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, the United States has forfeited its right to try him and certainly to kill him,"" the brief said. ""Through the infliction of physical and psychological abuse, the government has essentially already killed the man it seized almost 10 years ago."" Al-Nashiri's legal team, comprising military and civilian lawyers, made the arguments to the ""convening authority"" of the military court, retired Vice Adm. Bruce MacDonald. The commission was brought into existence by President George W. Bush and overhauled by President Barack Obama. In legal papers obtained by CNN, al-Nashiri's lawyers presented details of their client's treatment, saying that, in addition to subjecting their client to waterboarding, his questioners revved a power drill by his ear and chambered a round in a handgun, all while he was naked and hooded. ""The government has admitted to waterboarding Mr. al-Nashiri and subjecting him to verbal and physical threats to his life and threats to the safety of his family,"" the brief says. ""Both set of acts constitute torture."" If it goes to trial, the case will be the first full prosecution under the military commission system. It is seen as the latest fine-tuning of the system before the military commission moves ahead with prosecution of other terrorist suspects, especially the four men accused of plotting the September 11 attacks. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a news release restating its ""concerns about the inherent unfairness of the military commissions."" ""Unlike federal courts, military commissions have unfairly lax rules for allowing evidence, except when it comes to torture -- the commissions may admit coerced testimony, while evidence of the torture that produced it can be censored,"" said Denny LeBoeuf, director of the ACLU Capital Punishment Project. This latest step for the Guantanamo detainee comes as the new chief prosecutor for military commissions, Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, is taking over. Martins was first in his class at West Point, was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law. He will have the chance to put his stamp on the job amid renewed scrutiny of both the military trials and the Guantanamo Navy Base detention facilities. In a recent Weekly Standard profile, Martins is portrayed as the man the administration hopes will bring new credibility and legitimacy to the system. He has powerful friends, including his former commander, Gen. David Petraeus, now CIA director. Petraeus gave Martins the job of cleaning up the military detention and interrogation system in Afghanistan, and Martins delivered. In an effort to polish the reputation of the military commission system, both inside the United States and internationally, Martins may push for greater transparency of the process. He could roll out a plan the Pentagon has been working on for months to provide closed-circuit television transmissions of the military proceedings to victims, families and journalists in the United States. There would be a ""kill"" switch in the control room to wipe out the audio in case any national security secrets were blurted out in the courtroom. Al-Nashiri is one of 171 detainees remaining at Guantanamo.","The man suspect of being behind the attack on the USS Cole will go on trial .

"(CNN) -- Coffee shops in the Dutch city of Maastricht have banned foreign tourists, except those from Germany and Belgium, from entering their premises from Saturday, according to the local association of coffee shops. Coffee shops in the Netherlands are places where customers can legally buy and consume cannabis. ""We have put in place a 'neighbouring country' criteria,"" Marc Josemans, president of the Society of United Coffeeshops and owner of the Easy Going coffee shop, told CNN. ""This is a form of self-regulation. It is not a law, there will be no judge, this was just the only choice we had."" The move comes after Maastricht's city council decided that something had to be done about the 2.2 million visitors that come to the city every year, according to Josemans. ""The visitors put a lot of pressure on the city when they come here and make it very busy on our narrow streets. So the city said that something had to be done about the traffic and nuisance,"" he said. ""But the biggest nuisance isn't the number of coffee shops or the clients, but the illegal drug runners that can be quite aggressive and start fights and rob the tourists."" All visitors to Maastricht's coffee shops -- some 6,000 a day, almost three-quarters of whom are foreign, according to Josemans -- already have to show their passports and their information is then kept for 48 hours. Now only those with a Dutch, German or Belgian passport will be allowed in. ""A number of people will leave disappointed, and we are not very proud of refusing entry to visitors who have come to our shops for the last 28 years and never caused a problem,"" said Josemans, who has himself used cannabis for 35 years. ""The question now will be if they instead buy from the illegal drug runners here or if they buy illegally in their own countries."" Nobody from Maastricht city council was available for comment Saturday. A spokeswoman for Maastricht police told CNN that the police were not a party to the ban and that it is not illegal for foreign tourists to enter the city's coffee shops. The spokeswoman, who is not named in line with department policy, said police would not carry out any identity checks to enforce the ban. ""We will just go about our normal business and carry out our duties where needed,"" she said. At spokeswoman at the tourist office for Maastricht, which lies near the Belgian border, said it was not aware of the new rules. The Society of United Coffeeshops decided on the ban in July but it only came into effect October 1. The organization is also working on a plan to move seven of the city's 14 coffee shops to the outskirts, where foreign tourists can then go and buy hash and marijuana, Josemans said. ""But the first relocation won't happen until June 2013, so we had to put this ban in place now, and we could then change it again once we've completed the relocation. ""At these new sites, the parking (areas) will have direct access to the coffee shops, so the drug runners can't approach the clients as they walk to the coffee shop."" Josemans also says the Dutch government wants the coffee shops to operate on a smaller scale and is planning to impose a nationwide ban on anyone who doesn't hold a Dutch passport buying cannabis. ""They want to put this 'weed pass' in place from January 1 next year, but we are strongly against this."" A press release on the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice website from May this year says coffee shops will become private clubs where only adult Dutch citizens can become members. ""The Cabinet expects that closure of coffee shops to foreign drugs tourists will ensure that they no longer travel to the Netherlands to purchase and consume cannabis. After all, many of them can use the illegal markets available in their immediate surroundings,"" the press release says. The statement does not give a date for the implementation of the new measures. CNN's calls to the Dutch justice ministry were not immediately returned. But Josemans says cannabis supply is not only a Dutch problem. ""This is also the responsibility of the other European governments; nobody is taking responsibility for those millions of customers who want to buy cannabis for their own use,"" he said. ""It is time to get their heads out of the sand to get a decent drugs policy in place to address this problem.""","Maastricht city authorities say they need to cut visitor numbers .

"(CNN) -- You could say Chris Nsamba has always been something of an overachiever. By the age of 16 he'd already won three science competitions for adults. Now in his late 20s, the Ugandan is still dreaming big: He hopes to build and launch the first African manned shuttle into space. ""It isn't about money, it isn't about competition or pride,"" said Nsamba, founder of the African Space Research Program. ""The mission is about advancement in space technology as a continent and what we can contribute towards that growth."" While the group's plans are ambitious, they are starting at the beginning of the aerospace ladder. To test their engineering skills, Nsamba and his team are finishing off the first Ugandan designed and built aircraft. But for Nsamba the sky is not the limit. ""We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny,"" he said. He says the program's slogan, ""Slowly We Get Smart and Quickly We get Old,"" sums up why his efforts are so important. ""United as one, the knowledge we acquire today will help generations of tomorrow, and perhaps save our future generations from some kind of catastrophe,"" he continued. Nsamba has a team of over 600 volunteers, many of whom are engineering students, who work on the project in his backyard. Uganda doesn't have a history of space exploration and Nsamba is teaching the aspiring astronauts himself. ""This is not a one-man mission. We work jointly to achieve goals,"" Nsamba said. ""I have trained my crew (in) advanced astronomy. They are very good at astronomy in regards to calculations and identifications of various space objects."" As well as his astronomy lessons, he's educating them about the dangers of space, such as re-entry and the harms of radiation. But while the team may be knowledgeable, they lack the tools and machinery to properly get the project off the ground. It's all down to money, but this could be about to change. The Ugandan Government's Science and Technology department has told CNN that the state is going to start providing financial support to the program. ""You can call it a public-private partnership but mainly driven by the young people whose passion is in space science. I applaud their ambition,"" said Richard Tushemereirwe, a spokesman from the department. ""It provides an opportunity for Africans in general and Ugandans in particular to participate in space science and research instead of being spectators,"" he continued. A team of flight engineers from the Ugandan Civil Aviation Authority has also been assigned to review and advise the team. Tushemereirwe wouldn't disclose how much funding the group will receive. But until now the project has been funded by well-wishers from around the world. Nsamba says equipment has been donated to them and anything else the team needs they make it themselves. ""Recently we manufactured and launched a prototype thruster, a small shuttle engine in a prototype format,"" Nsamba said. One of the donors to the program is Lauren Stewart, a financial analyst from Texas. Stewart discovered the group online and immediately wanted to be involved. ""When you listen to the news you never hear good news from Africa, it's always sadness, so this is a light,"" she said. ""They are trying to do something on a positive side rather a negative side compared to what I'm used to hearing."" Stewart is now trying to raise the group's profile in the States. ""I want people to trust them and get involved so they can be part of history,"" she said. Despite the challenges the team faces, Nsamaba remains confident they'll have a space shuttle built in four to six years. He's already named it ""The Dynacraft."" ""It will first operate in Earth's lower orbit then advance with time,"" he said. ""We might not have money in our system but we do get our homework done!""","The African Space Research Program is based in Uganda .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- At London Fashion Week, all eyes are usually on the clothes. Egyptian Azza Fahmy is one of the Arab world's preeminent jewelry designers . But the Arab and Islamic-influenced brooches, bracelets, necklaces and rings adorning the models heading down Julien Macdonald's catwalk are also getting attention. They are part of a collaboration between the fashion powerhouse and former British Designer of the Year and Egyptian jewelry designer, Azza Fahmy. ""I really love the craft and the skill and the romance that goes into the pieces. So, that teamed with my sense of high octane glamour and my London high living twist is a great mix and a contrast. And that's what I like,"" Macdonald enthused to CNN. In return, ""Azza Fahmy Jewellery"" gets international exposure, to the likes of Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal and OK!. But don't -- as one London paper did -- call the catwalk collection ""designer bling."" ""It's quite a deep and nice collection -- not bling bling. I hate bling bling collections,"" Fahmy exclaims. Starting at $250 to 'the sky's-the-limit', Fahmy's pioneering blends of gold, silver and precious stones, makes her one of the Arab world's preeminent jewelry designers. The only problem is, a mere 30 percent of these 'jewels of the Nile' are sold outside Egypt -- Fahmy was missing out on the lucrative Gulf Arab market. One of the challenges of marketing designer jewelry in the Middle East is getting past the traditional mentality that measures an item's worth not by exceptional finishes but by its weight in grams and karats. To do well in the East, Fahmy and her daughters Fatma and Amina steered the family business to the West. It started with the Julien Macdonald collaboration, and now exclusive Western stores like Kabiri, Harrods and Harvey Nichols are selling their jewelry. Arabs tend to imitate Western spending habits, paying big money for luxury foreign items like Bulgari or Cartier -- but they don't give the same attention to their own Arab brands. Fahmy believes that as her jewelry becomes popular in the West -- more Middle Eastern buyers will follow suit. The marketing strategy seems to be working. Her team says the collections now sell in the U.A.E., Qatar and Bahrain. Next stop -- Saudi Arabia. ""To have a product which stands beside Cartier, etcetera -- it's a challenge. But we are sure of the ourselves because we are presenting something special, something which is different from all these brands,"" Fahmy said. At her workshop on the outskirts of Cairo, Fahmy's craftsmen work in the belief they're turning precious metal into something different -- art. Fahmy's daughter, Amina Ghaly, works for the family business as a designer and says there's value in the design, the marketing and workmanship poured into each item. ""At least 20 to 25 people will have touched that piece just to have one perfect piece at the end,"" Ghaly explained. In the 60's, Fahmy was the first woman to apprentice in Egypt's jewelry district. The one-time government employee used to run a one-woman shop in her spare time. Today, more than 180 employees drill, solder, hammer and file under her watchful eye, crafting two to three thousand pieces every year. The luxury goods market is a crowded one, as Fahmy well knows: ""Like any business, it's not a joke,"" says the designer. Going to the West to find a better footing in the East is seriously savvy move. A move that could lead to future success on the catwalk -- and with more consumers worldwide.","Azza Fahmy is Egypt's preeminent jewelry designer .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A United Nations court has found that the United States violated an international treaty and the court's own order when a Mexican national was executed last year in a Texas prison. Jose Ernesto Medellin was executed by lethal injection for raping and murdering two girls aged 14 and 16. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a ruling Monday in an unusual case that pitted President Bush against his home state in a dispute over federal authority, local sovereignty and foreign treaties. Mexico had filed a formal complaint against U.S. state and federal officials . ""The United States of America has breached the obligation incumbent upon it"" to stop the execution, the ICJ announced in a unanimous opinion. Jose Ernesto Medellin's death by lethal injection in August followed a 15-year legal dispute after his conviction for two brutal slayings. At issue was whether Texas and other states had to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and resentencing. Bush made that request reluctantly after the international court in 2004 concluded that Medellin and about 50 other Mexicans on various states' death rows were improperly denied access to their consulate upon arrest, a violation of a treaty signed by the United States decades ago. Their home countries could have provided legal and other assistance to the men had they been notified, the court said. In a separate judgment, the ICJ declined Mexico's demand that the United States provide guarantees against executing other foreign inmates in the future. The U.S. Supreme Court last March ruled for Texas, allowing the Medellin execution to proceed. Efforts stalled in Congress last summer over legislation that would have given foreign death row inmates like Medellin a new hearing before any punishment could be carried out. State Department officials have said the international ruling will not help other foreign inmates in U.S. prisons, because federal officials cannot force states to comply. Administration officials also said that the president did all he could to force state compliance and that Congress now needs to intervene with specific legislation. Medellin was 18 when he participated in the June 1993 gang rape and murder of two Harris County girls: Jennifer Ertman, 14, and Elizabeth Pena, 16. He was convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death. The prisoner's lawyers argued that Mexican consular officials were never able to meet with the man until after his conviction. Only Oklahoma has commuted a capital inmate's sentence to life in prison in response to the international judgment. Days after Medellin died by lethal injection, Texas executed Honduran native Heliberto Chi Acheituno, who also said his treaty rights were violated. The ICJ in 2004 ordered the United States to provide ""review and reconsideration"" of the sentences and convictions of the Mexican prisoners. That world court again in July mandated that the United States do everything within its federal authority to stop Medellin's execution until his case could be further reviewed by American courts. Based in The Hague, Netherlands, the ICJ resolves disputes between nations over treaty obligations. The 15-judge panel is the principal judicial organization of the United Nations, laying out rights of people detained in other nations. The Supreme Court appeal turned on what role each branch of government plays to give force to international treaty obligations. After the ICJ ruling, the United States pulled out of that international court's jurisdiction in matters arising from the Vienna Convention. In allowing the Medellin execution to proceed, the Supreme Court majority noted congressional ""inaction"" on the issue, efforts that had ""not progressed beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the ICJ ruling.""","Jose Ernesto Medellin executed in Texas by lethal injection last year .

"(CNN) -- French shoemaker Christian Louboutin is seeing red -- and will likely be seeing a lot more of it -- after a  judge in Manhattan denied an injunction that would have kept fellow designer Yves Saint Laurent from selling shoes with red soles. The lawsuit, filed in June, takes issue with four specific shoes from YSL's Cruise 2011 Collection: the Tribute, Tribtoo, Palais and Woodstock models, claiming the shoes violate Louboutin's trademarked ""lacquered red sole."" ""Everyone sees the flash of red and associates the red with Louboutin,"" attorney Harley Lewin said Thursday about his client. In fact, Louboutin's red soles have graced many a red carpets, adorning the feet of celebrities Oprah Winfrey, Heidi Klum and Sarah Jessica Parker. In 2009, Jennifer Lopez wrote a song about them, ""But it's the last time, I'm movin' on, I'm throwing on my Louboutins."" In his decision Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero acknowleded that in choosing a red sole for his shoes, Louboutin had ""departed from longstanding conventions and norms of his industry,"" to create a product, ""so eccentric and striking that it is easily perceived and remembered."" However, Marrero went on to say that, ""Louboutin's claim to the 'the color red' is, without some limitation, overly broad and inconsistent with the scene of trademark registration."" ""This was a trademark that never should've been issued,"" David Bernstein, attorney for the defendant, Yves Saint Laurent said. He adds, ""YSL has been using red since the 1970s, other designers have used red on the soles of their shoes. They aren't doing so to confuse people, but because it's a design aesthetic."" Lewin thinks the judge went too far. ""This is no longer about the case,"" he said. Judge Marrero's decision drew parallels between painters and fashion designers, calling them both members of a creative industry where no one should be barred from using color to achieve their aesthetic. Doing so could, ""interfere with creativity and stifle competition."" Bernstein agrees. ""No designer should be able to monopolize a color."" There have been cases when companies have copyrighted color. Owens Corning, for example, has the trademark for pink fiberglass. Marrero said industrial products are different because the application of color is simply to distinguish one manufacturer from another. Lewin says his client ""separated his shoes from everyone else's by using a red sole."" Lewin said he's never had such an outpouring from his fellow attorneys, law professors and members of the fashion industry, telling him, ""This [verdict] is an abomination. Tell your client to appeal."" On August 17, both sides will meet for a case management conference, and Lewin says he will announce his plans to do just that. ""This is not over,"" Lewin said, ""Not by a long shot.""","Judge won't stop Yves Saint Laurent from selling shoes with red soles .

"(CNN) -- I appeared on a couple of segments on CNN this week where the topic was the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations. A question raised was whether this was political. The Republican/tea party spokesperson said yes, arguing that labor unions were behind it (in fact the labor unions did not join until this week). I said it was economic, but political in the sense that you have a political party -- the GOP -- entrenched with the wealthy and Wall Street while doing nothing to protect middle-class America. But I was wrong. It is not economic. And it is not political. It is personal. Executive pay is now about five times higher than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation. The average salary for the rank-and-file American worker, however, is about the same as it was in 1980. Really? Does American exceptionalism exist only at the top 1% of our workforce? Did our CEOs really get 5 times better than they were in 1980 and our workers remain just ho-hum average? I don't think so. Neither does the rest of America. When there is this kind of disparity while these same CEOs are paying taxes at a rate lower than their secretaries, their receptionists, and the people who clean their offices, it is personal. When he was chair of the DNC, my former boss, the late Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, used to say in his stump speech that we live in an era where ""the rich got richer, the poor got poorer, and the middle-class got squeezed."" This was back in 1992. It could not be truer today. While President Obama has not done things perfectly, he has injected some fairness and balance into the economy to spur growth and job creation. More needs to be done, but his attempts have been met mostly by gridlock and a GOP that only wants to see him fail. In the meantime, corporate profits are at an all-time high, but corporations are paying lower taxes than ever before. Some aren't paying any at all. This week, we see banks tacking on extra fees -- which, contrary to what they argue, would lead them to 13% more in profits than they were making before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act went into effect. At the same time, CEOs, while also making record amounts of money (the average CEO makes $11 million a year while the average person makes $40,000), have laid off millions of Americans while sending our jobs overseas. These are not nameless, faceless Americans. They are our neighbors, our friends and even our families. It is personal. Republicans continue to protect this twisted system. And to add insult to injury, Republican legislators and the GOP presidential candidates want to eliminate the protections the middle class gained from the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed by Democrats and signed by Obama. Does the crash of 2008 ring a bell? Are Republicans really advocating that the greed of Wall Street be put before the needs of the American people? Yes, and here's why: In the 2010 election cycle, corporations spent over $275 million getting politicians elected and spent almost $3 billion lobbying them. While some of those donations went to Democrats, the vast majority went to Republicans. It's no wonder Republicans want less government accountability and more tax giveaways for billionaires and giant companies -- that's what their corporate donors demand. I, for one, take it personally. So does Obama. The second question I was asked this week was whether the demonstrators had a ""candidate"" in the race. They do. President Obama. He acknowledges Americans are angry. He knows times are tough and he continues to fight to restore some much-needed protections for exactly the people in that crowd at Wall Street. He and Democrats want more balance in the system. One way of getting there is the Buffett Rule -- Obama's proposal, named after billionaire Warren Buffett, that those making more than $1 million pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than the rest of us. Critics scream ""class warfare,"" and decry the attacks on the ""job creators,"" and cry ""socialism"" as they continue to preserve this unjust system that is giving rise to what could be a powerful and sustained movement. Here are my answers: . Class warfare? You bet. As Buffett has said so eloquently, this country has been engaged in class warfare for decades, and guess what? His class won. It is now time to stand up and fight for fairness for the middle class and a balanced approach for working-class families, who have labored just as hard as America's top CEOs but have not had the same kind of increases in salary. On job creators? Who are they? The majority of job creation comes from our small businesses, none of which are raking in the salaries of the top 1% of wealthy Americans. So asking the top 1% of wealthy Americans to pay their fair share and pay at least as high a tax rate as their workers is not class warfare or an attack on ""job creators"" or socialism. It is in fact the American way. And America agrees. Meanwhile, in the greatest country in the world, Latino children now rank highest in child poverty rates. Latinos and African-Americans suffer from much higher unemployment rates than others. With all this taken together, is it any wonder that our masses could be giving rise to our own ""spring""? While it is no Arab Spring, the movement is spreading. Not economic, not political, but personal. Republicans would do well to take it personally too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Cardona.","Maria Cardona says Occupy Wall Street is not political or economic; it's personal .
She says protesters railing against corporate greed, status quo of unfair taxation .
She says GOP supports system, thwarts Obama's attempts at protection for middle class .

"New York (CNN) -- The first two weeks of the NBA's regular season have been canceled, as basketball players and management have yet to reach a deal on a new labor agreement, Commissioner David Stern announced, according to NBA.com. The two sides remain far apart, Stern said from the NBA meetings. He added that no further talks are scheduled. Derek Fisher, the president of the NBA Player's Association, said the entire season may be in jeopardy. And the association's executive director, Billy Hunter, said the owners are more dug in than in the past. The commissioner had warned last week that such a cancellation may well be coming, at which time Los Angeles Lakers' guard and NBA Players Association President Derek Fisher acknowledged the stakes. ""We know our backs are against the wall in terms of regular season games and what those consequences will be,"" he said then. The league's owners began a lockout of its players in early July. Stern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players. The league lost as much as $300 million in the 2010-11 season, according to the commissioner. Less than a week ago, the NBA canceled its preseason, which meant the loss of about $200 million in revenue, Stern said. One of the battles has focused on the owners' rejection of the players union's call for an average $7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal. The current average salary is about $5 million. Other big issues include a fight over a move by owners to get a bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap. The last work stoppage occurred in 1998.","NEW: The Player's Association says owners are more dug in than in the past .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords joined about 50 dignitaries and family members Thursday in Washington to mark the retirement of her husband, Capt. Mark Kelly, from the U.S. Navy. Kelly, 47,enlisted the military in 1987 and served as a combat and test pilot before joining the U.S. space program. He was part of space shuttle flights in 2001 and 2006, and then commanded ones in 2008 and again in May. The last one took place several months after Giffords was among 13 people wounded in a shooting at a constituent event outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket. Six others -- including a federal judge and a child -- were killed. Since then, the Arizona Democrat has been mostly out of the public eye and in intense rehabilitation in Arizona and Texas. One exception, prior to Thursday, was her August 1 return to the Capitol to cast a vote to raise the nation's debt ceiling. She attended Thursday's event inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, located next to the West Wing of the White House, along with her congressional chief of staff, Pia Carusone, plus her and Kelly's mothers and his two teenage daughters from a previous marriage. Sporting glasses, black pants, running shoes and a brace on her right hand, Giffords smiled as she entered to prolonged applause and sat in the front row. Kelly officially retired from the Navy on Saturday. Thursday's event to commemorate the occasion was attended by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and several other members of Congress. At one point, Giffords helped present her husband with the Legion of Merit and Distinguishing Flying Cross medals, in honor of his fourth space shuttle mission. Vice President Joe Biden presided over the ceremony, attaching a Legion of Merit pin to Kelly's jacket and later offering remarks. ""It's not every day you encounter examples of sheer, sheer courage and selflessness and dedication like you see in this couple,"" he said of Giffords and Kelly. Kelly also spoke, extending thanks to those who have offered their ""boundless friendship and optimism"" over the past eight, trying months. And he made a plea for NASA to ""remain a permanent part of the fabric of this great country."" The former astronaut gave flowers to his daughters and wife, then addressed her in front of the crowd. ""Gabby, you remind me every day to deny the acceptance of failure,"" he said. ""I look forward to the next phase of our life together and watching all of your future achievements."" Kelly announced his retirement in June, writing then on his Facebook page that he wanted to devote more time to helping Giffords recover from her injuries and spend more time with his daughters. ""This was not an easy decision. Public service has been more than a job for me and for my family,"" he wrote.","Captain formally retired from the U.S. Navy on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The tragedy of Ireland's violent past seemed close to the surface this week as an Irish presidential candidate was confronted about his former role as an IRA commander, and Britain's prime minister talked with a family about a Catholic victim of ""the troubles."" Irish presidential candidate Martin McGuinness was confronted Monday by a man claiming to be the son of a soldier killed by the Irish Republican Army in the 1980s, as McGuinness campaigned ahead of Election Day, October 27. David Kelly confronted McGuinness in Athlone, Ireland, demanding answers about his father, Patrick Kelly, who he said had been shot dead with a trainee police officer as they attempted to rescue a kidnapped businessman in the Republic of Ireland in 1983. As shoppers and the media looked on, Kelly demanded that McGuinness name the killers, to which McGuinness replied, ""I don't know who was responsible for the killing of your father."" Kelly then accused McGuinness of having been a member of the IRA's ruling Army Council at the time of the killing -- which McGuinness denied. ""You are a liar. I want justice for my father,"" Kelly said. McGuinness, a former IRA commander and now a leader of the political party Sinn Fein, stepped down from his position as Northern Ireland's deputy first minister to run for president of the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, while the Republic of Ireland is an independent state. Meanwhile, on Tuesday the widow of murdered Catholic Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane and other family members will hold talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron about their demand for a public inquiry into his 1989 killing. The family says they suspect the British government sanctioned the killing. Finucane, 39, had represented IRA members in many high-profile cases, but he had also represented pro-British, or loyalist, terrorists. He was gunned down by a loyalist gang at his Belfast home, in front of his wife and three children. His family has long believed the security forces cooperated with the killers. The man convicted of Finucane's murder was a police informer. John Finucane was the youngest at the family dinner table on the day of the killing, just 8 years old. Now a lawyer himself, he will also attend Tuesday's meeting at Downing Street. ""The meeting is at the request of the prime minister and we expect to be told what his intentions are,"" he told CNN. ""We are optimistic and hopeful he will announce there is an inquiry and the inquiry is one we can engage with. We are cautiously optimistic, but there have been let-downs over the past 22 years."" Finucane says he has ""absolutely no doubt"" the state was involved in his father's murder. ""That's not just my opinion, that's the opinion of Sir John Stevens, the most senior policeman in England, when he examined it. It's also the opinion of Peter Cory,"" a retired Canadian judge, ""who was tasked with looking at the evidence in the case to decide whether an inquiry was necessary. So it's not just my family that believe there was collusion. ""I think it's pretty much accepted that there was collusion in my father's killing."" The question, he said, is ""how high up the chain of command that went."" Finucane added that, ""in the absence of a transparent examination of all the relevant evidence, I believe it went as high as the office where I'm going to meet the prime minister."" The British prime minister at the time was Margaret Thatcher. While the almost daily violence of the 1970s and 1980s is a thing of the past in Northern Ireland, remnants of ""the troubles"" remain. Some terrorist splinter groups remain active and even have the capacity to kill. Still, the current campaign is on a much smaller scale than in the past. Sinn Fein, viewed as the IRA's political wing, is now a key player in the peace process and shares power with its former bitter enemies, pro-British lawmakers, in a coalition government in Belfast. But this week's events show how old wounds still haunt and divide the island. Finucane believes facing the past is the key to continuing progress. ""The issue of the past is the single most important issue that has the ability to bring both sides of the community here back to a very dark place,"" he said, ""and unresolved cases like my father's do nothing but damage the present society.""","Man confronts Republic candidate demanding answers for his father's killing .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Army on Wednesday will report that while the number of suicides in the active-duty force declined in 2010, the number of suicides in the Army Reserve and National Guard increased, a senior Army official said. The increase in Reserve and National Guard suicides is among troops who are in the United States and not activated for duty. The senior Army official said more than half of those troops were never deployed to a war zone. The official said one possible explanation for the increase in suicides is economic pressure and rising unemployment, but he emphasized that the Army simply does not have answers. The official noted that for Guard and Reserve personnel who live as civilians back in their communities, the Army is not able to provide the same type of suicide awareness and prevention programs that are available to active-duty personnel. The decline in active-duty suicides, even though slight, may be initial evidence that those awareness and prevention programs are helping, the official said.","Report on suicides is to be released Wednesday, senior Army official says .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Nearly 700 patients and 100 employees at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta have been exposed to tuberculosis after coming in contact with a hospital employee carrying the disease, a hospital spokesman said Thursday. The Georgia Department of Community Health and the hospital have identified 680 patients who were exposed to tuberculosis between November and February, said hospital spokesman Lance Skelly. Patients will begin getting tested for tuberculosis next week, Skelly said. To date, no patients or employees have reported symptoms of tuberculosis, he said. The hospital and the department began notifying people about the exposure this month, after an Emory employee was diagnosed in April with the infectious disease, he said. The employee did not know he had tuberculosis when he came in contact with employees and patients, the hospital said. The hospital took extra precautions by contacting patients who were in the hospital for 90 days before the day the employee is known to have developed the disease, Skelly said. ""That is a major reason the numbers are so much higher."" All hospital employees are screened for the disease and must receive screenings each year, it added. A hospital statement did not say whether the employee had been screened. About 11 million people in the United States are infected with latent tuberculosis, which is symptom-free and is not contagious. Of those, 5 to 10 percent go on to develop active tuberculosis, which can be spread to others through the air, such as through coughing or sneezing.  It can be fatal if not properly treated. Symptoms of tuberculosis include chest pain, a bad cough (possibly with blood), weakness and a fever. While tuberculosis usually impacts the lungs, the kidneys, brain and spine may also be affected. Both the number and rate of tuberculosis cases has been on the decline since 1993, according to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The number of reported deaths nationwide dropped from 644 in 2006 to 544 in 2007, the most recent year for which such data is available, the CDC said.","NEW: Number and rate of TB cases has been on the decline since 1993, CDC says .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys representing Casey Anthony invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 60 times during a deposition given in a civil suit against her, according to a transcript of the proceedings. In addition, Anthony's attorney Charles Greene asserted he would also invoke the Fifth Amendment on her behalf if questioning delved into the 2008 death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. Anthony, who was acquitted in July of murder charges in Caylee's death, is being sued in civil court by a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez. When Caylee was reported missing in July 2008 -- a month after she was last seen -- Anthony maintained she had been kidnapped by her nanny, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Authorities were never able to find the nanny. But they did find Gonzalez, who claimed she never met Anthony or her daughter. Gonzalez's attorneys claim, according to questions asked of Anthony in the October 8 deposition, that Gonzalez was questioned by the police in Caylee's disappearance, was kicked out of her apartment complex, lost her job and that she and her two daughters received death threats as a result of media attention in the case. Anthony herself said little in the deposition, but did acknowledge she was aware she was being sued by Gonzalez. She also said she has not spoken to her brother, Lee, in the past six months, and has not spoken to her parents, George and Cindy Anthony, since October 14, 2008. However, Greene did not permit her to answer questions including whether she had ever met Gonzalez; whether a person named Zenaida was ever a nanny to Caylee; or whether defense attorney Jose Baez's assertion during Anthony's criminal trial, that Zenaida Gonzalez was one of Anthony's ""imaginary friends,"" was true. She also was not allowed to answer questions about whether she considered herself a good mother to Caylee; the last day she saw the 2-year-old alive; and whether she drowned in the Anthonys' pool in June 2008, as the defense claimed during Anthony's criminal trial. Asked why he was invoking Anthony's right against self-incrimination, Greene said, according to the transcript, ""I need not explain our factual basis other than to tell you that it could tend to incriminate and provide a link in the chain of evidence that could be used against (Anthony)."" Asked by Gonzalez's attorney John Morgan what pending criminal case that applies to, Greene said, ""We made our objection and that's all I'm going to state."" Morgan told Greene he anticipates a hearing before a judge on a motion to compel Anthony to answer some of these questions. Greene said that taking it to a judge is ""the best thing to do."" While Anthony was acquitted on murder charges in Caylee's death, she was convicted on four counts of lying to authorities investigating the child's disappearance. She was given credit for time already spent behind bars, however, and was released from jail July 17. She has remained in seclusion since then, although a judge ruled she must serve a year of probation stemming from her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges. The transcript of the deposition notes that Anthony participated via videoconference from ""an undisclosed location."" ""I hope that you and your counsel understand that we did not ask questions that many people may have wished we did concerning your employment history then or now, where you live, where you stay,"" Morgan told Anthony as questioning wrapped up. ""... We did this, this deposition, in pursuit of truth and not in pursuit of sensation."" Anthony has also been ordered to repay more than $217,000 to authorities for the costs of investigating Caylee's disappearance. In Session's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","Anthony says she has not spoken to her parents in years .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 28-year-old California man pleaded no contest Thursday to stalking actress Halle Berry, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. Richard Anthony Franco of Commerce was sentenced to 386 days in county jail, but received credit Thursday for 193 days already served and won't do any more time, prosecutors said. Franco was also sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to undergo a year of psychological counseling, the prosecutor's office said. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dennis Landin also imposed a 10-year criminal protective order, prosecutors said. As part of a plea deal, one count of first-degree residential burglary was dismissed at sentencing, prosecutors said. Franco pleaded no contest to one count of stalking. In July, Franco allegedly showed up several times at Berry's Hollywood Hills home. He was arrested after she reported a possible burglar, according to police. At the time, off-duty officers hired by Berry called police and said they were holding a burglary suspect at her home. A resident there identified him as the same man who had climbed over a locked security gate into the property several times over a few days, police said. Both times, he had claimed he was ""there to see somebody,"" but left after a Berry employee ordered him out, police said.","Richard Anthony Franco is sentenced to time already served .

"London (CNN) -- August 13 is likely to be Heathrow Airport's busiest day in its history, so the airport is building a temporary terminal to check through more than 10,000 athletes on that one day, the day after the closing ceremonies of the London 2012 Games. With 80% of Olympic and Paralympic athletes, coaches, media and other visitors expected to use Heathrow during the games, the world's busiest international airport unveiled the design of a temporary terminal to be used just for departures. ""The airport ... already operates close to capacity,"" said Nick Cole, the head of Heathrow's Olympics planning team. ""Every part of the airport is working together to ensure we can give the athletes a warm welcome and ensure all passengers enjoy the atmosphere."" London has had a relatively smooth seven years of planning and building venues. The one big worry for organizers and the city is transport. There are plans to limit car traffic while creating special Olympics-only traffic lanes. Officials have also asked companies to find ways to keep some employees out of central London and off the busy transport networks during July and August. In recent years, Heathrow has suffered from baggage snafus, snow disruptions and strikes. To help get people out of London after the games, Heathrow will allow athletes to check their luggage at the Olympic Village east of the city. Heathrow expects a 35% increase in baggage on August 13. Departure will not be the only challenge. The airport expects nearly 50% more passengers arriving on July 26, the day before the opening ceremony. That includes 390 athletes bringing in 780 firearms, says Heathrow.","The day after Summer Olympics end is expected to be the busiest in Heathrow's history .

"New York (CNN) -- Protesters upset about corporate greed rallied in New York's Times Square Saturday night, marking the 29th day of a movement that is tapping into popular frustrations about income disparities and an ailing U.S. economy. People hoisted signs in the iconic square and chanted. At one point, police began clearing a part of the street when a van pulled up and officers began making arrests. Police said they had given the crowd several warnings to disperse. Forty-two people were arrested in Times Square, bringing the total number of protesters arrested in New York City on Saturday to 70, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. Two police officers were injured in the Times Square confrontation and sent to a hospital for treatment, he said. Other people were arrested during the day for pulling down barriers and five were arrested for wearing masks, Browne said. As police cleared the street, protesters chanted, ""We are peaceful protesters"" and ""The whole world is watching."" The demonstration in Times Square was one of several that took place in the United States and around the world on Saturday. Protesters took to the streets again in Lower Manhattan earlier in the day. The group waved flags and banged drums, while keeping up an online presence that has helped spawn similar actions elsewhere. Others joined the demonstrations, yelling slogans of discontent over Wall Street influence, Beltway politics and their own seeming lack of opportunity amid U.S. unemployment levels that continue to hover above 9%. ""Banks got bailed out, we got sold out,"" chanted protesters as they meandered east of the city's Zuccotti Park, considered a home base for the Manhattan protesters. Columns of police on patrol and atop scooters monitored the march, but as dusk fell, it appeared largely peaceful. Earlier, an ""Occupy Wall Street"" spokesman said police made several arrests outside the LaGuardia Place Citibank in Lower Manhattan, after several protesters tried to enter the bank to withdraw cash and close their accounts. Police, meanwhile, said they made 24 arrests after protesters refused to comply with a bank manager's request for them to leave. On Friday, scores were detained during scuffles with authorities during similar protests in several American cities, including Denver, Seattle, San Diego and Washington. Reports of violence, however, were rare. In Los Angeles, protesters and police alike reported good relations Saturday -- and in recent days. Amber Barrero, 22, a student, said she has been participating in the Occupy Los Angeles movement since Day One, or October 1. Police have been quite friendly, Barrerro said. ""When we're occupying, they donate bread, snacks and water,"" said Barrerro, who attended Saturday's rally in Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles. Added Mark Simon, 63, an unemployed bookstore employee: ""So far, they've been very well behaved. The police are still the police, and they are part of the 99%,"" referring to the vast majority of Americans enduring a troubled economy. As demonstrators walked the near mile from City Hall to Pershing Square -- and then back -- police were peppered on the periphery, and there were many moments when none was in sight. John Sherman, assistant commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department, said the force established a working relationship with the protesters, and ""they approached us in the very beginning,"" he said. Added one officer: ""We're continuing to have a good relationship with Occupy L.A. If we get too close, they may feel threatened. They're cooperating with us, so we're cooperating with them."" Among the more distinctive figures at the Pershing Square rally was Rev. Danny Fisher, a minister at a Buddhist temple in Rosemead, who wore his full vestment. ""Religious leaders often speak very idealistically, but I think it's important to be available and let people know we hear them and we know they're upset,"" he said. He wore his vestment so ""people know they can approach us and see that religious figures are here,"" he added. In Lower Manhattan Saturday, union groups such as the United Auto Workers also joined the loosely defined movement. ""I know why I'm here,"" said New Jersey resident Tony Buontempo. ""I am surrounded by people that are losing their jobs. The government, the establishment, doesn't get it. They've literally abandoned us."" Melissa Rice, a college-age protester, said she was marching ""for all the young people who... can't afford college, and all the elderly who can't afford to take care of themselves."" Protester Jonathan Signey claims the monthlong protests are ""rooted in targeting those financial institutions that tanked our economy in 2008, made a profit out of it, and have not been held accountable by anybody."" Signey argued that ""corporate power has come to dominate politics"" and blamed institutions such as the investment firm Goldman Sachs for ""selling these packages of derivatives, that they knew were junk, to everybody, and at the same time betting against them."" Goldman and other firms underwent intense scrutiny in April this year after a U.S. Senate report found that it had misled clients and later Congress about short-selling securities linked to the housing market just prior to the 2008 financial crisis. The investment house has said the report exaggerated the bets, and -- along with other firms -- has been subject to high job losses in the wake of the crisis. Earlier this week, the New York state comptroller announced that Wall Street was projected to lose 10,000 jobs by the end of next year, totaling 32,000 from January 2008 to the end of 2012. Demonstrators, meanwhile, continued to congregate at the privately owned Zuccotti Park, serving food and holding signs in protest of corporate greed and a long list of other, often ambiguously defined, concerns. ""Debt is slavery,"" one sign read. ""Need over greed,"" read another. On Friday, the demonstrations seemed to pick up steam around the country, then began spreading to city streets in Europe, Asia and Australia. Firefighters battled a blaze at an Interior Ministry building near Porta San Giovanni in Rome on Saturday, the main gathering site of Italian protesters taking part in the Occupy movement. In Germany, France and the United Kingdom, protesters marched, listened to speeches and displayed banners reading anti-corporate slogans, including the now ubiquitous ""we are the 99%,"" ""Banks are cancer,"" and ""tax the rich 1%.'"" Europeans turned out amid debt troubles and austerity plans in Greece, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Germany, that analysts say have contributed to volatility in U.S. markets.

"(CNN) -- If you didn't know that Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro and Stephen Perkins were members of Jane's Addiction, you might think they belonged to three different bands -- and Farrell is the first to admit it. ""One guy's just a ball of sunshine. That's Stephen,"" the singer said. ""Then Dave is like a black hole sometimes, like places where he goes. And me? I'm just like a pingpong ball put in the cosmos, man."" And that, ladies and gentlemen, pretty much sums up the genius of Jane's Addiction -- the friction of three disparate parts rubbing together, until finally, it explodes into a glorious musical fireball. It's a chemical reaction that, throughout the band's 26-year-history, has all too often imploded as well. ""I'm not really sure how many times we've parted ways,"" said Navarro, the group's guitarist. ""I wasn't really one of the people who thought we wouldn't be back together, primarily because we've gotten back together so many times over the years. We don't break up anymore. We just go on five-year hiatuses."" The alternative rock pioneers are prepping the October 18 release of ""The Great Escape Artist,"" their first studio album in eight years. ""The sound is definitely updated on this album,"" Farrell said. ""The differences are that we are now working with synthesizers and computer software that goes with guitars, so you'll hear a lot of very modern sounds mixed in with what people call the ageless, or timeless, sound of Jane's Addiction."" With original bassist Eric Avery, Jane's Addiction put a soundtrack to the gritty Southern California underground arts scene of the late 1980s. The group's first studio album, ""Nothing's Shocking,"" was an examination of love, lust, violence and drugs. By 1990, the band was all over rock radio with ""Stop!"" and ""Been Caught Stealing,"" a pair of hit singles off its sophomore disc, ""Ritual de lo Habitual."" The new CD is only the group's fourth studio album. ""We pull from the environment,"" said drummer Perkins. ""Jane's Addiction wrote our (first) music in Hollywood in 1986. You hear Los Angeles. You hear that Mexico is only 100 miles away from us. You can hear the struggle, and also the glory, of being a musician in L.A. Our music was never negative, but it had that strong urge. You wanted to go f**k, not to go punch. And I think Jane's still has that."" CNN visited the band during a video shoot for the new single, ""Irresistible Force,"" on a Hollywood soundstage. Farrell, the lyricist, said the song chronicles how the universe was created. ""I say the big bang was actually a conscious act of cosmic lovemaking."" Perkins, the pragmatist, has a different interpretation. ""To me, the 'Irresistible Force' is what pulls me, Dave and Perry together. Ever since I was 13, I've been playing with Navarro. I met Perry when I was 17. And no matter how much we stopped playing with each other, and tried to get away from each other, it's the magnet -- it pulls us closer."" The band members discussed their reunion and new album and how they've avoid fistfights for nearly two decades: . CNN: How does it feel to have Jane's Addiction back together again? Perry Farrell: I love performing with Jane's Addiction. I hope I get to do it all my life. It's healthy for bands to take a break every now and then. People are really looking forward to this new record because they're a little starved. I'm pulling the old woman's trick of making them want, and want, and need and desire. CNN: Who's the peacemaker who calls and says, ""Let's try this again?"" Dave Navarro: I don't really know how it happens. I'm all about peace, but it's like with any family. If there's a conflict in a family, and it's Thanksgiving, and everybody gets together, and you have a few drinks and you start chatting with the family member that you have a problem with -- next thing you know, it's all water under the bridge. Stephen Perkins: If we're not getting along, we don't just stay together because we're getting paid for it. But when we like each other, the music sounds better, and it feels better to cash those checks when you're doing it with friends. Navarro: The old stuff percolates, of course, but the tools we have as adults are different to handle it, you know what I mean? When you're younger, you're not as equipped -- or at least we weren't equipped -- to handle diverse personalities. What seemed a big deal at 19 is way less of a big deal in your 40s. CNN: So no awesome fistfights lately? Navarro: No, no. People keep asking about that. That was done in like '91. That was done a long time ago, and I don't even have any recollection of that. CNN: Maybe that was part of the problem. Navarro: That probably contributed to the problem. (Chuckles) CNN: Do you think you'd still be making music if you had continued to live the way you were living? Navarro: Well, I can't speak for anybody else about that, but I certainly feel that any day above ground is a blessing. Been through a lot. CNN: How do you think you guys would have held up through the scrutiny that's part of today's culture? Navarro: When Jane's Addiction got started, it was the '80s, and there weren't cell phones, and there weren't people chasing people down the street with cameras, and there wasn't the Internet, and there wasn't cable news the way it is now. And I don't know if we'd be where we are, quite frankly, if there was, because we had some what I'd like to call 'colorful times.' You know, the less widely reported, the better. CNN: In order to generate press sometimes, you can't be just a musician. You have to be a musician/celebrity. Navarro: I didn't write the book, but I read the book that earlier had been written by Tommy Lee. CNN: Are people meaner now? Navarro: Back in the old days, there was no ""commenting"" section. Whatever comments you had were up here (points to his head), or you told your friend. It wasn't like public fodder. So yeah, people are meaner now. Sure. But you've got to take the attitude of, ""OK, we're in a blessed position."" You can't ask the world to entirely love you. CNN: The story of Jane's Addiction is very rock 'n' roll. Farrell: We've definitely had some dark moments. What would a story be without the dark moments? Part of the greatness of any story is that you can rise up out of that darkness and shake off the dust and the dirt. CNN: How are things different now? Farrell: Socially, we've never really hung out, although these days, I'm inviting the guys to things that I do just because I love 'em. But we definitely go to different parts of the universe. Some bands, they all have to like the same thing, and as a result, the sound is very linear, and once the time passes, they sound dated. When it comes to our prescription, we like to have different elements of music and influence coming together. That's what makes a new sound. Perkins: Jane's Addiction used to be the only thing in my life, and now, I've got so many other things. My pie has got a few slices. There isn't just one slice. But it's always got whipped cream on it, and it's always really warm, and I can't wait to get another bite of it.","The alternative rock pioneers are prepping the release of ""The Great Escape Artist""

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Al Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility Tuesday for a string of attacks that killed almost 70 people and wounded more than 200. The seemingly coordinated explosions Thursday struck during the height of morning rush hour, hitting a number of Baghdad's primarily mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods. Nine car bombs, six roadside bombs and a mortar round all went off in a two-hour period, targeting residential, commercial and government districts in the Iraqi capital, police said. ""The series of special invasions launched, under the guidance of the Ministry of War in the Islamic State of Iraq, to support the weak Sunnis in the prisons of the apostates and to retaliate for the captives who were executed,"" the group said on an al Qaeda website. Iraq's leadership is dominated by Shiite Muslims, including Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The country's Sunni minority held power under former leader Saddam Hussein. A recent political crisis has raised fears of a return of the sectarian bloodshed in Iraq that ripped the country apart at the height of the war a few years back. On December 19, al-Maliki, a Shiite, ordered the arrest of the Sunni vice president, a move that escalated sectarian tensions and threatened to collapse Iraq's fragile power-sharing government. The political turmoil as well as the recent spate of violence erupted just days after the final U.S. troops withdrew. Violence in Iraq has declined in recent years but last week's attacks were among the worst since August when a series of coordinated bombings killed at least 75 people in 17 Iraqi cities.","The claims are made on an al Qaeda website .

"(CNN) -- The saga of Jack the cat, the lost pet that roamed New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for weeks before being found last month, has an unhappy ending. The feline had to be euthanized Sunday evening, American Airlines announced on Facebook, where the cat's plight has attracted thousands of followers. ""We are deeply saddened that Jack the cat has passed away, and we offer profound sympathy to Jack's owner, Karen Pascoe, for her loss,"" the airline wrote. ""From all of us at American, our sincere apologies to Karen and Jack's family and friends."" It was less than two weeks ago the airline announced that Jack had turned up in Kennedy's customs room after being missing for two months. The carrier originally described him as ""well,"" but a health check revealed a number of problems. ""Jack had extensive wounds on the back of his body, and the wounds were unable to heal because his skin had deteriorated due to the malnutrition that occurred while he was lost,"" said Pascoe's friends in a post on ""Jack The Cat is Lost in AA Baggage at JFK,"" the Facebook page devoted to the cat, which has more than 24,000 followers. ""Jack had been through so much, and the last thing anyone wanted was for him to suffer more."" The saga started August 25 when Pascoe was flying from New York to San Francisco with Jack and a second cat as part of a job relocation. But Jack escaped his kennel and was last seen at Kennedy's inbound baggage claim. (A Department of Transportation Pet Incident Report released last month explains how it happened: A clerk placed one kennel on top of another on a baggage cart and the kennel on top fell. The impact ""caused the kennel to separate,"" allowing the cat to escape.) When a search failed to turn up Jack after a few days, Pascoe became frustrated with American and started the Facebook page ""to help us put pressure on AA to step up their efforts."" She also urged fliers to ""do whatever they can do to keep their animals out of cargo."" The airline said it did everything it could to find Jack. While the cat was missing, workers placed food and water around the airport and set up humane traps. American even hired a pet detective and issued a pet Amber Alert in hopes of locating the feline. When Jack was found, the airline promised to cover his veterinary bills. The cat's owner hopes Jack's death will spur improvements in how airlines transport pets ""so that no one else ever has to go through this again,"" her supporters wrote on Facebook.","Jack, the lost cat who roamed an airport for two months, has been euthanized .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats proposed Friday tax incentives for businesses hiring veterans as well as job training for all service members leaving the military. The measure was unveiled as the next piece in President Obama's jobs bill and as a remedy to unemployment among veterans. ""It would basically make sure that our veterans are not standing at the back of any unemployment line,"" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan) told reporters. ""It's important that we support our troops not just by lip-service but by action, and we intend to act next week."" Noticeable absent from Friday's Democratic proposal is the job bill's controversial millionaire's surtax, which would increases taxes on those with incomes of more than $1 million. Republicans have roundly rejected the surtax, saying it would hurt small businesses and stunt economic growth. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told reporters they would utilize ""existing pay-fors,"" or revenue streams, that have been used to fund veterans' issues. ""What we did is bring together Republican and Democrat, House and Senate, congressional and administration ideas in putting this package forward. I think it uses the best of everyone's ideas and will make a real difference for veterans,"" said Murray. ""Veterans are not a partisan issue. They are something we can all get behind."" A major component of the bill would offer tax credits to companies hiring jobless veterans -- up to $2,400 in credits for hiring veterans out of work for more than 4 weeks, up to $5,600 for hiring veterans out of work for more than six months, and up to $9,600 credit for employing veterans with service-connected disabilities looking for work for more than six months. The bill would also make mandatory jobs skills training for every service member moving into civilian life and also offer older veterans additional Montgomery GI benefits for training programs at community colleges and technical schools. ""It is quite frankly shameful that veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a higher unemployment rate than the rest of America,"" said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Montana). A cost estimate for the bill was not immediately available. Murray said Democrats plan to attach the veterans' measure as an amendment to House-passed bill that eliminates the 3% withholding requirement for government contractors -- a bill that House and Senate Republicans say would create jobs. While Senate Republican aides indicated the veterans' assistance proposal and the absence of the millionaire's surtax were encouraging, they were cautious and said they would need to see the proposal's details, including how it would be funded. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Senate Democrats eliminate controversial millionaire's surtax from jobs bill .

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed Tuesday it intends to refer the latest allegations of corruption involving officials of world football's governing body FIFA, to its ethics commission. According to a report by the BBC, Issa Hayatou -- who is a long-term IOC member, the FIFA vice president and the president of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) -- accepted $15,000 as a bribe in 1995 from a marketing company. The IOC responded to the claim by requesting the evidence the British broadcaster had gathered on the African executive for further analysis. ""The IOC has taken note of the allegations made by [the] BBC and will ask the program makers to pass on any evidence they may have to the appropriate authorities,"" the body said in a statement to CNN. ""The IOC has a zero tolerance against corruption and will refer the matter to the IOC ethics commission,"" the statement added. Cameroonian Hayatou was one of three FIFA officials -- including Nicolas Leoz from Paraguay and Ricardo Teixeira from Brazil -- who were named by the BBC as having taken bribes from the ISL marketing company who went onto secure valuable World Cup rights in the 1990s. All three are due to cast votes to decide which nations will play host to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in a ballot at FIFA headquarters on December 2. Hayatou said Tuesday that he was considering legal action over the BBC claims. He told Press Association Sport: ""This money was not for me it was for the 40th anniversary of CAF. ""At that time ISL was the sponsor of CAF and they give the money to CAF and not to me, and the executive committee of CAF accepted it and approved it."" The latest developments follow the suspension of two other FIFA executive members in November -- Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Tahiti's Reynauld Temarii -- after allegations by British newspaper the Sunday Times that both had accepted bribes for their vote. In contrast to the IOC's stance, FIFA said that it would be taking no further action. ""The investigation and the case are definitely closed,"" it said in a statement Tuesday, adding that the allegations had already been investigated by Swiss authorities. ""In its verdict of 26 June 2008, the criminal court of Zug had not convicted any FIFA officials. ""It is therefore important to stress again the fact that no FIFA officials were accused of any criminal offence in these proceedings."" England's 2018 bid team, who have been concerned that the fall-out from the corruption allegations would damage their chances of hosting the World Cup, claimed the program was ""an embarrassment to the BBC."" Worried about a backlash from FIFA members, the bid team wanted the BBC to delay the broadcast until after Thursday's decision, but their plea was refused. ""We stand by our previous position that the BBC's Panorama did nothing more than rake over a series of historical allegations none of which are relevant to the current bidding process,"" it said in a statement Tuesday. Michel Platini, the president of European football governing body UEFA, offered England some comfort. ""I don't think this (program) will have an effect, no,"" he told gathered reporters after a UEFA meeting in Zurich Monday. But he added: ""I think what may affect the decision is the atmosphere going back a long time and what people have been writing about FIFA in the British press for many years."" The 22 members of FIFA's executive committee will be choosing between bids from England, Russia and joint bids by Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium to decide who will host the 2018 World Cup. Australia, the United States, Japan, Qatar and South Korea are bidding for 2022.","The IOC confirms it will pursue the latest allegations of corruption involving FIFA officials .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Call it a case of high tech meeting low tech, really the lowest of tech. Satellites are locating penguin waste, which is easier to find than the penguins themselves . British scientists are using pictures from high-powered satellites to pinpoint emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica. The penguins are difficult to pick up on sea ice, because of their natural camouflage that helps them blend into the shadows -- so the British Antarctic Survey had to come up with another method. Fortunately, penguin waste shows up nicely from space, staining the ice a light brown. ""We can't see actual penguins on the satellite maps because the resolution isn't good enough,"" said mapping expert Peter Fretwell. ""But during the breeding season the birds stay at a colony for eight months. The ice gets pretty dirty and it's the guano stains that we can see."" The method helped scientists identify 38 penguin colonies -- of those, 10 were new. Of previously known colonies, six had re-located and six were not found. ""This is a very exciting development. Now we know exactly where the penguins are, the next step will be to count each colony so we can get a much better picture of population size,"" said penguin ecologist Phil Trathan. ""Using satellite images combined with counts of penguin numbers puts us in a much better position to monitor future population changes over time."" Estimates put the total number of penguins at between 200,000 and 400,000 breeding pairs.","British scientists are using a new way to pinpoint penguin colonies in Antarctica .

"(CNN) -- Thai authorities are considering the construction of a super-express waterway through Bangkok to prevent future floods similar to the one that has crippled the Thai capital and brought manufacturing in other parts of the country to a standstill. A team of disaster experts from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok is now investigating permanent solutions to the disaster that has left hundreds dead. ""One of the urgent solutions is a super-express floodway,"" Thanawat Jarupongsakul, from the university's Unit for Disaster and Land Information Studies, told the Bangkok Post. Under the plan, existing natural canals -- some of them more than 100 kilometers (62 miles) long -- would be linked in a 200-km ""super-highway"" that would divert the course of floodwaters from the north. The super-canal would hold 1.6 billion cubic meters of water and drain run-off at a rate of 6,000 cubic meters per second -- the equivalent of two and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools a second. ""This idea is much cheaper than digging a new river as a floodway,"" Thanawat said. He said the proposed scheme would involve the construction of a kilometer-wide exclusion zone next to the floodway to prevent properties from being inundated, and a raised highway on both side of the canal. The super-express floodway would then drain upstream run-off directly into the sea. The university team is also looking at other flood-prevention measures such as a better early-warning system, improved water resource management, a flood tax, the use of a flood-risk map for urban development and groundwater-use controls. ""Now, the government must stop [trying to] solve flood problems with political methods,"" Thanawat told the Bangkok Post. He said poor water management rather than excess rain had caused this year's severe flooding, adding that natural swamps in the west of Thailand's Central Plains, which once absorbed water flow, had been developed into industrial and residential areas, blocking the natural floodway. While giant flood tunnels in the Bangkok metropolitan area could drain floodwater from the city, they could not cope with a massive inundation from the north. ""If there is no step forward, foreign investors will eventually disappear from the country and the next generation will be still worried whether flooding will happen or not,"" he said.","Thai authorities consider super-express waterway to prevent future floods .

"(CNN) -- President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other top Democrats are heading back to school Tuesday, in hopes of convincing first-time voters from the 2008 election to vote again in 2010. The president is scheduled to headline a Democratic party rally at the University of Wisconsin in Madison while the vice president is the main attraction at a similar event at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania. The idea is to fire up ""surge"" voters and motivate them to go to the polls again in this November's midterm elections. According to national exit polls from 2008, 11 percent of people who cast ballots in the presidential contest said they were first time voters, and seven out of 10 of those new voters said they backed Obama in the election. Many of those people were young voters, and exit polls indicated that two-thirds of people age 18-29 voted for Obama. In advance to Tuesday's rallies, the president held a conference call with college and university journalists. ""You can't sit it out. You can't suddenly just check in once every 10 years or so, on an exciting presidential election, and then not pay attention during big mid-term elections where we've got a real big choice between Democrats and Republicans,"" Obama said. There's no mistake in the locations for the Obama and Biden rallies. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the Democrats face tough odds in holding onto open Senate seats and governorships. Polls also indicate that Republicans have a good chance of grabbing back a bunch of House seats. Also on the road Tuesday: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine, at a rally at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware; Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland; Labor Secretary Hilda Solis at California State University in Los Angeles; and United States Trade Representative Ron Kirk at North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina. Obama's speech at the University of Wisconsin is the first in what Democratic Party officials say will be a series of ""Moving America Forward"" events by the president over the next couple of weeks.","Obama will headline a rally in Madison, Wisconsin .

"(CNN) -- A judge on Thursday denied a request for President Barack Obama to testify at a court martial for a U.S. Army flight surgeon who refused to deploy to Afghanistan until he saw proof that Obama was born in the United States. The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, said any evidence or witnesses related to Obama's citizenship is irrelevant to the charges against Lt. Col. Terrence Lakin, who has 17 years of service in the U.S. military. After failing to deploy with his unit in April, Lakin was charged with missing a movement, disobeying a lawful order and dereliction of duty. The Uniform Code of Military Justice says the maximum punishment for both offenses -- missing his plane and disobeying lawful orders -- is a dishonorable discharge and up to two years in confinement. A guilty verdict could also result in forfeiture of Lakin's pay, which totals $7,959 a month, according to a charge sheet provided by a group sponsoring his defense. Lakin's lawyers argued that all military orders stem from the commander-in-chief. Without evidence that Obama is eligible to be president, they say, the doctor's deployment order was illegal. In addition to putting Obama on their witness list, Lakin's lawyers had asked Lind to order Obama's official birth records from Hawaii be brought to court for trial. ""If the president is ineligible, you need to know that,"" Lakin's civilian attorney, Paul Jensen, told Lind. ""Col. Lakin needs to know that, the government needs to know that, America needs to know that."" The prosecutors in the case argued that Obama's eligibility is not relevant because the officers who ordered Lakin to go to Fort Campbell and then ordered him to answer questions about why he didn't go were his proper superiors in the military chain of command, and they gave him legal orders. Jensen later conceded that point. The judge ruled that the matter of Obama's eligibility is not relevant because he did not give any orders in the case. She pointed out that while the president is commander-in-chief of the military, it is Congress that is constitutionally empowered to raise armies, pay them and equip them. Any contention that any orders are invalid if the president is ineligible ""is erroneous,"" the judge said. Lind also said that military law says that a soldier's personal beliefs or convictions are not sufficient to allow that soldier to determine that an order is illegal. The soldier has to have ""no rational doubt"" that the order is illegal before he or she can ignore it. Finally she ruled that a military court martial is not the forum in which to determine a president's eligibility, because the Constitution says only Congress has the power to impeach and remove the president. Afterward, Jensen said he respected the judge's ruling, but called it distressing. ""It completely deprives us of any opportunity to present a defense in this case,"" Jensen said. The court martial is set to begin in October, but Jensen said he's not giving up on the matter of Obama's eligibility. ""We will be giving the Army Court of Criminal Appeals in the next week or two the opportunity to take up the issue, and we are going to fight on for justice to be served in this case."" Lakin is among 27 percent of Americans who doubt or deny that Obama is American-born, according to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. They compose the birther movement, which demands that Obama present a birth certificate signed by the doctor who delivered him in 1961. CNN and other news organizations have thoroughly debunked the rumors about the president's birthplace. The Obama campaign released a copy of a birth record issued by the state in 2007, called a ""certification of live birth,"" and allowed reporters to examine the document in person in 2008. Last year, Hawaiian state officials issued a statement that they had personally viewed the president's original Hawaiian birth record, called a ""certificate of live birth,"" and verified it to be authentic. State law bars the release of the original certificate. In addition, two Hawaiian newspapers ran notices in 1961 announcing Obama's birth in the state.

She was born following Michelle's preeclampsia diagnosis at a mere 25 weeks, weighing only 1lb., 6 oz. Josie's medical drama -- and Michelle's own fight for survival -- was documented throughout their TV series. Josie will turn 2 in December and is developing normally, without any longterm effects from her premature birth. ""It is a miracle.

Michelle, who is under the care of a high-risk pregnancy doctor, says she is being cautious, eating a lot of protein and green vegetables and abstaining from caffeine. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of women have preeclampsia -- Michelle had it with her second pregnancy -- and the condition can strike randomly. Women who have had it previously are at higher risk, however. ""We are just going to do the best we can,"" says Michelle. ""I am taking a nap every day, and we are just taking good care."" Jim Bob agrees: ""If we had lived by fear after Michelle had preeclampsia after her second delivery, we would have missed out on all our wonderful blessings,"" he says. ""So many of her pregnancies have gone extremely well."" One completely new aspect of this pregnancy? Michelle will have her very first scheduled Cesarean section since Josie's premature birth required a special cut on the inside of her uterus. ""I've never had a planned C-section,"" Michelle says. ""So this one will be different."" Spreading the News . Also different: how to tell 19 siblings that one more is on the way. Jim Bob gathered all the kids together for a family picture, but instead of telling them to say ""cheese,"" told them to say, ""Mom's going to have another baby!"" ""The kids were all asking, 'Are you joking or are you serious?' "" says Michelle. ""It was a big surprise. The little ones started jumping up and down when they realized he was serious."" After hugs and high fives all around, the siblings are now debating the baby's gender and name.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved a new vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza. Agriflu, made by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu. The vaccine was approved using an accelerated approval process, the FDA said. Novartis demonstrated that the vaccine induces levels of antibodies in the blood that are effective in preventing seasonal influenza, but it still needs to conduct further studies. Agriflu, for ages 18 and older, is administered as a single injection in the upper arm and is available in single-dose, prefilled syringes, according to the FDA. Novartis produces another licensed vaccine for seasonal influenza, Fluvirin, approved for ages 4 and older. Although no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease, vaccination is the key to flu prevention, according to the FDA. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said Agriflu is made in Siena, Italy, with eggs, and it has been available in Europe under the brand name Aggripal. This approval, he said, will add to future seasonal vaccine supplies.","Agriflu, made by Novartis, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will meet Monday with the leader of the country's main opposition party to discuss who will become the nation's next prime minister -- a day after an announcement that Papandreou he will step down amid the country's financial crisis. Papandreou's planned resignation -- announced by President Karolos Papoulias -- is contingent on the approval of the controversial 130 billion euro bailout deal. On Sunday, Papandreou met with Antonis Samaras -- the leader of the New Democracy party, Greece's leading opposition party -- and agreed to form a new government. During Monday's meeting, the two will discuss who will serve in the new government as well as who will be the next prime minister, according to a statement from the president. New national elections will be held sometime after the bailout is implemented, but no more details nor a timeline of future events were disclosed. Earlier Sunday, Samaras told reporters that once Papandreou resigns, everything will ""take its course"" and ""everything else is negotiable."" The move appears to close one chapter in Greece's tumultuous political and economic saga, as Papandreou had become a lightning rod for critics for his leadership of the south European nation as it tackles a prolonged financial plight. It also paves the way for passage of an agreement that Papandreou negotiated October 26 with European leaders. The deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in Greek debt, half of what it owes to private creditors, and includes a promise of 30 billion euros to help the public sector pare its debts -- making the whole package worth a total of 130 billion euros ($178 billion). But Greece's turmoil is far from over. The bailout -- the second it has received from the European Union and International Monetary Fund -- would be accompanied by additional austerity measures such as slashing government jobs, privatizing some businesses and reducing pensions. It also comes at a time when Greece's economy -- and to some extent the global economy -- is still staggering. Though Greece ranks 32nd in terms of gross domestic product, experts say it wields a disproportionate influence internationally. Economists worry that a Greek default on its debt could pull down larger European economies -- particularly those of Italy and Spain, as well as struggling Portugal and Ireland. Eurozone finance ministers are scheduled to meet Monday in Brussels, Belgium. Within Greece, the bailout's passage would be a significant victory for Papandreou. He has insisted repeatedly in recent weeks that it needs to be approved -- signaling that he'd be willing to resign as prime minister, a job he has held since 2009, as long as that happens. Earlier Sunday, Greece's president met ahead of a Cabinet meeting with all party leaders -- including Papandreou, who heads the socialist PASOK party, and Samaras. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos is likely to remain in his post as finance minister in a new government, sources told Greek television. Candidates for the prime minister's job include Petros Moliviatis and Loukas Papaimos, according to Greek television. The new government will have a life of four months, according to Greek television, citing sources, and elections will take place in early spring. On Monday -- in addition to a meeting between Papandreou and Samaras -- the Greek president will hold another meeting open to heads of all Greece's political parties. CNN's Diana Magnay, Jim Boulden and Andrew Carey in Athens and Matthew Chance and Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.","Eurozone financial leaders will meet Monday in Brussels .

"(CNN) -- Japanese protesters took to the streets Saturday to demand safer energy as the nation marked the three-month anniversary of an earthquake and tsunami that sparked the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years. The massive quake on March 11 triggered a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, forcing the evacuation of thousands. Months later, crews are still working to control radioactive emissions. ""We need electricity, but we cannot put lives at risk,"" said Kentaro Morisawa, a railway worker who took part in the Tokyo protest. ""We have the responsibility to protect our children's lives as much as our lives. Safer energy, such as fuel and water, is what we need today. Crowds sang, chanted and beat drums in protests held nationwide. ""Because we are letting radioactive material leak into the environment, we are getting a bad reputation from overseas,"" protester Mamoru Matsuda said. ""So we need to end this Fukushima crisis as soon as possible."" Some of the protesters gathered near the headquarters the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which operates the nuclear plant. The protests comes three months into the crisis, which is the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. One of three operating reactors at the plant melted down after the March earthquake and tsunami, and others suffered extensive damage to their radioactive cores. The resulting contamination has forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people from towns surrounding the plant. In addition, restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated Japanese farmers and fishermen since the disaster started, though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks. The protests are the latest show of discontent for embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who survived a no-confidence vote in this month.","They take to the streets as the nation marks the three-month anniversary of a massive quake .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Ireland's expulsion of a Russian diplomat over spying allegations is ""clearly an unfriendly step that will not go unanswered,"" Russia's deputy foreign minister said Wednesday, according to a report. Vladimir Titov's remarks were reported by the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency. The ministry press office told CNN it was not aware of the comment and could not elaborate. Ireland on Tuesday rebuked Russia for ""completely unacceptable"" behavior and expelled a diplomat after an investigation found that the Russian intelligence services had forged Irish passports, the government said. An investigation by the Garda Siochana police force found the Russian intelligence services made ""false documents based on the acquisition of details of six genuine passports belonging to Irish citizens,"" and effectively stole the identities of six Irish people, the Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The probe -- launched after last year's discovery of a Russian espionage operation in the United States -- found ""an entirely persuasive picture"" of such activities, the statement said. The department's secretary general met with the Russian ambassador and informed him that it is ""not the behavior the government would expect from a country with which we have friendly relations,"" the statement said. ""The ambassador was also told that the accreditation of a named member of his staff with diplomatic status is to be terminated. ... The individual in question has been asked to leave this jurisdiction by a specified date."" The statement added, ""It is hoped that it will be possible to move on from this disturbing incident and to develop further the relationship between Ireland and the Russian Federation which is fundamentally strong and which has significant potential.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A rash of bank robberies in New York has the city's police commissioner worried that criminals have turned banks into ""virtual cash machines"" and some wondering whether tough economic times are fueling the trend. A surveillance camera captures a bank robbery suspect in New York on December 2. On Monday alone, robbers targeted five banks in the Big Apple, some striking in broad daylight and near famous landmarks. Police called the incidents unrelated, but they're just the latest examples of the growing tally of hold-ups. Bank robberies in New York have risen 54 percent compared with last year, with criminals committing more than 430  in the past 12 months, according to the New York police department. ""As it stands now, they've turned [banks] into virtual cash machines,"" New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. Bank robberies are also up in many areas across the country, including San Diego, California, and Houston, Texas, federal law enforcement experts told CNN. It's enough for some to link the trend to the rash of layoffs, the plummeting stock market and the bust in the real estate values, all of which have left many Americans in dire financial straits. ""It makes me think that the recession is making people go to extreme measures,"" a woman who frequents one of the banks robbed Monday told The New York Times.  Watch where the robbers struck » . But Kelly said it's not clear whether the bad economic times are fueling the unusual spike. ""People want to say... it's because of the economy. I think it's too early to make that statement,"" he said. CNN security analyst Mike Brooks agreed, adding that although there are typically many bank robberies during the holidays, there are no data to suggest that any recent spike was caused by the economy. Another expert said it's possible that the difficulty of finding a job right now may be a factor, but he doubted that law-abiding citizens are turning to crime to make ends meet. ""It's hard to attribute the bank robberies to people who were let go from Lehman Brothers or other organizations that are in trouble,"" said Alfred Blumstein, who has researched criminal justice for 20 years and is a professor of operations research at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. ""I would anticipate that people who rob banks have been involved with crime  before because that's not where one is likely to start,"" Blumstein said. A person who might turn to robbing banks is someone in their late teens or early 20s who has already broken the law and has decided to move on to a bigger target, he added. ""Bank robbery is a very high-risk activity, because most banks have various surveillance equipment in place, and it requires a degree of aggressiveness that otherwise law-abiding folks are not likely to take on,"" Blumstein said. Some officials say the modern, customer-friendly design of banks -- with easy access to tellers and cash -- is too tempting for robbers. ""We don't like the business plan that makes a bank look like a living room,"" Kelly said ""We [advise] just some common sense provisions, such as so-called bandit barriers, so that tellers have some option to act when somebody puts a note in front of them."" In fact, bank robbers have simply handed tellers a note in a vast majority of hold-ups in New York. Kelly put the figure at 80 percent and added that although the rest of the robbers claimed to have a gun, many didn't actually show it. Mike Smith, president and CEO of the New York Bankers Association, is meeting with the NYPD to see what more can be done to discourage robbers. He said banks have a significant amount of security, some of which may not be visible to the public. ""Are there enhancements? Obviously. Criminals talk to each other, they know what's going on, but typically they are apprehended,"" Mike Smith said. CNN's A. Pawlowski contributed to this report.","Bank robberies in New York have risen 54 percent compared with last year .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving brush fire burning just south of Reno, Nevada, on Thursday prompted evacuations, closed a major highway and led the governor of Nevada to declare a state of emergency. The more than 3,000-acre fire began burning around 1 p.m. Thursday in North Washoe Valley, according to a press release from county officials. At least 10,000 people have been evacuated. There was no containment on the blaze, said Nancy Leuenhagen, Washoe County press Iinformation officer. Video from CNN Reno affiliate KOLO showed dark smoke plumes, fueled by heavy wind and dry vegetation, pushing toward U.S. Highway 395. A 12-mile stretch of the highway remained closed late Thursday, according to Dan Lopez of the Nevada Highway Patrol. Several flights at the Reno airport have been canceled or diverted, CNN affiliate KTVN reported. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been and are being affected by this fire,"" Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval said in a statement. ""Declaring a state of emergency ensures that every resource from the local, state and federal level is available to assist."" The Nevada Division of Forestry and the Department of Public Safety were aiding local firefighters and emergency personnel, Sandoval said. The National Guard was on standby and the state of California was also providing assistance, according to the governor's website. About 12 families displaced by the fire were receiving assistance at an evacuation shelter at a local high school, said Karli Epstien, Red Cross press information officer. CNN's Nigel Walwyn and Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","Fire affects 3,000 acres in North Washoe Valley .
