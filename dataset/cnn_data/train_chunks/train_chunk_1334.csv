"Wales international Liam Williams  has issued an apology for a fancy dress costume in which he 'blacked-up' as Premier League striker Wilfried Bony. Williams, 23, posted a picture on Twitter of himself dressed as the Swansea striker wearing full face paint. He was slammed for imitating Bony, who has scored eight times this season, with many labelling his outfit 'racist'. Wales rugby international Liam Williams (right), 23, posted a picture on Twitter of himself dressed as  Wilfried Bony and wearing full face paint. There was an outcry after the picture was posted on Twitter . Williams, who plays for the Scarlets issued an apology and claimed Bony gave the costume his blessing . But Williams. a full-back for Scarlets, said Bony gave the costume his blessing. The image was retweeted 160 times and favourited 345 times after Williams shared it with his 31,000 Twitter followers. But Show Racism the Red Card urged Williams - who has featured in one of the charity's campaigns - to apologise for the picture. Campaign manager Sunil Patel said: 'We are disappointed to see the image on his Twitter feed. It's not acceptable as we move into 2015. 'We don't condone this sort of behaviour, especially when we have got issues of racism in sport and society. 'I can't comment on whether Wilfried is fine with it, but I am sure many black people would not be fine with it. Williams, pictured in an RBS Six Nations match in March, took part in Show Racism the Red Cards 2013/14 campaign with the Welsh Rugby Union.The sports body is investigating the image . 'It is behaviour we do not really like to see. It's something we might have seen 30 or 40 years ago but it is not something we expect to see in a multicultural society. 'We would call upon him to apologise for the image.' Williams was pictured alongside team-mates Harry Robinson, Michael Tagicakibau and Rhys Priestland and an unidentified man dressed as a donkey. Williams, who later deleted the picture, told his critics to 'shut up' and claimed Bony had given him his permission to wear the costume. Williams said: 'There's not a racist bone in my body. 'I know Bony through a mutual friend and he said it was OK so no offence taken.' Bony, who's scored eight times this term, takes his place on the Swansea bench for Saturday's game at Hull . He later tweeted: 'I am very sorry for any offence caused by my actions. I'm not a racist and there was no malice behind it.' Williams took part in Show Racism the Red Cards 2013/14 campaign with the Welsh Rugby Union. The sports body is investigating the image. A spokesman said: 'At this stage we would like to receive the full facts and background of the situation before commenting further.' In the summer Williams became a pariah after conceding a last-minute penalty against South Africa. Wales were 30-24 ahead and on the cusp of their first win against one of the southern hemisphere heavyweights in six years. Williams was penalised for making an illegal shoulder charge on Cornal Hendricks as he scored a try in the corner. The resulting penalty try gave South Africa a simple conversion to win 31-30 in the closing moments of the game.","Williams, 23, posted a picture  of himself dressed as Swansea striker Bony .

"Joachim Low has hinted that he could leave his role as Germany manager to return to club management role in the not too distant future. The 54-year-old, who has been in charge of the national side since July 2006, has admitted he is open about his future job prospects. He told Kicker: 'I would rule nothing out just now. It's very conceivable of course that at some point I will coach a club team again. Why not?

Low was Jurgen Klinsmann's assistant for two years before coming Germany manager in July 2006 . 'I've trained myself to think about my future only every two years. As a coach I know that there will be a decision after every tournament. In 2012, the mood was very different from 2010. It changes. 'But there is no curse of the title, as I sometimes read.' Low last managed a club side in the 2003-2004 season, spending eight months at FK Austrian Wien - where he averaged a 50% win percentage. Germany are currently second in their European Championship qualifying group with seven points, three points behind the leaders Poland.","Joachim Low has been Germany manager for over eight years .

"Thierry Henry says he wants to manage Arsenal one day. He talks of getting his badges and qualifications. In the meantime, he is working for Sky. ‘I have to be able to make sure I have everything on board to be able to go back,’ he says. What, a nice set of exams? Why would Arsenal appoint a novice to steer them through the difficult task of succeeding Arsene Wenger? Thierry Henry may be an Arsenal legend but he needs to prove himself as a manager, not a pundit . By joining Sky, while doing his coaching badges, Henry has weakened his chances of managing his old club . Arsene Wenger signed the French forward in 1999, but it seems unlikely he will be replaced by Henry . We saw what happened at Manchester United when Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down and what was needed to replace him: one of Europe’s most experienced elite coaches, Louis van Gaal. How can Henry prove Arsenal-worthy from his Sky studio? Jamie Carragher talks a good game, too — but the guys at Fenway are not about to ditch Brendan Rodgers for him, no matter how many badges he has. Ultimately, the test is to get out there and do it — at academy level, youth level, in the lower leagues, as an assistant. A former Highbury hero, Patrick Vieira, is doing just this at Manchester City, and if Henry was genuinely on the road to being Arsenal manager, his first appearance before the Sky cameras would involve having a microphone poked up his nose by Geoff Shreeves. Henry is Arsenal's all-time leading goalscorer, and has been invited to come back to the club as a coach . Wenger has been under pressure this season, but is likely to see out the rest of his contract at Arsenal . David Moyes showed what can happen when a club legend is not replaced by one of Europe's top coaches .","Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has just joined Sky Sports as a pundit .

"Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after a flurry of abusive text messages sent to his paying fans. In appalling texts seen by Sportsmail, the Seasiders’ chief has called one fan a ‘retard’ and told him to ‘enjoy the rest of his special needs day out’. Oyston could now face an FA investigation, even though he sits on the Football League’s board of directors. Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign after abusive text messages sent to his paying fans . Supporter Steve Smith was labelled a 'retard' and ‘intellectual cripple’ by Oyston, whose beleaguered side lost 6-1 at home against Bournemouth on Saturday and are bottom of the Championship. Blackpool manager Lee Clark looks on during his side's 6-1 defeat to Bournemouth on Saturday . One rant from Oyston, who had abuse hurled at him as well, read: ‘Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. ‘You are banned because I think you are a p****. ‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.’ Oyston has also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: ‘I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission’. Smith wants the FA and Football League to take action. ‘The texts are disgusting, politically incorrect and show that Karl needs to be put through the fit and proper person’s test. Let’s not forget he is supposed to be a figurehead in football,’ he said. ‘Karl treats this club like a cash cow and has no interest in what happens on the pitch. I did a radio interview recently and the presenter told me not one person rang in to support Karl. ‘His position is untenable. He’s been untouchable for years and the FA haven’t done anything about his actions.’ Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’. Harry Arter shoots and scores for Bournemouth with Blackpool rooted to the bottom of the Championship . ‘I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability,’ he said. ‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick.’ The FA say they are ‘aware of the matter’ while the Football League offered no comment. Blackpool were unavailable for comment.","Blackpool supporters are calling for chairman Karl Oyston to resign .

"Billy Davies is the favourite to replace Ally McCoist on Sunday night after the Rangers manager was finally allowed to walk away from the club he stood by during the darkest days of liquidation. The Ibrox outfit confirmed that, just over a week on from handing in his 12 months’ notice, they had put the head coach on gardening leave. Assistant manager Kenny McDowall has been put in charge ‘until the end of the season’, according to the official statement, although there is a strong chance that a new man will be in place before then. VIDEO Scroll down for Ally McCoist: Decision to resign as Rangers manager remains private . Ally McCoist has left Rangers, nine days after he offered his resignation to the club . Rangers beat Livingston 2-0 on Saturday, and sit second in the Championship table after 17 games . Billy Davies 4/6 . Stuart McCall 6/1 . Terry Butcher 6/1 . Dennis Wise 12/1 . Brian Laudrup 16/1 . David Weir 16/1 . Richard Gough 25/1 . Dave Jones 25/1 . Alex Neil 33/1 . Derek Adams 33/1 . Darren Ferguson 50/1 . Craig Brown 50/1 . McCoist and the board failed to reach an agreement on an early departure last week, raising the prospect of the manager hanging around to lead the team, despite working his notice. But directors moved on Sunday night to remove the ‘lame duck coach’, agreeing to continue paying him the monthly instalments of his £750,000 salary to stay away — at least until they can finalise a settlement. His departure clears the path for a new man to step in above loyal lieutenant McDowall, with Davies believed to be the front runner. Stuart McCall and Terry Butcher, like Davies both out of work and ready to start immediately, are also likely to be candidates. McCoist’s departure on the eve of the AGM removes one potential embarrassment for a club who have declared annual losses of £8million — and revealed they need the same again merely to stay in business. Rangers boss Ally McCoist looked in high spirits during Saturday's win despite recent difficulties at Ibrox . Putting him on gardening leave effectively silences him, too, with any public attack on the board — or embarrassing revelations about how things have been run during his time as manager — risking putting him in breach of contract, thereby weakening his claim for compensation. The club released a statement at 8.45pm on Sunday, saying: ‘Rangers would like to announce that Ally McCoist is relinquishing his duties as manager and will serve out the remainder of his 12-month notice period on gardening leave. ‘We would like to thank Ally for all his hard work and dedication over the last few years, but we feel it is now in the best interests of all parties to move on. Assistant manager Kenny McDowall will take over his duties until the end of the season.’ Meanwhile, Dave King’s receding chances of launching a rival rescue bid for Rangers appear to have hit a fresh obstacle — a potential resumption of hostilities with the South African tax authorities. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is expected to tighten his grip on the Ibrox club at Monday's AGM, as the board and new chief executive Derek Llambias — very much Ashley’s man in situ — outline plans for the Sports Direct tycoon to underwrite the £8m share issue needed to keep the business alive. Mike Ashley is keen to impress his stamp upon Rangers as soon as possible . King, who saw a £16m rescue package rejected earlier this year, remains keen to get involved. But reports emerging from South Africa at the weekend suggest that his reported £44m settlement with the tax man could be open to review and dramatically increased. An investigation led by a Johannesburg advocate has reportedly uncovered evidence that the South African Revenue Service had illegally spied on taxpayers it was targeting — including some it subsequently struck deals with. The investigation into ‘rogue behaviour’ also calls into question the legality of deals done — with King named as one of the most high-profile individuals allowed to pay back just a fraction of the tax allegedly owed. South African president Jacob Zuma has been called upon to launch a full commission of inquiry. Even the suggestion of a renewed investigation could tie up King’s time and funds while the threat of a huge new bill may scupper any last chance he has of buying into the club. SIGNINGS . Despite the club's financial implosion, McCoist has had money to work with during his three-and-a-half year reign as boss. But the 52-year-old repeatedly put his faith in players he knew with Scottish Premiership experience who failed to recreate their former performance level. Allies of the manager will point out that he did not have a scouting network to rely on, but moves for highly-paid figures like Ian Black, Nicky Law, Jon Daly, Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd simply did not work, while others signings such as Emilson Cribari, Francisco Sandaza and Arnold Peralta were outright failures. STYLE OF PLAY . The signs were good for McCoist when he first took over and Rangers managed to rack up a 15-point lead over Celtic in his first season. But as that lead was thrown away, a frailty in his management was brutally exposed. But worse was to come for the former Scotland striker as despite the mammoth resources he could call upon as he faced up to part-time minnows following the club's liquidation, his side often struggled. Tactically naive, one-paced and lacking creativity, the club's faithful soon grew tired as they toiled against sides they should have been ripping apart. CONTRACT . Rangers have staggered from one crisis to another - all the while wasting millions of pounds in the process. But McCoist did himself no favours by accepting an £800,000-a-year deal to manage the club while it was marooned at the depths of the Scottish game. Even when he volunteered to take a 50 per cent wage cut, many fans were disappointed that it took several weeks of negative headlines before it was finally agreed. McCoist's salary then increased to £750,000 a year when he handed his notice in and as recently as Friday the manager was adamant he would see out his notice period. YOUTH DEVELOPMENT . Many Gers supporters thought that by going down to the Third Division, Rangers would be able to flood their team with young recruits while they stock-piled cash for their Premiership return. But McCoist was reluctant to put his faith in his Murray Park youngsters, claiming they were not good enough to see the club back through the divisions. The only youngster to have made any impact in recent years has been Lewis Macleod. The Scotland Under-21 midfielder is undoubtedly a promising talent but one graduate from an entire youth system seems wasteful to many. CUP RECORD . Since replacing Walter Smith in the summer of 2010, McCoist has failed to win a single cup competition in 11 attempts. Rangers remain in this season's two major domestic knockout tournaments but suffered fresh shame when they blew a two-goal lead against Alloa as they crashed out of the Petrofac Training Cup semis earlier this month. Other humiliations include losing last year's Challenge Cup final to Raith Rovers and being taken to a replay by League Two outfit Albion Rovers.","Ally McCoist had offered his resignation from the club last week .

"David Silva played his 200th game for Man City on Saturday. The club have spent a fortune on players, but if you want value for money, you need look no further than the little Spanish magician. In terms of consistency, his performances are hard to match. He doesn’t cause any problems, he looks like he trains hard and he is a fantastic, technical player. He must be a manager’s dream. City are so much better with him in the side, as the table below shows, and he is the kind of player you are happy to pay to watch. With West Brom, Burnley and Sunderland to come over Christmas, Silva could be just the man to help City get through their striker crisis. VIDEO Scroll down to see Harry Redknapp on QPR striker Charlie Austin . Spaniard David Silva struck a brace for Manchester City as they beat Crystal Palace 3-0 on Saturday . Silva heads out for Manchester City's Christmas meal on Saturday night after their victory . BENTEKE BACK WITH A BANG . It was good to see Christian Benteke back to his best against Man United. He is a class act and an absolute monster and I’m pleased he’s overcome his injury problems. Damaging your achilles tendon is always a worry — players don’t always get back to those same levels again. But Benteke is flying and I’m a big fan. It’s good to see players like him catching the eye now. It’s not just your Costas and Agueros who are shining: there’s Benteke, Austin, Wilfried Bony, Saido Berahino, Harry Kane. There’s a lot of striking quality in the Premier League this season and those players are scoring a high percentage of their team’s goals, as the table below shows. Even Andy Carroll has come back in and proved himself when it looked as if he might not get a game at West Ham. It’s so vital to have a front man who can lead the line well and score goals, and this season almost every team have one. All I know is I wouldn’t want to be a defender this Christmas. Christian Benteke struck in the first half of Aston Villa's 1-1 draw with Manchester United . Charlie Austin scored a hat-trick as QPR came from two goals down to beat West Brom on Saturday . GOAL MACHINE AUSTIN KEEPS ON MOTORING . What a vein of form Charlie Austin has hit. He can’t stop scoring. He doesn’t seem to get many chances but when he does, he sticks them away. He is an arch goal poacher and saved QPR in a fantastic game against West Brom. That’s 11 Premier League goals now this season, but as our map shows, the majority of them have been scored on or around the penalty spot. He loves to sniff out opportunities and pounce. His conversion rate is impressive, too. He’s seventh in the league in that respect, and behind top man Diego Costa. But he is above Sergio Aguero, which shows just how Austin is more than capable of coping at this level. Argentine Erik Lamela celebrates after giving Mauricio Pochettino's side the lead against Burnley . ERIK'S BIG CHALLENGE . Erik Lamela has taken plenty of stick from people, myself included. There was a feeling the £30million price tag didn’t add up to the quality we’ve seen. He’s scored two world-class goals this season, including the winner on Saturday, as our graphic shows. But one was in the Europa League and, no disrespect intended, the other was against Burnley. I still feel he’s a bit lightweight but credit where credit is due. The key for Lamela now is to go and affect big games. He needs to score in a derby match or do something where we can all sit back and say: ‘So that’s why they paid £30million.’ That’s the next challenge. VIDEO Goal will boost Lamela - Pochettino . Per Mertesacker appeared to duck out of the way for Liverpool's late equaliser at Anfield . NO DEFENCE FOR SLOPPY GOALS . Aside from Philippe Coutinho’s goal, the others conceded at Anfield summed up Liverpool and Arsenal’s seasons: too many sloppy mistakes. Both sides can be a joy to watch but they concede so softly. Martin Skrtel’s header was good but Kieran Gibbs showed no urgency to get back on the line and Per Mertesacker ducked out of the way. I’m sorry, but that’s just not good enough. I saw a lot of positives for Liverpool and it would have been a travesty if they had lost. They conceded goals last year but the difference then was they kept scoring — at the same stage they had 42 goals, twice as many as 2014-15, and Luis Suarez had 19 of them. That’s only two fewer than the whole squad this season. Daniel Sturridge’s return will help and on Sunday there were signs of improvement. AWAY THE LADS... Three wins in a row at St James’ Park is an amazing achievement for Sunderland and since they lost 8-0 at Southampton, they are undefeated away from home. That form is so important for the teams who are scrapping at the bottom of the table because it eases the pressure on your home games. Watching Adam Johnson, you always feel you want a bit more from him because he’s got so much ability. But scoring big goals against your rivals is the kind of thing that can make you an icon at your club. Liverpool's Martin Skrtel celebrates after scoring a dramatic late equaliser against Arsenal in injury time . Adam Johnson watches on as his powerful strike flies past the dive of Newcastle goalkeeper Jak Alnwick . ALL SYSTEMS GO . It didn’t take long for people to ditch 3-5-2 at the start of the season but it was back in fashion this weekend. Liverpool, Manchester United, Aston Villa, Hull and Southampton all played it and I wouldn’t be surprised if others join in. It can help you get more possession, rotation and movement so it’s definitely not dead yet. BOURNEMOUTH STRIKE IT RITCH . Last week my old club Bournemouth did OK against Liverpool but when Eddie Howe made six changes for that game, the next one was always going to be interesting. It made no difference. They hit Blackpool for six and Matt Ritchie scored two. I’d be surprised if he’s not in the Premier League soon, either with Bournemouth or another team. Andy Carroll races away to celebrate after scoring his first league goal with his feet since April 2013 . Spurs have won their last four Premier League games 2-1 when Harry Kane has scored . NUMBER CRUNCHING . Nine -  Though Silva was undoubtedly the man of the match for Man City, much of the team’s second-half attacking impetus on Saturday came through full backs Pablo Zabaleta and Aleksandar Kolarov. The defenders — who both laid on goals — have provided nine assists each since the start of last season — a total betteredonly by Everton’s Leighton Baines. 27 - Andy Carroll scored his first Premier League goal with his foot since April 2013 — a period of 27 games. His last four goals have all come from his head. Eight - Following their 3-0 win against Crystal Palace, Man City have won eight matches in a row in all competitions — a run stretching back to late November. One - The pressure may be on Leicester manager Nigel Pearson with his side sitting bottom of the league, but Steve Bruce hasn’t fared much better this season — his Hull team are only three points better off than the Foxes, with just one win in their last 16 games. 2-1 - Spurs have won their last four Premier League games 2-1 when Harry Kane has got his name on the scoresheet — as he did against Burnley. 1,510 - Erik Lamela finally scored his first league goal for Tottenham on Saturday. The Argentina midfielder had to wait 1,510 minutes for his duck to end. One - Philippe Coutinho has been Liverpool’s best player on occasions this season, but his opener against Arsenal on Sunday was his first goal at Anfield since the 3-2 win over Man City last April. He is also yet to provide an assist in the PL.","David Silva has excelled for Manchester City this season .

But Liverpool, who had Fabio Borini sent off for two bookable offences, dug in and Rodgers feels they showed enough to suggest they can recapture last season’s swagger and reclaim an unlikely place in Europe’s top competition. When asked if they were still contenders, Rodgers said: ‘Absolutely. It is always going to be a big challenge. Of course, we have to make up points but we have shown this is a club that can go on a run and win games. ‘In the second half of last season, we went on a run of 11 wins. The most important thing is the confidence. When we bring Daniel Sturridge back in January, we can get back to being that team. Liverpool, who are in 10th position, have 22 points from 17 games this season, and no Barclays Premier League team has ever finished higher than sixth with that record at this stage. But Rodgers is adamant his side are still performing at the level he requires. ‘Slowly we are getting back to where we want to be,’ he said. ‘Our performance was outstanding, the passing, intensity and the pressing.

Arsenal’s manager said: ‘They came back and played very well. They were down to 10 men. To concede the corner that was a bit unlucky. From then on we conceded. 'Overall it is a fair result but a frustrating result for us because they came back when we had plenty of defenders on the pitch. ‘We had problems to get our flow going.

'He is a real warrior. Since he went back into the team he has scored goals and they are important for us. He was the top scoring defender in the league last year.’ Rodgers was aggrieved with Arsenal’s opening goal for a number of reasons, saying: 'A lot of our goals we give away are poor goals. 'I didn’t think it was a free-kick. I thought (Alexis) Sanchez dived but when it came in we lost three one-v-one headers, that is not about organisation that is about winning the duel. 'In the first half we were outstanding but had to regroup at half-time.

"Back at his swish penthouse apartment in Canary Wharf, Sam Allardyce would have rocked back on his settee and let out an enormous belly laugh. He is the biggest winner here. This is the Arsenal team West Ham’s manager wants to face on December 28, the one who cannot defend a set-piece for love nor money. What a charitable bunch Arsene Wenger’s men can be. It was a seasonal slip-up, conceding a 97th-minute equaliser when poor Calum Chambers was bamboozled out of the way by Martin Skrtel. VIDEO Scroll down to see Allardyce on what his West Ham side can achieve this season . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce (left) welcomes Arsene Wenger's shaking looking Gunners to Upton Park soon . Martin Skrtel jumps above Arsenal's Calum Chambers to power home a late leveller at Anfield . Kieran Gibbs had done his Arsenal team-mate no favours, moving off his designated station at the near post when Adam Lallana slung in a corner that was met by the bandaged head of the Liverpool defender. Allardyce will love that, confirmation that this Arsenal team, for all their good form of late, are capable of conceding at any stage of the game. In the post-match analysis Wenger admitted that there were ‘tactical and psychological reasons’ behind this awkward performance at Anfield. Tactically, truth be told, they were pretty much played off the park by a Liverpool side who have yet to decide whether they are in transition or whether they can still finish in the top four. The psychological reasons that Wenger alluded to were the visions — make that nightmares — of the 5-1 defeat Liverpool inflicted here last season. Philippe Coutinho shoots through a crowd of bodies in the area to give Liverpool a 1-0 lead against Arsenal . Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker attempts to block the ball as Coutinho rifles in his first half goal . It seems incredible to think that a team Brendan Rodgers believes are one of the best in Europe can be so vulnerable mentally. There is enough experience in this team, enough medals between them to do a bit better than this. When they concede like this you wonder what are they being taught at training. Those five West Ham strikers Allardyce has been talking about probably can’t wait to get among this Arsenal defence at Upton Park in a few days’ time. That game is shaping up to be a shootout for the Champions League, an invigorating clash between Allardyce’s upstarts and this vulnerable Arsenal defence. The stats that West Ham’s manager love so much would have been in one hand and a large glass of 1986 Petrus Pomerol in the other. Allardyce will drink to this. Andy Carroll is congratulated by Hammers player Aaron Cresswell after his first half strike against Leicester . Arsenal had only 35 per cent possession here, shut down every time the playmakers — Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sanchez — got on the ball. At one stage during a first half that was dominated in its entirety by Liverpool, there was a 10-minute period when Rodgers’ team enjoyed 87 per cent of the play. That is impressive for Liverpool, enough for Rodgers to describe their performance as better than last year’s 5-1. At one stage he even called it ‘brilliant’. Still, that is no excuse for a team who were leading 2-1 when referee Michael Oliver signalled that there would be nine minutes of added time because of the earlier injury sustained to Skrtel’s head. Chambers is struggling, returning from suspension to take his place at right back in defence. Arsenal playmakers such as Alexis Sanchez (left) and Santi Cazorla found space at a premium at Anfield . ‘We are guilty because we didn’t jump at all with Skrtel,’ admitted Wenger, but there was more to it than just a simple challenge inside the penalty area from a corner. You always fancy your chances against this back four and the kid is offered zero protection by Oxlade-Chamberlain, the man immediately in front of him. These are two youngsters and yet they need to develop an instinctive relationship, a protective cloak if they are to form a partnership down the right in the years to come. Calum Chambers (right) is struggling but he is getting little protection from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Without it they will be targeted, as they were here by the lung-busting first-half runs of Lazar Markovic. On the ball, Liverpool were sharp and inventive again. ‘There were memories from last season and maybe it played a part,’ admitted Wenger. ‘We let them come at us and when you don’t score a third you can never relax.’ Instead, they left Allardyce and his West Ham team sitting pretty.","Arsenal drew 2-2 with Liverppol at Anfield on Sunday .

"Martin Skrtel scored twice as Liverpool took Arsenal apart in this this fixture last season. For Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, however, the goal he scored late at Anfield on Sunday may prove more important. Skrtel in some ways epitomises Liverpool’s defending in that he doesn’t always look quite good enough. There is no doubting the Slovakian’s bravery, however. He may have been withdrawn had Liverpool had better back-up on their bench after a horrible clash with Olivier Giroud that left him with a stud-shaped hole in the back of his head. All wrapped up like a rather sombre Christmas present, though, Skrtel rampaged on and the crashing header he delivered from a corner at the death has at least given his manager reason to believe that maybe not everything in the football universe is against him right now. Martin Skrtel jumps above the Arsenal back line to power home a late leveller with his head and claim a point . Liverpool centre back Skrtel celebrates after scoring a dramatic equaliser against Arsenal in injury time . As nine minutes of injury time – added on solely because of Skrtel’s injury – rolled by, Liverpool did appear to be heading to a successive Barclays Premier League defeat in eight days. Once again, it would have been unjust. The figures of Liverpool’s last two games, against Manchester United and Arsenal, are stacked remarkably in their favour. More shots, more passes, but somehow there have been fewer goals. This time, at least, Rodgers’ team managed to emerge with a little of what they deserved. Liverpool are getting better, of that there is no doubt. The first half they contributed against Basle in the Champions League just two weeks away was dismal. They played without tempo, conviction or rhythm. At that point – so bad were they as they exited the competition – that it was tempting to worry a little for Rodgers’ future. Since then, though, Liverpool’s manager has summoned up a little anger, a little bit of dog, and his team have responded, at least in the manner of their performances. Philippe Coutinho is congratulated by his team-mates after opening the scoring during the clash at Anfield . Olivier Giroud expertly puts the ball through the legs of Brad Jones to give Arsenal the lead at Anfield . Much is still awry. Liverpool defended horribly at times once again on Sunday and Brad Jones hinted once again at what we already know. He is not the answer to Liverpool’s goalkeeping problems. Meanwhile, they lack ruthlessness in front of goal which is hardly surprising given that they lack a reliable centre forward. Their football, however, is beginning to resemble that of last season in some areas. On Sunday, as they did at Old Trafford a week ago, they worried Arsenal for long periods with some neat midfield combinations and some much improved running off the ball. If their attacking play had a focal point, someone like Daniel Sturridge for example, then they may begin to move forwards. Their best players in the first half were the creative Brazilian Coutinho and 20-year-old Lazar Markovic. The young Serbian was the fall guy against Basle as he was sent off but has shown enough in recent days to suggest he may transpire to be a rare success for Liverpool’s much-talked about transfer committee. Mathieu Debuchy beats Liverpool defender Skrtel to equalise for the Gunners shortly before half-time . Brendan Rodgers's side had looked as though they were heading for their second consecutive defeat . For the first 40 minutes, Liverpool were the only team in the game but struggled to open Arsenal up. Perhaps Arsene Wenger knew what he was doing. Liverpool are at their best rampaging forward on the counter attack but find things much harder when confronted with teams sitting deep. This is how it was on Sunday as Liverpool poked and prodded without ever really looking desperately dangerous. It was the closing minutes of the half, though, that summed up Rodgers’ problems at the moment. Finally they scored only to concede horribly – scruffily – at the other end. One step forwards two steps back. After that it was not surprising to see the home team fall behind. This is how it has been this season. One setback often follows another at Anfield. Rodgers talks to Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during the Premier League clash at Anfield . Fabio Borini was sent off for Liverpool after receiving two bookings in as many minutes . VIDEO Skrtel strikes late to earn Liverpool draw . Wenger suggested his team had played with ‘the handbrake on’ for too long and even floated the idea that his team were still troubled mentally by last February’s 5-1 hiding. If that is the case then Wenger needs to borrow Liverpool’s psychologist Dr Steve Peters for a while. Still Arsenal managed to lead, though. Their second goal was easy on their eye from their point of view but Liverpool’s video analysis today will show three red shirts marking dead space as Giroud was left unattended. All of that is familiar to Rodgers, of course. Liverpool continue to defend without authority and as long as that continues they will struggle to close the rather large gap between themselves and the top four. Their manager, though, will at least see other, better, things in his team that he recognises now. On Friday in his pre-match press conference he lost his composure with the media for the first time in two and a half seasons. If it was a show of defiance then it was mirrored, at least in part, by his team on Sunday. Rodgers said afterwards that his team had been ‘outstanding’. They weren't, but they were much better .","Liverpool and Arsenal drew 2-2 in their Premier League clash at Anfield .

"In an age where foreign imports are regularly given preference over home-grown talent in England's top flight, Burnley showed they are doing their bit for British football. When Sean Dyche's men lined up before facing Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday, there was a real homely feel to their squad. That's down to the fact that in contrast to their opposition, each of their starting eleven was born in Britain - something that has not occurred in the Premier League since the closing game of the 2010-2011 season. Ashley Barnes (left) celebrates in front of the Burnley fans after getting himself on the scoresheet at Spurs . Burnley's starting line-up against Tottenham on Saturday consisted entirely of British-born players . Burnley are  18th in the league, level on points with Crystal Palace who are above them on goal difference . Blackpool were the last Premier League side to field an all-British starting eleven against Manchester United on the final day of the 2010-2011 season. Here's how they lined up. Matthew Gilks - Rochdale . Stephen Crainey - Glasgow . Neal Eardley - Llandudno . Ian Evatt - Coventry . Alex Baptiste - Sutton in Ashfield . Keith Southern - Gateshead . David Vaughan - Rhuddlan . Charlie Adam - Dundee . Jason Puncheon - Croydon . Gary Taylor-Fletcher - Liverpool . DJ Campbell - Hammersmith . That team in question was Ian Holloway's Blackpool. He fielded a side entirely made up of British-born players against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Holloway's men suffered a 4-2 defeat and it was a similar story on Saturday as Burnley lost 2-1 at White Hart Lane. Following the defeat against Mauricio Pochettino's squad of global stars, Dyche spoke openly about his Burnley Brits. 'We are not necessarily a young group, but we're quite an inexperienced group as regards regular Premier League football. 'We've got a group who've maybe had a season in it, but it would be nice to have a few more who've been around it a long time,' Dyche said. While Dyche trains his thoughts on possible incomings, he knows that the speculation regarding Clarets striker Danny Ings' future is unlikely to go away any time soon. Gary Taylor-Fletcher is mobbed by his Blackpool team-mates after scoring against Manchester United in 2011 . The 22-year-old is out of contract in the summer and Newcastle and Sunderland have been mooted as potential destinations. 'We don't need to ignore it, we're just used to it,' Dyche said. 'He's used to it, I'm used to it. It's not a new story - people were talking about Ingsy last year from the beginning of the season so we're used to it.'

"Liverpool's stadium announcer was forced to plead with fans at Anfield to stop using a whistle during their clash with Arsenal on Sunday. The demand came just four days after their clash at Bournemouth ended in controversy when the Championship team’s captain Tommy Elphick stopped in his tracks when he heard a whistle from the crowd. Elphick was closing down Philippe Coutinho before stopping and raising his hand, believing referee Mark Clattenburg had blown his whistle.

He did it here in the 90th minute, to the unmitigated delight of the Sunderland fans up in the gods.

Fourth official Kevin Friend was about to hold up the board showing five minutes of added time when Sunderland punished their bitter rivals for committing too many players forward in search of a late winner of their own. Johnson made the break from a Newcastle corner after Costel Pantilimon had produced a magnificent save to tip Moussa Sissoko’s long-range effort over the bar. The ball was played wide to Steven Fletcher and his cross was cushioned into Johnson’s path by substitute Will Buckley. Johnson took a touch and then took aim, volleying left-footed past young goalkeeper Jak Alnwick. For the third season running, the Sunderland bench spilled on to the St James’ Park turf in celebration. In total, they have beaten their bitter rivals four times in a row now, a club record. For Alan Pardew, the statistics make less happy reading. Just one win in eight derbies and none at home. Worse still, the remarkable revival that saved his job is starting to go into reverse. Eight goals conceded in league and cup in the space of a week to Arsenal and Tottenham and now this. Next up, it’s Manchester United at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. It would have been pointless wishing the Newcastle manager a merry Christmas. Gus Poyet, on the other hand, will enjoy his Yuletide after maintaining a remarkable success rate against Newcastle. He scored six goals in 13 games against them as a player and has now won all five meetings as a manager with Brighton and Sunderland. Sir Bobby Robson once described him as the ‘scourge of Newcastle’ and Sunday’s events will only add to the legend.

Players from both teams signal to the bench as referee Anthony Taylor (right) calls for the Newcastle medical team to treat the injured Taylor . Taylor receives treatment from the Newcastle doctor before temporarily leaving the field on Sunday afternoon . Yet it all started so badly for the Uruguayan. Anthony Reveillere withdrew after injuring himself in the warm-up, which meant Sebastien Coates was called off the bench at short notice to partner Wes Brown in central defence and John O’Shea switched to left back. It would have been a difficult enough situation in any game, but even more so amid the white-hot atmosphere of the 151st Tyne-Wear derby. ‘It was a unique, strange back four and we kept a clean sheet,’ said a proud Poyet afterwards. The new set-up invited early pressure from Newcastle and Lee Cattermole got the pleasantries underway in the opening seconds by upending Daryl Janmaat. Coates picked up the first of seven yellow cards in total for a foul on Ayoze Perez, quickly followed by Newcastle skipper Fabricio Coloccini for a cynical knee into the back of Fletcher. At times it felt as though referee Anthony Taylor wasn’t so much writing names in his notebook as checking them off, such was the predictability of the bookings. Former Sunderland favourite Jack Colback and Cheick Tiote trod a fine line before Tiote was booked for smashing into the back of Connor Wickham and Colback for a nasty late challenge on Jordi Gomez. The latter was lucky not to see red shortly afterwards when the referee chose to ignore another tackle on Seb Larsson and call play back for an earlier, less serious infringement. If the transgressions were being committed fairly evenly, Sunderland — without a win in six league games before Sunday — certainly had the best of the chances before half time. Wickham somehow headed wide from barely a yard out after Johnson’s free kick had found him unmarked at the far post. And when Larsson caught Newcastle off-guard with a superb, first-time pass curled over the top of their defence, Fletcher stretched out a foot to volley past Alnwick but saw his effort come back off the bar. Steven Taylor hit a post soon after the restart but, painfully for the Newcastle centre back, it was with his face as he headed clear under pressure from Fletcher.

Newcastle boss Alan Pardew gestures to his players during the second half at St James' Park . Taylor had lengthy treatment on and off the pitch before returning to a hero’s ovation with a nasty swelling and cut under his right eye that required a ‘couple of stitches’, according to Pardew. Sunderland wasted another wonderful opportunity in his absence when Gomez nonchalantly placed the ball wide with only Alnwick to beat, and Johnson did likewise after cutting inside Coloccini. Poyet was ready to take off the former England winger. Considering Johnson’s record in this fixture, what was he thinking? Newcastle sensed it might be their day and surged forward — carelessly so, in hindsight. Pantilimon saved from Perez, substitute Adam Armstrong and then Sissoko in the moments before Johnson struck to send the Sunderland fans into raptures once again. It was a sickening blow for Newcastle but one they took on the chin. Efforts off the pitch to ease tensions in one of the most passionate local rivalries appeared to have paid off with little sign of the ugly scenes that have marred the fixture in recent years.

"Louis van Gaal admitted afterwards that this was a game Manchester United had to win to maintain their improbable title dream. But the luck they had been enjoying over six successive victories ran out. This was another incomplete performance characterised by pedestrian build-up play. United controlled possession and had a significant territorial advantage. But aside from a period at the start of the second half, they never exerted the craft or drive needed to break down the Aston Villa defence. Ron Vlaar was back to his best and Jores Okore and Ciaran Clark impressed — even when Villa were inexplicably reduced to 10 men with Gabriel Agbonlahor’s red card 25 minutes from time. United’s clinical finishing has outweighed brittle defending of late, but neither were evident here. Despite the presence of Radamel Falcao, Robin Van Persie and Wayne Rooney, sparks failed to fly. Robin van Persie fails to connect with an opportunity to give Manchester United the lead against Aston Villa . Christian Benteke opened the scoring on a day that United boss Louis van Gaal said was 'two points dropped' Benteke's shot was too good for United goalkeeper David de Gea who was left rooted to the spot . United playmaker Juan Mata (right) is tackled by Villa captain Ron Vlaar during the Villa Park encounter . Given the ground United have to make up on Chelsea, a draw away to Villa is, as Van Gaal admitted, ‘two points dropped’ even after falling behind to Christian Benteke’s opening goal of real quality. Lee Mason is the most decisive referee in the select group with straight red cards, but sometimes he sees ones which are not there. When Gabriel Agbonlahor went into a strong challenge with Ashley Young it was hard to see who made the foul. Both were committed and the Villa man’s momentum meant he caught Young on the follow-through. Mason would not have been influenced by United’s players surrounding him and he had already decided. I hope the card is rescinded on appeal. FULL REVIEW HERE. Falcao scored with a powerful header on his return to the side but his overall influence must improve. For long periods the Colombian struggled to impose himself. Rooney, who had a good game, vocalised United’s disappointment. ‘We were pushing them and we had good possession but just couldn’t get a breakthrough,’ he said. ‘We’re paying the price for that now. We should have got three points, so we’re a bit disappointed and frustrated.’ From a player who had previously talked up United’s title challenge, the overall sentiment was clear. Michael Carrick’s deployment in a three-man defence may have run its course. Darren Fletcher played in midfield due to the injury and illness of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini respectively. United substitute James Wilson (left) battles for the ball against impressive Villa defender Ciaran Clark . But the Scot could not provide the creative thrust of Carrick, who switched to midfield at half time as Tyler Blackett replaced Fletcher. Van Gaal explained: ‘We kept the ball much better but we didn’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards. That’s why I changed Darren Fletcher with Michael Carrick at half time, because I know he’s more a of a passer to the forwards. ‘But it was not good enough to get the victory here.

But there is still a long time to go. ‘When you want to be a part of the title race you have to win these games.’ Carrick predicted that Falcao is set to start showing his worth. ‘He’s scored so many goals over the years and you always feels when he gets that chance he will score.

"A last-gasp equaliser from Martin Skrtel stole a point for Liverpool against Arsenal on Sunday. Philippe Coutinho had opened the scoring for the Reds, but goals from Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud looked certain to secure three points for the visitors.

"What's Jose Mourinho’s secret to keeping his fringe players happy? Despite the abundance of world-class talent at his disposal, Mourinho has resisted the temptation to fiddle with his starting line-up too much this season. This is obviously working, with just one defeat in all competitions since the start of the season. Jose Mourinho has resisted the temptation to fiddle with his starting line-up too much this season . But why is it that, unlike other clubs, you don’t hear a peep out of those players who are not regularly in Chelsea’s starting XI? Filipe Luis, a £16million signing from Atletico Madrid who won La Liga and finished runner-up in the Champions League last season, has started three Premier League games. Goalkeeper Petr Cech, one of the major figures in Chelsea’s modern era, has made just one league start following Thibaut Courtois’ arrival at the club. Filipe Luis (right) arrived at Chelsea for £16million in the summer but has started just three games . John Mikel Obi (left) has been a stalwart at Stamford Bridge but has featured sparingly this season . John Mikel Obi, another multiple medal winner at Stamford Bridge, is not playing and there are more high-profile stars who will be warming the bench this Christmas. Yet, there have been virtually no declarations of frustration or unhappiness under Mourinho (right), whose side travel to Stoke tonight. Mourinho said: ‘It’s not difficult for me to leave players out. Everybody has to be ready to sacrifice for the team, to give everything for the team, not to be selfish. ‘This is the way I want a team to be. Mikel, for example, it was the first time he played against Newcastle and he was our best player. ‘How can he be our best player if he didn’t play in three months? Because he was working every day at the top level. Goalkeeper Petr Cech has made just one start for Mourinho's side this term . Cech (left) has been second choice for the Blues since the arrival of Thibaut Courtois . ‘Are the players sad, frustrated, not happy? Maybe, but professional. There is no secret. Players need to be patient. I don’t have a secret. ‘The reality is that, to be professional and work at a high level, you don’t need to be happy. Mark Schwarzer hasn’t played a second but if he has to play tomorrow he would be ready.’ The silence from his players is even more incredible given Mourinho does not offer those who have been left out any explanation why. ‘I just put the team up. Do I explain it? No,’ said the Portuguese. ‘It’s my decision. Players may not be happy or not agree with the decision, but they know my decision is not to favour somebody or to punish somebody. Stoke manager Mark Hughes (right) thinks Chelsea have the squad depth to lscure four trophies this season . ‘It’s what I think is best for the team at a certain moment. I don’t give explanations to players unless they ask me for one. ‘If they ask me to explain, no problem. If they ask, I’ll explain. I had one who asked, knocking on my door asking why someone else was playing instead of him. I said he was playing better, closed door, goodbye.’ Stoke manager Mark Hughes, a Chelsea player in the pre-Mourinho era, says his old club have the strength in depth to win an unprecedented quadruple of Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Capital One Cup. ‘It wouldn’t surprise me,’ he said. ‘It’s a big ask — a lot of things have to go your way (but) they are strong enough. You just sense their belief. ‘Some very good teams will try and stand in the way but they have a chance — a better chance than most teams.’","Chelsea have lost just one game in all competitions this season .

"AC Milan forward Jeremy Menez produced an outrageous piece of skill to break the deadlock in the Rossoneri's clash with Roma, only to see the linesman's flag rule his effort out. The flag had already gone up before the Frenchman had even begun his pivot, but fans were still wowed as Menez defied logic to find then net from the tightest of angles. The 27-year-old was enduring a frustrating night after being very isolated up front, especially after the dismissal of Pablo Armero, but he showed his class, even if it was all meaningless. Jeremy Menez races through and rounds the 'keeper as the linesman's flag is raised for offside . As the ball reaches the byline, he turns and uses the outside of his boot to spin the ball back towards goal . Menez looks on as his audacious effort spins back towards the line, now aware he has been flagged offside . The ball heads away from goal before spinning back due to the slice Menez put on his effort . It just creeps over the line to complete the skill, but the offside flag meant it counted for nothing . Menez, who moved to Milan in the summer after being deemed surplus to requirements at Paris Saint-Germain, showed the San Siro what he could do in September, with an astounding back-heeled goal against Parma in a thrilling 5-4 victory. With eight goals already, Menez has enjoyed a new lease of life after falling out of favour in the French capital. And fans will be hoping that with such a repertoire of skills, Menez can help the fallen giant get back to challenging at the summit of Italian football.","Jeremy Menez flicked the ball as he reached the byline after racing through .

"When Real Madrid beat San Lorenzo 2-0 on Saturday to become Club World Cup champions, skipper Iker Casillas made history. By lifting the golden trophy after his 700th game for Real, Casillas became the first captain to win eight major trophies - the Club World Cup, La Liga, Copa del Rey, Spanish Super Cup, European Super Cup, Champions League, World Cup and the European Championships. The 33-year-old can now also claim to have won every competition he has ever played in after goals from Sergio Ramos and Gareth Bale secured victory in Marrakesh.

Having been made Los Blancos captain in the summer of 2010 following the departures of Raul and Guti, Casillas lifted his first trophy as skipper at the end of the 2010-11 season when Real beat rivals Barcelona 1-0 in the Copa del Rey final. The La Liga title and the Spanish Super Cup followed in 2012, while he lifted the UEFA Super Cup, the Champions League and another Copa del Rey earlier this year.

"Martin Skrtel was disappointed at Liverpool's failure to beat Arsenal, despite his goal deep into stoppage time salvaging a 2-2 draw for the Reds. The Slovakia international powered home a header from Adam Lallana's ball into the box to rescue a point for 10-man Liverpool, who had dominated the game for long periods. Brendan Rodgers' side shifted to three at the back and that caused Arsenal problems throughout, with the hosts dominating possession, but they were unable to make it count. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers on Martin Skrtel's heroics . Martin Skrtel leaps above the Arsenal backline to power home a late leveller with his head and claim a point . The Liverpool centre back celebrates after scoring a dramatic late equaliser against Arsenal in injury time . Skrtel receives treatment on the pitch following a clash of heads with Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud . Skrtel was left with a bandaged header following the clash of heads with the Gunners' French frontman . 'Obviously we wanted to get the three points today but being down one goal and to equalise in the last minute is good, but we are disappointed we couldn't win,' Skrtel told Sky Sports 1. Philippe Coutinho gave the Reds a deserved lead on the stroke of half-time with a delightful finish, but it lasted little over a minute as Mathieu Debuchy won an aerial duel with Skrtel to make it 1-1 at the break. Skrtel was culpable again as Olivier Giroud peeled off him at the near post to put Arsenal into a 2-1 lead against the run of play just after the hour mark. Philippe Coutinho shoots through a crowd of bodies in the area to give Liverpool a 1-0 lead in the first half . When substitute Fabio Borini saw red for two rash moments it looked like it was slipping away from Liverpool, but Skrtel made the most of the nine minutes of stoppage time - which were a direct result of a head injury he suffered - to atone for his mistakes and earn the Reds a point. 'It was a great cross from Adam and I had a header before, but I've been waiting quite a while for a goal so I'm really happy,' he added. Lallana, who looked bright for the hosts, echoed Skrtel's sentiments and now wants them to kick on over the festive period. 'I thought we were the dominant team throughout the whole game and we created enough to get the victory but that's the way it's been going for us lately,' he said. Mathieu Debuchy won an aerial duel with Skrtel to make it 1-1 at the break . 'We can take a little bit of momentum out of that goal into the Christmas period but we've got games coming up that are winnable and we need to start turning these good performances into wins.' Rodgers was delighted with his side, surprisingly heralding their display as being better than the corresponding game last season which Liverpool won 5-1. 'Our performance today was better than our 5-1 here last year. There's no question about that. The dominance we had today was fantastic (and with all) the efforts on goal,' he said. The former Swansea boss highlighted how the passing and movement of his side caused problems for the Gunners but admitted he was frustrated by the goals they conceded. Olivier Giroud puts the ball through the legs of Reds goalkeeper Brad Jones to give Arsenal the lead at Anfield . Even though the 41-year-old felt Alexis Sanchez dived to secure the free-kick that led to Debuchy's leveller, he pointed out that the Reds' failure to clear it on three occasions was simply not good enough. 'We thoroughly deserved to be at least one up after the first half, but we made bad decisions defensively. I don't think it was a free-kick, I think Sanchez has dived to get the free-kick and the referee bought it,' Rodgers said. 'But then we've got to be better in the box. It's not about organisation it's about winning the duel and we lost three so from being 1-0 up and total domination we found ourselves 1-1 at half-time."" Fabio Borini receives his marching orders from referee Michael Oliver after picking up two yellow cards . The Liverpool boss was also critical of the space afforded to Giroud for the second goal, but he had no complaints about Borini's sending off. Referee Michael Oliver showed Borini his first yellow card after he threw the ball away in anger and then the Italian was given his marching orders shortly after for a high tackle on Santi Cazorla. 'Fabio was just keen to come on and affect the game,' Rodgers added. 'He picked up a silly booking for the first one, showing his passion, and obviously the foot up on the second one so there's no excuse.' Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers had no complaints about Borini's sending off at Anfield . Rodgers' opposite number Arsene Wenger felt the draw was the right result and conceded his side struggled to get going in the first half. 'It was an intense game. Of course we have the regret that we conceded on a set piece in the last minute but maybe overall a fair result,' he said. 'My first job is to win the games and if you can win them and be fair it's even better, but regret dominates tonight. When you're 2-1 up with two minutes to go you want to win the game and overall, objectively, 2-2 is a fair result.'","Martin Skrtel struck deep into extra time to salvage a 2-2 draw .

"Raheem Sterling may still be without a Premier League goal since September, but the 20-year-old can be pleased with his contribution following Liverpool's 2-2 draw against Arsenal. Sitting at the very top of Brendan Rodgers' 3-4-3 system, Sterling looked a constant threat during the first 45 minutes despite losing his early exchanges with Arsenal defenders Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers. The England international spent most of the initial period drifting across the line and found space well, often pointing to where he wanted the likes of Philippe Coutinho to play the ball.

The 20-year-old may not have had a direct hand in Liverpool's opening goal, but his darting run across the penalty area attracted the attention of German defender Per Mertesacker, giving Coutinho the space to fire Rodgers' side into the lead with a brilliant low strike. Meanwhile, after a poor first 30 minutes from Arsene Wenger's side, Alexis Sanchez was switched to the left as the visitors reverted to a 4-4-2 with Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck coming away from the wing to help lead the line. The Chilean seemed to attempt a dive midway through the first half after a tackle from Mamadou Sakho only for the ball to run out of play and referee Michael Oliver waved play on. Sterling enjoyed a 100 per cent pass completion rate during the first 45 minutes while Sanchez made four more successful passes . Sterling (left) was heavily involved during the first half which ended 1-1 between the Premier League rivals . Sterling led the line for Brendan Rodgers' side, but spent much of his time out on the left . Just as Sterling had indirectly helped his side take the lead, Sanchez was sure to have a say in Arsenal's equaliser just two minutes later. The Chilean forward, who played the majority of the game from the right, won a promising free-kick for the Gunners following a sharp turn away from Steven Gerrard. Sanchez's resulting free-kick may have been a poor one, but Liverpool's inability to clear led to Mathieu Flamini being allowed enough space to head towards team-mate Debuchy who jumped higher than Martin Skrtel to pull his side back into the game. Sanchez seemed to dive after a tackle from Mamadou Sakho, but the Chilean escaped punishment . Sanchez struggled to make his usual impact on the game, but still helped his team to three points . With Rodgers chasing the game after a second half strike from Giroud, the Reds boss sent on Fabio Borini, sending Sterling out into a left wing back position. Sterling once again showed his knack of finding pockets of space in the second half as he ran down the left and unleashed a strike which Debuchy was able to block. Liverpool's cause wasn't helped by the late red card for Borini during a frantic nine added minutes of stoppage time but Sterling and Co continued to push before Skrtel managed to head home a late leveller.

Ahead of Liverpool's key clash with Arsenal at Anfield on Sunday, Sterling added: 'There's always room for improvement.

"Jamie Redknapp believes it would have been a 'travesty' had Liverpool lost against Arsenal at Anfield, having dominated for large spells of Sunday's encounter. After missing several chances at Old Trafford in their defeat to Manchester United last time out, Liverpool were again guilty of profligacy in front of goal against the Gunners at Anfield, with 27 shots yielding just two goals. However, after going down to ten men following substitute Fabio Borini's dismissal, there are certainly plenty of positives to take out of the 2-2 draw, and Redknapp thinks things are looking up for Brendan Rodgers' men. VIDEO Scroll down to watch our summary of the stats from Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Arsenal . Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp felt Liverpool were magnificent against Arsenal on Sunday . Lucas Leiva had one of several Liverpool attempts which failed to find the net at Anfield on Suday . 'Liverpool certainly didn’t deserve to lose today,' Redknapp told Sky Sports. 'It would have been a travesty if Liverpool would have lost that game. They were magnificent. 'They have been battered at times this season. They’ve conceded too many goals and not been at their best for a while. 'If you are looking for positives, today is as good as it gets for Liverpool. Wojciech Szczesny had a busy afternoon at Anfield, with Liverpool finding the target on ten occasions . Martin Skrtel's late header rescued Liverpool, but Jamie Redknapp was pleased with what he saw . 'I know they only drew 2-2, but the manner with which they passed the ball they can only get better with Sturridge to come back. 'Going forward has been a problem, as well as at the back this season, but some of the movement was a joy to watch at times. 'How they got themselves into a position to lose that match, with the amount of chances and possession that they had I do not know.

'They are looking more of a threat that’s for sure. '(Philippe) Coutinho was brilliant today, and we are now seeing the best of (Adam) Lallana. 'He has found a position and we are seeing what he did at Southampton.

"It seems increasingly likely that Frank Lampard will play a major and far-reaching part in Manchester City’s title campaign this season. The game against Crystal Palace looked won when he was introduced on Saturday, yet it was still Lampard’s interception that started the move for the third goal, putting the contest beyond reach. As every positive contribution he makes must feel like a dagger at Stamford Bridge, Jose Mourinho has been driven to defend his sale. VIDEO Scroll down to see Manuel Pellegrini on the future of Frank Lampard . Frank Lampard has already played a crucial role in Manchester City's best moments this season . Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer is happy to be part of a rotation system, and has proved a great signing . Jose Mourinho denies that Lampard could still function in his squad, but his defence is not convincing . ‘We made the right decision,’ he insisted. ‘Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic are the next 10 years of the club. The project is to prepare for 10 years, not next year. 'Didier Drogba is a striker, coming to help and support the strikers. John Terry is the best defender in England, so it doesn’t matter how old he is. A big player like Frank would stop the development of the other guys.’ Lampard has proved useful at City, both on the pitch and in helping young players develop . The former England midfielder was again involved in a City goal this weekend, once the game was won . This makes no sense. For a start, Matic is 26, while Fabregas will be 28 in May — they are not going to do 10 years in the first team at Chelsea. Equally, Lampard, used exactly as he is at Manchester City, as an impact substitute and occasional starter in a system of rotation, would not have harmed development in the least. Indeed, as everybody at City cannot stop talking about his professionalism and worth as a role model to the youth and academy players, quite the opposite.","Frank Lampard was influential off the bench again this weekend .

"Temper tantrum: Tara Palmer-Tomkinson (pictured at an event in 2012) was arrested after reportedly being refused entry to a first-class lounge . Tara Palmer-Tomkinson was arrested by eight armed police following a temper tantrum because she was refused access to the first-class lounge at Heathrow airport. The socialite, 42, swore at officers and tore out her hair extensions in fury before she was handcuffed by police and led away, it was reported last night. Miss Palmer-Tomkinson, who has a history of drink and drug problems, had been due to fly out to the exclusive ski resort of Klosters in Switzerland to celebrate her birthday before the incident on Saturday afternoon. She is thought to have been cautioned and released without charge. One witness told The Sun:  ‘She had completely lost all control and she was screaming at officers. They had no choice but to arrest for her own and everyone else’s safety.’ The dramatic arrest was captured on video with onlookers describing her as ‘ballistic’.In the footage, Miss Palmer-Tomkinson – the goddaughter of Prince Charles – can be seen arguing with a male and female police officer. She then becomes so frustrated that she rips out a chunk of her own hair extensions and flings them at the officers’ feet amid a storm of four-letter abuse. As a third officer moves in, Miss Palmer-Tomkinson – who turns 43 tomorrow – tries to flee, screams ‘f*** off’ and hurls her coat on the floor as they stop her. Five more officers then arrive and, sobbing and screaming, the former model is restrained and handcuffed. In her rage, she also allegedly ripped a security badge from a BA manager. It is believed the incident was sparked when Miss Palmer-Tomkinson, who had a business class ticket, was prevented from entering British Airways’ first-class lounge. The Sun reported that police were called when she attempted to go back through security the wrong way. Another onlooker added: ‘She went ballistic, she screamed “I can’t f****** believe you are treating me like this”.’ Last night, Miss Palmer-Tomkinson claimed that she had not been drinking at the time and that a panic attack had triggered her behaviour. She said: ‘I was not drunk, there was no disorderly; I was cautioned and I saw a doctor, they were nice to me.’ She flew out to Switzerland last night. Earlier this year, Miss Palmer-Tomkinson gave an interview in which she claimed to be a recluse. She said that nowadays she hardly ever leaves her home because of anxiety and that the problem has become so severe that she has only gone outside three times this year. In an interview with talk show host Jeremy Kyle, she said she checked herself back to rehab two years ago after a nervous breakdown triggered by paranoia and anxiety. Royal link: Miss Palmer-Tomkinson was on her way to a ski resort at the time of the incident. She is pictured left with godfather Prince Charles, and right with the Duchess of Cambridge, then Kate Middleton . She also claimed that the experience has left her terrified to touch drugs again, and that she has seen a therapist every week for the last nine years. Her battle with drugs has been well-documented. In 1999, Miss Palmer-Tomkinson spent time in a rehabilitation centre, the Meadows, in Arizona, after she made a disorientated appearance on the Frank Skinner show. She was forced her to undergo reconstructive surgery on her nose after it collapsed in 2006 – damage which needed a further procedure in 2011. The former party girl, who admits she once had a £400-a-day cocaine habit, has also become infamous for her string of failed relationships. After being linked to the likes of Robbie Williams and James Blunt, she now claims not to want a boyfriend – because she can’t stand the way men eat.","Socialite reportedly tore out her hair extensions after being refused entry .

"Warm, woolly jumpers are a staple in most people’s winter wardrobe. The very essence of eco-friendly fashion, they conjure images of fields filled with contented sheep — a quintessentially British scene. The use of wool is even encouraged by the Prince of Wales, patron of the global Campaign for Wool. Although the unethical production of luxury fabrics such as cashmere and angora has (quite rightly) come under fire — thanks to distressing evidence of goats packed into atrocious factory farms, like battery hens, and live rabbits having their fur ripped out of their skin — sheep-shearing has always been deemed a pretty benign process. Scroll down for video . The unethical production of luxury cashmere and angora has been criticised in the past, however sheep shearing has received little attention . But now some are suggesting your ordinary woolly jumper may not be as ethical as you think. An undercover video filmed by animal rights campaigners shows sheep being hit, kicked, stabbed and stamped on by men shearing them at high speed. The footage was filmed in 30 farms across the U.S. and Australia — the largest exporter of wool in the world, with the Chinese and Indian rag trades its biggest markets. The Prince of Wales (pictured) has encouraged the use of wool, and is a patron of the Global Campaign for Wool . Since these countries manufacture cheap jumpers for the UK market, it’s an issue that feeds directly into the British High Street. And, says Peta, who made the film, it is the tip of a very large, disturbing iceberg. ‘The investigators recorded shearers as they violently punched struggling sheep and beat and jabbed them in the face with sharp shears,’ says Peta spokesperson Ben Williamson. ‘These routine attacks leave the animals bleeding from their eyes, nose and mouth.’ These revelations come on top of a long, unsuccessful campaign to ban another cruel practice in Australian sheep farms called mulesing — in which a portion of skin is carved from the sheep’s backside using shears, usually without anaesthetic, to prevent ‘flystrike’, a deadly infestation of maggots. Brands from Marks & Spencer to John Lewis have rejected wool that comes from mulesed sheep, demanding other methods of avoiding flystrike, and New Zealand has banned it altogether, yet Australia’s wool board has delayed plans to phase out the practice. Most sheep are bred for meat with wool as a by-product, even if the fleeces are not taken directly from a carcass . Almost all Merino wool — from an ancient breed of hardy sheep — on the High Street comes from Australia and New Zealand, including anything labelled with the Woolmark logo, and unless a brand states its opposition to mulesing, it is likely to have been subject to the practice. Philip Brooke, welfare development manager for the organisation Compassion in World Farming, is outraged by it, saying: ‘It is unacceptable that sheep should be roughly handled, thrown around, punched, kicked or hit with sharp or blunt metal objects.’ Even the British Wool Marketing Board (BWMB), the organisation through which, by law, almost all British fleece wool must be sold, is adamant such behaviour is unacceptable. ‘I’m 61, I’ve been in the shearing industry all my life, and I have never seen sheep treated that way,’ says BWMB’s shearing training manager Colin MacGregor. Ethical sheep farmer and wool producer, Isobel Davies (pictured) uses wool from sheep that have been rescued from slaughter for her luxury brand Izzy Lane . ‘In the UK that would never happen. Here, when we teach young shearers it’s about respect for the animal, and keeping it calm is all in the hold. I think I can speak for every farmer in the UK: their animals are their pride and joy.’ The problem, though, is that there’s no way of knowing what you are buying. Your wool could be from China — where intensive farming is on the up, and which is now the second largest producer in the world — or from Australia or even Iran, the ninth largest producer. Unless it is marked as British, you can have no clue. PETA spokesman, Ben Williamson (pictured) said ‘The investigators recorded shearers as they violently punched struggling sheep and beat and jabbed them in the face with sharp shears’ ‘People are able to make informed choices about their meat and know how the animal has been raised,’ says ethical sheep farmer and wool producer, Isobel Davies. ‘Yet when it comes to wool, they are given no information. Have the sheep been sheared then live-exported and traded round the globe before being slaughtered? There is simply no way of knowing.’ She uses wool from sheep rescued from slaughter and allowed to live out their days happily in her fields for her luxury brand, Izzy Lane, and has been trying with little luck to persuade the BWMB to introduce a premium wool label that takes account of welfare standards. ‘Humane, slaughter-free wool is achievable at an industrial level,’ she insists. ‘Not at Primark prices — there is inevitably a premium. But increasing numbers are turning their backs on fast fashion in favour of buying less and more ethically.’ Model Lily Cole's company, The North Circular, works with luxury brand Izzy Lane . A number of companies do make the effort to source more ethically produced wool. British brands Icebreaker and Finisterre offer full traceability on all their fabrics, including Australian Merino wool from a non-mulesed flock, and, in Finisterre’s case, rare Bowmont sheep in Devon. The model Lily Cole’s company The North Circular works with Izzy Lane, and Jaeger has exclusive UK rights to Gostwyck wool — an Australian Merino producer that claims to have the happiest sheep in the world. If you’re vegetarian, be under no illusions, though: most sheep are bred for meat, and wool is a by-product, even if the fleeces are not taken directly from a carcass. Philip Brooke, (pictured) welfare development manager for the organisation Compassion in World Farming, is outraged by Peta's video revealing cruel practices in wool shearing. ‘The great thing about wool is that it’s sustainable fibre,’ says Colin MacGregor. ‘It’s not reliant on oil and it’s a fibre that keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer. It’s one of the greenest fibres there ever will be.’ A biodegradable, breathable fibre with no petrochemicals? Sounds like a dream — if only there was some easy way to know just what you’re getting when you buy your jumper.","An undercover video  shows sheep being hit, kicked and stabbed .

"Though one year ago Miley the husky was discovered as a stray dog sitting on top of a mound of trash and suffering from mange, she now has a full, fluffy white coat and is full of energy. Her complete change was revealed in a YouTube video by dog rescuer Eldad Hagar and the rescue group Hope for Paws, which Hagar founded with his wife Audrey. 'I think dogs really appreciate the rescuers, you can really feel it,' Eldad Hagar says in the video, which was uploaded to YouTube last Saturday. Scroll down for video .

He continues 'Sometimes I see dogs long time after they were rescued, and you can tell that they appreciate it. It's just a special bond that was created between us during the rescue.' Archival footage of Miley in the YouTube clip shows her being approached with food and a leash by Hagar in November 2013 as she sits on the mound of trash. 'Okay so she definitely has mange,' Hagar said in the November footage. In the YouTube video, Hagar says of retrieving Miley 'We spent quite a while on that pile of trash. We spent an hour just to reassure her that everything will be fine because I wanted to be a positive experience for her, to create a less stressful event from this whole thing.' He also recalls 'I mean it's interesting. She actually like, jumped into my car. She was so ready to be rescued.'

'Many people don't realize how exhausting it is to be a stray dog,' Hagar also says. 'You're always on alert because you don't know who is gonna come behind you or who is gonna attack you or who is going to be not kind to you.' The sickly pooch is then seen being taken in and cared for by workers. The video also shows her burgeoning friendship with Frankie, a chihuahua who was pullet out of an underground tunnel. The healed pet runs around and hops on a bed as Hagar looks in the clip. The Huffington Post, which earlier reported on Miley's turnaround, said she was adopted four months after Hagar found her and took her in. He told the website last week 'To see Miley transforming from that dog who dying on a pile of trash, and now living in one of the most beautiful homes I have ever seen in my life is so amazing to me. It was very rewarding to see her so happy.' More information on Hope for Paws can be found on the organization's website.

"The family of an NYPD officer shot dead in broad daylight on Saturday has forgiven his  murderer, a relative revealed. Rafael Ramos' cousin, Ronnie Gonzalez, insists their focus is on remembering the 40-year-old officer, father of two boys, rather than gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley. '[Brinsley] in the hands of God now,' Gonzalez told Pix11. 'We don't believe in vengeance, we just forgive.' He added that Ramos was due to graduate as a chaplain this weekend. 'We don't believe in vengeance': A cousin of officer Rafael Ramos (the slain cop who is pictured left with his wife) claims the family has forgiven killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley (right) saying 'he is in the hands of God now' 'My cousin had a couple of priorities in his life,' Ronnie Gonzalez told the Wall Street Journal from outside the Brooklyn home where Officer Ramos grew up. 'One was God, because he was a God-loving man,' said Mr Gonzalez. 'I wish I could be half the man my cousin was. He was sweet. He didn't deserve…to die.' His words come just 24 hours after Ramos and his partner officer Wenjian Liu were gunned to their deaths while they ate lunch in a patrol car on their first day in a new precinct. It has since emerged Brinsley asked passersby to follow him on Instagram and said 'watch what I'm going to do' before killing the two men. NYPD officers: The gunman  fired a fatal round of bullets at Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) 'We have to move forward': Ramos' aunt Lucy Ramos told reporters the city needs to reach peace . Vigil: Hundreds of mourners gathered on the corner of Tompkins and Myrtle Avenues to remember the cops . The 28-year-old had earlier posted to the social network boasting that he would take the lives of two policemen. He walked up behind the patrol car of officers Ramos and Liu, parked up in Brooklyn, then fired four bullets at their heads, 'execution style'. Brinsley had already been arrested 19 times for offenses including concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce revealed a timeline which began with the shooting of an ex-girlfriend near Baltimore, and ended with Ismaaiyl's suicide on a subway platform. Mourning: The crowds sang 'we shall overcome' and 'this little light of mine' while laying flowers and candles . Tributes: NYPD badges were seen strewn among the mementos, including Christmas wreaths and holly . United: Members of the police force stood with members of the public to sing and mourn together . Gesture: New York Jets center Nick Mangold took to the stadium in an NYPD cap on Sunday . Worldwide statement: His message was broadcast across the world as he was filmed at the coin toss . Describing the final moments, caught on surveillance cameras, he said: 'We have found on one of our videos two males who spoke with the perpetrator just prior to the event. 'He asks them three things: For their gang affiliation, he asks them to follow him on Instagram, then he says 'watch what I'm going to do'. 'He then walks north down on Tompkins, past the two officers in the car, circles back around, goes across the street, then comes up behind the officers.'

Paying respect: NYPD officers  participate in a moment of silence for the two slain cops before an NBA basketball game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Detroit Pistons yesterday . Mourning: NYPD officers around the city paid their respects last night while hundreds of New Yorkers gathered at the scene of the shooting with blue flowers . Boyce added that Brinsley threatened to hang himself a year ago, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive. He said: 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month. 'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.' Last night, hundreds of New Yorkers gathered at the scene of the shooting with blue flowers, NYPD badges, Christmas wreaths and candles to pay tribute to officers Ramos and Liu. They sang This Little Light Of Mine and We Shall Overcome. Bereaved: Jaden Ramos wrote the moving message in a public post after his father was murdered yesterday . Gift: Jaden posted this picture online some days ago as a birthday present to his father . New York Jets center Nick Mangold offered his condolences by wearing an NYPD cap as he entered the MetLife stadium on Sunday. Ramos' 13-year-old son Jaden expressed his devastation that will never see his father  again in a Facebook post on Sunday. He said he was heartbroken after Ramos was murdered along with his partner 'just for being a police officer'. Shared loss: A message of condolence is lit up by candlelight at the memorial to the NYPD officers . A mountain of flowers and other tributes lie on the corner of Tompkins and Myrtle Avenues in Brooklyn . Fallen colleagues: Four NYPD officers pay their respects at the makeshift memorial during last night's vigil . 'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' Jaden posted. He continued: 'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.' It was a somber addendum to an earlier December post in which he honored his dad's 40th birthday. 'Happy birthday to the best dad in the world, you are always there for me even when it's almost impossible,' he wrote on December 9. 'We have so many good times it's not even funny, I love you so much.' Two men release a sky lantern as demonstrators gathered in Central Park for a candlelight vigil and march .

The group will also set aside money for education-related expenses needed by both spouses of the murderered officers. William Walters, chairman of the group which funds academic expenses for slain law enforcement officers, told ABC News: 'We just want to do good for these people that take care of us'. He said they plan to discuss the funds with the families on Monday. Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand . The first official words from Ramos' family came at a press conference on Sunday night. The officer's aunt, Lucy Ramos, told reporters: 'I would like to thank all those who have shared their sympathy and support for our beloved family member, Rafael Ramos, who will always be loved and missed by many. 'I hope and pray that we can reflect on this tragic loss of lives that has occurred so that we can move forward and find an amicable patch to a peaceful coexistence.'

"A 13-year-old California boy stopped a kidnapper in his tracks as he tried to take off with his four-year-old sister, deputies said Saturday. ABC reports Earl Williams, 61, walked past the fence of a Lancaster home and into the yard where the little girl was. He asked her what her name was, picked her up and tried to walk away, before her older brother grabbed Williams by the arm and yelled for someone to call police.

"They were cleared of accusations they enslaved and abused their nanny. But now this wealthy New York City couple have been barred from the country - after a border official cited the case as evidence of human trafficking. Malu Custer Edwards and Micky Hurley, both descended from Chilean aristocracy, spent a year in and out of court denying Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garnica's allegations that she was locked up and abused in the  Upper East Side apartment. Stranded: Socialites Malu Custer Edwards, 29, left, and Mickey Hurley, 35, right, who descended from Chilean aristocracy, are not allowed to return to New York from Italy despite being cleared of abusing their nanny . Their 50-year-old aide testified that she was brought to the US from Chile using a fake passport and forced to work 12 hours a day for just $2 an hour for three months looking after their three children. However, a judge dismissed the case on December 10, claiming Villanueva contradicted her own testimony. Despite the ruling, 30-year-old Ms Edwards, 37-year-old Mr Hurley, and their young children - aged three, five and seven - remain in exile in the northern town of Portofino, which brands itself as the eighth wonder of the world. Ms Edwards, whose ancestor Agustín Edwards Mac-Clure led the League Of Nations in 1922, said in an interview with the New York Times that friends remark: ''Well, what's so bad about Italy?'' Her response: 'Well, just wait until you are anywhere in the world, and you think you'll be there a couple of weeks, and then be told you can't go back to where your life is.' She and Mr Hurley, who descends from Chile's founding fathers, are now looking for a new rental apartment and appealing to the consul general in Italy. Meanwhile, she says, they are struggling to ignore a tumultuous influx of hate mail. 'We have received hate mail and even death threats from the lies that were said about our children and ourselves,' she told the New York Post. 'We just want to return to our current lives in New York.' 'Distress': The couple and their three children aged three to seven are stuck in Portofino, north Italy . 'Abuse': Ms Edwards claims the pair have been receiving hate mail in the wake of the dismissed lawsuit . The lawsuit against the family was thrown out this month after a judge said Garnica contradicted herself. According to the New York Post, court documents show Judge Alvin Hellerstein found Garnica 'testified that she did not believe her own allegation, that the mother, Malu Custer Edwards, purposefully allowed the children to hit her,' and that she 'testified she was never locked in any room.' Despite the denials from Edwards and Hurley, the New York Department of Labor ordered the couple to pay Villanueva $6,302 in back wages in 2011. Garnica had claimed to the New York Post that the couple often left her with only small slices of bread and milk to eat, while they were regulars at the exclusive French restaurant Balthazar - where entrees run $30 to $45. 'The claims are completely without merit and will be fully refuted in court,' attorney Robin Alperstein told the Post. Garnica said she began working for Edwards and Hurley in Chile in December 2010 but the coupledecided to move to New York in January 2011 so Edwards could enroll the the New School. She claimed the couple did not deliver on their promise of $10-an-hour and health care. Finally, in March 2011, she quit her job claiming one of the children slammed her head in a door.","Micky Hurley, 37, and Malu Custer Edwards, 30, were accused of abusing Chilean nanny and locking her in their Upper West Side apartment .

"'Plum' bonus: CEO Rick Holley refused $1.85million worth of Plum Creek stock . The CEO of a timber management company refused $1.85million worth of stock because he hadn't done enough to deserve the bonus, an SEC filing reported. Rick Holley, who heads Seattle-based Plum Creek Timber, returned 44,445 shares of company stock, claiming he didn't earn it because shareholders did not enjoy an increase in returns. Even the board of directors couldn't believe an executive would pass up millions as a matter of conscience. Holley told Fortune the board  was 'surprised' when he decided to return the bonus. 'I told them I wasn’t asking for their approval. They had given these to me and I appreciated their confidence in me, but I didn’t feel comfortable taking them.' The numbers, Holley said, just didn't show the strong performance he believed was deserving of a bonus. 'This has been a year where total shareholder returns are down 10% or more,' he said. 'It just wasn’t the right thing to do.' Holley likely won't be hurting financially, as the Plum Creek chief took home over $8million in 2013 and still owns stock valued at $11.8million in the company. The list of executives willing to forgo the extra compensation is short. In January, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty turned down her 2013 performance bonus after the company's stock dropped for seven straight quarters, the Washington Post reported. Timber!: Holley stated that with returns in Plum Creek - which manages forestland and energy and mineral extraction - down 10 percent or more, it 'wasn't the right thing to do' to keep the bonus . The chief executive at Barclays, Antony Jenkins, turned down his bonus for 2013, the year the bank was forced to raise billions from stockholders to shore up its books. But the CEO still made off with 1.9million shares of Barclays stock, valued at over $6million at the time, the Guardian reported.

The next year, the board approved a bump in compensation to $18.5million in restricted stock, over the protests of a small minority of directors. The Telegraph reported Nokia CEO Stephen Elop refused to take less than $25million after selling the handset unit to Microsoft, while regular employees were denied bonuses and faced layoffs. A Securities and Exchange Commission document filed by Plum Creek earlier this month noted Holley's bonus, which would have vested in February 2017, was given 'as incentive for [Holley] to remain in his position as chief executive officer for the next several years.' The Plum Creek CEO 'elected to return the restricted stock units because he does not believe that he should receive such an award unless Plum Creek’s stockholders see an increase in their investment return.' 'Nonetheless, Mr. Holley remains fully committed to Plum Creek and intends to lead the company through this challenging and prolonged economic cycle,' the filing added. The document also noted Holley returned the bonus on December 12, when shares opened at just under $42. Plum Creek, which is also invested in energy and mineral extraction, land development and conservation, is the largest private owner of forestland in the United States. The AP reports that earlier this month a watchdog group asked the Sustainable Forestry Initiative to investigate Plum Creek's green certification for logging in Oregon's Coast Range. The complaint by the Center for Sustainable Economy noted the company had four citations for exceeding a 120-acre limit on clear cutting and included evidence of landslides in areas logged by Plum Creek.","Rick Holley, CEO of Plum Creek Timber, returned the bonus earlier this month .

"Actor James Woods took to Twitter on Sunday to blame the Rev. Al Sharpton, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Obama for being 'responsible' for the murder of two NYPD officers on Saturday . Actor James Woods took to Twitter on Sunday to blame the Rev. Al Sharpton, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio and President Obama for being ‘responsible’ for the murder of two NYPD officers on Saturday. Sharpton came in for the worst of Woods’ abuse, with the former Academy Award nominee calling him a ‘race pimp’ and a ‘disgusting pig’. At one point on Sunday morning Woods’ tweeted: ‘This disgusting pig is DIRECTLY responsible for the murder of two good policemen. No discussion’. The tweet included a photo of Sharpton at a protest against police. Woods later took down that post, reports Daily Caller, but he continued tweeting using a series of hashtags including '#PigSharpton', '#RaceHucksters', '#TurnYourBack', '#BlueLivesMatter' Woods, 67, even called for a boycott of Sony Entertainment - after executives from the company recently promised to work with Sharpton after leaked emails featured racist comments. The president also came in for criticism including a tweet that featured a photo of Sharpton and Obama and the text ‘mission accomplished’. Woods also applauded  the NYPD officers who turned their backs on Mayor de Blasio during his press conference following Saturday's shootings.

This isn’t the first time Woods has used Twitter to express his political views. Last year he called President Obama ‘a true abomination’ and then tweeted that he didn’t think he would work again because of his opinions. 'I don’t expect to work again. I think Barack Obama is a threat to the integrity and future of the Republic. My country first,' he wrote in response. The Rev. Al Sharpton said Eric Garner's family has no connection to a man who murdered two New York City cops in an apparent retribution killing as he revealed at a Sunday press conference threats made on his life in racist profanity-laced voicemail. He also said there is no place for angry rhetoric that blames protesters or New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. 'We are now under intense threat from those who are misguided,' he said. 'From those who are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight.' In one tweet, Woods accused Sharpton of being 'DIRECTLY responsible for the murder of two good policemen. No discussion’, although he later deleted it . Woods tweeted throughout Sunday using a series of hashtags including '#PigSharpton', '#RaceHucksters', '#TurnYourBack', '#BlueLivesMatter' Woods, 67, even called for a boycott of Sony Entertainment - after executives from the company recently promised to work with Sharpton after leaked emails featured racist comments . Sharpton told The Associated Press that he's considering tightening his personal security after receiving nine messages threatening him — all within hours of the shooting. He then clicked on his cellphone and played one message in which the male caller used the N-word to address the preacher, followed by a stream of four-letter words used to describe protest actions Sharpton has led against police-involved deaths of unarmed blacks. 'The language is ""Hey N word, stop killing innocent people, I'm going to get you,"" and I have several like this,' he said, according to silive.com. 'We are now under intense threat from those that are misguided, by those that are trying to blame everyone from civil rights leaders to the mayor rather than deal with an ugly spirit that all of us need to fight.' Sharpton continued: 'There are those of us committed to nonviolence and making the system work. 'And there are those committed to anarchy and recklessness who could care less about the families of police or the families who have raised questions about police accountability.' He was joined at the National Action Network by the wife and mother or Eric Garner, who both advocated non-violence. Threats: Al Sharpton appeared at a press conference Sunday in which he played a racist threat he received in the wake of a double cop killing in Brooklyn on Saturday . Not involved: Rev. Al Sharpton holds up his phone after saying he received threatening voice mail messages as he is joined by Esaw Garner, Eric Garner's widow, during a press conference denouncing the shooting deaths of two New York Police Department officers at the National Action Network on Sunday . Brown's family condemned the shooting in a statement posted online by their attorney. 'We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities,' the family said. Garner, who was black, died after he was taken down by a white officer during an arrest on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes. The 18-year-old Brown, who was black, was fatally shot by a white officer. He was unarmed. Most of the protests have been peaceful, particularly in New York. Bratton said police were investigating whether Brinsley had attended any rallies or demonstrations and why he had chosen to kill the officers. De Blasio said the killings of Ramos and Liu strike at the heart of the city. 'Our city is in mourning. Our hearts are heavy,' said de Blasio, who spoke softly with moist eyes. 'It is an attack on all of us.' Scores of officers in uniform lined up three rows deep at the hospital driveway. The line stretched into the street. Officers raised their hands in a silent salute as two ambulances bore away the slain officers' bodies. The mayor ordered flags at half-staff. Sharpton and the family of Eric Garner appeared together at a press conference Sunday to distance themselves from the cop killings . Defended: The families of Michael Brown (left) and Eric Garner (right) have condemned the killings of two police officers after it emerged gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley said his attack was avenging their deaths . In a statement Saturday night, Attorney General Eric Holder condemned the shooting deaths as senseless and 'an unspeakable act of barbarism.' Obama, vacationing in Hawaii, issued a statement saying he unconditionally condemns the slayings. 'The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day — and they deserve our respect and gratitude every single day,' Obama said. 'Tonight, I ask people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal — prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen.' The shootings ended a bizarre route for Brinsley that began in Maryland early Saturday. He went to the home of a former girlfriend in a Baltimore suburb and shot and wounded her. Police there said they noticed Brinsley posting from the woman's Instagram account threats to kill New York officers. Baltimore-area officials sent a warning to New York City police, who received it moments too late, Bratton said. Officers pursued Brinsley after the shooting to a nearby subway station, where he shot himself in the head as a subway train door full of people closed. A silver handgun was recovered at the scene, Bratton said. Assassinated: Rafael Ramos (left) and his partner Wenjian Liu (right) were shot dead while on patrol .

"Chris Christie has personally appealed to President Barack Obama to extradite Tupac's aunt from Cuba. Joanne Chesimard, a former Black Panther Party member who is living under the name Assata Shakur, last year became the first woman on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list for fleeing to the Caribbean island after executing a police officer in 1973. Now, following the landmark change in relations between the US and Cuba, New Jersey Governor Christie has launched a bid to retrieve the 67-year-old from her hiding place. Wanted: Gov Chris Christie has launched a personal appeal to extradite Tupac's aunt Joanne Chesimard . Convicted: The 67-year-old, now living as Assata Shakur, escaped jail in 1973 after killing Werner Foerster . In a letter to the president, Christie slams the deal with Castro's communist government but says it is an opportunity to bring justice and prove Cuba is ready for 'serious change'. He wrote: 'I do not share your view that restoring diplomatic relations without a clear commitment from the Cuban government of the steps they will take to reverse decades of human rights violations will result in a better and more just Cuba for its people. 'However, despite my profound disagreement with this decision, I believe there is an opportunity for Cuba and its government to show the American people it is serious about change.' Chesimard was convicted of killing New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973 during a gunbattle after being stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike. Appeal: Christie wrote to Obama condemning the new relationship with CUba but urging action on Chesimard . 'Armed and dangerous': Last year Chesimard became the first female on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list . Chesimard's nephew was rapper Tupac Shakur, who was shot dead in a drive-by in September 1996 . She was found guilty but escaped from prison and eventually fled to Cuba, where she was granted asylum by Fidel Castro. Christie's appeal comes despite his reluctance to weigh in on contentious foreign policy issues as he mulls a run for president in 2016. He said Cuba's decision to grant Chesimard asylum 'is an affront to every resident of our state, our country, and in particular, the men and women of the New Jersey State Police, who have tirelessly tried to bring this killer back to justice.' Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council, said it will 'continue to press in our engagement with the Cuban government for the return of U.S. fugitives in Cuba to pursue justice for the victims of their crimes.'","Joanne Chesimard, or Assata Shakur, shot and killed a cop in 1973 .

"An overweight British man won a landmark discrimination case against his employers, after a High Court judge ruled the effects of obesity can be classed as a disability. John Walker, 49, weighed more than 21 stone when he was dismissed from his post as an IT manager at Sita Information Networking Computing UK. He was sacked after spending seven years off work with health problems linked to his size such as asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, chronic fatigue and knee problems. Scroll down for video . An overweight British man won a landmark discrimination case against his employers, after a High Court judge ruled the effects of obesity can be classed as a disability. Above, the High Court in London . Mr Walker, from Bude in Cornwall, initially lost the case when it was ruled that he could not be categorised as disabled but that decision was overturned on appeal. It is understood that Mr Walker, who now weighs 19 stone, has since secured a six-figure settlement from a health insurance company. His case echoes the ruling by the European Courts of Justice last week that although obesity itself was not deemed to be a disability protected under EU laws, it could be disabling in its effects. It means that companies could now be obliged to provide bigger desks and special parking spaces to accommodate larger staff members. Karsten Kaltoft, a 25st Danish childminder, claimed he was fired because his weight affected his performance . The ECJ case was brought by Karsten Kaltoft, a 25st Danish childminder, who claimed he was fired because his weight affected his performance. The development was described as ‘regrettable’ by Tam Fry, a spokesman for the National Obesity Forum. He said: ‘Employers should be hugely concerned about this. They will face problems if employees insist that they are disabled, and need special furniture or wider access to fire exits, for example. ‘But the biggest cost will be the amount of money they will have to spend in contesting cases made against them. Lawyers will be licking their lips over this ruling.’ He added that lack of clarity around what constitutes obesity would prove problematic. ‘In my opinion the [European] court was gravely in error not to put a definition on what they consider to be disabling obesity,’ he said. ‘They did not confirm the original ruling from July which indicated having a body mass index of 40 would be the cut-off point. Now, without that definition, every person over the World Health Organisation’s threshold of a BMI of 30 will feel that they can make a claim.’ He said in practice overweight people would face more discrimination and feel further singled out by sitting in ‘the office “fat-chair”’ or by being allocated a more desirable parking space ahead of their colleagues. In Britain, 64 per cent of adults are overweight or obese, costing the NHS £5 billion a year.","IT manager John Walker weighed more than 21 stone when he was sacked .

The New York police officer captured on a smartphone video punching a teenage suspect during an arrest last week has been suspended, although the department refused to divulge the officer's name . 'Punch': Footage appears to show the man punching the boy as officers move to let him into the circle . The NYPD hasn't released the name of the officer, left, who was in plain clothes at the time of the incident . The video shows several uniformed officers struggling to handcuff a 16-year-old boy before a plainclothes officer rushes in and throws two punches. A woman can be heard yelling at the officers to stop what they're doing. Another woman says she can't believe what she's seeing after 'everything that's happened,' an apparent reference to the chokehold death of Eric Garner. Garner, a black man, died after a white officer applied an alleged chokehold while arresting him for selling un-taxed cigarettes during the summer. When a grand jury opted not to indict the officer last month, thousands took to the streets of New York City in protest. In the video taken last Monday, the teen appeared to be resisting officers who were attempting to handcuff him. Suddenly, a plain-clothes cop ran up from behind and punched the teen several times in the side. Screams: Witnesses screamed at the man to stop as the 16-year-old boy lost his footing .

Actress Sarah Doneghy, who caught the incident on her phone camera, said on YouTube: 'This happened today on my way to the post office. 'The kids were 12. They had supposedly pushed one of their classmates down. 'However when the victim was asked, he said those weren't the guys.' 'They were still taken away,' Doneghy added. '12. Years. Old.'

"Getting supplies to astronauts on the International Space Station can be a long, costly process and, unfortunately, UPS doesn't deliver to outer space. However, this week, thanks to Made In Space's Zero-Gravity 3-D Printer, astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore got a ratcheting socket wrench he needed uplinked --or transmitted-- to him in space, CNN reports. Since its launch in September, the 3-D printer has made a total of 21 objects aboard the ISS, according to Business Insider, those objects had previously been tested on the printer with back-up files created. Scroll down for video . Wrench: The Zero-Gravity 3-D printer aboard the International Space Station 'emailed' a ratcheting socket wrench (photographed) to outer space . On December 17, MIS designed, qualified, tested, and printed the wrench in space in less than a week, according to the MIS site. Unlike the 21 objects printed before it, the wrench's design did not exist when the printer was first launched. The wrench took four hours to print and the entire process took less than a week, CNN reports. The tool has rounded edges and finger grooves to make it 'more ergonomic and improve the grip,' according to MIS. The wrench will be returned to Earth, along with other 3-D printed parts, for observation and testing. Installed: Astronaut Barry 'Butch' Wilmore initially installed the 3-D printer and recently received the wrench he needed from the 3-D printer . The 3-D printer is the first to operate in zero gravity, according to CNN, and printed its first object in November. The object was a part for the printer. In a news release, Niki Werkheiser, NASA's 3-D print manager, said the printer will be 'critical for exploration missions.' 'This means that we could go from having a part designed on the ground to printed in orbit within an hour to two from start to finish,' Werkheiser said. 'The on-demand capability can revolutionize the constrained supply chain model we are limited to today...' The printer will decrease cost, decrease risk, and increase efficiency, according to the news release. The process of printing an object can take anywhere from 15 minutes to hours, depending on its size and complexity. Zero-Gravity: Photographed is the Zero-Gravity 3-D printer, created by Made In Space, and launched in September . Manufacture: The printer receives a hardware code and can immediately begin manufacturing an object . The process of uplinking objects to the ISS includes designing the objects hardware, converting that hardware into a file-format the 3-D printer can read, sending the file to NASA, and, finally, transmitting the file to the ISS. The zero-gravity printer then receives the code and can begin manufacturing the object immediately. This new, innovative technology is a big step for space exploration. Normally, astronauts would wait anywhere between weeks and months for objects they needed in space. But now, thanks to the zero-gravity printer, astronauts no longer need to wait.","A zero-gravity 3-D printer manufactured a socket wrench in the International Space Station .

"The Sydney cafe gunman's widow, Amirah Droudis, has been jailed after her bail was revoked following a successful plea from government prosecutors in Sydney on Monday. Accused of murdering Man Horan Monis's previous wife, Droudis today faced Downing Centre Local Court in downtown Sydney where prosecutors argued she was 'capable of doing criminal acts' on her fanatical husband's behalf. Noleen Hayson Pal's body was found stabbed and burned to death in the stairwell of a western Sydney apartment block in April 2013. Droudis was charged with her murder and Monis as an accessory to the alleged killing. Chief Magistrate Grame Henson said Droudis posed an 'unacceptable risk to the community' after prosecutors introduced more than 90 minutes of fresh video evidence. The material was not tendered in court during Droudis' previous bail hearing in December 2013, twelve months prior. Scroll down for video . Amirah Droudis, 35, arrived at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Monday morning . As she was surrounded by police officers, Droudis appeared impassive and handed her belongings to her brother, John Aspros, whose hand she held during proceedings. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird hailed today's development. 'The NSW Government expects community safety to be front and centre of all bail decisions and that is why the Attorney General expressed concern and requested a review of the case,' he said in a statement. The dramatic ruling came as deputy senior Crown prosecutor John Pickering SC showed a closed court more than 90 minutes of video Droudis made with Monis. Prosecutors also claimed that Monis, who was shot dead when police stormed the Lindt cafe in Sydney's Martin Place last Tuesday to end a 16-hour siege, was the 'driving force' in his marriage with Droudis - who, as a 'plump' woman with 'olive skin', is 'extremely closely aligned' with the physical description of Ms Pal's killer. A copy of remarks made by a judge when Droudis was sentenced to sending abusive letters to the families of dead Australian Defence Force personnel several years ago were also included in the prosecution's case. Droudis' defence lawyers had argued the application was 'frivolous'. They attempted to provide Judge Hansen with a letter from the family to the court outlining why she should be bailed, but the chief magistrate said: 'I've already made my decision'. In one of several videos posted on Monis' website, Droudis announced: 'I regret to say I am a terrorist. I admit and formally confess that for many years I have been a terrorist, but I’ll try not to be anymore.' The court heard today that multiple women appeared in Monis's videos. Droudis will be required to front Penrith Local Court on February 27, 2015 via audio-visual link. Outside court, she refused to comment on her husband's actions last week - where he held 18 people hostage and killed two in the Martin Place siege before he was killed in a hail of bullets sixteen hours after the crisis began. Hostages Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson and the gunman died when police stormed the cafe more than 16 hours after the siege began. Earlier this year, a court heard that Droudis and Monis vigorously denied the murder allegations and would plead not guilty. Judge Henson reminded the court the 'presumption of innocence' is a cornerstone of Australian democracy and needs to be taken into account. The court heard that some evidence presented in the case - including a video where Droudis is seen holding a long matchstick similar to one presumed used in Pal's murder - is  'circumstantial'. The wife of the Sydney siege gunman is in court where authorities are pushing for her to be placed behind bars over murder charges . Last Thursday, Attorney-General Brad Hazzard demanded the DPP review Droudis' bail decision after it was revealed Monis and his wife were on bail during last week's crisis. Mr Hazzard said: 'The charges laid against Amirah Droudis are extremely serious and her alleged actions involve a murder. 'This week I asked the DPP to review any cases where bail had been granted where there may have been any similarity to the circumstances of Man Haron Monis. 'In this case the allegation is that he and she had involvement in the murder of Monis' ex-wife. 'On behalf of our community I want to know whether every aspect of her being on bail has been examined in all possible detail.' An autopsy of Monis's body has now been completed and a burial order will be made on Monday, which means the body will be released to next of kin to organise burial. Before Droudis married self-styled Sheikh Monis she was known by a different first name - Anastasia, a nod to her Greek heritage. Born to Greek Orthodox migrants who live in Belmore, south-west Sydney, Droudis worked as a hairdresser in Sydney's Kings Cross during her late teenage years. As a young adult, she would often visit bars, drink and party with friends, a source previously close to her told Daily Mail Australia. But after she met the Iranian fanatic in the mid-2000s,  Droudis dropped her birth name in favour of Amirah, an Arabic name, and converted to Islam. 'She's been Anastasia for 30 years,' the source said. 'You can't just turn around and say, 'I'm whatever now''. The source said she became 'influenced' by Monis after the two struck up a relationship following the collapse of her former relationship with her previous partner of eight years. Amirah's brother, John Aspros, told Daily Mail Australia this week that Monis often spent time at the home of Amirah's parents, which was raided by NSW Police officers following the bloody end to the Lindt cafe siege on Tuesday. Droudis declined to comment outside her home this week and later reported to Campsie Police Station where she is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. Sydney lawyer Manny Conditsis, who represented Monis and Droudis in court, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that Droudis was a pleasant client to work with. 'She's always extremely courteous, pleasant,' he said. 'But… it's also fair to observe that she would defer to Monis.' Wearing a tan trench-coat and white beanie, Droudis, did not answer questions from media about her husband's activities .

Bailed: Droudis was pictured at Campsie Police Station last Tuesday, hours after her family's home in Belmore was raided by authorities following her husband's siege. Reporting to police is part of the condition of her bail on charges of murdering Noleen Hayson Pal, Monis' ex-wife .

Droudis declined to comment outside her home last week. She was pictured attending Campsie Police Station last week, where is required to appear each day as part of her bail conditions. In another video post on Monis' website, 'Amirah' describes acts including the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the Bali bombings as 'acts of God.' 'Yes, we are happy about the punishment of September 11. Yes, we are happy about the punishment in Bali. Yes, we are happy about the punishment of the Holocaust and any other punishment that God sends to us.' The video provoked a media storm at the time they were first posted, but no charges were laid. At around the same time both Monis and Droudis were charged with sending offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed by insurgents in Afghanistan. Relatives said the letters accused the troops of killing innocent children, among other things. Monis and Droudis were eventually convicted and sentenced to community service. In addition to the murder accessory charge, Monis was facing more than 40 sexual assault charges involving seven women that allegedly took place while he posed as a 'spiritual adviser'. Droudis was not involved in that case. Mother: Amirah Droudis is pictured here around a decade ago .

"Britain’s nuclear power stations are under threat from attacks by drones, it has been claimed. A London-based nuclear expert investigated the issue after a spate of mysterious and illegal flights by small unmanned vehicles over more than a dozen power stations in France. And John Large warned that the problems arising there were of equal importance across the English Channel, where the UK has 16 operational reactors generating 18 per cent of our electricity. Scroll down for video . Up above: Britain’s nuclear power stations are under threat from attacks by drones (file picture), it is claimed . Mr Large told the French parliament that existing plants were not prepared to counter the threat of ‘near-cyborg technology’, such as placing explosives and dropping equipment to help a saboteur. He examined four attack situations, saying the plants ‘fared very badly indeed - if these scenarios had been for real, then there would have been the potential for a major radioactive release’. British officials have studied Mr Large’s evidence and handed it to the Office for Nuclear Regulation, but have not asked for a copy of the report - however, the expert has urged them to reconsider this. According to an article by Independent on Sunday journalist Mark Leftly, Mr Large will meet with the Ministry of Defence and France's nuclear and safety regulators next month regarding his report. Energy Secretary Ed Davey told the newspaper that he ‘would like to see’ the report, although stressed it was ‘unlikely’ that it would tell ministers anything they had not already examined. Incident scene: Three people were arrested last month near the Belleville-sur-Loire reactor (pictured) in Cher, south of Paris, after using remote-controlled vehicles in a restricted area within 650ft of the plant . It was revealed early last month that authorities in France had tallied at least 15 overflights of nuclear sites since October, culminating on one day with five at separate sites. Drone attack threat: London-based nuclear expert John Large (pictured) has investigated the issue . Authorities insist that nuclear facilities in France - a country that largely lives off atomic energy - are built to handle seismic and security risks. State-controlled power firm EDF, which has had 13 sites flown over by drones, said the overflights had not affected plant operations. Three people were arrested last month near the Belleville-sur-Loire reactor in Cher, south of Paris, after using remote-controlled vehicles in a restricted area within 650ft of the plant. But they were released when it emerged they were model aircraft fans in the wrong location. Drones have vaulted into public awareness in recent years, ranging from ones as large as planes used by the CIA to bomb terrorist suspects, to small ones bought for fun. Greenpeace has in recent years led peaceful incursions into French nuclear facilities to expose security vulnerabilities, but it denies any connection to the drone flights. French law prohibits individuals from operating drones in crowded areas, near airports, and near sensitive sites like military bases or nuclear plants. Concerns about nuclear plant security were revived most recently after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. France gets more than two-thirds of its electricity from nuclear power - the highest proportion in the world - and stepped up nuclear security measures after the Japan debacle. There are fears that this year’s must-have Christmas gift could cause a disaster in Britain's skies. Warnings have been issued over the dangers posed to passenger planes by recreational drones flown by amateurs, with models as cheap as £35 being snapped up before December 25. Sales have risen rapidly - around 2,000 a month are being bought - and electronics retailer Maplin said they are one of its biggest sellers. The most sophisticated designs cost up to £3,000. They can include cameras and are usually used for recreational purposes – although increasingly they are being considered for commercial uses, such as carrying deliveries and monitoring crops. Earlier this month the Mail reported how a remote-controlled drone flying near London Heathrow Almost crashed into a passenger jet - and was spotted by the airliner’s pilot rather than radars. It was the first near miss between a passenger jet and an unmanned aircraft at Britain’s biggest airport, but also the latest in a series of incidents involving unmanned planes. In May, the pilot of a 74-seat plane reported that a quadcopter drone flew within 80ft as he was approaching London Southend Airport. And in December 2012 the crew of a Boeing 777 coming in to land at London Gatwick Airport said they saw ‘two white or silver discs’. In April this year, the owner of a remote-controlled plane was ordered to pay £4,340 in fines and costs after his machine crashed in a no-fly zone near a shipyard in Cumbria for defence company BAE Systems, where nuclear submarines were being built. Attendees and consumers look at drones during the first-ever Drone Expo in Los Angeles on December 13 . The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) has demanded better protection for the public against the risk of drones. There are currently few rules on operating drones. But Balpa wants them to meet the same safety standards as piloted aircraft, including only being flown by operators with pilot-equivalent training. In October, intelligence experts warned of the misuse of drones and called for ‘urgent’ measures to safeguard British airspace to cope with commercial use, which is expected to be more widespread by 2035. Their research for a University of Birmingham report said that the ‘hazards presented by inadvertent or accidental misuse of [drones], or the consequences of their malfunctioning, are becoming better understood’. And a conference on unmanned craft in London last month heard that police were worried about injuries on Boxing Day when amateur ‘pilots’ try out their new drones.","UK nuclear expert John Large probes issue after spate of flights in France .

"Simple lifestyle changes could see 80,000 people saved from dementia every year, a major research project has found. The study suggests that people make changes earlier in life to cut the risk of developing the brain disease as they grow old. It says three million cases of dementia could be avoided in Britain by 2040 if people started regularly exercising their bodies and minds. A major research study has found that exercising the mind - by completing puzzles or playing chess - as well as the body can cut the risk of developing dementia . The results of the study - which looked at the benefits in 1,200 men and women in their 60s and 70s - are due to be formally presented at the World Innovation Summit for Health in Doha in February. Its chairman, surgeon and former Labour health minister Lord Darzi said people should act quickly to change their diet and exercise and stimulate their brains through puzzles. He said this could help to prevent a ‘tide of suffering’ which could overwhelm the country, which already has an estimated 800,000 dementia sufferers – half of which are undiagnosed. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said individuals should adopt a ‘use it or lose it’ attitude to their brains. Former Labour health minister Lord Darzi said people should act quickly to change their diet and exercise and stimulate their brains through puzzles . He wrote: 'The degenerative brain condition that strips sufferers of their dignity and humanity is among the most feared of all those that afflict our species. 'It is one of the greatest health challenges we face.' The surgeon warned the public should not wait for a cure to be found, adding: ‘At an individual level we need to look after our brains – sharpen those chess skills, pick up that crossword and solve that puzzle.’ And he said there was evidence mental decline may start in the late 40s. He said: ‘Eating a healthy diet, avoiding obesity and getting plenty of exercise are all important to brain health because what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads.’ The study saw half of the 1,200 men and women make changes to their diet and embark on brain training. Their hearts were also managed and they increased social activity. The report suggests many cases might be avoided if action was taken to reduce blood pressure - it said untreated blood pressure in mid-life could give a person a 60 per cent higher chance of developing dementia. Type 2 diabetes linked to weight gain was also said to be a key cause. It also suggests 13,000 cases a year are linked with depression, 4,000 to obesity and inactivity, and 2,000 to smoking. But the report warns: 'There is no known intervention that can definitively prevent dementing diseases.' Yet Lord Darzi said the results marked a 'significant breakthrough' in showing that individuals could curb the effects of dementia. The study - which looked at the benefits in 1,200 men and women in their 60s and 70s - also found that getting plenty of exercise is important for brain health . 1 Regular exercise . Doing exercise three to five times a week for between 30 minutes and an hour is recommended. In the UK, adults are urged to do 150 minutes of activity a week to promote health but barely a third manage it. 2 Give up smoking . Never smoking is recommended, but smokers who give up by the age of 40 can gain ten years of extra life, claim scientists. 3 Reach a healthy body weight . A healthy weight is a ‘healthy’ body mass index (BMI) score. BMI is assessed by comparing height to weight, in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared. A healthy score is between 18.5 and 24.99 - above is overweight and obese. 4 Eat a Mediterranean diet . The Mediterranean diet is high in fish, nuts, whole grains and ‘healthy’ fats such as those in olive oil, while low in red meat and dairy products. Studies suggest three to five or more portions of fruit and vegetables with fat making up less than 30 per cent of calories. 5 Keep alcohol consumption low . Low or moderate alcohol consumption is classified as three or fewer units per day for men, two or fewer for women, with abstinence not treated as a healthy behaviour. A small 125ml glass of wine contains 1.3 units, while a pint of beer contains at least two units.","Study suggests making changes  can cut risk of developing brain disease .

"As the memorial to the victims of the Sydney siege continues to grow, a Muslim bride has made a pilgrimage on her wedding day to lay flowers at Martin Place. Adorned in a white wedding dress, which included a traditional white hijab and veil, newlywed Manal Kassem arrived at the memorial with her husband, Mahmod Homaisi, to place her wedding bouquet among the tens of thousands of other floral tributes in the square. The 23-year-old bride had planned for her wedding photos to be taken in the city, but had been hesitant to continue after the tragic events of Tuesday morning which claimed the lives of three people.

Newlywed Manal Kassem arrived at the memorial with her husband, Mahmod Homaisi, to place her wedding bouquet with the tens of thousands of other floral tributes in the square . 'She was going to cancel [the photoshoot] because she didn't want to be judged...celebrating her wedding in a scarf while people were terrorised,' said the couple's wedding planner Dina Kheir. 'But she made is a priority to visit the memorial site as the first pit stop,' Ms Kheir said. A witness said that as the couple approached, clad in their wedding gear, the crowd that had gathered to lay their own floral tributes stared in surprise. When Ms Kassem, from Punchbowl, placed her bouquet of white roses held together with ribbon at the memorial, the crowd erupted in applause. 'She did it out of respect for her country, that will one day be the country of her children and grandchildren,' said Ms Kheir.

'Deeply moving to pay tribute to Katrina and Tori in Martin Place in Sydney today,' she tweeted on Sunday. Ms Gillard recently joined the board of mental health organisation beyondblue, the same charity that Mr Johnson's family has asked funds raised in his name to be directed. The family of Ms Dawson also confirmed on Saturday that  the Katrina Dawson Foundation had been registered, to honour her achievements. Ms Dawson was described as one of the 'best and brightest barristers' at the NSW Bar before her untimely death.

Ms Dawson's brother, Sandy Dawson, said that her tragic passing during the Martin Place siege on Tuesday would not prevent her legacy from living on. NSW Premier Mike Baird said that the Australian government had been in contact with London and Boston, cities which have both housed large-scale floral memorial sites, for advice on how to transport and reconstitute the flowers being laid at the Martin Place memorial site. The Premier confirmed that the flowers would be preserved and 'clean composted' for a future site to preserve the memory of public compassion and support. 'The NSW Government is in contact with authorities in London and Boston regarding flowers, tributes notes and condolence books to ensure we are operating on prior international best practice.' Condolence books will be moved from the city centre to the Opera House and state parliament on Monday.

"They eat three full meals a day, drink from a cup, they've grown teeth and can walk and talk, but these three-year-old triplets are still breastfed by their mother once or twice a day. Davina Wright, 45, has been breastfeeding her triplets - Willow, Connor and Summer - since they were born and will continue as long as she is physically capable. Ms Wright, who lives in Hong Kong with her husband Jason, was doing 30-40 feeds a day when their two daughters and son were first born but has since scaled back to just morning and night. Scroll down for video . Davina Wright, 45, has been breastfeeding her triplets - Connor, Willow and Summer - since they were born and will continue as long as she is physically capable . 'They each have their own room and I go in to each of them individually and it is a lovely bit of one-on-one time,' Ms Wright told Daily Mail Australia. 'At three years old they are basically just fed to sleep, not that they actually fall asleep, it's more like 'fed to calm/sleepy'. 'In reality it is only about 10-15 minutes of their day, their hectic, chaotic, loud, busy, competitive, triplet day, where they get to sit quietly by themselves with mummy.' Ms Wright also breastfeeds first thing in the morning and she says the three toddlers are highly competitive as they fuss over who has to wait to be nursed. 'My kids walk and talk and eat solid food and drink from a cup and are independent and have a full set of teeth... all the things that people point out as reasons for weaning, but in actuality a child can do all these things and still be breastfed,' she said. Ms Wright says her triplets eat solid food and have a full set of teeth but she still breastfeeds morning and night to spend one-on-one time with each of her children . The three toddlers can be highly competitive as they fuss over who waits to be nursed, according to Ms Wright . 'I think the weaning down of feeds during the day was partly because we got so busy… there was play and stimulation and they just asked for it less. 'I really only say no to them now... when we are out in public. I say that we will wait until we are home for that now, simply because I am aware of how many eyes are on us.' The Wrights, who lived in New Zealand when the triplets were born, tried several plans before finally working out how to breastfeed three hungry mouths and still manage to sleep. 'We finally settled on (Jason) sleeping in the nursery with the two girls and bottle feeding them my breast milk at night,' she said. 'I would sleep in our bedroom with the third one and breastfeed him. Then after every feed I would pump the breast milk, which became the next nights feeding for the girls. Davina and her husband Jason gave birth to triplets after two rounds of IVF when they lived in New Zealand . 'As they got older they got much quicker at feeding and instead of 30-40 minutes, they would be done in 15-20, and then as they got older it still only takes 10 minutes.' Ms Wright, who has two adult daughters from her first marriage, breastfed them until they self-weaned at 13 months. 'I set myself the goal of two years with the triplets, not fully sure that we would get that far, and definitely not thinking we would still be going at three years old,' she said. 'But they are still happy with it and I am still happy with it and it works for our family so we keep going. Ms Wright used to feed 30-40 times a day when the triplets were newborns. But she has since cut scaled back to just twice a day . Ms Wright says a breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues . 'It has been everything to their lives, it has slowly changed to being a very small part of their lives, and one day it will be a distant memory in their lives. 'A breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues. The beauty being that every mother gets to decide for herself.' 'I know that extended, or natural-term breastfeeding isn't for everyone, and that is okay. I would say to people if it's not for you then don't do it, simple as that.'","Davina Wright still breastfeeds her triplets Willow, Connor and Summer .

"An orangutan which has spent its entire 29-year life in zoos could be freed within days after judges said it has the same rights as a person. Experts say the landmark ruling over Sandra, who was born in Germany and has lived in Buenos Aires Zoo for 20 years, could open the floodgates to thousands of similar cases across Argentina. Animal rights campaigners won Sandra's freedom by filing a habeas corpus petition - a document more often used to challenge the legality of holding prisoners - in the capital's courts last year. Scroll down for video . Just like you: Sandra the orangutan could move to a sanctuary after winning a person's rights in Argentina . They argued Sandra should not be treated as an 'object' under the law but instead as a 'non-human person', because of her intelligence and complex way of thinking. A judge rejected the petition, but the campaigners appealed and won in Argentina's Criminal Appeals Court at the end of last week, according to national newspaper La Nación. Paul Buompadre, who arranged the case as part of Argentina's Association of Professional Lawyers for Animal Rights (Afada), told the newspaper: 'This opens the way not only for other Great Apes, but also for other sentient beings which are unfairly and arbitrarily deprived of their liberty in zoos, circuses, water parks and scientific laboratories.' The zoo has two weeks to seek an appeal in Argentina's Supreme Court before the ape is moved to a sanctuary, reportedly in Brazil. A spokesman for the Jardín Zoológico de Buenos Aires declined to comment to the Reuters news agency. Its head of biology Adrian Sestelo, however, accused the campaigners of unfairly comparing the animal to a human. Home: The ape has lived for the last 20 years in an enclosure at Jardín Zoológico de Buenos Aires (above) He told La Nación: 'When you don't know the biology of a species, to . unjustifiably claim it suffers abuse, is stressed or depressed, . is to make one of man's most common mistakes, which is to . humanise animal behaviour.' With a name meaning 'forest man', orangutans are often cited alongside chimpanzees and bonobos as humankind's closest genetic relatives, sharing around 97 per cent of our DNA. Native to Malaysia and Sumatra, the red-haired animals are severely endangered with numbers dropping from 230,000 a century ago to fewer than 50,000 today. Of those, 41,000 are Bornean orangutans and just 7,500 are Sumatran orangutans, which the World Wildlife Fund says are critically endangered. The ruling has come just days after U.S. campaigners failed in an almost identical bid to gain human-like rights for a chimpanzee. Parallel case: U.S. activists have failed in a bid to gain the same rights for a chimp named Tommy, pictured . The Nonhuman Rights Project vowed to push its case further after a New York state appeals court ruled Tommy, a privately-owned chimp, could not be described as a 'legal person'. The campaign group's president Steven Wise said: 'We intend to bring the Argentine case to the attention of the New York appellate courts immediately as we believe it will assist the courts in reaching a similar conclusion for our chimpanzee plaintiffs.' Executive director Natalie Prosin previously told MailOnline: 'Under U.S. law animals count as things, not people. There are animal protection laws but that's not the same as giving rights to animals. At the moment they're just the same as a table or a chair. 'The last time we saw him he was in a cage in a shed on a trailer park. He basically lives in solitary confinement.'","Ape was born in captivity and has lived for 20 years in Buenos Aires Zoo .

"No rent collection while in jail, double the dough for landing on Go and clean out Free Parking if your luck takes you there are among five made-up Monopoly rules Facebook fans voted in for future editions of the board game. Several thousand people weighed in on 'house rules' over ten days of recent debate and a year after Hasbro Inc. added a cat token and retired the iron in a similar online stunt aimed at keeping the 79-year-old game fresh. 'Our goal is to stay current and deliver Monopoly in a way that they want to engage with it and that means sometimes being new and having modern takes on the brand,' said Jonathan Berkowitz, vice president of marketing, ahead of Friday's house rules announcement. Popular demand: A new House Rules edition of Monopoly has new rules voted in by the game's Facebook fans . New means old all over again in this case since house rules are often passed on through generations. Some casual players may have thought a few of the ten in the running before debate ended Thursday were already in the official rule book. And some, even regular players, might not have heard of others. Did you know some people play that moms get out of jail for free? Always. No questions asked. That one didn't make the cut. Nor did buying houses for a property without an actual monopoly (a complete color set of properties), or starting the game by placing half of all the money on the game board for a cash-grabbing free-for-all on the count of three.

The winning house rule for landing on Go means players get 400 Monopoly dollars instead of the official 200. As for Free Parking, official rules call for absolutely nothing to happen when a player lands there. Under the house rule, any taxes and fees collected are thrown into the middle for a lucky someone who lands on that corner square. Rounding out the five winners are players must travel around the board one full time before they can begin buying properties, and collecting 500 bucks for rolling double ones. To appease hardcore players not interested in new rules, the Pawtucket, R.I., company will put the winners into a special House Rules Edition to be released in the fall and add them to classic Monopoly's game guide next year as unofficial. 'There are a lot of Monopoly purists who want to play by the classic rules and don't want to change it, but we love the idea of there being some optional rules in there that can mix up the game a little bit,' Berkowitz said.",Hasbro will put the winning five suggestions into a special House Rules Edition to be released in the fall .
"A neonatal nurse who lay dead in her home for seven years was being investigated for 'inappropriate conduct towards a child' at work shortly before her death, an inquest heard. The mummified body of Anne Leitrim, 58, was discovered at her Bournemouth flat in June by bailiffs who had been called because of her unpaid mortgage. She was under final warning at Homerton University Hospital in east London after a disciplinary hearing on 6 June 2007, Bournemouth Coroner's Court heard. The mummified body of Anne Leitrim, 58, was discovered at her Bournemouth flat in June by bailiffs who had been called because her mortgage had not been paid . Her badly decomposed body was found near her bed along with a note which read, incorrectly: 'My doctors has done anything wrong. I love my babies. Goodbye Janet.' A post mortem report said that the body was in 'a state of advanced mummification' and a cause of death could not be ascertained because toxicology tests were impossible. Coroner Sheriff Payne said the 'vague' note 'could be treated as a suicide note', but there was no physical evidence at the scene to indicate she had taken her life. It also emerged that she had been taking medication for anxiety and stress for about 10 years. She was under final warning at Homerton University Hospital in east London after a disciplinary hearing in June 2007 . Her GP said he last saw her in June 2007 when she was suffering from a high level of anxiety. A waist-high pile of post for Ms Leitrim had built up in the hallway of the flats, where neighbours said they thought she had moved away. Her sister Katherine Clarke said that Ms Leitrim had had lost contact with the family around 20 years ago, but they were not sure why. Campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged people to check on their neighbours this Christmas, saying it is the perfect time to go round with a card . She trained as a nurse, working in Glasgow, Barnet and St Thomas' Hospital in London. Ms Leitrim bought the flat in Bournemouth in the 1970s and continued to work in London, living there while she was on duty. Fiona Kennedy, from Homerton University Hospital in London, said that allegations had been made of inappropriate conduct towards a child in Ms Leitrim's care. She had been given a final written warning, but a back-to-work plan was put in place. Ms Leitrim did not attend further appointments and did not respond to letters and phone calls from the hospital. With no next of kin on file, she was put on unauthorised absence in August 2007 and her employment terminated that November. Coroner Payne said: 'She had no social life down here (in Bournemouth); people didn't know who she was to any great extent.' With no cause of death and no evidence, the coroner said he had no alternative but to record an open verdict. Campaigner Esther Rantzen has urged people to check on their neighbours this Christmas, saying it is the perfect time to go round with a card and a mince pie.

"Critics have accused Prince Charles of being 'elitist' after he drew up a guide for city planners which attempts to banish unsightly concrete, phone wires, tower blocks and cars. The prince wrote his ten-point plan as part of a 'big rethink' on how to design cities for a world population expected to hit almost 10billion by 2050. Despite denying he wanted to return Britain to a 'Golden Age', his list prompted mixed responses among architecture experts. Rethink: Prince Charles at his new-build town of Poundbury in Dorset. He has written a ten-point guide for city architects which shuns wires, cars, concrete and tower blocks in favour of traditional principles . Professor Alister Scott of Birmingham City University attacked his often-quoted dismissal of high-rise towers in favour of Victorian-style mansion blocks, which exist in London's most expensive areas. 'The combined impact of these principles, when backed up with the examples he uses, is socially regressive and elitist,' Prof Scott told The Independent. 'When he considers the ""charm and beauty of a place like Kensington and Chelsea"" he sort of forgets that the average price of property is £2,085,950.' He added that in Poundbury, the prince's experimental town in Dorset, the 'average detached house costs £458,946' - more than £60,000 above the national average. Other critics told the newspaper the manifesto sounded 'cranky' and like it was written by a 'fussy grandmaster of a masonic lodge'. Transport planning consultant Phil Jones complained on Twitter about the prince's lack of formal sources for his claim, saying he had only consulted the government's Manual for Streets. Out: The prince said tower blocks were 'isolating and alienating'. Pictured is the brutalist Shakespeare Tower in London's Barbican Centre, which remained the tallest residential block in Britain for several years . But there were some supporters, including Swedish architect Fredrik Hellberg, who wrote: 'Hats off for anyone who speaks up, no matter what they are saying.' Randy Nishimura, a member of the American Institute of Architects, added: 'Some think of the Prince of Wales as a dilettante. I believe he sees the big picture while his critics do not.' Prince Charles has been outspoken on architecture issues for many years. He founded a School of Traditional Arts and supported the new-build village of Poundbury in Dorset, which was created on his land in a bid to challenge post-war ideas about planning. His critics have accused him of trying to influence the government after he wrote personal memos to ministers, which the government has blocked from release in a nine-year legal fight. In his piece, the prince insisted his ten-point plan 'does not deny the benefits and convenience that our modern technology brings. 'Far from it, the aim is to mix the best of the old with the best of the new. Symmetry: The prince called on designers to follow traditional principles and ideas about beauty . 'All I am suggesting is that the new alone is not enough. We have to be mindful of the long-term consequences of what we construct.' Writing in the magazine Architectural Review, the Prince added: 'I have lost count of the times I have been accused of wanting to turn the clock back to some Golden Age. 'Nothing could be further from my mind. My concern is the future. 'We face the terrifying prospect by 2050 of another three billion people on this planet needing to be housed, and architects and urban designers have an enormous role to play in responding to this challenge.' He compared well-planned cities with a rose because humans do not have to think about why a rose is beautiful - they simply know it is. Referencing 'spiritual mathematics' and 'sacred geometry', he said the best designs, including the Taj Mahal mausoleum in India, could be drawn from points around a basic circle. 1 Developments must 'respect the land' and not be too intrusive . 2 Buildings must abide by the 'language', 'grammar' and 'ground rules' of architecture . 3 New blocks should not be oversized compared to the buildings surrounding them . 4 There must be 'coherence' between nearby buildings by using similar balconies or railings . 5 People need 'well-designed enclosures' which encourage walking and make them feel safe . 6 Traditional or regional materials should beat 'bland' concrete, aluminium, glass and steel . 7 Signs, lights and utilities should be avoided and as many wires as possible should be buried . 8 Streets 'must be reclaimed from the car' and pedestrians must be put first in all designs . 9 Shun 'isolating' high-rise towers and instead build mansion blocks like those in Chelsea . 10 Be flexible to the situation, building and area - avoid following 'rigid, conventional' rules .","Prince of Wales wrote manifesto as part of 'big rethink' on city planning .

"A Christian blogger is at the centre of a free speech row after posting an 'offensive' advert on behalf of a petition against plans to legalise gay marriage. Advertising watchdogs have demanded an explanation from the writer, known by the pen name Archbishop Cranmer, after they received 24 complaints. The Advertising Standards Authority is asking that he respond to claims that the message - which asks viewers to 'Help us keep the true meaning of marriage' - is homophobic. Offensive? A frame from the advert displayed on the Archbishop Cranmer blog, which attracted 24 complaints . Archbishop Thomas Cranmer (pictured) was the man wrote and compiled the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer. He was also a reformist who helped build a favourable case for Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, which resulted in the English Church breaking away from the Vatican. Cranmer was tried for treason and heresy after Mary I, a Roman Catholic, came to the throne. Imprisoned for more than two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew these and died a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr to Protestants. Archbishop Cranmer featured in Hilary Mantel's Man Booker Prize-winning novel Wolf Hall, a fictionalised account of the rise to power of Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. The Coalition for Marriage advert flickers between pictures of heterosexual couples on their wedding day, the phrase 'I do' and a message citing a market research poll that showed '70% of people say keep marriage as it is'. The campaigners behind the petition describe themselves as 'an umbrella group of individuals and organisations in the UK that support traditional marriage and oppose any plans to redefine it'. The ASA has stressed that the adverts, rather than the blogger, are the subject of their probe - and insist he is not compelled to justify the campaign message. However, Archbishop Cranmer - who takes his pseudonym from a sixteenth-century reformer - remained adamant that the ASA is trying to restrict his and the Coalition for Marriage's right to free speech. In a post attacking the anonymous complainants he wrote: 'They called in the Gestapo to censor the assertion that marriage is a life-long union between one man and one woman, in accordance with the teaching of the Established Church, the beliefs of its Supreme Governor, and the law of the land.' Fellow ecclesiastical bloggers leapt to his defence and even the National Secular Society, which is in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, has stood by him. A statement from the society read: 'The NSS wants to announce its support for the Archbishop Cranmer blog. Although it disagrees with this blogger profoundly on so many issues, it agrees with him entirely that the Advertising Standards Authority is overstepping the mark and posing a rather sinister threat to freedom of expression.' Though the NSS went on to distance itself from Archbishop Cranmer and the Coalition for Marriage campaign, it argued the complaints made to the ASA were 'not reason enough to silence them'. The ASA today stressed it would not necessarily uphold the complaints, which would lead to the ad being banned. Probe: The Advertising Standards Authority is now investigating claims that the advert promotes homophobia . It said in a statement: 'The right of advertisers responsibly to express their views will undoubtedly be an important factor in our assessment of whether the ads are likely to cause serious or widespread offence.  We are also looking at whether the ads are misleading.' The authority also responded to Archbishop Cranmer's outrage over the 'threatening' way in which it approached him, explaining that: 'We have long found it useful to ask, in confidence, publishers of ads subject to ""offence"" complaints for their views, because they can give us a valuable insight into whether or not their readers are likely to be offended'. Of the 24 complaints said to have been lodged, ten took issue with the advert's allegedly offensive content. The rest demanded evidence to back up the claim that seven in ten people do not want any change to marriage laws - but as this figure came from major polling agency ComRes, the ASA did not expect those who posted the advert to provide this.","The campaigners behind the petition describe themselves as a group of people 'that support traditional marriage and oppose any plans to redefine it'

"A Michigan woman whose boyfriend started a massive fire on her deck while attempting to cook a squirrel using a blowtorch is being sued for more than $2 million by her building's insurance companies. Traveler's Indemnity Company, which insured the Clearview apartment building at 120th Ave and Riley St in Holland County, claims Barbara Pellow signed a lease in which she agreed to be responsible for any damages caused to the building by herself or her boyfriend, Khek Chanthalavong. The company paid out more than $2 million to repair damages caused to apartments in the building as a result of the fire, which left 32 apartments uninhabitable. Scroll down for video . Destroyed: The blaze quickly spread to the rest of the apartment building and made 32 people homeless . Easy way out: The man was preparing to eat the squirrel and perhaps thought he could burn the hair off instead of skinning it . Another insurance company, Auto Owners Insurance Company, insured three apartments in the building and paid $56,529.52 in damages, reports M Live. The company has also filed a suit against both Pellow and Chanthalavong, claiming they had 'a duty to act with reasonable care on the apartment premises.' In October 2012, Chanthalavong used a propane torch to singe the fur off a squirrel he captured while on the third-floor deck of Pellow's apartment. Blow torches can reach temperatures in excess of 2,500 degrees - hot enough to melt copper. Chanthalavong was preparing to eat the squirrel and perhaps thought he could burn its fur off instead of skinning it - a notoriously tough task requiring special technique. According to investigators, Chanthalong placed the torch in the the corner of the deck and went inside to cook the squirrel. Fire hazard: The man was standing on his third-floor wooden deck when he attempted to singe the fur off a squirrel . MLive reports that Pellow awoke around 12:30pm  to Chanthalavong yelling and attempting to douse flames with water, but the blaze spread quickly. Eight apartments were destroyed and a further 24 were badly damaged, leaving residents homeless. The blaze was so fierce that firefighters had to call in backup from the nearby town of Zeeland. The . fire started about 12.30pm and several residents reported having to run . for their lives as flames and thick, black smoke spread to their . apartments. 'You think you know what you'll grab, but you really don't,' resident Jack Pruim said. Pruim said he only had time to rescue his dogs before fleeing. 'Pellow is contractually obligated to Travelers for the full amount of any and all damages from the fire and water damage including the actual costs of repairing or replacing the damaged property as well as any loss of rental income suffered by Clearview related to the fire and water damage,' a complaint filed in Ottawa County by the Traveler's Indemnity Company reads. Both cases are currently in the beginning stages; Pellow is expected to appear in court to answer the Traveler's Indemnity Company case this fall.","Khek Chanthalavong ignited a huge blaze trying to singe the fur off a squirrel with a propane torch on the deck of Barbara Pellow's apartment .

"A typical Christmas shopping list usually consists of toys, electronics, gift cards, etc. But now, some women are adding positive pregnancy tests to their list -- and checking it twice. Women across the country are selling and buying positive pregnancy tests on Craigslist. One post from Claremore, Oklahoma offered a positive pregnancy test for $20. The advertisement stated: 'I have positive pregnancy test for those of you who need a little help holding onto your man through the holidays, shoot me a message for $20 each.' Scroll down for video . Lock: This ad from Lake Charles, Louisiana advertises the positive test as a way to 'lock that new man down' Responsibility: In a New Jersey add, one seller refuses to take any responsibility for the test after it's sold . Keep: A number of the pregnancy test advertisements offer the test as a way to 'keep' a significant other . Posts from Kansas, California, New York, Texas, and others have advertised the tests as a great prank or a way to 'keep your man,' while some ads clearly state that the buyer doesn't care what is done with the false test. Many of the tests range in price, some are being sold for $15 and others for $50. A Kansas police officer,  Gary Mason, explained to KCTV how the false test could be used negatively. Price: The average cost  of the tests are $20 with prices going up from there . False: Gary Mason, a Kansas police officer, said that if someone used the false test for misrepresentation, that could be a 'level of blackmail' 'For example, if a married man is having an affair and he tried to break it off with the girl, and she became upset and decided to present this fake pregnancy test and demand money, otherwise she would tell the spouse,' Mason said. 'That would be a level of blackmail.' Those who buy the test could face charges including libel, emotional stress, or misrepresentation, according to FOX23. If the case escalated, those fooled by the fake test could even press fraud charges. More and more the saying is becoming true, one really can buy anything on the internet.","The latest 'must-have' on Craigslist looks to be positive pregnancy tests .

"These amazing shots capture the moment a Western bat glides silently in pursuit of prey with delicate wings outstretched and its small mouth gaping open. The detailed shots were captured by wildlife photographer Michael Durham, in Deschutes National Forest near Pine Creek in Oregon, US. It shows the exact moment two bats - a speedy pipistrelle and a small brown bat - locate a flighty moth over an expanse of desert scrub and woodland. Prey: This small bat echo has located a flighty moth as it gets ready to strike in pursuit of its prey . Each image was taken in the late hours between 11pm and 2am by Durham, 49, who patiently waits for the creatures to appear - ready to . snap them with lasers which trigger a high-speed shutter. He spots when a long-eared myotis bat skims the surface of a man-made guzzler, eager to scoop a mouthful of water in the muggy heat of the night. Mr Durham, from Portland, Oregon, said: 'This is an enormous technical challenge. Bats prefer to fly in complete darkness and they are incredibly quick.'I'll watch the figures being fed onto a laptop but sometimes the bats surprise me by flying back and forth through the laser trigger like it's a fun trick they can do.' Despite capturing them in pursuit of prey, the photographer has never actually seen the bats catch an insect - although he has heard it with a bat detector. Prey: This Western bat sees its prey as it glides over an expanse of desert scrub and woodland in Deschutes National Forest and near Pine Creek in Oregon, US . Fresh water: A long-eared myotis bat skims the surface of a man-made guzzler, eager to scoop a mouthful of water in the muggy heat of the night . He said: 'The detector allows you to hear the ultrasonic calls of a bat and when they are closing in on prey the calls become extremely rapid and turn into a buzz. 'The bats do occasionally make a flapping noise but they're otherwise silent to human ears. Of course, they are actually echo-locating like crazy in the ultrasonic range.' The nocturnal creatures eat anything from beetles and centipedes to small fish and even frogs. Due to their secretive nature, humans rarely see bats up close - so a brush with the beasts is valued by Mr Durham. He said: 'I've had curious bats land on my head and brush past me with their wings. I try to stay out of their way, but I'm incredibly close. 'I think bats represent all the things in nature that we don't see directly.. They are magnificent little animals but almost nobody gets to see them in action up close. 'And yet they live just outside our doors and under our very noses. 'There are thousands of spectacles of nature that we can't observe because we lack the proper ability to perceive. We miss a lot. Bats are just the tip of the iceberg. 'I think these photos are just a brief look into the life of a very secretive animal.'

"She may be a Oscar-winning actress with best-selling cookbooks and a popular lifestyle blog, but it seems Gywneth Paltrow is still not quite good enough for Yahoo's Marissa Mayer. According to an article in the New York Times, the CEO  'balked' at the idea of hiring the Hollywood actress because she 'disapproved of the fact that Paltrow did not graduate college'. The lengthy piece revealed that former Google executive Mayer, who had been drafted in to remake the once-great Yahoo, 'habitually asked deputies where they attended college'. Marissa Mayer (left) 'balked' at the idea of hiring Gwyneth Paltrow (right) because she 'disapproved of the fact that Paltrow did not graduate college' And according to one executive, the fact that Paltrow did not even graduate college was the major stumbling block to her being hired as a contributing editor for Yahoo Food. The decision has been questioned by critics who label Mayer as 'a higher education snob' and point out that internet greats Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of Reed, Harvard, and Harvard respectively. Mayer, who graduated Stanford in 1997, was just 38 when she was hired by Yahoo in 2012 in a bid to turn around the fortunes of the floundering California-based internet corporation. The initial appointment was met with huge amounts of hope and positivity, and Yahoo's stock was on the rise within Mayer's first six months on the job.

She embarked on a program of buying up start-ups (she outbid Facebook for Tumblr), generating more 'must-read' content, investigating content collaboration possibilities and hiring expensive journalists - including Joe Zee, the former creative director of Elle, and former New York Times gadget columnist David Pogue. It was also Mayer who gave the greenlight a plan to hire Katie Couric, the former anchor of 'CBS Evening News' and former co-host of the 'Today' show. But two years into the job and things aren't looking so rosy for Mayer. Internet greats Steve Jobs (left), Bill Gates (center), and Mark Zuckerberg (right) dropped out of Reed, Harvard, and Harvard respectively . Following a series of embarrassing management setbacks, Mayer has not succeeded in turning any of Yahoo’s many products into an industry leader, and a number of investors are questioning whether the company might be better off merging. Paltrow, on the other hand, initially attended the University of California, Santa Barbara, but dropped out to begin her acting career and went on to Hollywood stardom with roles in films including Seven, Emma, Sliding Doors and The Talented Mr. Ripley. The 42-year-old  now runs popular lifestyle blog Goop and says she plans to launch a line of apparel and beauty products.","Mayer 'balked' at idea of hiring Paltrow as  Yahoo Food contributing editor .

As The Wall Street Journal reports, the researchers used 149 people in Turkey from ages 18 to 40 for their study. Participants were ranked by their texting style and frequency. Tendon thickness was recorded in ultrasound images showing the length through the carpal tunnel to the thumb's tip. For those who texted frequently, the dominant side's tendon was much thicker. Tendon thickness was recorded in ultrasound images showing the length through the carpal tunnel to the thumb's tip . Thickness increased for those who sent the most texts.

"A father and his two young boys have been found alive and well after spending up to ten days in their trapped car. Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, were found in their 'severely bogged' four-wheel drive at Expedition National Park in central Queensland by a local property owner at about 3:30pm on Sunday. 'He [the property owner] was checking his cattle on a piece of land that he owns and he remembered seeing the media and a vehicle similar to that description,' Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy said. 'He thought, while he was down in that part of his property, that he'd shoot across and check an area that people had camped in before, and lo and behold.' Scroll down for video .

Police  arrived at the scene just after 5pm and are expected to winch the car out of its position before taking the trio to their Lota home in Brisbane's east. 'It is a piece of land that is normally visited by cattle from what I can understand of it. It is black soil country, it's very soft,' Detective Elloy said. 'It may well be the case that they [police and the family] can't get out during the course of the night. The family will stay with the property owner overnight.'

Detective Elloy also added: 'They had the common sense to stay with their vehicle which is a huge point in any survival technique. They've stayed with their car and it's a lot easier to find a car than somebody walking.' He noted that the area was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying, 'even the property owner went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god.'

A massive search was launched across a huge area of outback Queensland before the trio were found. 'We have had police, including those from Miles, Wondoan and Taroom, patrol hundreds of kilometres of outback roads, as well as camp grounds and truck stops,' Detective Elloy said. 'This is a vast geographical area that we are talking about and many roads are cut due to localised flooding or swollen creeks.'","Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, have been found alive and well .

"The Earl of Cardigan's mansion has been bought for nearly £12 million after a long and ultimately unsuccessful battle by the Old Etonian aristocrat to prevent the sale of the home on the estate that has been in his family for 900 years. The new owner of Tottenham House is understood to be Conservative Party donor and multi-millionaire property developer Jamie Ritblat. Lord Cardigan, who once said he was 'put on this earth to take care of Savernake and I will never let it go', had fought to keep the 100-room property in his family but was forced to admit defeat earlier this year after an Appeal Court ruling. The 61-year-old Earl had challenged a decision by the trustees of the Savernake estate to sell the dilapidated house and 800 acres near Marlborough, Wiltshire but lost the case. Lord Cardigan, who once said he was 'put on this earth to take care of Savernake and I will never let it go', had fought to keep the 100-room property in his family . Tottenham House, which is 200 years old, has been empty since it was used as a prep school in the 1990s . One of the trustees, John Moore, said last night: 'Tottenham House has now been sold. The sale contract is complete.' Mr Moore declined to name the purchaser but Mr Ritblat was reported earlier this year to be negotiating to buy the estate. Mr Ritblat donated £50,000 to the Tories two days before the last general election via his property empire. One of his companies, Delancey, owns the former athletes' village at the 2012 Olympic Park in London. Tottenham House, which is 200 years old, has been empty since it was used as a prep school and then leased to a charity until 2004. Lord Cardigan and his American wife Joanne live in a lodge on the estate with their younger daughter, Lady Sophie. At one stage he was claiming £71 per week jobseeker's allowance and training to be a lorry driver while the court case rumbled on. He had been in dispute with the trustees since returning from the US in 2011 to discover they had sold off family portraits to pay outstanding bills. At one stage, Lord Cardigan was claiming £71 per week jobseeker's allowance and training to be a lorry driver while the court case rumbled on . He has also been involved in a legal battle with his estranged daughter, the singer Bo Bruce, who reached the final of the BBC1 talent show The Voice in 2012. Ms Bruce, whose real name is Lady Catherine Brudenell-Bruce, is the daughter of the earl and his first wife, Rosamond, Countess of Cardigan, who died of cancer two years ago. The Savernake estate was given to Lord Cardigan's ancestors by William the Conqueror and was once the site of Wolf Hall, the home of Henry VIII's third wife Jane Seymour that provided the title for Hilary Mantel's award–winning novel. Lord Cardigan is a descendant of the 7th Earl, who led the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. Construction work at Tottenham House has already started and the mansion is expected to be converted into luxury flats. Proceeds from the sale will be shared between the earl and his estranged son, Viscount Savernake, 30. Neither Mr Ritblat nor the Earl of Cardigan was available for comment.","Lord Cardigan, 61, had challenged a decision by the trustees of the Savernake estate to sell the dilapidated house and 800 acres .
But he was forced to admit defeat earlier this year after Appeal Court ruling .
New owner of mansion is thought to be Tory Party donor Jamie Ritblat .
An earlier version of this article may have suggested the whole estate was being sold. We would like to make clear that only Tottenham House and its surrounding lands are being sold. The rest of the 4,500-acre Savernake estate in Wiltshire remains under the control of Lord Cardigan’s family trust."
"It’s been more than 30 years since James Bond faced evil Ernst Stavro Blofeld, his most feared adversary. But now the intimidating baddie – famous for his trademark white cat and for gruesomely disposing of his failing underlings – is back. Django Unchained star Christoph Waltz is tipped to play the evil genius in a new 007 movie which is due to begin shooting next month. The 58-year-old double Oscar-winner will join an elite band of stars who have previously played the role. Donald Pleasence starred as Bond’s nemesis in You Only Live Twice in 1967, followed by Kojak star Telly Savalas in 1969’s On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. The smooth-voiced British actor Charles Gray took the part in Diamonds Are Forever in 1971. Scroll down for video . Infamous baddie Ernst Stavro Blofeld will return - pre-production work on ‘Bond 24’ has already started . Blofeld had previously featured in From Russia With Love in 1963, and in 1965’s Thunderball – but the character’s face was not shown and only his lower body was visible as he stroked his white Angora cat. The villain made his last appearance in an ‘official’ Bond film in 1981 when he featured in For Your Eyes Only. In a nail-biting opening scene Blofeld is hanging from an helicopter which is being piloted by Roger Moore’s James Bond. The scene ends with Blofeld being dropped down a huge brick industrial chimney close to the River Thames in London. Christoph Waltz is tipped to play the evil genius in a new 007 movie  due to begin shooting next month . Waltz’s involvement in the new film – which has the working title ‘Bond 24’ – will be confirmed at a press conference to be held in the first week of December. Eon productions, which owns the James Bond film franchise, will announce the star is playing an unknown character called Franz Oberhauser, son of the late Hans Oberhauser, a ski instructor who acted as a father figure to Bond. But senior sources believe the casting is a double bluff worthy of 007 himself and that Waltz is actually playing Blofeld. One Hollywood source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Christoph Waltz is playing Blofeld in the next Bond film. The tone of the 007 films has changed significantly in recent years and the producers have changed the character to fit in with the new-look 007.’ Blofeld’s return is now possible because of the settlement of a long-running legal dispute involving Eon Productions and the estate of the late Kevin McClory – a film producer and former friend of 007 author Ian Fleming – over who owns the right to the character and his evil empire SPECTRE. Blofeld remains one of the most popular villains in cinema history and his influence is obvious in the Austin Powers films which spoof the Bond franchise . Blofeld, who was also known as No 1, quickly established himself as the archetypal Bond villain when he made his big-screen debut in From Russia With Love. His sinister one-liners and increasingly ingenious methods of dispensing of his underlings made him an instant hit. But Bond villains have an almost superhuman capacity to cheat death, and there was no close-up shot of Blofeld’s body when he was dropped down the chimney in For Your Eyes Only. In any case, the character reappeared alive and well in the ‘unofficial’ Bond film Never Say Never Again when Max von Sydow played Blofeld. The name of the villain was inspired by Thomas Blofeld, a schoolmate of Fleming at Eton. His son is Henry Blofeld, the cricket radio commentator. Sources say the new Blofeld will be just as sinister as earlier incarnations but will be more sophisticated and less ‘campy’. Blofeld remains one of the most popular villains in cinema history and his influence is obvious in the Austin Powers films which spoof the Bond franchise. Powers’s secret agent has to do battle with the bald headed Dr Evil and his cat Mr Bigglesworth. Pre-production work on ‘Bond 24’ has already started in Austria, and Waltz’s co-stars will be Naomie Harris as Moneypenny, Ralph Fiennes as spymaster M and Ben Whishaw as Q. Michael G Wilson, who co-produces the Bond films with his half-sister Barbara Broccoli, last night declined to comment on the return of Blofeld. A spokeswoman for EON productions also declined to comment.","More than 30 years since James Bond faced villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld .

"Response: Jeremy Hunt took to Twitter to dismiss claims that there are plans to allow ambulance waiting times to double as ‘scaremongering’ Jeremy Hunt was accused of ‘moving the goalposts’ yesterday as a row erupted over plans to allow ambulance response times to more than double. The Health Secretary described the claims as ‘scaremongering’, but a leaked NHS memo revealed proposals to increase maximum permissible waiting times for some serious calls from eight to 19 minutes. Senior doctors said the plans ‘risked lives’ and Labour accused Mr Hunt of making a ‘panic decision’ in the face of a winter NHS crisis. But last night it emerged that Labour and the Liberal Democrats had been informed of the plans up to three months ago and had not raised any objections. The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, which wrote the document, said in a statement it was ‘surprised’ by the reaction. It said that ‘over the last three months the principles of what we are proposing and the benefits for patients that we envisage have been shared with Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats and we have received no negative feedback on the thrust of those principles’. The statement added: ‘At this stage, these are only proposals and they will not be formally approved until NHS England and the Secretary of State are convinced … that they are clinically safe and that they offer better care for our patients.’ The Association pointed out that half of call-outs are categorised as ‘life-threatening’, but only one in ten actually are. Bosses believe relaxing targets – so the eight-minute response time only applies to these calls – would mean more lives could be saved. The ambulance service in England and Wales is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since April. In some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year . Officials blame an increasing tendency of patients to dial 999 first instead of trying to arrange an appointment with a GP. Facing the strain: The ambulance service in England and Wales is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since April. Above, file image of ambulance workers . The most serious ambulance calls are categorised as either Red 1, such as cardiac arrests, or Red 2, which are slightly less serious but still life-threatening, including strokes, breathing difficulties or blood clots. Currently, ambulances have to respond to both Red 1 and Red 2 call-outs within eight minutes. But the leaked document suggested raising the waiting time for some Red 2 call-outs to 19 minutes. It was drawn up by the Association, dated last Monday, and clearly stated that the proposals had been ‘approved by the Secretary of State’. It added that the target date for implementing the proposals was the first week of January. Row: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham, above, said plans suggest Jeremy Hunt’s solution to the A&E crisis is to ‘move the goalposts’ However, Mr Hunt took to Twitter to dismiss the claims as ‘scaremongering’, saying he ‘categorically refutes’ them. He wrote: ‘No plans to double ambulance waiting times, and there never have been.’ But one ambulance service director, who asked not to be named, told BBC News: ‘This is being done for political expediency rather than patient safety … with the full blessing of Jeremy Hunt. This is being pushed through with limited consultation with the chief executives and the health service as a whole.’ The document states that a small proportion of the most serious Red 2 calls would be upgraded to Red 1. Of the remaining Red 2 cases, just under half would keep the eight-minute target – but would be given an extra three minutes before the clock started, to help staff classify the call. All other Red 2 cases would have a 19-minute target, and the clock would not start until three minutes after the call is received. Yesterday Professor Keith Willett, NHS national director for acute care, said ‘nothing had been agreed’ – and that the plans would not take effect next month. He told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend: ‘If it is not clinically sound then it is not going to progress.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the plans suggest Jeremy Hunt’s solution to the A&E crisis is to ‘give up and move the goalposts’. He added: ‘People will struggle to understand how, in the middle of a crisis, it makes sense for the Government to make a panic decision to relax 999 standards and leave patients waiting even longer.’ Mr Burnham has written to the Health Secretary asking why the measures were not disclosed to Parliament days after he signed them off. Professor Sir Roger Boyle, the Government’s former adviser on heart disease, said the plans were ‘going down a very dangerous path, and will risk lives … it’s an admission of defeat’. Rising numbers of 18 to 34-year-olds are heading straight for A&E as they cannot get convenient appointments with a GP, according to a report. They are twice as likely to attend casualty units and walk-in centres compared with over-55s. Analysis of the official GP patients’ survey by the House of Commons library found there were 37.4million failed attempts to book an appointment with GPs last year, affecting 4.7million patients. The research into young adults was carried out by Citizens Advice and found one in seven people aged 18-34 could not see a GP last time they tried to make an appointment, compared with just one in 17 aged 55 or over. Inconvenient: Only 30 per cent of younger patients found experience of GPs to be ‘very good'. (File image) Only 30 per cent of the younger patients found their experience of GPs to be ‘very good,’ compared with 64 per cent of patients over 75. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said failure to treat younger people outside hospital would add to the financial pressures on the NHS. ‘GP services need to keep up with 21st-century lifestyles,’ she said. ‘With many younger adults out at work, it can be difficult for them to get an appointment with a GP, particularly at a convenient time. As a result, some people are struggling to access the medical advice they need. ‘It is in the NHS’s interest to get primary healthcare for younger adults right and ensure services fit around busy working lives. A failure to meet their needs piles more pressure on budgets.’ The charity found young people often prefer to use walk-in centres but noted that nearly a quarter of these 24-hour services had closed since 2010.","Plans to allow response times to double revealed in a leaked NHS memo .

"Jeremy Clarkson claims he and his colleagues were forced to hide under their beds after an angry mob of locals came after them when filming in Argentina . Jeremy Clarkson has compared the attack by Argentine ‘thugs’ on his Top Gear team to a violent Hollywood action film. The controversial presenter claims he and his colleagues were forced to hide under their beds and flee Argentina after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them. Locals were seething after Clarkson was filmed driving a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL, believing it was a reference to the 1982 Falklands conflict. The incident will form the centrepiece of Top Gear’s Christmas special, in a move that risks escalating the row even further. It will show Clarkson and his fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May driving three V8 sports cars 1,600 miles through Patagonia in southern Argentina. Footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in the southern town of Tolhuin. Clarkson, 54, yesterday compared the attack to a violent scene from John Carpenter's 1976 Hollywood film: Assault on Precinct 13. In the thriller, actor Austin Stoker plays a police officer who defends a Los Angeles police station from heavily-armed gangsters. Describing his experience in Argentina, Clarkson said: ‘I'll warn you, it's gruesome. 'You get the sense that there's a never ending supply of — let's call them “youths"" — coming out of the darkness, hurling anything they can lay their hands on. ‘You wouldn't have wanted to be in any of the cars, that's for sure.’ The Top Gear Christmas special will show Clarkson and his fellow presenters driving three V8 sports cars 1,600 miles through Patagonia in southern Argentina - including this Porsche which sparked tensions . Footage captured on camera phones will show the convoy coming under attack from irate locals in Tolhuin . In a Sunday Times article, Clarkson continued to deny that the controversial number plate was chosen deliberately to stoke up a row and push TV ratings up. ‘I've given up telling people that the H982 FKL number plate was a coincidence because absolutely nobody believes me,’ he said. ‘I have the email chains that show exactly why that particular car was chosen — only two were available at the right time for the right price and the other was black, a colour that doesn't work on television. ‘Everyone on the show knows the car was not chosen for its number plate and no one believes them either.’ The presenter admitted that his innocent explanation of the incident was not believed because the stunt was ‘exactly the sort of thing’ which the show is infamous for. He added: ‘Of course I don't doubt that after the programme is aired many people will say that I should be ashamed of myself for putting all those innocent people in danger and that it really is time for the show to be turned into something more benign — Countryfile with windscreen wipers perhaps. He admitted his innocent explanation of the incident is not believed because the stunt was ‘exactly the sort of thing’ which the show is infamous for - pictured with fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond . The footage of the violence will be shown on December 27 as part of the two-part Top Gear Patagonia special . ‘But here's the inconvenient truth. On this occasion, for once, we did nothing wrong.’ Last month the BBC announced that the Top Gear special will sit at the heart of its festive programming – alongside more traditional staples such as Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing and the last ever episodes of Miranda. The announcement of the Christmas line-up came on the same day that Argentina's ambassador to the UK, Alicia Castro, wrote to the BBC Trust expressing 'discontent' with how the number plate fiasco was handled. Despite the denials, many observers still think the incident was a publicity stunt. Here’s why: . - Top Gear received an email stating the car’s registration before it was bought. The BBC say they did not spot it. - The numberplate H982 FKL stayed on the car for ten days after the show was warned it was offensive. - Some filming for the show took place in Ushuaia, from where doomed Argentinian warship General Belgrano set off on her final voyage. - Argentinian police found another set of ‘joke’ numberplates reading BE11 END in the same Porsche. - The man who sold the car to the BBC was allegedly gagged by the corporation. - Argentina accused Clarkson of exaggerating the ‘attack’ on the Top Gear team to improve ratings. She claimed Clarkson's behaviour 'fell well below BBC's editorial values and standards' and called for a fresh investigation. The presenter said: ‘Since our return Alicia Castro has been stoking the fire. Rightly so. 'That's her job, and she's good at it. She demanded the BBC apologise and scrap the programme, and when that failed she released a series of statements claiming I'd exaggerated the incident and that when we abandoned the cars we tried to set them on fire for ‘dramatic effect’. ‘The message then is clear. We had tried to provoke the Argentinians into some kind of response, and when that didn't work, because they were all at home knitting jumpers and making daisy chains for handicapped children, we had invented some kind of a kerfuffle to boost the show's ratings.’ The footage of the violence will be shown on 27 December as part of the two-part Top Gear Patagonia special on BBC2. In a departure from usual form, the video will be shown without the customary horseplay and risqué humour, for which the show is famed. Andy Wilman, Top Gear’s executive producer, said: ‘We’ve been very careful to present it as it happened rather than put an agenda or spin on it. 'Viewers will make up their own mind.’ The programme has been embroiled in a string of controversies over the years, including accusations of racism after Clarkson apparently mumbled the word ****** during an outtake and referred to an Asian man as a 'slope' during a Burma special. In 2011, Hammond prompted a complaint by the Mexican ambassador after he suggested a Mexican car would be 'lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight'.","Presenter claims he and colleagues were forced to hide under beds .

"The police force which led the investigation into murdered schoolgirl April Jones could become the first in the UK to abandon monitoring CCTV 'because it fails to cut crime', it has emerged. Dyfed Powys Police is set to receive reduced funding for CCTV after an independent investigation found they have had 'little success in deterring violent crime or anti-social behaviour'. But, it could also stop monitoring live camera footage altogether - as early as January next year - if an inquiry by the force decides it is the best course of action. It would leave the police force, which covers an area more than half the size of Wales, without any monitored CCTV cameras. Dyfed Powys Police will receive reduced funding for CCTV after an independent investigation found they have had 'little success in deterring violent crime or anti-social behaviour'. It could also stop monitoring live footage . The force's biggest investigation was the hunt for five-year-old April, who vanished while playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, in October 2012. CCTV images caught killer Mark Bridger's car on the night of her disappearance, ultimately leading to his arrest. Using footage from a variety of private and public cameras, police were able to piece together a complete picture of his movements which formed a central part of the prosecution case. But a report ordered by Christopher Salmon, Police and Crime Commissioner for the force, concluded that live monitoring of CCTV footage should stop. He said the removal of cameras would not result in 'significant rises' in crime. Dyfed-Powys Police records show that for the 12 months leading up until August this year, only 1.5 per cent of case files used publicly-controlled CCTV evidence. In addition, 2.2 per cent used evidence from private CCTV systems. The CCTV network in the UK is one of the largest in the world - with the Shetland Islands Council and Corby Borough Council - among the smallest local authorities in the UK - having more cameras than the San Francisco Police Department. The inquiry into CCTV systems revealed cameras which flood town centres and housing estates do not have a significant impact on crime. Instrom Security Consultants, which carried out the report, discovered that while cameras have a modest impact on crime levels, they are at their most effective in reducing car crime in car parks, especially when used alongside improved lighting and the introduction of security guards. The force's biggest investigation was the hunt for five-year-old April, who vanished while playing outside her home in Machynlleth, Mid Wales, in October 2012. CCTV footage led to the arrest of her killer Mark Bridger . Bridger (left) was caught on CCTV walking his dog (right) and his car was captured on the night of the murder . The CCTV review came at a time when many local councils are reducing funding to police due to financial pressures. Mr Salmon said: 'We must spend every pound where it delivers. In the meantime, I'm giving the public what they ask me for - more bobbies on the beat.' The crime commissioner said he will discuss the inquiry findings with chief constable Simon Prince and county council leaders before agreeing to stop the CCTV monitoring in the New Year. He said: 'I look forward to our discussions to agree a solution for CCTV that delivers value and that most of all is effective. 'This research will be an important reference point as we develop a strategy.' The Dyfed-Powys force covers more than half of Wales, from Pembrokeshire to the English border with Shropshire. But, it is sparsely populated with only 488,000 people in the force area. A Home Office report into CCTV effectiveness, whose authors include Cambridge University criminologist David Farrington, said cameras should continue to be used but have a much narrower focus, such as reducing vehicle crime. Traditionally, CCTV cameras have been funded by councils with police meeting the costs of monitoring them. The report found monitored CCTV cameras do not deter crime or anti-social behaviour and many are unable to produce evidence acceptable in court. However, the inquiry confirmed they can play a crucial role in securing convictions. The report said: 'Properly presented, relevant CCTV evidence provides a very credible witness factor when cases were judged they allowed the context of an incident to be conveyed to the court - particularly relevant in cases of violent behaviour. 'Also, they are instrumental in challenging not guilty pleas, and often led to an early admission of guilt.'","Dyfed Powys Police is set to receive reduced funding for CCTV next year .

"Revelation: Senior Fifa official Harold Mayne-Nicholls claims England had the strongest World Cup bid despite earning just two votes . The senior Fifa official who was tasked with assessing competing bids to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups has claimed that England 'was by far the strongest contender'. Harold Mayne-Nicholls, chairman of the group that evaluated strengths of bids, concluded that England had the best infrastructure and strongest public involvement - both essential to staging a successful tournament. The revelation is of little consolation after England bid's was condemned as ‘improper’ by a Fifa ethics panel last week. Russia, which won the 2018 bid, and Qatar, selected as 2022 hosts, were handed a clean bill of health by the panel despite suspicions they may have bribed their way to success. Mr Mayne-Nicholls toured all 11 countries who competed to stage the two World Cups, including the winners, and said England's offering was unmatched. England won just two votes in a ballot of Fifa's 22 executive committee members (Exco), with Russia winning the right to host the 2018 event. Mr Mayne-Nicholls told The Sunday Times: 'England were on the top. They had the best concept, the best infrastructure and the people were very much involved. 'How could England have only got two votes? It was a big surprise. I was there and I saw the faces of Prince William and [David] Beckham, and they were shocked.' Prince William was left ‘bitterly disappointed’ in 2010 as he, David Beckham and David Cameron watched England win just two votes despite having privately secured the pledges of at least five Fifa delegates. The trio felt ‘lied to’, according to one England bid member who said it was ‘embarrassing that William and the Prime Minister have lent their good names’ to the project. William was reported to have objected to having to fawn to FIFA officials who had assembled in Zurich to decide which countries should host the World Cup finals of 2018 and 2022. He was quoted as having said: ‘I don’t see why we have to suck up to these people.’ Bid team: David Beckham and Prince William were part of the FA delegation in Zurich in 2010 . Mr Mayne-Nicholls added: 'It's like when you are a first division team and you play a third division team and you lose by five goals.' His words are likely to fuel further allegations that Russia and Qatar bribed Fifa officials to choose their bids. Last week Fifa agreed they would publish a report into the bribery allegations - having previously attempted to keep it secret. Mr Mayne Nicholls said there was clearly suspicion surrounding the voting but claimed Michael Garcia, the American lawyer charged with producing the report, had limited power. Prince William, Beckham and the Prime Minister share a joke at a meeting before the announcement that Russia would host the World Cup in 2018, not England . David Beckham pictured with Fifa delegates, including president Sepp Blatter (right) in 2010 - when he, Prince William and David Cameron attempted to secure pledges for England's bid for the 2018 World Cup . Sepp Blatter, Fifa President confirmed he would publish the 430-page report produced by by Mr Garcia - who resigned as Fifa's ethics investigator after complaining that the organisation's summary of his report was wrong. The Sunday Times recently exposed how Mohamed Bin Hamman, a former Qatari vice-president of Fifa, made dozens of payments worth millions of dollars to senior football officials to help his country secure World Cup 2022. As well as allegations of bribery, some countries have also been accused of trading votes. Quit: Michael Garcia resigned as Fifa's ethics investigator after complaining that the organisation's summary of his report into corruption allegations was inaccurate . In one instance Mr Bin Hamman is said to have promised Qatari support for the Spanish 2018 bid in return for Spain backing Qatar's 2022 bid. Mr Mayne Nicholls is now considering opposing Sepp Blatter for Fifa's presidency - the Swiss is once again standing for reelection despite being 78 years old. He has been visiting countries in Europe, building up support for a potential bid for the top job. Mr Mayne Nicholls, a former Chilean football federation president, believes the result of 2010's voting exposes the weakness in Fifa. He said Qatar was 'too hot' and 'too small' - and the idea of one city hosting the World Cup posed a number of problems. Standing for reelection: Sepp Blatter, 78, is hoping to stay on as Fifa president after 16 years in the job . With four games being played in one single day there will be 160,000 fans occupying a city with a population of just 800,000. A breakdown in the city's transport system could cause havoc for thousands of travelling fans. He also highlights the decision to combine bids for both World Cups as a mistake - as this made it more likely that countries would breach the rules by vote trading. The 2022 tournament is expected to be moved to winter to avoid matches being played in searing heat - however this creates huge logistical problems for leagues around the world that play through winter.","Harold Mayne-Nicholls is chairman of Fifa group that assessed rival bids .

"Victoria police have used capsicum spray to subdue children 90 times in the past three years, including an 11-year-old girl, documents show. The revelations have prompted calls for an urgent review of the use of force by police on underage people. Victoria's Commissioner for Children and Young People Bernie Geary said capsicum spray should not be used as an early option after it emerged police sprayed 90 children under the age of 15 in a three-year period. Scroll down for video . Victoria Police seen carrying long-range capsicum spray (right) and pump-action shotguns during training . In some cases children were sprayed even though they were not armed or were not posing a physical threat to police, the Herald Sun reported. Documents show a number of cases of children being restrained with pepper spray between 2011 and August 2014, including a 14-year-old girl who was resisting handcuffs in a police cell in Narre Warren, south-east Melbourne. A 11-year-old girl was sprayed after she tried to throw a chair at a police officer while being interviewed at a police station in Broadmeadows, in north Melbourne. Another case involved a 13-year-old girl who was sprayed through a window after locking herself in a Department of Human Services bathroom. Mr Geary said he was not aware of any police guidelines relating to the use of capsicum spray on children and teenagers, adding that it needed to be addressed. Victorian Commissioner for Children  Bernie Geary . 'Spray should only be used in extreme cases and these reports suggest this isn't the case,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're just moving out of a year where violence against women and children is being condemned, and rightfully so. 'It's admirable police-led advocacy and it must extend itself to police practises.' He would discuss the issue with police in the New Year. Superintendent David Clayton said police resorted to capsicum spray when children were armed, and are using it more often due to a rise in violence and drug abuse. 'We have had conversations about restraint on children in the past and I'll be continuing that, and more specifically making comments on the use of spray.' A Victoria Police spokeswoman said officers consider the safety of others and themselves when dealing with people armed with weapons or displaying extreme physical violence towards police, people nearby or themselves. 'While the age of the offender is a consideration in these dangerous incidents, the safety of the community and police is the priority,' she said. 'Our officers are trained to resolve situations using the least amount of force necessary however it is the nature of policing that at times, police will come in contact with people who, for what ever reason don't cooperate and place either themselves, a member of the community or one of our members at risk and in those situations our members have no choice but to use force to protect life and property and affect an arrest. 'Whenever force is used by an officer, the event is recorded and reviewed to ensure our officers are accountable and the use of force was justified under the circumstances.'","Victorian police sprayed 90 children under 15 in a three year period .

"David Cameron was last night under intense pressure to deliver on his promise to hold a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture. As the clamour for an independent investigation mounted, the Prime Minister was condemned for insisting a Westminster committee should do the job even though it presided over an alleged whitewash in the treatment of terror suspects. An alliance of nine human rights groups said only a judicial probe could get to the truth of the disturbing questions raised by an explosive US Senate report which laid bare the barbaric treatment of detainees by the CIA. In a letter to Downing Street, seen by the Daily Mail, the organisations blasted the Premier’s decision to allow Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) to investigate the UK’s ‘shameful’ involvement in American wrongdoing. David Cameron was last night under intense pressure to deliver on his promise to hold a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture. Pictured: Guantanamo Bay . Nine human rights groups told David Cameron only a judicial probe could get to the truth of Britain's role in torture by the CIA . It said the ISC was inadequate to look into allegations that, during the war on terror, British agents colluded in extraordinary rendition – where suspects are moved to secret prisons around the world for torture – and turned a blind eye to abuse of captives. The joint letter was sent to Number 10 as the spotlight once again fell upon the case of Shaker Aamer, the British resident who has been held in Guantanamo Bay for almost 13 years. US President Barack Obama said holding people in the camp ‘continues to inspire jihadists around the world’. Over the weekend, four Afghans were sent home leaving around 130 detainees, including father of four Mr Aamer. Mr Cameron has been under growing pressure to order a judge-led inquiry since the Senate intelligence committee report earlier this month detailed CIA beatings, waterboarding, hanging and the rectal feeding of detainees. But it had been stripped of any mention of the UK security services or Diego Garcia, the British territory in the Indian Ocean that Labour admitted was used for at least two US rendition flights. Shaker Aamer, the British resident who has been held in Guantanamo Bay for almost 13 years . MI6 agents have also been accused of being present when terror suspects were tortured. Compelling evidence has also emerged that Diego Garcia was used to hold prisoners. The letter, signed by human rights charities including Reprieve, Liberty and Amnesty International, said neither the ISC inquiry, nor its predecessor, begun by Sir Peter Gibson but controversially axed by the Government last year, ‘came up to the mark’. It said Mr Cameron had shamefully ‘U-turned’ on his 2010 vow to hold a judge-led inquiry to probe into the sickening abuse claims. At the time, the Prime Minister said the ISC could not be independent and would not inspire public confidence. The ISC cleared MI5 and MI6 of involvement in extraordinary rendition in 2007. The letter said: ‘The publication of the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has highlighted not only the horrors of the CIA’s torture programme, but also the UK’s failure as a country to put our own house in order. We therefore urge you to deliver on your promise of an independent, judge-led inquiry with the powers necessary to get to the truth, before next year’s General Election.’ Last night, President Obama said he remained committed to trying to close Guantanamo Bay by 2016. That would mean finding a solution to the wrangle over Mr Aamer who the authorities wish to send to his native Saudi Arabia, even though his British family live in South London. A British soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for simply thrusting a piece of paper at a Taliban fighter, it has emerged. He was accused of abuse for touching the terror suspect on the nose with the sheet during a routine interrogation in Afghanistan. The fighter was suspected of being a potential ringleader in the murder and mutilation of four French soldiers in 2008. But it was the intelligence officer – who had an exemplary record – who ended up being investigated amid claims that he had broken rules banning the touching of prisoners during interrogation. And another interrogator was probed for shouting in a suspect’s ear, it was claimed. A former senior Army interrogator said the investigations were both ‘ridiculous’.","Nine human rights groups call for judicial probe into Britain's role in torture .

"Summer holidays in 2015 could cost just half as much as they did this year thanks to low oil prices and the global upturn. Some airfares for next year have already been slashed by up to half - and experts say the discounts will even cover the Easter and summer holidays, which is expected to be warmly welcomed by parents. Experts say a combination of the current strength of the pound, the Government's decision to scrap air passenger duty for children and falling oil prices reducing airlines' fuel costs all mean the savings could last well into the summer. Scroll down for video . Some airfares for next year have already been slashed by half thanks to low oil prices and the global upturn . People are expected to start booking their holidays for 2015 as early as Boxing Day. Bargains available include huge savings on winter breaks to Florida, Mexico and Greece, and Easter flights to Spain being cut to almost half price compared to this year's prices. Other savings include £50 flights to Prague, Barcelona, Morocco, Portugal and Prague. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said lower oil prices and stronger worldwide financial growth are the main reasons for the savings. Bargains include huge savings on winter breaks to Florida, Mexico and Greece and Easter flights to Spain . They say consumers will benefit 'substantially' from the stronger industry performance as lower industry costs and efficiencies are passed over to holidaymakers in the form of savings. After adjusting for inflation, average return airfares excluding taxes and surcharges are expected to fall by 5.1 per cent compared to 2014 prices. The savings come just weeks after George Osborne announced in the Autumn statement that families with children will save hundreds of pounds on the cost of their holidays after he axed taxes on flights. The Chancellor abolished air passenger duty on all flights for children under the age of 12. Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement announcement is a major boost for families who are hit by higher holiday costs during term time - and if deals do cover the school holidays in 2015 parents can expect to make substantial savings. Joel Brandon-Bravo, UK managing director of Travelzoo, has said low air fare prices mean people can expect competitive deals and offers in 2015 . The £50 million tax break cuts £138 from the price of a family of four's holiday to North America – and almost £200 for a family of four travelling to Australia. From May 1, a family of five flying to Florida could save £213, or £71 for each child under 12. It will also reduce the cost of a family holiday to Spain by £26. The tax currently adds between £13 and £97 to the cost of a flight, depending on how far the final destination is from London. Joel Brandon-Bravo, UK managing director of Travelzoo, told the Sunday Express: 'With the low air fare prices we are seeing for the new year, early 2015 is set to kick off with some great travel offers.' Tony Tyler, IATA's Director General and CEO said: 'The industry outlook is improving. The global economy continues to recover and the fall in oil prices should strengthen the upturn next year. 'The industry story is largely positive, but there are a number of risks in today's global environment—political unrest, conflicts, and some weak regional economies- among them. 'But stronger industry performance is good news for all. 'It's a highly competitive industry and consumers—travellers as well as shippers—will see lower costs in 2015 as the impact of lower oil prices kick in. 'A healthy air transport sector will help governments in their overall objective to stimulate the economic growth needed to put the impact of the global financial crisis behind them at last.'

"Restrictions imposed on the movement of poultry after an outbreak of bird flu have now been lifted, the Government has said. Some 6,000 ducks were culled on a farm at Nafferton, near Driffield, East Yorkshire, following the identification of 'highly pathogenic' H5N8 bird flu last month. The disease was the same strain as one confirmed at a chicken farm in the central province of Utrecht, the Netherlands, and in Germany. Around 6,000 were culled on a farm in East Yorkshire, after bird flu was discovered last month - today the government has announced that restrictions imposed on nearby poultry farms have finally been lifted . The farm is operated by the UK's largest producer of duck and duck products, Cherry Valley, which sells ready meals to Tesco, M&S, Lidl and Aldi. Most types of bird flu are harmless to humans but two types - H5N1 and H7N9 - have caused serious concerns. In a statement today, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Defra, said: 'On Sunday, December 21 all restrictions following the outbreak were lifted. 'This means that all poultry-keeping farms within the 10 kilometre (6.2 mile) surveillance zone around the infected property are now allowed to move poultry and other animals without restriction. The farm which was found to be infected is operated by the UK's largest producer of duck and duck products . 'Other restrictions covering the storage, transport and sourcing of meat products are also lifted. 'A protected zone which imposed additional movement controls on properties within three kilometres of the infected farm was lifted on Friday.' Nigel Gibbens, chief vet for Defra, said: 'Protecting our country from animal diseases is important for our economy and our robust and thorough approach to tackling this outbreak means we are able to lift these restrictions at the earliest possible point allowed by EU law. All poultry-keeping farms within the 10 kilometre  surveillance zone around the infected property were temporarily banned from moving their birds around . 'This outbreak should serve as a reminder for the poultry industry of the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity to minimise the risk of infection and I would urge keepers to remain vigilant for any signs of disease and report suspicions to their vet immediately. 'Following confirmation of the outbreak last month, all poultry on the infected premises were humanely destroyed and the affected farm was cleansed and disinfected. 'The advice from Public Health England and the Chief Medical Officer is that the risk to public health is very low and the Food Standards Agency has said there is no food safety risk for consumers. 'Investigations are ongoing into the most likely source of the outbreak.' The Yorkshire outbreak was the first serious case of bird flu in the UK since 2008 when the H7N7 strand was found in free range hens near Banbury, Oxfordshire. When the strain was confirmed emergency restrictions were immediately put in place on the movement of birds and eggs. Defra carried out the cull on November 18 and began when a culling team dressed in chemical contamination suits marched into the first of six large barns. They put batches of 80 ducks in large plastic crates that were loaded into a 20ft long chamber where they were gassed to death in around 15 minutes. The dead ducks were soaked in disinfectant and dumped inside a lorry to be transported for incineration. At the time a Defra spokesman said the cull was being carried out in a ‘safe and humane manner’ by fully-trained staff from the Government’s Animal and Plant Health Agency. Officials are still investigating how the virus reached East Yorkshire. The European Commission said it is possible the virus is still being carried around Britain by migrating swans which are showing no signs of disease. But environment secretary Liz Truss insisted there was no risk to human health - as the H5N1 strain which has killed 400 people globally was ruled out at an early stage. Instead it is the H5N8 strain found in Germany and the Netherlands, which has never been known to cross over into humans. Cherry Valley has 33 British sites for breeding, hatching, growing or slaughtering 7million ducks a year, mostly in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. The farm at Nafferton, near Driffield, East Yorkshire, where 'highly pathogenic' H5N8 bird flu was found . Police guard the entrance to the farm after bird flu was discovered last month - 6,000 ducks have been culled . Bird flu - officially known as avian influenza - infects poultry around the world, often with no symptoms and no danger to people. But some strains have been known to cross into humans with deadly results, notably with the H5N1 and H7N9 varieties. The H5N1 strain first infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997 before re-emerging in 2003 and spreading from Asia to Europe and Africa. Some 393 people have died from the strain since 2003 - more than half of the 667 who were infected. Indonesia had by far the most deaths, followed by Vietnam and Egypt. The H7N9 strain has caused particular concern since it emerged last year. It has not yet been reported outside China but the closure of live bird markets for several months as a precaution has devastated farmers. The incubation period ranges from two to eight days and symptoms include a fever, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal and pain and bleeding from the nose and gums. Antiviral drugs can lessen the severity of the disease and help patients survive. The biggest risk of catching bird flu is from direct contact with infected poultry, particularly carcasses. There is no evidence 'properly cooked food' can infect people with the virus. The H5N8 strain, the one found in the Netherlands, Germany and Britain, has never been known to pass to humans.

"The British soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for tapping the suspect on the nose with a piece of paper (file image) A British soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for thrusting a piece of paper at a Taliban fighter, it has emerged. He was accused of abuse for touching the terror suspect on the nose with the sheet during a routine interrogation in Afghanistan. The enemy fighter had been captured and detained as a potential ringleader in the murder and mutilation of four French soldiers in 2008. But it was the military intelligence officer, who had an exemplary record, who was investigated for possible war crimes amid claims he had broken rules banning the touching of prisoners during interrogation. On another occasion an interrogator was probed for shouting in a suspect’s ear in case he burst an ear drum, it was claimed. The investigation is said to have taken place four years after the alleged offence. The incidents came to light after the Ministry of Defence tightened the rules governing tactical questioning in the wake of several highly-damaging allegations that UK troops abused captives in their custody. The changes have led to considerable disquiet in the military that soldiers are being hampered in their ability to extract information from insurgents that could potentially save lives. Last week, the Al Sweady Inquiry report into the fallout from a firefight in Iraq in 2004 which became known as the Battle of Danny Boy concluded that insurgents and their families had used ‘deliberate lies’ to smear British troops. Sir Thayne Forbes, who led the £31million inquiry, found that claims soldiers murdered, mutilated and tortured detainees were ‘wholly and entirely without merit’. But while blasting the Iraqis and their legal aid-funded British lawyers, the 1,250-page report also turned the spotlight on nine examples of military intelligence officers abusing Iraqi detainees during questioning, although these instances were found to be ‘relatively minor’. Colonel Tim Collins, who was awarded an OBE for his service during the Iraq war, said he blamed 'ambulance chasing lawyers' for the new rules on interrogation . One soldier was criticised for walking around a captured and blindfolded Iraqi insurgent and blowing gently on his neck, which Sir Thayne said ‘amounted to a form of ill-treatment’. The soldier was also castigated for banging a metal tent peg on a table to startle the prisoner, shouting in the man’s ear and warning him he would never see his wife if he refused to co-operate. Following the revelations, a former senior Army interrogator, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘There was an incident in 2008 when French soldiers were massacred and the bodies of four of them were mutilated. ‘We had two of the suspects in detention and they were brought in for questioning. ‘One of the interrogators touched one of the suspects on the nose with an A4 piece of paper and he was investigated by the special investigation branch for abuse. ‘Just for touching a detainee on the nose. The fact somebody could be investigated for that is to my mind incredible. It was ridiculous. These French soldiers had been horribly mutilated and yet it was the interrogator who was investigated.’ Blaming MoD lawyers, the former soldier said: ‘We once had in for questioning a well-known Taliban fighter. ‘He didn’t say a word; he wouldn’t speak to us and when he eventually did all he would say through the translator was: “Your detention policy is toothless”. ‘We would have these suspects in and there we are worried about what the lawyers in Britain are going to say. These are really bad people. They mutilate their victims. ‘They murder women and children and all we can think about is did we shout in their ear and will we get investigated for that? That’s how ridiculous it got.’ Colonel Tim Collins, who made a celebrated eve-of-battle speech during the Iraq war, said he blamed ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ and ‘play-it-safe judges’ for the new rules on interrogation. He said: ‘We are no longer able to carry out tactical questioning. That in itself brings risks to the lives of the people we deploy. ‘These insurgents are not nice people. These are criminals. They behead people; they keep sex slaves. They are not normal people.’","Soldier is accused of abusing terror suspect during routine interrogation .

"Wildlife photographer Alex Cearns has served in the police force for 14 years and visited some amazing locations but one of her most memorable moments is of when an emu sat on top of her during a photoshoot. 40-year-old Cearns, who has released her second book Joy which is filled with animal photos, is utterly obsessed with the furry creatures and photographs around 1300 animals per year. 'I went to photograph an emu and she sat on top of me. She bumped me out of the way and I kind of fell on the ground and she came over and sat on top of me,' the western Australian woman told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . This Orangutan was living in a colony in Singapore when Cearns visited for a photoshoot. The whole family were feeding at the time and eating mangosteen . When she was 16-years-old Cearns bought a film camera but didn't really have any idea how to use it. In 2006, she treated herself to a digital camera and soon realised her passion. She joined the Western Australian Police Service when she was 19 and left 14 years later to pursue her hobby of animal photography. Since then, she has opened up her own studio, Houndstooth Studio, and has won more than fifty Australian and international photographic awards. 'I realised that I liked photographing animals the best,' she said. 'I would kind of gravitate towards birds and dogs if I was at the park other than people and landscapes. It’s where I'm really comfortable photographing I struggle with everything else.' While she always thought her favourite animal would be something exotic, she reveals that she loves to photograph the humble dog. The domestic animal's unconditional love has inspired many of the photographers compelling snapshots in her book. Max the smiling wombat came into Cearns' studio in a pouch. He was soon jumping around and smiling for the camera . Cearns was part of the Western Australian Police Service for 14 years and soon realised her passion for photography . A sleepy baby boxer puppy was photographed by Cearns in the studio at just eight weeks old. Puppies generally play until they crash and Cearns managed to capture this adorable photograph just before the puppy fell asleep . 'They just give you so much unconditionally and are generally so happy to see you,' she said. 'I also love photographing baby native Australian animals because I just think we have some of the sweetest most adorable creatures here and I think they’re gorgeous.' In Cearns' beautiful book, she details the joy animals provide to humans in the world. Each picture has it's own story and starts with an adorable baby Orangutan sucking his thumb. The precious animal was living in a colony in Singapore when Cearns visited for a photoshoot. The whole family were feeding at the time and eating mangosteen. 'I was a few metres away and it was a little bit dark so I couldn't actually see what I was capturing at the time. It wasn't until I got home and looked at the pictures three weeks later that I realised the baby had been sucking their thumb,' she said. Alex the pig became friends with Cearns after she arrived at the gate of Brightside Farm as a stray . This grasshopper jumped all over Cearns as she tried to shoot him in the studio. Little did she know that the creature could bite . Cearns says her favourite animal to photograph is the humble dog. She loves how unconditional they are . On the opposite page lies a cheeky, smiling wombat from Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary in Tasmania. Cearns explains that Max the wombat was about the size of a football and full of joy. He came into the studio session tucked up in a pouch. When the time came to photograph the furry animal, he was jumping around, headbutting Cearns and going crazy on the set. However he soon settled back down and went back to his pouch, happily smiling up at her like a tiny Buddha. Cearns tells of an injured grasshopper she photographed in an educational animal facility in Western Australia. The critter was wild and kept jumping on her face and all over her camera as she tried to get the best shot. 'He was maybe three-and-a-half inches in length and I asked they can they bite?' she said. Cearns has opened up her own studio, Houndstooth Studio, and has won more than fifty Australian and international photographic awards . 40-year-old Cearns, who has released her second book Joy which is filled with animal photos, is utterly obsessed with the furry creatures and photographs around 1300 animals per year . Unfortunately for her, they can bite, and it was a close call for the photographer. A baby seal on Kangaroo Island caught Cearns' eye after coming over to her on the beach and nudging her. The seal's mother had gone off hunting and the seal was obviously checking to see if Cearns was her mother. 'I felt like he was checking to see was I his mum and then went back and lay down again,' she said. A sleepy baby boxer puppy was photographed by Cearns in the studio at just eight weeks old. Puppies generally play until they crash and Cearns managed to capture this adorable photograph just before the puppy fell asleep. The story of Alex the pig definitely tugs at the heartstrings. The pig turned up one day at the gate of Brightside Farm Sanctuary in Tasmania. A few days later, Cearns visited and decided to tickle the pig on his stomach, not knowing that the pig was a stray and did not belong to the farm. A baby seal on Kangaroo Island caught Cearns' eye after coming over to her on the beach and nudging her. The seal's mother had gone off hunting and the seal was obviously checking to see if Cearns was her mother . While her friend was disgusted she has touched the 'feral' animal, Cearns developed a strong bond with the pig. When she visited again in February this year, the pig didn't recognise her and Cearns left the barn upset. However, within an hour the pig has ran out in search of his friend, remembering their heart-warming moment together. 'I was delighted, I was crying because I was so excited,' she said. Cearns decided to photograph three Balinese street puppies for a  campaign called 'Look Twice'. The campaign aimed to make people stop and look at the animals on the streets of Bali instead of turning a blind eye. 'I wanted to do a studio shoot because I wanted to show people that dogs and cats on the street in Bali are really just the same as our pets at home,' she said. 'Don’t try and befriend them just give them an extra piece of toast or something.'

Lord Mandelson said Labour must spell out exactly how it would slash government spending and ‘show they mean it’ in order to win the election. The former Business Secretary called on individual members of the Shadow Cabinet to reveal exactly where cuts will be taking place to hammer home Labour's deficit message. He said there was no point just leaving the hard work to Labour leader Ed Miliband and Chancellor Ed Balls as the senior ministers must ‘play as a team’. ‘What Labour is saying is that it will reduce day to day spending across government departments and it will do that year on year to reduce the percentage of borrowing,' he told BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show. 'But the party will also invest where we need to. That’s what Labour’s position is for this election and they need to spell it out and show that they mean it. ‘There is no point just leaving it to the two Ed’s – the shadow cabinet has got to play as a team in this. Each member must spell out exactly what this means for the departmental budget and where cuts will be taking places.’ He said the past few weeks after the Autumn Statement would be seen as a ‘defining’ moment in British politics. ‘I was surprised that the Conservatives took such a sharp step to the right. This has created an opportunity for the Labour party. Labour is in such a good position for coming election.’ When asked whether he would like to see David Miliband return to British politics, the Labour peer said: 'He has a lot to contribute wherever he is,' with a pantomime wink. ‘I have no idea what David’s plans are. Of course I’d like to see him back in British politics. He’s got a very good job that he’s doing at the moment.’ Lord Mandelson also said leaving the European Union would be an ‘extraordinary act of self-destruction’. He joined forces with Conservative cabinet minister Ken Clarke and Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander to warn leaving the EU would be a 'historical error'. He said the hard work should not just be left to Ed Miliband (right) and Ed Balls (left) as all Shadow Cabinet ministers should reveal where spending cuts will be coming from . Speaking this earlier today, he said: ‘The Scottish referendum was extraordinary moment this year for the mobilisation and engagement of the whole of Scottish nation but also how people outside Britain were totally aghast at how the country would want break itself up. ‘They feel the same about Britain and the European Union – that we should rob ourselves of our influence and separate ourselves from our own home market. It strikes them such an act of self-destruction they find it difficult to know why we would contemplate it, they can hardly believe it.’ He said many voters were now looking to the marginal groups because they are ‘angry and pessimistic’. ‘But the election will be decided in the centre-ground and not on the margins,’ he said.","Lord Mandelson said Labour must 'spell out' cuts and show they mean it .

"The Prime Minister has delivered a major shake-up as he announced his first ministerial reshuffle on Sunday afternoon, with a second woman promoted to Cabinet. Tony Abbott has appointed Peter Dutton to immigration and shifted Scott Morrison to Minister for Social Services, while Sussan Ley will take on her role as Minister for Health and Sport.

Scroll down for video . Prime minister Tony Abbott speaks to the media during a press conference at Parliament House on Sunday . Mr Abbott announced his new look in Canberra, saying it would 'reset and refocus the government for the coming year'. 'This is a ministry for jobs and families and it is a sign that this is a government which wants the economy and the budget to be front and centre in the coming year,' he told reporters in Canberra. Josh Frydenberg will become assistant treasurer, replacing Arthur Sinodinos, whose resignation from the role triggered the reshuffle. Mr Abbott said the education portfolio would now become education and training, with former parliamentary secretary Simon Birmingham named as an assistant minister to Christopher Pyne. THE WINNERS .

Kelly O'Dwyer also entered the outer ministry, becoming a parliamentary secretary to the treasurer. 'This is a good team. It is a strong team. It is a balanced team,' Mr Abbott said. I am proud of all my colleagues but I am particularly proud to be able to make these announcements this afternoon.' Brett Mason has been dropped as parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs and the vacancy filled by Steve Ciobo. Meanwhile, Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane will become the Minister for Industry and Science, rectifying an omission that has plagued the government. Addressing the dumping of Senator Johnston, the prime minister said 'no one goes on forever'. Sussan Ley (pictured) will take on health, becoming the second woman in the Abbott cabinet . Scott Morrison (pictured) has been shifted from immigration to the important portfolio of Social Services . Mr Abbott announced his new look in Canberra, saying it would 'reset and refocus the government' for 2015 . However, the resignation of Senator Sinodinos provided an opportunity to 'refresh and reset' the government. 'Just because someone leaves the government doesn't mean that he or she has done a poor job,' he said. 'Johnno did a fine job as defence minister and Brett Mason has done a good job in his role.' Mr Andrews would be a 'very, very safe pair of hands' as defence minister. 'He will do an excellent job in this difficult and vital portfolio,' Mr Abbott said. The prime minister also heaped praise on outgoing immigration minister Scott Morrison as a master of difficult policy and administration, who had all but stopped the boats. As part of an expanded social services portfolio, Mr Morrison will have responsibility for child care and Mr Abbott's signature paid parental leave scheme. 'He is a very tough and competent political operator but he is also an extremely decent human being,' the prime minister said. 'We need good judgement in these areas and that is exactly what you will get from Scott Morrison.' Former Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews (pictured) will take over the Defence Minister role .

Rounding out Mr Abbott's reshuffle, Christian Porter, Bob Baldwin and Karen Andrews were all named parliamentary secretaries. The new ministry will be sworn in on Tuesday. Acting opposition leader Penny Wong said no reshuffle could fix the government's biggest problem - its an unpopular budget. 'You might change the tyres on the bus but the wheels are still spinning,' she told reporters in Adelaide. 'It is a vote of no confidence in the PM's cabinet.

"Australians have hit back at Prime Minister Tony Abbott after he said the most important thing he had accomplished for women this year was the repeal of the carbon tax, because it helped women balance the household budget. Voters have taken to social media to slam his comments, by posting pictures of irons, ironing boards and other household items with the tongue-in-cheek hashtags #thankstony, #putyourironout and #putoutyourboards. In an interview on The Today Show on Monday morning host Lisa Wilkinson asked the Prime Minister to name his biggest achievement this year in his dual role as Minister for Women. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott says his biggest achievement this year as Minister for Women was to repeal the carbon tax . 'Well you know it's very important to do the right thing by families and households, and as many of us know women are particularly focussed on the household budget,' the Prime Minister said. 'And the repeal of the carbon tax means a $550 a year benefit for the average family.' Ms Bishop, Foreign Minister and the most powerful woman in the Abbott government, sought to play down the prime minister's comments. 'There are numerous issues that could be mentioned in the context of what we do for women,' Ms Bishop told reporters in Adelaide. 'I think what the prime minister was focusing on was the policy change that would have the largest impact on families and households.' Following his Mr Abbott's comments the hashtags #thankstony and #PutYourIronOut soon began trending on Twitter and Facebook. '#Thankstony With the Carbon tax repeal I can buy a new apron,' one woman tweeted. '#ThanksTony, because of the carbon tax repeal I can afford to leave my sandwich press on ALL THE TIME just in case my hubby wants a snack,' said another. In a major Cabinet reshuffle on Sunday the prime minister promoted Sussan Ley to the health ministry . Others were more critical. 'Thankstony for setting women and families back a few decades,' one Facebook user said. 'Well he wasn't lying. Pity the only woman to benifit (sic) from repeal of carbon tax was Gina Reinhardt (sic) #ThanksTony,' one man tweeted. After talking about the carbon tax, Mr Abbott added that the Government has its 'fair dinkum paid parental scheme' coming into parliament in 2015 along with improvements to childcare. 'And obviously I'm very pleased that I was able to promote three women in my own ministry yesterday,' he said. In a major Cabinet reshuffle on Sunday the Prime Minister promoted Sussan Ley to the health ministry. As health minister she becomes the second woman in Cabinet, after foreign minister Julie Bishop. The elevation of Ms Ley to cabinet has been accompanied by the promotion of Kelly O'Dwyer and Karen Andrews as parliamentary secretaries, addressing long-standing criticism of the lack of women in the ministry. Mr Abbott was pleased the number of women on his frontbench had increased, but stressed all appointments were made on merit. Mr Abbott dumped Defence Minister David Johnston and named Kevin Andrews as a surprise replacement, in a major reshuffle to 'reset and refocus' the Government for the new year. The frontbench overhaul also moved immigration minister Scott Morrison into an expanded social services portfolio. Peter Dutton has been given the immigration portfolio, while Josh Frydenberg will become assistant treasurer. He replaces Arthur Sinodinos, whose resignation on Friday sparked the ministerial rejig. The reshuffle just days before Christmas is an attempt to reboot the coalition, who by the prime minister's own admission had a 'ragged' end to 2014. The new frontbench team will be sworn in on Tuesday, and would 'reset and refocus the government for the coming year', Mr Abbott said. 'This is a good team. It is a strong team. It is a balanced team,' he told reporters in Canberra. 'It will put jobs and families at the heart of our political agenda for 2015.'

"Two foreign fishing boats suspected of conducting illegal fishing activities are blown up by the Indonesian navy in Ambon bay, Indonesia, 21 December 2014. The destruction of the Papua New Guinea-flagged vessels follows a government ruling to sink almost all foreign ships which carry out illegal fishing activities in the waters of Indonesia. 'The ships have gone through legal procedures at the court in Ambon and their owners were found guilty of stealing fish from Indonesian waters. We must sink these ships so that other foreign ships will think twice before fishing illegally in our territory,' said navy spokesman Commodore Manahan Simorangkir. Extreme prejudice: A pair of Papa New Guinea-registered ships are destroyed by the Indonesian Navy after they were caught poaching fish in the nation's waters. Indonesia is cracking down hard on illegal fishing and has destroyed a number of ships so far . One of the ships burns. The two vessels carried 63 tonnes of fish and shrimp. 62 crewmen, mostly Thai, were arrested and several were turned over to immigration. They were caught on December 7 near the sea border of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea . The ships, the Century IV and Century VII, were caught on December 7 near the sea border of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, reports the Jakarta Post. 'The ships were flying the Papua New Guinean flag but the crew were all Thai,' Navy Maj. Eko Budimansyah, spokesman for Lantamal IX Naval Base in Ambon, said. The two vessels carried 63 tonnes of fish and shrimp.  62 crewmen were arrested and several were turned over to immigration. The ships were emptied of fuel before being destroyed to prevent pollution. The vessels will be the fourth and fifth ships sunk by Indonesia in the three months since President Joko 'Jokowi' Widodo took office. Indonesia loses about £15.3bn annually from illegal fishing and there are currently an estimated 5,400 illegal ships operating in the nation's waters . Six more foreign ships are currently facing destruction, pending legal proceedings. The number of cases of illegal fishing has declined since the hardline stance was taken. Some opponents say the destruction of the boats could cause diplomatic tension with other nations. Officials with Taiwan's Fisheries Agency asked that Jakarta observe international protocol that allows its authorities to seize poaching vessels and arrest their crews, but forbids them from opening fire. Indonesia loses about £15.3bn annually from illegal fishing and there are currently an estimated 5,400 illegal ships operating in the nation's waters.","The Indonesian Navy has taken a hard stance against foreign poachers operating its waters .

"The group of friends dressed as chocolate bars and lay on the ground as a Christmas selection pack . Over the years Christmas fancy dress outfits have evolved from novelty jumpers to reindeer onesies. But this group of friends from Dublin, Ireland, took the task of coming up with a festive outfit to the next level when they donned chocolate bar costumes and became a Cadbury selection box. The outfits were the group's effort for the '12 Pubs of Christmas' - an annual seasonal pub crawl, which sees revellers dress in festive attire and down a drink in a dozen different bars in the city. Pictures of the 12 men, two of which had travelled from Australia for the big event, went viral on social media overnight and have had over 350,000 likes on Facebook. Aaron Johnston, 31, who runs a fitness company, came up with the novel idea over a month ago and set to work putting the plan together. He told the MailOnline: 'We've been doing the 12 pubs bar crawl every year for the last seven years. 'It's a group of 12 of us and every year we have a different theme. Last year we went as the nativity and we didn't think we could top that this year and then we came up with this. 'My friend Craig made all the costumes by hand. We all chipped in with a few quid for him to get the material, but it must've taken him a long time to make.' When the group got together yesterday they posed for pictures, which family and friends posted on the internet before they had even left the house. Mr Johnston, who was dressed as the Crunchie bar, added: 'When we got into the city centre people were saying to us you're all over Facebook and loads of people wanted pictures. 'We were really surprised with the reaction. Last year we thought we had a great idea and we were saying it's never going to be topped but we put a lot of effort into it.' They dressed up in the festive-themed outfits to take part in the '12 Pubs of Christmas' in Dublin yesterday . They were dressed as everything from a Dairy Milk to a Curly Wurly and made it round all of the 12 designated pubs. The group have known each other for several years and Mr Johnston says the event is the time of year they all get together. 'Some of my friends have moved away so most of them come home for Christmas - in fact two of them flew over from Australia and one came over from Canada. 'We're just a group of friends getting together. We go and get a drink in each of the 12 pubs and spend about 30 minutes in them - but it's a really well planned event.' And instead of waking up with too much of a hangover, Mr Johnston said he was woken up to hundreds of messages on his phone from people who had seen he had gone viral. Pictures of the group - two of which flew in from Australia and one from Canada to take part - have gone viral . Even Cadbury Ireland were impressed and tweeted: 'This has made our day!!! So well made and perfectly modeled :) #SelectionBoxSuits'. The 12 Pubs of Christmas has become increasingly popular in the Irish capital and brings with it challenges along the way, including 'left-handed pub' where you can only drink with one hand. Other tasks might be the 'silent pub' - no talking - and the 'swapsies pub' where the punters have to swap shoes with each other. But there are concerns from health authorities over the harmful effects of heavy drinking. Joe Treacy, an accredited counsellor with the Addiction Counsellors of Ireland, told the Connacht Tribune, that people are dicing with death by taking part in the ‘tradition’. From left to right, Richie, Paul, David, Stuart, Andrew, Aaron, Alan, David, Craig, Barry, Brian and Anthony . #There are two drinking festivals in Ireland now – St Patrick’s Day and Christmas. 'Go to A&E over the next few weeks and you’ll see an awful lot of Christmas jumpers – head injuries, intoxication, domestic violence, fights. The common factor is alcohol. “Six hundred people self-harmed [died by suicide] last year and no parent relishes the thought of that. Loading young people with cheap alcohol is a recipe for disaster.'","Group of men dressed as chocolate bars to become Cadbury selection box .

"A 90-year-old D-Day veteran has become the oldest person ever to be jailed in the UK. Albert Barrow, a former lance corporal, sexually abused two young victims over many years, a court heard. After being arrested he told a probation officer he did not believe what he had done was serious, and said: 'It happens all the time.' Southampton Crown Court heard how his actions 'ruined' the lives of the victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons. A picture of his Second World War medals was held up in court as Barrow's barrister pleaded with the judge not to send him to prison. Southampton Crown Court heard how the actions of Albert Barrow 'ruined' the lives of the victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons. At 90, he is the oldest person ever to be jailed in the UK . But the judge ignored the plea and jailed Barrow, from Totton, Hampshire, for four years. After hearing the sentence the father turned to a dock officer and said: 'But I won't be alive all that long.' The historical offences were revealed after police were called to an incident between him and one of his victims earlier this year. Carolyn Branford-Wood, prosecuting, said the defendant abused the victims on a regular basis. One victim said in a statement: 'I was scared. I did not like it, I did not want it and I wanted it to stop.' 'He has ruined my life and for the past years I have had to live with this... It does not stop and it has ruined my relationships with men.' In total, Barrow admitted 14 charges of indecent assault, which covered multiple offences. Initially, he had only admitted six charges. Albert Barrow, a former lance corporal, fought at D-Day. A picture of his Second World War medals was held up in court as Barrow's barrister pleaded with the judge not to send him to prison. File picture . Defence barrister John Lofthouse asked his client be spared prison. He said when Barrow was asked by police why he committed the offences, he told them: 'I don't know. I was abused as a child myself by my mother.' Following his arrest, Barrow attended a police station voluntarily for an interview and said: 'I'm guilty.' Mr Lofthouse said this belied a man who wanted to 'get things off his chest', was 'frank' and sorry for what he had done. However, the judge pointed out there were 'concerning things' that Barrow had told probation officers in a pre-sentence report. Judge Nicholas Rowland said: 'There are some unappealing sentiments expressed by this defendant about one of his victims. 'At one point it is reported that he [Barrow] remarks that he doesn't see it [indecent assault] as a serious matter as it ""goes on all the time"".' Mr Lofthouse agreed what was said was 'appalling' and said his client was an 'ill-tuned bell' who was 'stuffy in his attitudes'. But he insisted his client was remorseful and suggested that since committing the offences Barrow had had 'the sword of Damocles' hanging over his head. The court heard Mr Lofthouse had submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Ministry of Justice asking how many people aged 90 or over were in prison in the UK. This revealed there were just five. He added Barrow had a war record and held up pictures of all the medals he had won to the court. Judge Rowland ignored Mr Lofthouse's pleas, noting that had the defendant been caught at the time of his offending and admitted the charges he would have faced at least 14 years behind bars. Judge Rowland added: 'The effect on your victims has been immense. 'In their impact statements they have written of the long-term consequences for them - there were all sorts of problems that manifested from the abuse that you perpetuated.' Upon hearing his sentence, Barrow, who had walked into court with the aid of a walking frame, appeared stunned. As dock officers came to lead him away to the cells, Barrow asked them to confirm how long he had got in prison and one of them told him 'four years'. He replied: 'But I won't be alive all that long.' In 2010, wheelchair-bound Thomas Burton, 88, became the previous oldest person to be jailed in the UK after he admitted abusing two sisters. Burton, from Middleton, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was jailed for 16 months for molesting the sisters more than 40 years ago.","Albert Barrow, a former lance corporal, sexually abused two young victims .

"Father-of-two Raymond Lorne of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, texted the juror, whom he had known for 30 years, an anonymous threat as a 'joke' A juror in a high-profile rape trial was left terrified when he received a text message reading: ‘I know who you are. If you find them guilty, I will find you.’ He did not recognise the number and called 999 to report the threat, fearing for his life and his family’s. But days later, after a police investigation had been launched, it was revealed the menacing message had been sent by his friend as a ‘practical joke’. Father-of-two Raymond Lorne of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, texted the juror, whom he had known for 30 years, after learning he could not be at their usual Thursday night pub quiz due to jury service. He claimed to get the idea from the film of John Grisham’s novel Runaway Jury, a legal thriller. The 40-year-old garden designer, who is married to a financial adviser, had been drinking and had forgotten he had recently changed his mobile phone number. Lorne has now been jailed for 28 days after pleading guilty to being in contempt of court. His friend received the text four days into a nine-day trial of Jason Britcher, 40 – a legal clerk who was accused of attempting to rape a junior barrister at a Christmas party. The juror believed the message was connected to the court case as Mr Britcher had just given evidence saying he had sleepwalked into bed with the barrister and was innocent. Later that night, the man called 999 and told police he was a juror on a case, did not recognise the number and was taking the threat seriously. An officer was stationed at his home to protect him and his family while an investigation was launched on December 12. Hull Crown Court heard that, when the number was traced, Lorne told police: ‘I sent the text. It was a practical joke.’ He said he had meant to ring his friend to explain the message, but after the pub quiz had forgotten. Crown barrister John Thackray told the court that the jury in the rape case had had to be sent away, Britcher had been unable to speak to his barristers for three days and the juror had to be discharged for fear the stress could have influenced his decision. Lorne was jailed for 28 days, after pleading guilty to being in contempt of court. Defence barrister Nigel Clive said Lorne was a married businessman who did not fit the picture of a man accused of jury intimidation. ‘He and a friend were in a pub quiz,’ said Mr Clive. ‘He was told about his mutual friend who was on jury service. He took it upon himself to send the text... it was his phone... There was no venom or malice, but there was stupidity in abundance. Hull Crown Court heard that, when the number was traced, Lorne told police: ‘I sent the text. It was a practical joke'. The judge said: 'The consequences of your extremely foolish action have been serious' ‘I have told him what will be at the forefront of your honour’s mind. The prospect of prison fills him with dread. He coaches a local football team which the juror’s son is in. Their friendship will recover.’ Sentencing Lorne, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC told him: ‘This was a serious contempt of court in the middle of a difficult, sensitive high-profile case. As a measure of the serious nature of that case I have just sentenced the defendant to nine years in prison. ‘Your friend was serving on the jury in that case. The defendant had just completed his evidence in chief with his defence lawyer and was preparing himself to be cross-examined. ‘He could not talk to his lawyer. The case had to stop because of what you did. The defendant could not be told about the problem because no one knew initially what was going on. ‘A senior officer from Humberside Police had to be tasked to investigate, away from more important duties, until it was found out how serious the threat was. 'The consequences of your extremely foolish action have been serious. We lost one full day of trial. A juror on that trial was terrified. ‘That juror had to be protected by a police officer at his home until the threat was established. 'People you know were terrified. The cross-examination had to be delayed. There was a three-day gap in [the defendant’s] evidence and he had that hanging over his head. ‘No one must be under any illusion sending a threatening text to a juror must mean you go to prison at once.’","Raymond Lorne, 40, sent message to friend as practical joke .

"Troubled club: Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston (above) described a fan  as an ‘intellectual cripple’ A Championship football club chairman has called a supporter a ‘retard’ and ‘f***tard’ in a series of foul-mouthed text messages. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston described fan Steve Smith as an ‘intellectual cripple’ after the supporter had texted him with some questions about the side who are bottom of the league. Mr Oyston, 47, shockingly referred to father-of-three Mr Smith, 31, and other angry fans of the club - who lost 6-1 at home to Bournemouth yesterday - as ‘lower mentality types’. According to a report in The Sun on Sunday by journalist Paul Keaveny, the chairman said: ‘Are you sure we have met? I would have remembered such a massive retard.’ During a text exchange with Mr Smith, in which the fan was also said to have made insults, Mr Oyston added: ‘Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f***tard as you.’ He went on to tell business manager Mr Smith: ‘Sorry that your life is so s***, but that's only your fault not mine. Enjoy the rest of your special needs day out.’ Mr Smith said Mr Oyston had banned him from the club’s Bloomfield Road ground, telling The Sun on Sunday: ‘As a chairman you should be able to rise above what a fan thinks and respond in a polite manner.’ Ismail Kaji, who has a learning disability and works for the charity Mencap, said that the ‘disgusting’ language made him ‘sick’ - and was ‘just as bad as using racist or homophobic words’. Protest: Blackpool fans outside the club's Bloomfield Road ground in August, asking for Mr Oyston to resign . Heavy defeat: Brett Pitman of Bournemouth scores a penalty during his side's 6-1 win at Blackpool yesterday . He told MailOnline today: ‘A lot of people with a learning disability, like me, are passionate football supporters. I would feel ashamed however to support any football club that has a chairman who uses such disgusting language to people with a disability. ‘This language is just as bad as using racist or homophobic words. There is no difference and it makes me sick. Someone with a high profile should act as a role model, not needlessly insult the people that look up to them. ‘Regardless of his position though, what he said should not be tolerated. The chairman must apologise to the people who will have been deeply affected by the language aimed at them. This cannot be ignored.’ Mr Oyston - whose family is worth £100million, putting them in 863rd position in the latest Sunday Times Rich List - is the son of businessman and convicted rapist Owen, 80. Revelations of the messages come after Wigan Athletic's chairman accepted a Football Association misconduct charge last week for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities. Also under fire: Wigan chairman Dave Whelan (right, with new manager Malky Mackay) accepted a Football Association misconduct charge last week for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities . Dave Whelan allegedly used the words in trying to justify his managerial appointment of Malky Mackay, who remains the subject of an FA probe into racist, homophobic and sexist messages. The 78-year-old was quoted as saying ‘Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else’ while also arguing there was ‘nothing’ offensive about the term ‘chink’. But, following the comments, Mr Oyston said of Mr Whelan: ‘He says things as he sees them and is from a different generation but he’s certainly not a racist.’ Blackpool manager Lee Clark is the Seasiders' fourth manager this calendar year, with the Fylde coast club - who were in the Premier League as recently as 2011 - having won just twice all season. A spokesman for Blackpool did not immediately return a request for comment today, while the FA told MailOnline that it was 'aware of the story'.","Karl Oyston described fan Steve Smith as 'intellectual cripple' in texts .

"Jordan has been condemned by human rights groups after hanging 11 men convicted of murder (file picture) Jordan has been condemned by human rights groups after hanging 11 men convicted of murder, ending an eight-year moratorium on the death penalty. The men were killed at dawn in a prison 45 miles from the capital Amman, interior ministry spokesman Ziyad Zoobi confirmed. The men, said to mostly be in their 40s, were convicted murderers with no links to politics or extremism, Jordanian authorities said. Jordan last carried out an execution in 2006, with 122 people sentenced to death since. The 11 men hanged by the Middle Eastern nation were convicted in 2005 and 2006, it was claimed. Although Jordan gave no reason for ending the eight-year moratorium on capital punishment, Interior Minister Hussein Majali recently hinted that the death penalty could return. He said there was a 'major debate' in Jordan on the death penalty and that 'the public believes that the rise in crime has been the result of the non-application' of executions. Rights groups condemned the executions, saying they would make little difference to rising crime in Jordan. 'With these executions, Jordan loses its standing as a rare progressive voice on the death penalty in the region,' Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director Human Rights Watch said. 'Reviving this inherently cruel form of punishment is another way Jordan is backsliding on human rights.' Taghreed Jaber, regional director for Penal Reform International, said: 'We are surprised by this decision, which is a step back for Jordan.' The head of Jordan's Adallah (Arabic for justice) rights group, Assem Rababa, said the country's authorities would be better off tackling the root causes of crime. 'Political and economic problems are fostering crime,' he said. 'The authorities should not make a headlong rush (into executions) while ignoring these problems.' The executions in a prison 45 miles from the capital Amman ended an eight-year moratorium on the death penalty (file picture) Oraib Rantawi, head of Amman's Al-Quds Centre for Political Studies, said: 'The authorities have been confronted in recent years with a wave of violence, criminality and murders and want to meet the challenge by opting for deterrence and the renewed application of the death penalty.' A number of countries in the Middle East continue to impose the death penalty for serious crimes, including Jordan's neighbour Saudi Arabia, which has executed 83 people so far this year. China by far carried out the most executions in 2013, numbering in the thousands, followed by Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United States, Amnesty International said in a report in March.","Jordan condemned by rights groups for executing 11 convicted murderers .

"Britain was basked in a glorious orange sunset this afternoon on the shortest day of the year with darkness setting in shortly before 4pm. The Winter Solstice - the day of the year during which earth is learning furthest from the sun - was heralded with stunning amber and pink skies across much of the country. But following a day of dry, mild weather, hopes for a white Christmas have been dashed by forecasters who predict light showers and minimum temperatures of 0C on December 25. Those hoping for widespread snow will be disappointed, say experts, with the Scottish hills and North Yorkshire Moors the only places likely to see snowfall. Scroll down for video . A couple admire the stunning orange sunset in Ellerton, York, on the shortest day of the year with the sun setting across Britain at 3.53pm . The Winter Solstice marks the shortest day of the year when earth is leaning furthest from the sun. In Ellerton, York, bright amber hues set over a rural landscape . 'Those hoping for a white Christmas will be disappointed.Snow is most likely in higher ground, such as the Grampian Mountains, and possibly the North Yorkshire Moors, but any snow or sleet will be light and patchy and is unlikely to settle. 'For the rest of the country, most areas will be dry and bright on Christmas Day with temperatures of 6C to 7C in England and 5 to 6C in Scotland,' said Met Office forecaster Emma Corrigan. Light rain and heavy clouds are expected across central and southern England and Wales tomorrow, with mild temperatures expected to remain in the low teens. 'The north of England, Ireland and southern Scotland will be windy and wet with heavy rain at times. It will also be mild with temperatures of 10C to 12C,' added Miss Corrigan. 'Northern Scotland will be colder, between 7C and 8C, and bright and clear with the odd snow or sleet shower, though most areas will have rain instead.' On Christmas Eve however much of the north of England will be showered with rain, with frost expected on the ground on Christmas morning. Brighter conditions were seen over the Cambridgeshire Fens near Ely. Temperatures across the region were mild, remaining in the low teens . The Winter Solstice marks the beginning of longer days and shorter nights for the rest of the year, and usually occurs on December 21.

In parts of Scotland temperatures are expected to drop as low as -1C with clear skies and crisp sunshine expected throughout the day. If there is to be any snow it will likely fall on Boxing Day, she added. The last time Britain was blanketed in snow on Christmas morning was in 2010, with 83 per cent of the Met Office's weather stations recording snowfall across the country. Wintry weather is more likely between January and March. Despite recent forecasts, scores of revellers donned festive hats and swimming costumes to take a frosty dip in the North Atlantic.

"The man known as the ‘Lotto Rapist’ has been pictured walking in the countryside with his girlfriend after buying a luxury new home in the form of a converted church. Iorworth Hoare, 62, became notorious when he won £7.2million on the lottery in 2004 after buying a ticket on day release from prison while serving a sentence for rape. Now he has paid £440,000 for an isolated five-bedroom home in Northumberland and is living there with former policeman’s wife Karen Cameron, 51, and their two dogs, it has been reported. Out and about: 'Lotto Rapist' Iorworth Hoare (left) enjoys a walk in the countryside with his girlfriend Karen Cameron (right) and their pet dogs after buying a new luxury home in Northumberland . Walk in the countryside: Hoare (pictured with Miss Cameron) became notorious when he won £7.2million on the lottery in 2004 after buying a ticket on day release from prison while serving a sentence for rape . The ‘attractive and unique’ house dates from 1790 and is said to retain period features with modern fixtures and fittings, an ‘enclosed private garden’ and rooms ‘full of character’. He bought it in July. Hoare began a relationship with Miss Cameron six years ago after hiring her as a cleaning lady on £6.50 an hour, reported journalists Nick Warbuton and Nick Doman in the Sunday People. The mother-of-two was claimed to have told her daughter six years ago that Hoare was a 'total gentleman' who 'makes me laugh and smile in a way that I haven't done for years'. Three years ago he has put his mansion at the exclusive Darras Hall estate outside Newcastle up for sale at a knockdown price after the words 'leave or die' were spray-painted on the gates. Converted church: Hoare has paid £440,000 for an isolated five-bedroom house in Northumberland . Rapist: Since his release from prison, Hoare (pictured in 2007) has faced a catalogue of abuse and threats . Hoare bought the six-bedroom detached house for £700,000 following his release from a life sentence in 2005. But in 2011 he was forced to put it up for sale for a bargain price of £595,000. Since his release from prison, Hoare, originally from Seacroft, Leeds, has faced a catalogue of abuse and threats, most notably eight years ago when he received silver bullets through the post. Market trader Peter Oates, of Brixton, south London, was found guilty of threatening to kill the jackpot winner and was jailed indefinitely at Newcastle Crown Court in December 2006. In 2008, Hoare tried to get access to his fortune so he could leave the country and set up home in France. However he was restricted to £8,666 a month as part of the conditions of his release. Hoare was jailed for life in 1989 for attempting to rape a 59-year-old woman in a Leeds park. He already had six previous convictions for rape and other sex offences.","Iorworth Hoare, 62, goes for walk in countryside with Karen Cameron .

"In these incredible pictures soldiers are seen leaping 10,000ft with their daredevil dogs in tandem parachute jumps. One four-legged recruit joined Special Forces troops on a parachute freefall into one of Europe's biggest military training exercises in Norway. The explosives sniffing dog, a member of Austria's version of the SAS, took part in Operation Cold Response along with British Special Forces and Royal Marines assault teams. Securely strapped to his handler and with a muzzle to stop him damaging his mouth on landing, he plunged 10,000ft from a transporter plane over Narvik. Scroll down for video .

But the Spanish Army has recently introduced the world's first tandem parachute for dog and handler. In new trials at a drop zone in Santorcaz, Spain, both dogs and handlers have been safely delivered to the ground by the professional parachutist. A dog specialised in sniffing out explosives was able to leap out of the plane with its owner and a soldier from the Parachute Regiment in the first jump. And in the second jump another dog called Jimy, specialised in tracking and attacking on command, made the leap. Spanish army spokesman Raul Ramon, 45, said: 'Both dogs were Belgian shepherds.

"Refused: Sue Smith, above with guide dog Sonny, was left feeling 'embarrassed' after Shahzad Ahmad told her that he could not accept her fare . A taxi driver has been fined £1,000 after he refused to pick up a blind woman who was standing in the pouring rain because she had a guide dog. Shahzad Ahmad, 32, told Sue Smith that he could not accept her fare because his vehicle wasn't big enough to fit five-year-old Labrador Sonny - even though he was driving a six-seater people carrier. Ms Smith  left feeling 'scared' and 'embarrassed' when Ahmad drove away, leaving her and Sonny to be soaked on the street, Birmingham Magistrates Court heard. The 50-year-old had phoned taxi firm T.C. Cars after visiting the headquarters of Action for Blind People in Birmingham on March 27. But she was stunned when Mr Ahmad arrived and told her that he could not take her with Sonny. She was left 'embarrassed' and 'disorientated' in the street for 20 minutes as she tried to find her way back into the building she had just left. Ms Smith said that the incident has 'dented her confidence' and has left her scared to get into a taxi. It is an offence for a taxi driver not to take a blind person and their guide dog unless they have a medical exemption certificate for an allergy. Ahmad was found guilty in his absence of breaching the Equality Act 2010 at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Wednesday. He was fined £1,000, ordered to pay court costs of £1,000 and a victim surcharge of £100. On Thursday, Ms Smith, who lives with long term partner, Colin, 50, said: 'I was so angry and scared. It was horrible. 'It was pouring with rain and if I hadn't been going to the Action for the Blind building I would have just been stranded in the city centre. God knows what I would have done. 'I have been on antidepressants since and I'm scared to get a taxi now. It has really dented my confidence. 'He just kept saying ""no, no, no"" even though I told him it was illegal. He was very rude and just drove off.' Ahmad, from  Birmingham, has since been sacked by taxi firm and now faces losing his license.

"A Labor politician has been forced to reveal how he once helped the Sydney siege gunman plea for access to his children on Father’s Day. NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson signed a letter to the Department of Family and Community Services on behalf of Man Haron Monis, a constituent in his western Sydney Blacktown electorate, in 2011. Last week, Monis kept 18 terrified people hostage – shooting two dead – during a 16-hour siege in the Lindt café in Sydney’s Martin Place. Mr Robertson has admitted to having assisted Monis when he was seeking visitation rights for his two children from his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal. Scroll down for video . NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson (left) sent and signed a letter to the Department of Family and Community Services on behalf of Man Haron Monis (right) ‘He met with staff in my Blacktown electorate office on one occasion regarding a family custody matter in August 2011. He was seeking a supervised visit with his children on Father’s Day,’ Mr Robertson said. The politician helped despite the fact Monis had sent abusive letters to the families of dead Australian soldiers between 2007 and 2009. He was convicted of sending the letters in 2013, and was also charged last year with 50 sexual offences, including aggravated sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault and inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. Monis painted the breasts and bodies of women with water, massaged their breasts and rubbed his genitals against them and raped them in 'spiritual healing' sessions all over Sydney going back 13 years, the documents allege. The 50-year-old committed the sexual offences against women at his Spiritual Consultation business in the Sydney suburbs of Burwood, Liverpool, Westmead and Belmore between September 2001 and September this year, according to the documents. Monis met his second-wife Pal in 2003 while he was working as a ‘psychic’. Ms Pal split with Monis – the father of her two children - in June 2011 after becoming increasingly disturbed by his aggressive and arrogant behaviour. Monis kept 18 terrified people hostage during a 16-hour siege in the Lindt café in Sydney’s Martin Place . Monis  was seeking visitation rights for his two children from his ex-wife Noleen Hayson Pal (pictured) Shortly afterwards, Ms Pal told Campbelltown Court: ‘He's always saying to me that people are watching, people are hearing our conversations, especially when he started getting more into his Islamic activities, running the websites.' 'Today I have forwarded a constituent file regarding Man Haron Monis to the Joint Commonwealth and New South Wales Review into the Martin Place siege. He met with staff in my Blacktown electorate office on one occasion regarding a family custody matter in August 2011. He was seeking a supervised visit with his children on Father’s Day. Man Monis was a resident in the Blacktown electorate and his request was forwarded in a routine manner to the Department of Family and Community Services. The letter included all relevant information, including that he was subject to an AVO and there were ongoing family court proceedings. The request was refused by the Department in September 2011 and their response was forwarded to Man Monis. My office subsequently received anonymous emails relating to Man Monis and his matter. Staff promptly reported these matters to the NSW Police. I have forwarded these records to the Joint Inquiry to assist their work in completing a thorough review of all government interactions relating to Man Monis. It is important that we learn from this terrible tragedy and the NSW Opposition supports the work of the Joint Inquiry as part of this process.' She said he came and went 'randomly, whenever he pleased' until finally, on June 18, 2011, she told him to take all his things and not come over again. 'He was shocked, surprised and said ""Are you sure?"". I did see his face change. He became, like angry. 'I was worried he could just attack me, like become violent in that moment.' Monis's third wife Amirah Droudis appeared outside court on Monday for a bail hearing after being charged with the murder of Ms Pal . Ms Pal was found dead, following a brutal attack after she was lured to the Werrington apartment where Monis was living in western Sydney on a Sunday afternoon, April 2, 2013. Attacked in the stairwell by a 'woman in a black cape', Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times, doused with accelerant and then set alight as horrified neighbours watched on. In October last year, Monis was charged with accessory before and after the fact of Ms Pal's murder and his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis was charged with murder. On December 12, both were released on bail to await trial. Droudis, 35, faced Downing Centre Local Court on Monday as prosecutors attempted to revoke her bail.

The daughter of former Olympian Lisa Curry and former Ironman Grant Kenny, was caught driving while more than four times over the legal alcohol level, a court has heard. Jaimi Lee Kenny was found to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.23 per cent when she was stopped by police on the Sunshine Motorway at Mountain Creek on November 29. The 27-year-old appeared at Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Thursday, where she was fined $1200 and disqualified from holding or obtaining a license for 11 months, The Courier Mail reports. The sentence is likely to impact on Ms Kenny's job, according to her lawyer Chelsea Emery, which involves privately taking care of and driving around children. Ms Kenny told police that she had been drinking since 8:30 that morning, Prosecutor Sergeant Leonie Scott said. 'The defendant further stated she wasn't sure but she drank up to 16 stubbies of Strongbow cider,' Ms Scott said, according to The Courier Mail. The daughter of former Olympian Lisa Curry (left) and former Ironman Grant Kenny (centre) told police that she had been drinking since 8.30am and could have drank 'up to 16 stubbies' of cider prior to be pulled over .

Ms Emery told the court that Ms Kenny had suffered from anxiety since the age of 14 and had contacted her psychiatrist prior to being stopped by police. She said that Ms Kenny had begun drinking to 'self-medicate' when a relationship of hers failed two years ago.

"Currency trader Joe Lewis, 59 (pictured), is under investigation after almost £128million reportedly disappeared from the accounts of his clients . A currency trader who is being investigated by police over fraud claims has vanished along with almost £130million of investors' cash, it has emerged. Joe Lewis, 59, is under investigation after the money reportedly disappeared from the accounts of his clients, who are said to include a host of wealthy British investors including professional footballers and golfers. The whereabouts of Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul, is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city. In an email sent to investors nearly two weeks ago, Lewis apparently admitted that his company – JL Trading – had not been running since 2009 after suffering 'substantial' losses. In the email dated December 3, he apparently confessed that he had continued taking his clients' money for five years in an attempt to turn around his fortunes following losses on foreign exchange deals. According to The Telegraph, he wrote: 'Dear investor, I am writing to inform you that JL Trading is ceasing to carry on business. Contrary to the impression that I have hitherto given, the business has lost almost all of its assets, and there appears no prospect of those assets being recouped. 'JL Trading ceased foreign exchange trading in 2009 following substantial losses and since that time the business has suffered further losses, which I have tried to make good through investments in a number of commercial projects. 'However, it is now clear that the business will not be able to recover its losses and must cease trading. This means that, contrary to what was reported to you previously, you cannot expect any payments in the future. 'I can only apologise unreservedly for any losses or unfulfilled expectations of profit. I have tried to recover the position for a considerable period of time, but it is now clear that I will be unable to do so. 'I sincerely regret that I have not been able to do better on your behalf.' The currency trader's JL Trading website currently has a message which says it is 'no longer trading' (above) It was followed up by an email two days later, the last to be received from him, in which he blamed the comments on his legal team. He said: 'You have been sent an update this week which was worded by my lawyers, but I wanted everyone to know, I am not running away from things. While I regret some of the things I have done, I will do my best to remedy this situation. 'Please note, I have covered up my mistakes from everyone including my staff, no one else knew what was happening.' In an earlier email, sent on November 14, he also reportedly claimed his company was having a 'stressful time' releasing £126million ($197million) from American brokers. The father of two attracted investors via word of mouth and promised monthly returns of between one and three per cent, as well as luxury golf days out. Since 2011, he has reportedly insisted that investors have a minimum of £16,000 readily-available. Don Wall, a retired businessman from Cambridgeshire, claims to be owed about £100,000 by JL Trading. The 77-year-old told The Telegraph: 'This money was supposed to be savings for my children and grandchildren. I have never met the bloke and I don't think I have ever spoken to him.' He invested £10,000 in 2009 before withdrawing £7,000 and later pumping a further £100,000 into the fund. He has now reported Lewis to police. Mark Bavin, who introduced Mr Wall and others to the scheme, has also reported Lewis. Mr Bavin said he was 'sure it was a massive fraud' and claims to be owed 'significant' sums by Lewis. The whereabouts of Joe Lewis, who traded from a luxury apartment overlooking the Bosphorus in Istanbul (pictured), is currently unknown after he apparently fled the Turkish city. He has not been heard from since . Other alleged victims claim to have started legal proceedings against Lewis, which has apparently led to his bank accounts and assets being frozen. Lewis was unavailable for comment when approached by The Telegraph but his son told the newspaper: 'I don't know where the money's gone. I am happy to share information with the legal entities. 'Everything he had is ruined. There are no assets at all that I am aware of.' Forex Fraud, an organisation set up to help prevent Forex scam and commodity fraud, said it 'advises caution' on using the broker, who operates under the name of Joe Lewis Trading. The JL Trading website is currently withdrawn and a message has replaced the homepage informing visitors that the firm is 'no longer trading'. MailOnline has contacted JL Trading for comment.

"A vaccine against the human form of mad cow disease could be a step closer after scientists immunised deer against a similar illness. The researchers say their breakthrough in the fight against chronic wasting disease (CWE), which affects captive deer across the U.S., could have wide implications for the medical world. CWE and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has killed 177 Britons since 1995, are both fatal brain conditions which are thought to be caused by dangerous proteins known as prions. Vaccine: An innoculation against the human form of mad cow disease could be a step closer after scientists immunised deer against a similar illness. Pictured, a false colour brain scan of a human patient with CJD . Prions convert healthy proteins into a disease state which then affects the brain, causing a loss of balance, dementia and muscle twitching before vCJD patients die. Led by experts at New York University's Langone Medical Centre, the team gave their experimental vaccine to five deer which were then exposed to prion-infected brain tissue. They were housed together and monitored daily for signs of illness, including having biopsies taken of their tonsils and gut, while being given eight boosters over 11 months. Eventually the deer started producing antibodies against the disease which could be detected in their saliva, blood and faeces, according to the study in the journal Vaccine. Although four of the deer still developed the infection, it took 'significantly longer' than for a control group of six deer who were given a placebo. The fifth deer which was given the vaccine remains infection-free, the scientists added. To prepare the vaccine, the researchers inserted a prion-like protein into the genome of a neutralised salmonella bacterium. Experimental: Five deer produced antibodies against CWE, a similar illness, after being given the vaccine . The salmonella was then induced to produce an immune response in the gut, producing anti-prion antibodies. They now claim their breakthrough could have two major implications. The first would be to prevent CWE among captive deer in the U.S., where the disease also affects wild deer, elk, caribou and moose. Vaccinating just a tenth of each herd could induce 'herd immunity' despite the disease being known to affect every animal where it breaks out, the researchers said. The second implication - described as 'equally important' - would be to prevent human vCJD, where the vast majority of cases were recorded in Britain in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Professor Thomas Wisniewski, one of the study's leaders, said: 'Now that we have found that preventing prion infection is possible in animals, it's likely feasible in humans as well'. Associate professor Fernando Goni added: 'Although our anti-prion vaccine experiments have so far been successful on mice and deer, we predict that the method and concept could become a widespread technique for not only preventing, but potentially treating many prion diseases.' Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease, broke out across Britain two decades ago and is believed to have led to the UK's 177 fatal cases of vCJD. At its peak in 2000, 28 Britons died of the disease after eating beef products contaminated with brain or nervous tissue from cows infected with BSE. After BSE was contained within cattle the number of human infections began to drop, and just one Briton has died of vCJD since the start of 2012.","Five deer immunised against chronic wasting disease (CWE) for first time .

"Australia's iconic beaches have always been a source of fascination for surf photographers, and one native has made it his mission to find moments of perfection in Sydney's water no matter what it takes. Shey Ivanov, 32, spends hours in the water every day in an attempt to capture elusive moments of beauty, often heading into the water after a long day at work just as other photographers are leaving. Having gained a name for himself posting his stunning images on Instagram, Shey said that the responses he gets from his followers makes his efforts all worth while. Scroll down for video . Curl Curl native Shey Ivanov captures waves as they crash onto the shores of Sydney beaches: this image was captured during a lightning storm that Shey 'had to be out in' 'I want to capture a moment, a microsecond of perfection, that might come out of hours of shooting,' Shey told Daily Mail Australia. Working Monday to Friday as a picture framer 'to pay the bills', Shey has what he calls a 'full time hobby' in his water photography, building up a fan base on social media and his website. His images, shot from the water using a Digital SLR Canon 5D Mark 3 in waterproof housing, capture moments of tranquility which Shey hopes will inspire positivity in people. Growing up in Byron Bay, Shey said that he was 'basically born on the beach', and that it was inevitable that he would end up back in the water for his driving passion. 'I always knew I'd end up back there, but Byron offered very little options- it tended to chew you up or spit you out, so I needed to get out of there.' After being inspired during his final school years by his sister's dabble with photography, Shey said he picked up a camera and never looked back. Relocating at the age of 21 to Curl Curl in Sydney's North Shore, Shey said he considers himself lucky to be able to live and work right near 'the best beach in Australia'. His images are shot from the water using a Digital SLR Canon 5D Mark 3 in waterproof housing . Shey said he tries to capture moments of tranquility which he hopes will inspire positivity in people . Shey was born in Byron Bay and became inspired to pick up a camera by his older sister during his HSC . While he admits that his style has changed over the past five years, Shey said the most significant change in his photography has been his ability to take pictures in any light. 'I use two flashes, which sets me apart from other people. I can be out in the almost dark and capture the rich colours of sunset, heading in to the water when other photographers are heading back on to the beach,' he said, . This persistence and spirit of determination has seen Shey capture some of the most unique and striking images of his career. 'You can go out in the worst conditions with grey skies, and can come back with gold- I'm in the water every afternoon for so many hours but I'm happy if I come out with one photo I love.' 'My goal is to find pieces that everyone can relate to, whether they're an 80-year-old surfer or a 15-year-old out West.' 'As a surfer, waves are a big thing for me, but I've been moving towards capturing tranquility shots, ones that allow people to lose themselves in the photo and make them feel like they're there.' Spending hours in the water in pursuit of these shots has meant that Shey has seen his fair share of strange and beautiful sights. In 2012 Shey was out in the water taking photographs when he saw a 15 metre whale swimming right by him . While he admits that his style has changed over the past five years, Shey said the most significant change in his photography has been his ability to take pictures in any light . Spending hours in the water in pursuit of these shots has meant that Shey has seen his fair share of strange and beautiful sights . In 2012 Shey was out in the water taking photographs when he saw a 15 metre whale swimming right by him. 'I swam over, and he was sitting there, just floating around,' Shey said. 'I started taking photos, it was just unbelievable,' he said. While he hopes he hasn't had a run-in with any ocean predators, Shey said that he's kicked things out in the water 'that you just pray aren't sharks'. One of his favourite images was captured during the lightning strikes which hailed down on Sydney earlier in the month. Shey saw an evening storm start to roll in, complete with thunder and lightning, and knew he 'just had to be out there'. 'I was in the water taking photos and got the shot, and decided to stay in for a bit longer. One big bolt of lightning hit the water right next to me and I decided to get out,' Shey said. 'Being 6ft 6 I was the tallest landmark on the beach and could feel the electric shocks zapping my neck from my wetsuit zipper,' 'I got down low and bolted, out of breath and almost collapsing as I reached the surf club. I don't know if it was the friction building up from me running in a rubber wetsuit or how close I actually came to being struck but that was close enough for me!' Working Monday to Friday as a picture framer 'to pay the bills', Shey has what he calls a 'full time hobby' in his water photography, building up a fan base on social media and his website . Shey's dog Kyza, who he said is 'a nutter, but pretty much the best thing in my life', is a 4-year-old American Staffy cross Australian cattle. This image was taken in a lagoon near the North Curl Curl walking track . 'I think it's important to strive every day to be happy; life is a rollercoaster so enjoy it,' Shey said . Despite the scare, he said that the feedback he received on his Instagram made it all worth while. 'Getting comments from people who are stocked with my photos just makes my day,' Shey said. 'I think it's important to strive every day to be happy; life is a rollercoaster so enjoy it while you're on it,' he said. 'I have a tattoo across my ribs that says 'enjoy the journey', and seeking the positive, and sharing that with other people is all part of that.' For aspiring surf photographers, Shey said that keeping an open mind and being willing to take a chance is one of the biggest elements in finding 'gold'. 'One of the most important things I've learnt is that you can't wait for the perfect conditions to present themselves- go out and have an adventure, because you never know what you're going to get.' Accounts on Instagram which he uses for inspiration are other surf photographers, such as Warren Keelan, a photographer from Wollongong, and Willem Ungerman, from the Gold Coast. Shey is also a big fan of Clarke Liddle, a surf photographer from Hawaii, but he said that 'everyone in the world has been inspired by him at some point.' 'Living in Hawaii, with crystal clear water and everything sitting in his backyard, he's one of a kind.' 'Anything that makes you happy should be your inspiration,' Shey said.

"One of the four Sydney bothers, who are believed to have flown to Syria to fight alongside the Islamic State, spent thousands of dollars on a future honeymoon and new furniture before he went missing. Bassima and Issam El Baf, the parents of Taha, Hamza, Bilal and Omar from Yagoona in Western Sydney, have released an image of their four sons in an effort to locate them, and written to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to plead for assistance in finding them. Omar El Baf, who planned to marry and move in with his fiancé, paid $13,000 for his future honeymoon only a couple of days before he vanished in November, The Daily Telegraph reports. He also paid a deposit for furniture for their future home. Scroll down for video . Bassima (centre) and Issam El Baf, the parents of (from L to R) Taha, Hamza, Bilal and Omar from Yagoona in Western Sydney, have released an image of their four sons in an effort to locate them . The four men, aged between 17 and 28, told their parents they were taking a holiday in Thailand after winning their tickets in a competition, before revealing via text message that they had arrived in Syria. Before they were due to come home last month, the parents received a text stating: 'We made it to Bilad al-Sham, we will see you in paradise'. Bilad al-Sham is a region in Syria. Despite the text, the parents went to the airport to pick up their sons but they never arrived. They now fear their boys have been lured into the clutches of the IS terrorist organisation. Bassima (left) and Issam El Baf (right) - the parents of four brothers from Sydney's south-west who left Australia to fight in Syria . Their father Issam El Baf said he hadn't heard anything since receiving the haunting text. 'It's bad, very bad,' he said. 'It's very frustrating. We haven't heard anything for three weeks.' Authorities tracked the sons down in Turkey after the family alerted them but it is believed they have since crossed the border into Syria. Unlike some before them, the siblings were 'clean-skins' and had not been on any watch-lists that would have alerted immigration controls. In a statement last month, their mother pleaded with them to come home. 'My sons, you are dear to us. You are good at heart. You have done nothing wrong. 'Come back. We love you.' Taha El Baf, 17, from Yagoona, and his three older brothers flew to Syria to join the Islamic State last month . The 17-year-old also appeared in a school anti-bullying video which was posted to YouTube last year . Last month, leading Islamic community leader Dr Jamal Rifi told radio station2UE: 'The family is distraught, their main concern is to initiate contact, the concern are not concerned how they were radicalised but that they want them to come back. Dr Jamal Rifi said the brothers had not responded to messages and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS . Dr Rifi said the family was trying to get messages to the brothers but they had not responded and had probably had their mobile phones confiscated by IS. He explained the family had given all the information to the authorities who were trying to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. Their mother is of Lebanese descent and their father is a taxi driver, they also have another brother and sister living at home. Dr Rifi added they were 'simple boys' who could not organise trip properly, and he revealed they had missed the first flight they had booked and had to re-book one for the next day. He said: 'They have no life experience. They (the parents) had no idea what their kids were planning such a move, these are ordinary kids who live at home, they showed no sign of radicalisation.' The fifth son went to meet a flight that was coming in from Thailand last month, hoping it was a joke. Dr Rifi said the family had alerted the authorities to the brothers' departure and it was now up to them to 'put the pieces of the puzzle together'. More Australians have slipped through the cracks and fled overseas to join the fight with Islamic State . It emerged on Saturday authorities had tracked the brothers - who lived in south-west Sydney - as far as Turkey and alerted the family last week. Australian Federal Police commissioner Neil Gaughan told a parliamentary committee that the group of four that managed to leave the country this week were 'not on anyone's radar',The Guardian reported. 'We got wind of it after the fact, but the fact is there are still people travelling,' said Gaughan, the national manager of counter-terrorism for the Australian Federal Police,' he said.","Four brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to fight in Syria .

"Theresa May has been warned that a feud between the Home Office and Downing Street is damaging her chances of succeeding David Cameron . Theresa May has been given an extraordinary warning that a toxic feud between the Home Office and Downing Street is damaging her chances of succeeding David Cameron as Tory leader. A senior party source said support for the steely Home Secretary as the Prime Minister’s successor was being ‘seriously undermined’ by a row that has led to two of her senior advisers’ bids to become MPs at the general election being scuppered by Tory HQ and Downing Street. ‘How can Theresa not see that having her advisers running around behaving badly is harming the support she will need from a bunch of Cabinet ministers if she does go for the leadership?’ the source said. Last week it emerged David Cameron personally approved the suspension of Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson from the approved list of Tory candidates, ostensibly because they refused to campaign in the Rochester by-election because they believed it would breach civil service rules. Mrs May is understood to have been told there is ‘absolutely no chance’ of her two advisers being reinstated as candidates in time to run as candidates next May. Tory chairman Grant Shapps insists civil service rules were changed to allow special advisers to take part in telephone canvassing and Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson were simply being ‘awkward’ by declining to take part. However, the move against them came after Mr Timothy was linked to criticism of Mr Cameron in a magazine profile of Mrs May. Number Ten is known to be exasperated by speculation about the Home Secretary’s leadership ambitions and her camp’s criticism of what they see as as incompetence in the Prime Minister’s political operation. Veteran former Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, who clashed with Mrs May when they were in Cabinet together, praised her as one of the most impressive figures in the Government and called for an end to the ‘spat’ that has exploded into the open. ‘It’s quite entertainingly newsworthy but somebody should stop all their entourages falling out with each other,’ Mr Clarke told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. ‘The relations between the people themselves are good. Theresa is one of the strongest ministers in the government. Any prime minister – and David is very sensible about this – accepts he wants strong ministers at the top of his government. The entourage seem to be having a little spat between themselves.’ David Cameron personally approved the suspension of Nick Timothy (right) and Stephen Parkinson (left) from the approved list of Tory candidates because they refused to campaign in the Rochester by-election . Number Ten is said to be fed up of criticism of what they see as as incompetence in David Cameron's political operation from May's camp . Chancellor George Osborne is said to have been concerned by a surge in support for Mrs May among party activists, among whom she is now the clear favourite to succeed Mr Cameron, though sources insisted he had played no role in the suspension of Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson. One of the Home Secretary’s supporters was yesterday quoted as saying: ‘Osborne is obsessed with having spies everywhere so he can either succeed Cameron or be kingmaker. Theresa has every right to protect her own interests. ‘That is not disloyalty and she will not be intimidated by anyone in Downing Street.’ Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries said: ‘The man pulling the strings is Osborne, not Cameron. ‘Osborne is desperate to ensure he has enough MPs in place to vote him on to the shortlist of two, which is put before members to choose the next leader, should there be a contest in 2015. Those two are likely to be Boris Johnson and Theresa May.’ She added: ‘If Nick and Stephen become MPs that is two more votes for Theresa and two fewer for George. Theresa has had a lot to put up with. The more popular she is among party members, the nastier it becomes in Westminster.’ Mrs May has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to Mr Cameron and personal relations between the two remain reasonable, though she has never been part of his inner circle. However, the Home Secretary, dubbed ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by allies, is thought to regard Mr Johnson as a ‘faintly ridiculous’ figure and would run against him if the Tories lose in May and Mr Cameron is forced to quit.","May warned row with Number Ten harming her chances of Tory leadership .

"A rock singer who claimed that he was forced to quit his day job after a female colleague sexually harassed him by slapping his bottom and sending him lewd texts has lost his sexual discrimination case. Tom Ford, 31, said Lucy Myers constantly complimented his looks, gave him gifts and bought cooked food into work for him to win his affection. But when he rejected her advances, the 34-year-old American became hostile, he claimed, sending rude messages and criticising his glamour-model girlfriend. Scroll down for video . Claims: Tom Ford, left, said Lucy Myers, right, constantly complimented his looks, gave him gifts and bought cooked food into work for him to win his affection while they were both employed by a furniture company . Mr Ford and Miss Myers, from Highmoor, Oxfordshire, worked together at a bespoke furniture company in the upmarket village of Rotherfield Greys, South Oxfordshire. It is where Mr Ford worked when he was not playing with his rock band, Motherload. He is the band's lead singer and has played gigs in Europe and around the UK. He told the employment tribunal that he repeatedly complained to David Gibbon, his boss at the Good Shelf Company, but was rebuffed for being ‘over-sensitive’. He said he had no choice but to resign and attempted to sue the company for sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal and constructive dismissal. The tribunal, in Reading, was told the problems began soon after Mr Ford, from Henley, began working at the company. Miss Myers described his girlfriend Sarah-Jayne Whiteley as ‘Barbie’ and a ‘bimbo’ and said she had fake breasts, he said. Front man: Mr Ford has played across Europe as the lead singer of his band Motherload. He told the  tribunal that he repeatedly complained to David Gibbon, his boss at the company about Miss Myers' behaviour . Couple: Mr Ford claims Miss Myers would make derogatory comments about his glamour model girlfriend of five years, Sarah-Jayne Whiteley (pictured with him), describing her as a 'barbie', 'bimbo' and 'fake t**s' She would repeatedly slap his buttocks and on occasions brush her breasts against him, he said, adding that she seemed to enjoy making him feel uncomfortable. 'Lucy would brush past me whilst in my area, pushing her breasts against me. I told her not to touch me and to be strictly professional,’ Mr Ford told the tribunal. Mr Ford claimed Miss Myers began bringing him hair care products as gifts and even put a plate of food on his car seat in an attempt to win his affection. The day before she was due to leave for a new job last October, they met for a drink to try to sort out their problems. Mr Ford said Miss Myers admitted she had feelings for him but they ended the evening on good terms. Uncomfortable: Miss Myers would repeatedly slap Mr Ford's buttocks and on occasions brush her breasts against him, he said, adding that she seemed to enjoy his discomfort. Above, his girlfriend Miss Whiteley . After ending that evening on good terms and exchanging text messages in which Mr Ford said he had a good time, Mr Ford said Miss Myers launched a tirade of verbal abuse at him on her last day at the company. 'She stated I was a real piece of s***, a c*** and that I needed to get over myself,' he said. A few weeks later she returned to the company as a general manager. Mr Ford said he suspected Miss Myers and Mr Gibbon were having an affair after spotting her hand-feeding him chocolates in the office. Boss: Company owner Mr Gibbon, pictured today, said that he was glad 'commonsense had prevailed' He claimed he was demoted to packing the furniture, rather than building it. On December 13, he was accused by Mr Gibbon of being late and having too much time off, both of which were ‘fabricated’, he said. On December 28, Mr Ford was told in an email from Mr Gibbon that he would not be needed to work in January. He immediately sent in his resignation. But Jack Mitchell, representing Mr Gibbon, said Mr Ford enjoyed female attention. He said Miss Myers may have inadvertently brushed against him in the cramped workshop but did not do so on purpose. Mr Ford made no mention to Mr Gibbon of being harassed, he said. He had joined in the flirting with Miss Myers when the pair first worked together and they had engaged in playful ‘high jinks’. Mr Gibbon told the hearing that Mr Ford’s attitude and effort at work deteriorated to the point where he had to be made redundant. Miss Myers, from Highmoor, near Henley, said she had been 'shocked and disgusted to discover the vulgar allegations' made by Mr Ford after he left the furniture company. Mr Ford's claims, made at an employment tribunal in Reading, have been dismissed by a judge who reserved his judgement until providing a written ruling. Speaking following the judgement, company owner Mr Gibbon said: 'We're just glad that the matter has been brought to an end and that commonsense has prevailed. 'We have got a really good team and now we can concentrate on taking the business forward.'","Tom Ford, 31, lost sexual discrimination case against furniture company .

"The Pope showed he has a sense of humour as well as a caring side today when he donned a red nose at the wedding of members of a charity that uses clowns to cheer up children. Pope Francis appeared at the Vatican to congratulate the newlyweds from the Rainbow Association Marco Iagulli Onlus who were getting married there. As the pair came down the steps, he took the opportunity to show his support for the charity by donning the universal symbol of comedy. Who nose what he'lll do next? Pope Francis dons a red nose to surprise two newlyweds who are volunteers with the Rainbow Association Marco Lagulli Onlus, a charity that offers clown therapy to sick children . Francis is fast becoming well known for his informal manner, which has landed him in situations that would have been unthinkable to his predecessors. He has posed opened an account on the popular photo-sharing site Instagram, posed for selfies with worshippers after mass and, just seven days ago, barely batted an eyelid when a youngster leapt on stage at the Vatican. Apparently unperturbed by the huge audience, the boy happily stood next to Pope Francis on the stage in St Peter's Square and then hugged his leg. Cool as a cucumber, the Pontiff responded by patting him on the head and carrying on with his speech. Unthinkable to his predecessors: The moment last week that a young boy ran onto the stage in St Peter's Square and hugged Pope Francis's leg as he made a speech . Buenos Aires-born Pope Francis began his papacy in March this year after the shock resignation of Pope Benedict XVI who resigned a month earlier. He has apparently set about making the Catholic church more relevant to the modern era, asking questions of centuries-old doctrines like the celibacy of priests, opposition to homosexuality and contraception, and the secondary position of women in the church. In a series of breaks with protocol, he has telephoned worshippers who have left him letters, established Vatican sports teams, donated money to hard up pensioners and offered personally to baptise the child of a woman who had refused her partner's demands she have an abortion. Last month he again showcased his lively sense of humour when he stopped the Popemobile to try on a firefighter's helmet in front of a Vatican crowd. Trying it on for size: Pope Francis wears a . firefighter's helmet as he arrives to lead his general . audience in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican last month .

It also offers economic and practical support for their families. Its website says: 'The association was founded with the aim to provide support, both moral, psychological and economic (where possible) to the families whose children are suffering from the cancer. 'The weekly trips, specialist visits, medical advice and hotels stays for the parents of patients involve troubles and expenses. 'The happy life of a child who just want to play, go to school or do what any child of that age would do, together with the life of the family, are rudely interrupted and often destroyed through an ordeal endless and excruciating. 'And it is at this precise moment that our association tries to help out.'","Pope Francis donned the universal symbol of comedy in the Vatican .

"Why weather the bone-chilling rocky surface of Mars when you could call the clouds of Venus' earth-like upper atmosphere home? That's the question posed by a NASA project that envisions a future where humans might live in solar-powered airships 31 miles above Earth's nearest neighbor. Dubbed the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) the project would first send a robotic scout to gauge the lay of the land (or clouds) followed by a 30-day manned mission in a zeppelin-style helium ship. Scroll down for video... A furture in the clouds? A Venus exploration mission envisioned by NASA sees a future in which a permanent human habitat could float in the clouds above Earth's fiery neighbor . One day, a 'city' comprised of multiple space zeppelins would hover above Venus at a sweet spot where temperatures are around 167 degrees, according to IEEE.com. That may sound hot, but at only 17 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than Earth's highest recorded temperature it's downright cozy compared to the -81F chills on the surface of Mars. That's at 30 miles above Venus only, of course. Thanks to a greenhouse gas heavy atmosphere, Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system with surface temperatures reaching 863F. Dale Arney, whose helped dream up the idea with Chris Jones at NASA's Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate at Langley Research Center in Virginia, told IEEE: . 'The vast majority of people, when they hear the idea of going to Venus and exploring, think of the surface, where it's hot enough to melt lead and the pressure is the same as if you were almost a mile underneath the ocean . Earth-like: The ambitious project would take a spacecraft carrying folded up helium airships (right) to the planet where surface temperatures reach nearly 900F. However, at 31 miles above Venus, scientists say the conditions are far more Earth-like . Easuer than Mars? Scientists at NASA say that in some ways a 'landing' in the atmosphere of Venus would be easier than a surface landing on Mars . Nearest neighbor: A manned mission could place two astronauts above he Venusian surface for 30-days after a 110-day trip to Earth's nearest neighbor . 'I think that not many people have gone and looked at the relatively much more hospitable atmosphere and how you might tackle operating there for a while.' Once implemented, HAVOC would begin with an unmanned mission to Venus in which a 100-foot-long robotic solar-powered helium airship would test the waters, so to speak, in the planet's atmosphere. A gondola beneath would contain instruments with which to take measurements of temperature and other factors in preparation for a manned mission. If given the go-ahead, that manned mission would take two brave souls on a 110-day trip to Venus. They would spend a month inside a habitat in a gondola below the airship. At the end of the 30-day mission, the astronauts would ascend back through the atmosphere in a vehicle brought with them for that purpose. The trip back would take 300 days, putting the astronauts back on Earth after 440 days. A very optimistic mission to Mars--which is 33.9 million miles from Earth at its closest versus 25 million for Venus--would have astronauts in space a minimum of 500 days for a stay of the same length. ‘Traditionally, say if you’re going to Mars, you talk about “entry, descent, and landing,” or EDL,’ said NASA's Dale Arney. 'Obviously, in our case, ‘landing’ would represent a significant failure of the mission, so instead we have ‘entry, descent, and inflation,’ or EDI.’ And that's no easy task. Inside an ‘aeroshell’ the astronauts would enter Venus’ atmosphere at 4,500 miles per second. The aeroshell would decelerate to 450 meters per second and deploy a parachute. The shell would then fall away, revealing the airship, which would unfurl and inflate while gently positioning itself at 31 miles above the fiery Venusian surface. The next step would be a year-long mission to Venus' atmosphere and then, in the more distant future, a permanent human settlement comprised of a floating city of airships. Jones says the atmosphere above Venus is 'probably the most Earth-like environment that’s out there' and says its protection from the sun's radiation makes it almost preferable to Mars, which gets 40 times the amount of radiation as Earth. In the Venus atmosphere, Jones says, you'd be exposed to 'about the same as if you were in Canada.' For all the obstacles involved in a plan to get to Venus, stay a while and then return, Jones says it might actually be more practical than a trip to Mars. 'Venus has value as a destination in and of itself for exploration and colonization, . 'There are things that you would need to do for a Mars mission, but we see a little easier path through Venus.' Hwo to bet back: At the end of their mission, the astronauts would ascend back into space in an aircraft they brought along for that purpose .","The High Altitude Venus Operational Concept program would eventually send a manned mission to the atmosphere of Venus .
Around 30 miles above the surface, Venus has temperatures and atmospheric pressure reminiscent of Earth's .
A robot would first be sent to the Venus' atmosphere to test the waters -- a two-manned vehicle would follow .

"An anonymous call to the Australian National Security hotline about gunman Man Haron Monis did not expose his deadly plan, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said. The tip-off was followed up, but Mr Abbott says it didn't reveal the imminent Sydney siege attack. 'The information provided didn't expose any threats of direct violence by the Martin Place murderer,' he told reporters. 'It was followed up, it was really followed up.' Scroll down for video . Prime Minister Tony Abbott has insisted that the tip-off to the Australian National Security hotline about gunman Man Haron Monis was followed up and 'didn't expose any threats of direct violence' The comments come after claims ASIO was forewarned about the self-styled sheikh's extremism by an anonymous caller, just two days before the Lindt Café Siege which rocked the nation. Australia's Intelligence Organisation revealed the call advised them to 'take a look at this man's website', but did not suggest Monis was planning a terrorist attack, had a weapon or that he planned to take any hostages. The prime minister said a joint review between the federal and NSW governments will go through the siege events to determine what happened before, during and afterwards. NSW Premier Mike Baird said the review was aimed at ensuring such a tragedy does not recur. The premier did not comment on ASIO's involvement and put the blame solely on Monis. 'It is something that all of us have a heavy heart over but we have to go through this because we need to ensure every measure is taken to ensure it doesn't happen again,' Mr Baird told reporters. 'But I will say, there is one person who is responsible for the actions that happened in the past week and we know who he is. He came with an intent to divide this city but what he has done is united the city.' Just days before the Lindt Café Siege which rocked the nation, an anonymous caller rang the Australian National Security hotline to alert authorities about Man Haron Monis . It was reported that ASIO examined Monis's website as result of the phone call, which features rambling posts about terrorism fuelled protests in Martin Place,reports the Daily Telegraph. Monis had numerous social media websites, including a Twitter and Facebook account-the latter of which had 14,000 'likes'-which he used to preach extremist jihadist views. It comes after the revelation that Monis may have initially planned to attack the offices of Channel Seven in a terrorist attack. In 2009, Channel Seven's Today Tonight show exposed Monis for sending abusive 'condolence' letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. The program, which labelled Monis a 'Fake Sheik', led to his and his wife Amirah Droudis' conviction in the High Court over the letters. On several occasions after the program aired, Monis protested on the steps outside the Seven Studio with pro-Islamic leaflets. In the early hours of Monday morning, it's understood the gunman walked around Martin Place before entering the Lindt Cafe and sitting for up to an hour before taking customers and staff hostage. Australia's Intelligence Organisation has revealed they received a call within 48 hours of the deadly siege, advising them to 'take a look at this man's website' One of Monis' former lawyers encountered the man in the cafe by chance on Monday morning and described his behaviour as distinctively calm. 'He was cool as a cucumber, not agitated, not scoping the place out, not looking over his shoulder,' said the lawyer. 'He kept asking, 'Why are you here?'. I think he was genuinely surprised to see me there.' The evidence comes after reports that the siege gunman told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week. Man Haron Monis also wrote letters to Qantas's chief executive in 2009 suggesting he had information about sabotage at the airline that would lead to mass casualties. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has launched a major investigation into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list  despite numerous examples of extremist views and behaviour, reports Sydney Morning Herald. Man Haron Monis told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week . The scenes after the shootout that resulted from a 17 hour siege that saw Monis seize control of a busy café in Martin Place and hold staff and patrons hostage for almost 17 hours . In one post on his website, Monis writes about a meeting he allegedly had with New South Wales police in 2008 in which he claims one of the detectives asked him about a protest outside the Seven Network studios in Martin Place against the way the network's program Sunrise had reported a terrorist attack overseas. The protest was carried out by Monis' wife, Amirah Doudis. According to the post, Monis was asked by police if he planned further protests in Martin Place, to which he replied: 'Well, it depends if the Australian government condemns the terrorist comment which was broadcast by Sunrise (then) I don't have to continue but if the Attorney-General doesn't condemn Channel 7 for its terrorist act I believe it is my religious duty to continue.' He wrote that he also told police during the discussion: 'If our fair defence against your unfair attack is called terrorism, we are proud to be called terrorists.' The Seven studio is immediately opposite the Lindt café on Martin Place that Monis raided this week. Siege victim Tori Johnson (left) and Katrina Dawson (right), who died in the shootout that resulted from the 17 hour incident . The revelations comes as a major investigation called by Prime Minister Tony Abbott gets underway into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list in 2009 . A separate post in August 2008 revealed Monis' writings to then-Qantas chief executive office Geoff Dixon. Monis wrote to Mr Dixon: 'I have sent you a letter warning dated July 28 about upcoming technical problems which will be caused deliberately by some people within Qantas... if you do not take my warning seriously Qantas will witness similar technical problems. .. if you keep ignoring my offer for sharing information you will be responsible for the death or injury of people...' Qantas reportedly referred Monis' letters to Australian Federal Police at the time. Monis was also on bail for a long list of charges, including sexual offences, conspiracy to murder his ex-wife and a series of abhorrent letters. In September 2013, Monis was sentenced to 300 hours community service for a series of letters he sent to the families of seven Australian soldiers killed between 2007 and 2009. Amirah Droudis, the wife of the café gunman, is pictured in these photographs with her former partner. Monis was on bail on a charge of conspiring Ms Droudis to murder Noleen Hayson Pal . In the letters, Monis likened soldiers to murderers and killers, and in one letter said the man was going to hell. Monis was also on bail on a charge of conspiring with his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, who is allegedly a Muslim convert, to murder Noleen Hayson Pal. Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis. Monis and Amirah Droudis were arrested on November 15 last year and charged. Monis also had outstanding charges over allegations of indecent and sexual assault relating to his career as 'a spiritual healer'. He was due in court due in court in February next year for the sexual assault charges, which included 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault against seven women, including one 27-year-old who answered his ads placed in ethnic Sydney newspapers. Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis (pictured) Speaking to ABC, Prime Minister Tony Abbott questioned  why Moni- who was well known to both federal police and ASIO - was not on any counter-terrorism watch lists. 'These are the questions that we'll be having our officials ponder because he was a person who had been of interest to our security agencies,' Mr Abbott said. 'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored, given his history of violence, his history of mental instability, and his history of infatuation with extremism.' The Prime Minister said Monis was inadequately dealt with, and that the events of the siege should serve as a grave learning lesson. He announced an urgent review to examine why  Monis had access to firearms and why he was granted citizenship in Australia.","The Prime Minister assured that the anonymous tip-off was followed up by authorities, but didn't reveal the imminent Sydney siege attack .

"Reality TV star Jack Tweed is alleged to have harassed his ex-girlfriend, the glamour model and former Big Brother contestant Chanelle Hayes. The 27-year-old, who was left a widower when wife Jade Goody died from cancer in 2009, faces charges of assault, criminal damage and threatening behaviour with intent to cause fear of violence.

Tweed, 27, has now been charged and bailed until next month, when he will appear before Chelmsford magistrates, reports the Sun on Sunday. He denied the charges when contacted by MailOnline. Chanelle and Jack, a club promoter, have had a rocky romance and she previously claimed they both can't live with each other or without each other.

Officers were called to a branch of McDonald's in Chelmsford, Essex, at 4am on October 9 . Jade Goody and Jack Tweed: The former Big Brother contestant died from cancer in 2009, aged just 27 . The two are now no longer in contact and Chanelle then moved on to Jack, dating during her pregnancy and splitting just three weeks before son Blakeley's birth, before later reuniting. One of the reasons for their rocky romance was the grief Jack was still experiencing over his late wife Jade Goody, who died in 2009 following a cancer battle. At one point it all became too much for Chanelle who tweeted: 'Absololutely f**king sick of living up to a ghost and never coming close. What's been the point to my last three years of my life then?!' The two finally appeared to call it quits after Jack appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show last May, talking about his late wife.

"Foreign students could face being sent back to their home countries after their courses finish under  plans reportedly being considered by Theresa May . Foreign students could face being sent back to their home countries after their courses finish under hardline plans reportedly being considered by Home Secretary Theresa May. The move would mean non-European Union students would have to return home in order to apply for a work visa if they wanted to continue to live in the UK after they graduated. Mrs May wants a future Conservative government to 'move towards zero net student migration' by sending home those who come to Britain on student visas. A source close to the Home Secretary told the The Sunday Times: 'Making sure immigrants leave Britain at the end of their visa is as important a part of running a fair and efficient immigration system as controlling who comes here in the first place. 'Theresa is pressing for the next Conservative manifesto to contain a policy that will make sure that anybody coming here on a student visa will have to leave the country in order to apply for a new visa of any kind. 'She wants to make the colleges and universities that sponsor foreign students responsible for ensuring their departure. 'She wants to be able to fine colleges and universities with low departure rates and deprive the worst of them of their right to sponsor foreign students.' Under current rules, most students switch easily to a work visa from within the UK rather than have to leave the country and then come back. Mrs May has repeatedly clashed with Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable - whose department has responsibility for universities - about foreign students. Mr Cable has warned about tough rhetoric on immigration putting off students from countries including India from attending UK institutions and the Liberal Democrats would be highly unlikely to support any further tightening of the rules. A senior Lib Dem source said her plan made 'zero economic sense' and could deprive the UK of highly-skilled graduates. 'Such a blunt instrument would not get our support,' the source said. Brain drain: A senior Lib Dem source said her plan made 'zero economic sense' and could deprive the UK of highly-skilled graduates. File picture . 'The idea that you have people from abroad studying in this country and they become engineers or scientists of huge practical value to the economy, and rather than have them stay here you immediately turf them out makes zero economic sense.' Mrs May's plan emerged following a week in which her allies have been caught up in an internal party feud. The Tory hierarchy is said to have blocked attempts by allies of the Home Secretary to stand as MPs after they refused to canvass support for the Conservatives in the Rochester and Strood by-election last month. Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson declined to take part, citing the code of conduct for special advisers, which states they would have to resign if they wanted to get involved. The move to block their candidacy is seen as the latest power struggle amid claims Mrs May is gearing up for a leadership bid if David Cameron is ousted after the election. Chancellor George Osborne, another potential successor to Mr Cameron, was instrumental in the move aimed at depriving Mrs May of allies in the Commons. Struggle: Chancellor George Osborne is reportedly in a power struggle with Theresa May . Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries said: 'The man pulling the strings is Osborne, not Cameron. 'Osborne is desperate to ensure he has enough MPs in place to vote him on to the shortlist of two, which is put before members to choose the next leader, should there be a contest in 2015. 'Those two are likely to be Boris Johnson and Theresa May.' She added: 'If Nick and Stephen become MPs that is two more votes for Theresa and two fewer for George. 'Theresa has had a lot to put up with. The more popular she is among party members, the nastier it becomes in Westminster.' Former Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, who had his own clashes with Mrs May while in Government, said: 'It's quite entertainingly newsworthy but someone should stop all their entourages falling out with each other. 'I actually think the relations between the people themselves are very good, I actually think Theresa is one of the strongest ministers in the Government, I actually think any prime minister - and David is very sensible about this - accepts he wants some strong ministers at the top of his government. 'The entourages seem to be having a little spat between themselves.' But Mr Clarke, appearing on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, warned against grasping for simple solutions to immigration. He said: 'It's very difficult to debate immigration, which is why I do agree that the major parties have tended slightly to avoid it, because it runs away, it becomes almost hysterical quite rapidly in the public debate. 'Our problem is illegal immigration - our problem is that from dangerous, poor parts of the world we have people coming in and it's very difficult to control them if they are coming in on lorries from Somalia or Syria or Afghanistan or whatever. 'Legal immigration is a feature of the modern world but everybody insists it must be controlled properly. ' He did not agree that immigration was 'somehow the cause of our housing crisis or our health crisis', adding: 'There are far more complicated things there that you have got to tackle. 'What we do have to ensure is that we do have immigration, because we have got multinational companies, because half a million of the immigrants here are running their own businesses and providing jobs, we don't want to throw out French hedge fund managers... 'At the moment the politics of the country, because of anger, because of reduced living standards, because of the recession, are very susceptible to people telling them 'oh don't bother with all this complicated politics, it's foreigners, let's get all these foreigners to go home'. 'That is not a sensible immigration policy. Real immigration policy is very difficult, we have reduced immigration from outside the EU by about 50,000 but we have a long way to go, not least as Theresa has been trying to do, improving the efficiency and the effectiveness of the Home Office and the immigration service.'","Foreign students would have to return home to apply for a UK work visa .

"The next generation: A picture of a youngster posing with a toy gun in front of an ISIS flag. It was tweeted by Londoner Umm Khattab, the teenaged widow of an ISIS fighter . The 18-year-old British widow of an ISIS fighter killed fighting in Syria has tweeted a picture of a young boy clutching a toy gun in front of the black flag of the terror group. The image was posted by Umm Khattab, believed to be from London, with the caption: 'Next generation, Bi'ithnillah (God willing). Last week it was reported that British Muslim extremists are offering teenage girls in the UK money to marry Islamic State militants waging bloody jihad in Syria and Iraq. Supporters of the terror group are believed to be offering cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls as young as 17 to travel to the group's de facto capital Raqqa and marry fighters. Although the boy, who appears to be aged about four, is not likely to be Khatab's son, his mother could be Lewisham-born Khadijah Dare, 22, from Lewisham in south London, who left Britain to join ISIS and is married to Swedish terrorist Abu Bakr. The pair are believed to live in Manjib, northern Syria, along with other British jihadi brides. The teenager also posted pictures of the food she receives, such as pizza and chocolate cakes, because of her status as the widow of a 'shaheed', or martyr. Her youth is evident in the three 'smiley' emoticons she places at the end of the tweet. Khattab, whose husband died in the war-torn town of Kobane on the border of Syria and Turkey, also tweeted a picture of foods from Kobane, including a drink from Starbucks, reports The Sunday Times. It is understood that ISIS channels money for the would-be jihadis' payment and travel expenses through international money wire systems, enabling the group's UK cell to offer significant sums of cash to disenfranchised teenagers, many of whom are from poverty-stricken backgrounds. The whole grooming process operates using the same techniques of trust-building and reward-offering employed by sexual predators, and is designed to turn the teenage girls into jihadi brides. News of ISIS' secret teenage terror trade was revealed in The Times, following a three month investigation by the newspaper in which reporters posed as two schoolgirls. It exposes how vulnerable young British Muslims are to ISIS' chilling network or groomers - and reveals that police are taking seriously the idea that the terror group has already provided money and travel assistance to children under the age of 16. Posing as Aisha, a 17-year-old girl from East London, the reporters - who have not been named for their own safety - were swamped with approaches from ISIS sympathisers, and were eventually put in touch with an alleged Syria-based extremist of Lebanese origin named Abu Abbas al-Lubnani.

Here she is pictured alongside her Swedish terrorist husband Abu Bakr. Their marriage was arranged by his mother . Grooming: Islamic State supporters are believed to be using British intermediaries to offer cash incentives to encourage schoolgirls as young as 17 to travel to the group's de facto capital Raqqa and marry fighters . 'Terror twins': Zahra (left) and Salma (right) Halane, who have 28 GCSE's between them, were groomed online and flew to join ISIS. The 16-year-olds ran away from their Manchester home on 26 June . Having built something of a rapport with the jihadi - including getting him to prove his authenticity by asking him to send photos taken in Raqqa with a banner reading 'Aisha' - al-Lubnani then offered to introduce 'Aisha' to a British intermediary, who would then pay for her to travel to the Islamic State. A surveillance operation followed, in which investigators identified a white British Muslim convert as the prime candidate for being the UK-based jihadi who offered to pay for two girls to travel to Syria. The man reportedly also offered intensive coaching on how the girls could avoid drawing attention to themselves before and during their journey to the Middle East. Terror: Aqsa Mahmood was reported missing by her Scottish parents a year ago before surfacing in Syria in February. She is now a prominent member of ISIS' all-female police force in de facto capital Raqqa . Shocking: Earlier this year Aqsa Mahmood posted this photograph of her holding the severed head of a Syrian man executed for criminal acts in Syria. She was standing alongside young children at the time . Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey and went on to Syria . Police in Britain have been urging families to contact them if they believe their loved-ones are trying to leave for Syria so they can be stopped. Detectives say young women are being manipulated online with glamorous descriptions of life in Syria with ISIS, only to suffer a miserable existence when they arrive. Yusra Hussien, 15, from Bristol, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey. She boarded a plane with a 17-year-old British girl Samya Dirie, who she met online and the two are now believed to be in Syria, and may have married jihadist fighters. Police failed to stop schoolgirl Miss Dirie despite being told she had run away with her passport. Three hours after her panicked parents alerted officers that she was missing, she was allowed to fly from Heathrow to Turkey. Her exit may have prompted the urgent response in the latest Heathrow case. In June 'terror twins' Zahra and Salma Halane, both 16, of Chorlton, Manchester, are thought to have married in the war-torn nation since disappearing overnight from their home. Both have insisted that Allah had 'chosen' for them to be in Syria. The pair have 28 GCSEs between them and were planning to become doctors, having just finished their first year of sixth-form college, but were said to have been radicalised over the internet. Their father Ibrahim and mother Khadra travelled to the region to try to bring them home, but without success. The couple have 10 children and their 21-year-old son Ahmed is said to be fighting with Al Shabaab, a militant group in Somalia. Bodies of Islamic State militants killed during fighting in Koban, Iraq were photographed this morning . Details of the investigation came after it was revealed that police stopped a plane at Heathrow just seconds before it was due to take off because a 15-year-old girl on board was planning to fly to Turkey before continuing her journey on to join ISIS militants in Syria. The young girl had secretly saved up to buy a ticket from London to Istanbul and planned to continue her journey through Turkey and over the border into Syria. It appears it was treated as a missing person's inquiry and she was not arrested. Her family, who had no idea she harboured extremist views, reported her missing and Scotland Yard tracked her down to a passenger jet about to leave Britain. After rushing to Heathrow, officers realised the girl's plane was already taxiing along the runway, so the pilot was ordered to stop and the girl  taken home. It later emerged that a second British 15-year-old girl was not spotted on board and was able to continue her journey to join the Islamic State in Syria. A United Nations official says one of the two Austrian girls who fled their middle class homes in Vienna earlier this year to fight in Syria has definitely died in the conflict. The two Viennese girls, Samra Kesinovic, 17, and 15-year-old Sabina Selimovic, whose parents are Bosnian refugees, disappeared in April after saying that they wanted to fight in Syria. They first went to the Turkish capital Ankara by plane, and then on into the southern Turkish region of Adana. After that, their tracks were lost. But they appeared on social networking sites branding Kalashnikov rifles and surrounded by armed men - photos which Austrian police said acted as recruitment posters for young girls.

David Scharia, a senior Israeli expert of the United Nations Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTED) said: 'We received information just recently about two 15-year-old girls, of Bosnian origin, who left Austria, where they had been living in recent years; and everyone, the families and the intelligence services of the two countries, is looking for them. He added: 'Both were recruited by Islamic State. One was killed in the fighting in Syria, the other has disappeared.' His confirmation comes three months after the Austrian government said it had informed both sets of parents of the girls that one of them might have been killed.","The teenager's husband died fighting in war-torn Kobane on Syrian border .

"As a country, it faces threats of terrorism, nuclear power and frosty international relations with world leaders. But Iran is focusing on another problem - a shrinking lake. Lake Oroumieh, of the world's biggest saltwater lakes, is in danger of completely drying up because of climate change, nearby farms using it for irrigation and the damming of rivers. Visitors walk on salt-covered rocks that were once deep underwater at Lake Oroumieh Lake . Two men walk toward salt-covered rocks that were once deep underwater at Lake Oroumieh. Expanded irrigation for surrounding farms and the damming of rivers that feed the body of water have been attributed to the shrinking lake . It has shrunk more than 80 percent to 1,000 square kilometers (nearly 400 square miles) in the past decade, experts say. Salt-covered rocks that were once deep underwater now sit in the middle of desert. Experts fear the lake - famous in years past as a tourist spot and a favorite stopping point for migrating flamingos, pelicans and gulls - could disappear within two years if nothing is done. 'The lake is gone. My job is gone. My children are gone. Tourists, too,' said Mozafar Cheraghi, 58, who used to run a his bustling teahouse. Less than a decade ago, he recalled, he hosted dozens of tourists a day, with his two sons taking them on boat tours. His children have since left to pursue work elsewhere. 'I sold a dozen boats and kept half a dozen here, hoping the water will return,' he said. 'But it didn't happen.' Rescuing the lake in northwestern Iran, near the Turkish border, was one of the campaign promises of Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani. Video Source YouTube . Reza, an Iranian gardener, sits on a dry tree near Lake Oroumieh, which has shrunk more than 80 percent to 1,000 square kilometers . Twenty proposals are on the table for saving the lake, including cloud-seeding to increase rainfall in the area and the building of pipelines to bring in more water . His new cabinet promptly decided to form a team to invite scholars to help find solutions. The president is putting an emphasis on tackling long-neglected environmental problems critics say were made worse by his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. An engineer with an appetite for giant populist projects, Ahmadinejad pursued policies that led to the expansion of irrigation projects and construction of dams. 'Rouhani stands by his campaign promise to revive the lake,' Isa Kalantari, a popular scholar appointed by Rouhani to lead the rescue team, said at an international conference in Oroumieh this week. The gathering brought experts from Iran and around the world to discuss the best options for reversing the trend and saving Iran from a major environmental and economic disaster. An abandoned ship is stuck in solidified salt at Lake Oroumieh. The shrinking has been blamed on climate change . The lake used to be famous as a tourist spot and a favorite stopping point for migrating flamingos, pelicans and gulls . 'Don't blame nature and drought. Human beings, not climate change, are responsible for this situation. We dried up the lake because of our excessive demands and wrong methods. Now, we have to revive it ourselves. Five million people have to leave this region if the lake dies,' Kalantari said. Kalantari and his team are to come up with a final rescue plan by May. Twenty proposals are on the table for saving the lake, including cloud-seeding to increase rainfall in the area and the building of pipelines to bring in more water. Experts have also proposed the creation of other industries to reduce reliance on agricultural water. Lake Oroumieh, pictured in 1984, was a sprawling lake - but climate change, river damming and irrigation has caused ti to shrink, experts warn . The government has already begun a project to raise public awareness and encourage farmers to abandon wasteful practices and adopt drip irrigation systems that save water. It is also urging farmers to switch to less-thirsty crops. Wheat and pistachios, for example, use less water than sugar beets. In the village of Govarchinghaleh, near the lake, Nader Hazrati and his son, Ali, grow grapes and almonds. 'A decade ago, this was a green area. Now it is not because of decrease in rainfall. With the level of water . in the lake going down, water in wells has gone down too. If we dig . deeper, the water gets very salty and isn't fit even for agricultural . use. Our grape and almond harvest has fallen dramatically,' Ali said. Ali, 27, said salty winds have killed some of his almond trees. The . effect on crops has prompted many villagers to leave the place of their . birth. Govarchinghaleh had about 1,000 people a decade ago. Now, . only 300 live in the village overlooking the shrinking lake. Once there . were three schools; now there is one, serving a dozen students. A deserted boat is seen through the shattered window of an abandoned ship, both stuck in the lake's solidified salt . The president is putting an emphasis on tackling long-neglected environmental problems critics say were made worse by his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Not far away, trucks hauling salt, a new business, could be seen driving over the dry lake bottom. Ali Asghar Siab Qudsi, a university teacher and one of the organizers of the conference, said dams and the digging of more than 24,000 unauthorized wells - in addition to some 30,000 legal ones - are among the reasons for the shrinking of the lake. He said increasing evaporation and cultivation of thirsty crops such as sugar beets have worsened the crisis. Lakes in other parts of Iran are facing a similar crisis, though not as severe as at Oroumieh. Even residents of Tehran experience water shortages on weekends, and authorities are making plans for possible rationing in the capital. Authorities have warned of a national disaster in the coming decade if water is not managed properly. 'My No. 1 demand is to see our dying lake back to life. Will that happen in my lifetime?' Cheraghi asked.","Lake Oroumieh has shrunk more than 80% to 1,000 square kilometers .

"Traditional Boxing Day sales could become extinct following a rise in pre-Christmas discounts, experts said. With shops starting their sales earlier every year, the British retail ritual on December 26 is coming to 'the end of its life cycle'. Footfall on Boxing Day fell by four per cent between 2011 and 2013 as people found themselves shopped out by the time the customary sales began. Scroll down for video . Shoppers beg sales assistants for products in Selfridges on Boxing Day last year - but scenes like this could become a thing of the past following a rise in pre-Christmas discounts . The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales . The Boxing Day shopping stampede could become extinct as there are now bargains available pre-Christmas . Retail analyst Springboard said there has been a huge shift in shopping patterns, with many people snapping up discount electrical items and clothing throughout December instead. The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales. The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started. This prompted retailers to bring their sales forward to encourage spending and, ever since, shops have competed to be the first shop to drop its prices. Three-quarters of the top 100 high street shops have already started their sales in a bid to attract customers, with discounts averaging 45 per cent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Marks & Spencer is already offering 30 per cent off knitwear, 20 per cent off bags and 20 per cent off hats, scarves and gloves, while Debenhams is offering up to half price off everything from boots and coats to dinnerware and watches. John Lewis, Ted Baker and Next appeared to be some of the few stores holding their nerve until after Christmas. Diane Wehrle, at Springboard, said: 'The special nature of Boxing Day is diminishing. It is possibly coming to the end of its life cycle. 'Culturally in Britain, Boxing Day is still a day when people shop, while Black Friday is a relatively new import from the US. 'But Boxing Day is no longer what it used to be, partly because the sales are starting before Christmas, so there is less impetus to rush out to the shops after Christmas, and partly because of the growth of online shopping.' She said high street retailers needed to adapt and give families a reason to venture out on Boxing Day, including putting on entertainment. She said: 'They need to make it an event again so that people want to go to 'experience' the sales. 'They could have entertainers or demonstrations or celebrities to attract people in.' The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started . The mad scramble for cut-price goods on Boxing Day, such as this scene in Selfridges, could become extinct . Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts . The rise in online shopping also means that many people spend their Christmas money and gift vouchers on December 25 itself, using their phones and computer tablets to do so. Amazon has predicted this will be its busiest Christmas on record, with sales peaking at 12.26pm and again at 9.02pm, as families download films, music and books on their Kindles and tablets. This new trend also eats into Boxing Day revenues, with many consumers felling they have 'spent up' by the time they fall asleep in Christmas Day. Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts. But retailers were forced to slash their prices in the aftermath of the economic crisis to lure shoppers back on to the High Street. Now, customers expect these sales every December. Accounting company BDO claims that 'consumers have become conditioned towards waiting for promotions before making purchases'. Millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year . The busiest hour on Tuesday will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, with an estimated £1.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street . The December sales have also encouraged people to put off their Christmas shopping, rather than stockpiling in November. It means millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year. The busiest hour will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, according to credit card provider Visa, with an estimated £1.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street. For those wishing to avoid the crowds, brave shoppers could delay until the quietest hour of the week on the high street – 3pm on Christmas Eve. While expensive iPads, Kindles and games consoles have featured among the best-selling items this year, traditional wooden toys and games have also made a comeback. John Lewis said sales of backgammon boards were up 100 per cent on the same week last year, while its £100 doll's house has completely sold out. Waitrose also reported a 'real trend for nostalgia' as sales of frozen puddings rose by almost two-thirds. A frozen pudding by Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, called the Ultimate Chocolate Bar, is among the supermarket's bestsellers. Based on one of Blumenthal's childhood favourites, it contains caramel mousse, an almond and hazelnut mousse, crunchy chocolate biscuit and a caramel ganache. Meanwhile, Asda said it has also seen a big rise in venison sales, while Waitrose also has a large selection of venison steaks, pates and sausages this Christmas. Omnivorous Britons will reportedly eat seven different types of meat over the festive season.","Boxing Day sales could become a thing of the past, according to experts .

"A garage which could become the most expensive to ever be sold in Britain has gone on the market for a staggering £650,000 – the same price as an eight-bedroom country pile in Northumberland. The tiny lock-up workshop measures just 420 sq. ft., but its exclusive W8 postcode in Kensington, west London, means its price tag is more than double the national average for a family home in England. The garage, which is being used to store tools, bicycles and furniture, is currently uninhabitable but the sellers insist it is a 'good deal' because it has the potential to be transformed into a small one-bedroom flat. In contrast, an eight-bedroom farmhouse, which is nestled in sprawling countryside, is currently on the market for the same price in Northumberland.

An eight-bedroom grade II listed farmhouse in Northumberland (pictured) is on the market for the same price . The Grade II listed barn conversion, situated on the edge of Northumberland National Park, is more than five times the size of the garage and comes with additional outbuildings. Raglan International, the estate agency handling the sale of the garage in the desirable Lexham Gardens area of Kensington, believes it has the potential to be transformed into a studio flat. Although planning permission to change the garage into a residence was granted more than 10 years ago, it's no longer valid and any buyer would have to reapply to turn it from a car storage unit into a home. In its current state, the property has external parking for two cars on a forecourt and an electric, roller-blind garage door. Christopher Mackay, spokesman for Raglan International, said: 'It is no ordinary garage.

'And every viewing is different because every prospective buyer gives you their vision of how they'd turn it into something special. 'If you did it well you could have a good sized one-bedroom flat, with two off-street parking spaces and sell it on to easily make 10 per cent of what you'd invested. 'It has the potential to be an incredible and unique property.' In October, a smaller garage off King's Road in Chelsea sold for £550,000. Tucked at the end of an alleyway behind a row of terraced houses, the outbuilding was described as being on an 'irregular shaped, broadly level site' and sold at auction after attracting a stream of investors. The latest garage to go on the market is situated in the exclusive W8 postcode, where the average price for a detached home  is more than £9million and flats often sell for over a £1million. In contrast, the  farmhouse is situated in Northumberland, where the average price for a detached home is slightly over £280,000.

'The high standard of renovation that makes country and contemporary work so harmoniously together. 'Not only does this property have the wow factor but it can also provide an income through the holiday letting route.

If the garage in W8 sells for its £650,000 asking price, it will become the most expensive to be sold in Britain - beating a one-car garage which sold in Chelsea for £550,000. The garage, off King's Road in Chelsea, London, sold at auction in October for the large sum, despite it measuring just 11ft by 7ft. Tucked at the end of an alleyway behind a row of terraced houses, the outbuilding was described as being on an 'irregular shaped, broadly level site' which could be extended to 538 sq. ft., or just 0.013 acres. Despite the size and awkward location, the Lamont Road garage attracted interest from a range of investors after planning permission was granted for it to be converted into an unusual home. Planning permission was granted last year for the garage to be demolished, and replaced with a single-storey plus basement dwelling. When completed, it will have two bedrooms, one with en-suite, living room, kitchen/ diner, toilet, guest shower room and patio.

"A decision to crack down on parents taking their children on holiday during term time by Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove is being challenged in the courts . Michael Gove's decision to crack down on parents taking children on holiday in term time is being challenged in the courts by a group of parents. The action to take the Education Secretary's ruling to judicial review is being backed by a petition signed by more than 200,000 parents. The group claims the rules are a breach of their human right to a family life. Parents Want A Say is being launched . today and co-ordinated by Karen Wilkinson, a mother-of-three from Bath . in Somerset, reports the Sunday Times. Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who has successfully campaigned to open up the family courts, is advising the group. Ms . Wilkinson says it's not just parents looking for cheap holidays who are . being refused permission to take children out of school under the new . stricter rules. 'Requests . to take children out of school for weddings, to visit elderly . grandparents who live abroad or even in some cases, when doctors have . sanctioned the request because it's in the child's interest, are all . being turned down,' she said. This weekend it emerged that a ten-year-old girl from Tamworth was denied a day off for her grandfather's funeral. Mr . Gove's changes brought in last year end the right for schools to grant . up to 10 days holiday per year in special circumstances. Parents face fine of £60 per pupil . per parent if they take children out of school without permission and . those who refuse to pay could be fined £2,500 by the courts and even . jailed for up to three months. More . than 24,000 children are skipping school every day to go on family . holidays as parents ignore the threat of fines to escape peak-time price . hikes. Official figures . reveal a sharp drop in the number of schools giving permission for . term-time holidays following a crackdown by Mr Gove. But . growing numbers of parents are taking children on 'unauthorised' family . breaks, despite the threat of £120 fines and even court action. So-called 'middle-class truancy' is . linked to inflated prices imposed by travel companies during half-term, . Christmas, Easter and summer school holidays. Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term . Prices can be double normal rates and savings on the holidays often outweigh the cost of any fines. Mr Gove tightened the rules from last September to prevent unnecessary disruption to children's education. Heads were previously able to grant up to ten days holiday a year. But changes to the regulations remove references to the ten-day threshold and make clear heads 'may not grant any leave of absence during term-time unless there are exceptional circumstances', such as a family bereavement. Provisional figures show that more than 24,000 pupils skipped classes every day in the autumn term last year despite the crackdown. About three-quarters of these had been taken out of school without the permission of the head.Parents who fail to gain the consent of the head teacher risk truancy fines of £120 – or £60 if paid within 28 days. The true figures for pupils missing lessons could be higher since the Department for Education realised some schools had not been counted.","Action backed by a petition signed by more than 200,000 parents .

"Middle-class households fork out more in taxes than they get back from the state, with top earners paying the Treasury £30,000 more than they receive in handouts. The average working family gives the Treasury £274 more every year than it receives back in the form of tax credits or from public services such as the NHS and schools, a report found. It adds that the rich shoulder ‘more than their fair share’, with the top 10 per cent of earners paying an average of £30,023 more in tax than they got back. The average working family gives the Treasury (pictured) £274 more every year than it receives in handouts like tax credits or from public services such as the NHS and schools. Lower-income families are hammered hardest by indirect taxes such as VAT and fuel duty, while income tax is the biggest burden for higher earners, says the TaxPayers’ Alliance. The campaign group says the average household has an income of £32,108 a year before tax. People living in London, the South East, South West and East Midlands were hit hardest by tax, with the average household paying more than it got out in benefits and services. On average, households in the North East received around £3,175 more in benefits per year, although their incomes were lower. The poorest 10 per cent of homes – with an income of £3,875 a year before tax – paid the highest percentage of their income in tax of any group, according to the figures from 2012-13. Those at the lowest end of the spectrum were paying 47 per cent of their income in tax, with VAT by far the biggest drain on their finances. By comparison, the top 10 per cent of earners – on an average of £104,000 a year before tax – paid 35 per cent of their income in tax. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This analysis shows just how pernicious our tax burden has become. Not only does the tax system hit the poorest hardest, but those at the top are already contributing far more than anybody could reasonably describe as their fair share. ‘Our tax system is neither progressive nor fair, and we need radical reform as well as necessary savings if the way we tax and spend is to become fit for purpose.’ The poorest 10 per cent of homes – with an income of £3,875 a year before tax – paid the highest percentage of their income in tax . The campaign group calls for National Insurance and sales tax to be reduced to relieve the burden on lower-income groups and middle-class families. The report comes after researchers revealed that Britons also pay one of the highest proportions of property tax in the world. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found £1 in every £8 paid to the taxman is levied on people’s homes and businesses. This compared with £1 in every £12 in 1990 – a level still seen in countries such as France and Australia. The Coalition has raised the income tax threshold to £10,000 this year, taking three million of the lowest earners out of paying tax. Around 26 million people have benefited from the income tax changes to some extent, keeping £705 a year on average more than they did in 2010. To compile the survey, the TaxPayers’ Alliance used data on different income groups from the Office for National Statistics. It added on average figures for how much each category claims in benefits, including the state pension, jobseekers’ allowance, housing benefit and tax credits. It then looked at how much they pay in direct tax such as income tax, national insurance and council tax, and indirect taxes including VAT, alcohol and tobacco levies, and fuel and stamp duty. The lowest-income group receives £7,691 a year of benefits and state services, compared with an average of £6,677. The highest-income group takes only £4,980.","Average working family gives Treasury £274 more than it gets in handouts .

"James Houghton, 19, (pictured) was at Leeds Festival  when he collapsed and died after taking ecstasy tablets . A former school prefect with a 'fabulous mind' died of an ecstasy overdose at a music festival last year, an inquest has heard. James Houghton, 19, from Hartlepool, County Durham, had travelled to Leeds Festival with a group of friends in August last year - just a month before he was due to start studying history at Manchester University. The student was seen stumbling while waiting to watch Eminem at the festival at Bramham Park, Wetherby, West Yorkshire, before he left the crowd and suffered a seizure near a burger van. After being rushed to the festival site's medical centre by ambulance, he went into cardiac arrest - and despite attempts to revive him, Mr Houghton was pronounced dead at 11.30pm on Sunday August 25. Friends of the teenager told security staff that he had taken three ecstasy tablets. Dr Lisa Barker, a consultant histopathologist at St James's Hospital in Leeds said that results of toxicology reports showed Mr Houghton had taken a fatal level of ecstasy. Dr Barker told an inquest into his death that there were also traces of amphetamine and cocaine in his system.

"This is the place where the Queen Mother exchanged nods with a complete stranger who was sitting in a warm bath. It was where Princess Margaret allegedly took cocaine with the Rolling Stones at a concert, and where a young Cliff Richard had announced he had found Christ at a Billy Graham ‘crusade’. Oh yes, and in 1896 Buffalo Bill Cody put on his Wild West Show there. But now the bulldozers are growling with impatience. Soon the demolition men will be moving in. With an £8 billion project at stake — now that London Mayor Boris Johnson has given the scheme his blessing — they will not take long to reduce to rubble the art deco façade famous around the world and the vast buildings on 77 valuable acres behind it. Progress, if that is the right word, comes in many guises. In this instance, Earls Court exhibition centre, for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of London, is coming down to make way for — but you already knew — town houses and flats. Scroll down for video . Earl's Court, where the Queen Mother exchanged nods with model Anne Callaghan who was sitting in a warm bath at the 1986 Ideal Home Exhibition, is to be demolished . Earls Court exhibition centre, for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of London, is coming down to make way for town houses and flats . The demolition men will soon be moving in to Earl's Court after an £8bn project to turn it into houses and flats was backed by Boris Johnson . The sad moment when the edifice starts to crumble will unlock a billion nostalgic memories. For generations of young lovers and families, Earls Court has resonated with our most fundamental needs — home-making, romance and entertainment. What brought the late Queen Mother into contact with a bathing man there was the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition, which was staged at Earls Court over many years. It was the mid-Eighties and she had declared the highly popular exhibition open. Then, as she began a tour of the exhibits, she steered a course through the kitchens towards the bathrooms — and there was this young man demonstrating one of the luxuries of life. Their brief exchange was not exactly a deep conversation, more an exchange of smiles and nods. The poor chap was in no position to bow. He was said to be ‘almost in a prayer’ of relief when she moved on. The waiting cameramen resisted the temptation to capture the introduction, but demonstrating wise discretion, they instead photographed a subsequent encounter between the Queen Mother and a female model wearing a swimsuit. Princess Margaret (left) allegedly took cocaine with the Rolling Stones at a concert at Earl's Court after she was invited back stage by Mick Jagger (right) Take That perform at the BBC Music Awards on December 11 - which could be one of the last events to be held at the famous venue . As for Princess Margaret’s visit backstage with the Stones, this emerged in a scurrilous biography of the Queen’s sister in which it was alleged she was invited by Mick Jagger to a Stones concert at Earls Court and partook of the drug with them in their dressing rooms before the concert, watched by 23,000 people, had begun. ‘An amusing drug, don’t you think?’ she was quoted as saying to one of the band’s female assistants. For Cliff Richard, the exhibition centre holds very different memories. He was 26 and already a big star when he went to Earls Court to see American evangelist Billy Graham. He listened to Graham — now 95 and in poor health — and that night he joined dozens of others in the audience shuffling down to the front of the stage. Suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found Christ. Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift with the Victoria's Secret models at the underwear chain's fashion show, held at Earl's Court earlier this month . Others have packed into the great auditorium for very different reasons. On July 16, 1939, just six weeks before the outbreak of World War II, Oswald Mosley filled it to overflowing with his blackshirts for a mass rally of the British Union of Fascists. With the party’s white lightning bolt insignia hanging from the walls, Mosley’s ranting speech raised to a fever of excitement the 50,000 who had squeezed standing into a space built to seat half that number. ‘Mosley, Mosley, Mosley,’ they cried until his name reverberated around the walls and could be heard outside in the streets. That Earls Court gathering was then, and remains now, the biggest indoor political rally ever held in Britain. When Mosley hired Earl Court, it was only two years old in its present form. Back in 1887, when it was originally opened on what had been waste land by the engineer-businessman John R. Whitley, it was an open-air space surrounded by covered stands, rather as football stadia are today. It was called Earls Court after the Earl of Zetland, who owned the freehold. One of Whitley’s first major successes was Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, which pulled in 15,000 visitors a day including, on one occasion, the whole of Harrow School, possibly including the young Winston Churchill who had just started there. The ground was turned into a lake in order to accommodate Captain Paul Boyton’s Water Show, an aquatic stunts display featuring the country’s first ‘water toboggan’. In 1895 there was the Empire Of India Exhibition supported by four maharajahs, with spectacular displays and a 300ft ferris wheel that could carry 1,600 people at a time, revolving in eight minutes (though on one occasion when it broke down the passengers were suspended for four-and-a-half hours). In a po-faced editorial, the magazine The Builder described the wheel as ‘a foolish kind of sensational toy . . . carrying coachloads of fools round in a vertical circle’. Then came World War I and Earls Court became a refugee camp for Belgians whose country had been overrun by the German army. Part of it became a bus depot. But when new owners took it over in 1935, they decided to build a vast, triangular building over the site. Cliff Richard was 26 and already a big star when he went to Earls Court to see American evangelist Billy Graham. Suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found Christ . Earls Court was also where Spice Girl Geri Halliwell wore her famous Union flag dress at The Brit awards . Ironically, at the outbreak of war this huge edifice that Mosley had hired to promote his black propaganda served the war effort brilliantly, and was perfect as a factory making and testing barrage balloons in the heart of London where they were most needed. The post-war years and the country’s need for glamour and entertainment revealed Earls Court to be the most flexible venue in the country. In 1948 there was the Aquashow, starring Johnny Weissmuller, who had gone from being an Olympic swimming champion to Hollywood’s Tarzan. Earls Court was the perfect place for Tarzan, for it had been built with a permanent swimming pool covered by a 750-ton concrete floor which slid in and out of sight at the touch of a button. The Queen Mother with Lord Rothermere at the opening of the 1970 Ideal Home Exhibition . They packed in to see Cinderella On Ice and other ice-borne shows. During one panto in 1949, one of the skating clowns stopped to plant a kiss on the bald head of a mild-looking chap sitting with his family in the front row. It was Clement Attlee, Britain’s post-war Labour prime minister. A strong royal link also began to take root as the Royal Tournament — the world’s largest military tattoo, held by the Armed Forces annually — was established there, along with the Motor Show and the International Boat Show. For Billy Graham, it was a natural place to hold his mass meetings. And then Earls Court was discovered, as it were, by the pop groups. Pink Floyd first played there in 1973, and had other full-capacity appearances in 1980, and again in 1981, selling out the entire 85,000 tickets in just four hours. Thirteen years later, in 1994, they had just started their set when a stand holding 1,200 fans collapsed, injuring 96. Miraculously, no one was killed. The concert was abandoned. Led Zeppelin filled it for several nights in 1975, charging £1 a ticket: £9 in today’s money, and what fans might pay for a programme these days. The Rolling Stones, too, played Earls Court to packed houses, sometimes with Mick Jagger’s friend Princess Margaret and friends slipping into their seats just as the lights went down. David Bowie also filled it. Earls Court was also where Spice Girl Geri Halliwell wore her famous Union flag dress at The Brit awards, and where, just the other week, the Victoria’s Secret fashion show extravaganza attracted huge attention. And, finally, it was in an almost surreal atmosphere that the Bombay Bicycle Club, an Indie rock band from north London, took to the stage on Saturday. For this, it seems, was the very last gig of any kind at Earls Court. Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour made a point of being there. He slipped on stage to sing the band’s song Wish You Were Here. With rock royalty on stage, someone described the farewell to Earls Court as ‘joyous’. Nostalgic would surely have been a better word to describe the night the music died.","Exhibition centre to be pulled down in £8bn scheme to build new homes .

"A young pilgrim has been crushed to death by a giant crucifix dedicated to Pope John Paul II.

We never imagined that something like this could happen.’ Mr Citroni said maintenance work had been carried out on the crucifix last summer. Mr Gusmini had been visiting the area with a church group from his home town of Bergamo, where - ironically - he lived on a street named after Pope John XXIII, according to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The tragedy will inevitably be seen as an ill omen for Sunday’s celebration when John Paul II is to be declared a saint, along with Italian pope John XXIII.

It was installed in a scenic location near Cevo in 2005. The crucifix was anchored with cables intended to represent the scars of the Second World War. This is not the first death caused by a falling crucifix in Italy. In 2004 a 72-year-old woman was crushed to death by a 7ft metal crucifix in the southern town of Sant’Onofrio, Calabria.","Marco Gusmini was killed when the sculpture fell in Cevo, northern Italy .

"The father of a teenage man, who had both his legs severed when he was struck by a train, allegedly attacked the ambulance vehicle after they arrived to save his son. Emergency services were called to Bushland Drive railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast to find the 18-year-old on the tracks with his legs severed at about 4.30am on Sunday. But police officers and paramedics who arrived, were forced to take refuge in the train driver's cabin, along with the 33-year-old train driver, after they were hurled with rocks by a group of people. Paramedics were also blocked, pushed and verbally abused by the group during their initial attempts to treat the teen, and an ambulance vehicle was damaged from the rocks. Scroll down for video . An 18-year-old has had both his legs cut off when he was struck at a railway crossing in Taree on the NSW mid-north coast .

'Today the father has been better to us and is apologetic for his actions,' he said. 'We are trying to find people and get an ID on a couple who threw rocks and smashed windows. 'It is horrific to have to deal with that and then deal with alcohol-induced friends and family. And they are having a go at the cops and ambulance officers. 'Initially we had two officers out there. We had to close the station down then because we had five people (at the scene). 'Then there was three or more police who rushed out there when they started in the morning.

"The number of civil servants earning more than £150,000 - which is a higher salary than the Prime Minister - has doubled since the Coalition took power and now stands at 316. Many officials have seen their salaries rise by more than the one per cent cap imposed on the public sector since 2012. The Tax Payers' Alliance has described the growing number of high earners as 'unacceptable'- insisting the 'bill must come down'. Public sector fatcats: 316 officials now earn more than £150,000 a year. The Prime Minister's annual salary currently stands at £142,500 . David Cameron has also criticised the hike in pay and banned salaries rising faster than inflation until 2018. The Prime Minister earns £142,500 a year but the Ministry of Defence currently has 21 staff on more than that, reports The Sun on Sunday. Meanwhile the Department of Health has 111 employees earning more than £150,000. And many others employed by the NHS and Department of Health also command giant salaries - some earning as much as double the Prime Minister's salary. Well paid: Andrew Haines, Chief Executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, earns £300,000 a year .

'Most workers in the public sector are feeling the pinch from a necessary pay freeze, and they'll wonder why those at the top appear immune to the same financial discipline. 'This bill must come down.' While the number of high earning civil servants is on the rise George Osborne continues to impose a pay freeze on public sector workers lower down the pecking order. This week health workers warned the Government there would be a new wave of strikes in the new year over the pay freeze.

A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'This is disappointing. NHS staff are our greatest asset and we want to make the current pay system fairer - which is why we have put forward proposals that would guarantee all staff would get at least a one pay rise this year and next, but these have been rejected by the unions.

"Those of a more wholesome disposition, look away now. Because below is a shocking - and equally creepy - depiction of what a futuristic female ‘sex robot’ might look like on the inside. The computer generated image reveals the complex wires and circuitry that might be in machines one day - among other more, ahem, risqué features. Would you? A French artist has created a depiction of futuristic 'sex robots' (shown). The bizarre - and creepy - images reveal the 'innards' of androids. They include artificial organs and a mechanical spine. But more unnervingly, they also have artificial 'reproductive organs'. Some experts believe androids could become partners for humans in future . The image was created by French artist César Vonc. On his website he called it the ‘new invention of the next century.’ The computer generated image was made for a robotic contest this year using a programme called Cinema 4D and rendered with Octane Render. Earlier this year two cybernetics experts gave their views on how robots might reproduce. Novelist George Zarkadakis said robots that are both silicon and carbon based, could have sex at a molecular level to produce offspring - although how this could happen is unclear. AI expert Professor Noel Sharkey, meanwhile, said that there might not be any need to look at molecules as robots can be 'bred' by swapping software, so the code used to make robots perform certain tasks particularly well can be combined to create a 'child'. He believes that robots of the future will be able to print their offspring, a little like a 3D printer, but could assemble them too. And Mr Zarkadis said if robots could have sex, it would defend them from computer viruses and make them more robust. The cutaway image appears to bear some resemblance to a crash test dummy on the exterior. The interior, though, is a different story. Running down the ‘back’ of the robot is a metallic spine, obviously intending to replicate the real thing. Elsewhere other organs area also recreated in all-too-accurate CGI. Humorously - or bizarrely, depending on your view of this art piece - there’s also a handy arrow in a suggestive position. Despite its rather not-safe-for-work tone, though, the piece does at least provide what may be an accurate depiction of futuristic robots. Namely, as attempts are made to make machines more and more human, it stands to reason we might some day create a robot with such artificial organs. And aside from lungs, a heart, bones and more, this may also include other artificial organs of a reproductive nature. Earlier this year a study looked at how robots could replace several jobs in the next ten years. The One Poll survey, which marked the launch of a new sci-fi TV police drama called Almost Human, said in a decade streets could be governed my RoboCop-style police, taxis could drive themselves and prostitutes could be replaced by ‘sexbots’. It found that people feared the rise of artificial technology, and felt many jobs could be replaced sooner rather than later by machines.

Transport/train driver, pilots, truckers (8 per cent) 8. Service industry/shop assistant, customer service, waiters, bartenders (8 per cent) 9. Sex and sex workers (4 per cent) 10. Cooking/chefs (3 per cent) Among the top jobs people think will be replaced by robots by 2025 include soldiers (45 per cent), factory workers (33 per cent) and astronauts (33 per cent). The research also revealed many people think education will soon be led by androids, with 42 per cent believing teachers could be replaced by robots in the classroom in the future, and more than a tenth thinking it could happen in the next 20 years. And 17 per cent of those questioned said they’d happily have sex with an android, while 29 per cent admitted they had no problem with other people enjoying android sex. More than one in ten even said they would like robotic offpsring, while nearly a fifth of pet owners said they would consider replacing a beloved animal with a robot. Dr Martin Smith, professor of robotics at the University of Middlesex, who oversaw the survey, said: ‘I would expect robots to develop levels of emotional intelligence that will be greater than many humans including: thinking, judgement, problem solving, openness, self-control, self-analysis, and paying attention to and identifying people’s feelings and emotions, for example.’ But he said that we do not need to feat a robot uprising just yet, adding: ‘Robots are being applied in fields described as the three Ds, that is, tasks that are dirty, dangerous or dull. ‘The jobs most at risk are low-skill, routine, highly-structured, simple, and rule based, in environments that are static and structured. 'It is unlikely that all the humans will be replaced by robots in any task, it is much more likely that fewer people will be needed because for many years robots will be assistants. 'The future is most likely to be one of productivity gains rather than mass redundancies.’ Earlier this year a study looked at how robots could replace several jobs in the next ten years. The One Poll survey, which marked the launch of a new sci-fi TV police drama called Almost Human, said in a decade streets could be governed my RoboCop-style police (shown) and prostitutes could be replaced by ‘sexbots’","A French artist has created a computer genrated depiction of futuristic 'sex robots'

"In 2012, audiences were shocked by the graphic violence and gore featured in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, the story of a freed slave who sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation owner. Now British-born director Steve McQueen, who won critical praise for Shame (2011), and its unflinching look at sex addiction, is dividing viewers with a new film about the horrors of slavery. The movie, 12 Years a Slave, is adapted from Solomon Northup's memoir of the same name, which recounts his harrowing experiences after being separated from his family and sold into bondage. Scroll down for video . Difficult viewing: The sight of slaves being brutalised and chained proved too much for some audience members . A scene from 12 Years a Slave, which takes an unflinching approach to the suffering of American slaves . Northup, born a free African . American, was taken prisoner in 1841 by so-called circus owners who . lured him with a fake job offer. He was drugged, then transported to New Orleans, and sold as a slave to a plantation owner from Louisiana. The . film, which will hit screens in October, stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as . Northup. The all-star cast also includes Benedict Cumberbatch as . Northup's first master, and Michael Fassbender on horrifying form as his . second. Brad Pitt, who also notched up a production credit, features as . a grizzled abolitionist. It caused a sensation at the Toronto . Film Festival this weekend when some viewers were so shocked that they . left the screening - but others were moved to tears and gave the film a . 10-minute standing ovation. Ejiofor, . who is already being tipped for an Oscar, says the film's darkness is . integral to its sombre subject matter - and points to the goodness at . its heart. Savage: The film's most shocking scenes include hangings, murder and torture, including a 10-minute whipping scene . Human tragedy: The film charts Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor)'s struggle to survive and return to his family . Chiwetel Ejiofor (left) says the story is one of 'beauty and hope and human respect' as well as gruesome violence . 'Solomon's story is full of . [violence] but also full of beauty and hope and human respect and . dignity,' he told The Independent on Sunday. 'With [director] Steve there to guide it, we weren't afraid to explore all that, and go to those dark places.' To get to the heart of Northup's . agony, McQueen aims to convey the monstrous indignity and injustice of . slavery. In one bloody scene, the protagonist is beaten 15 times with a . bat before being whipped by his captors. Slaves are shown being hanged, murdered and lashed - including by each other, on their masters' orders. Critics expect the bold film to score Oscar nominations in multiple categories, including Best Picture.

Beautiful Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o has also impressed critics with her role as a cotton picker brutalised by her master. McQueen told audiences at Toronto Film Festival he was driven by a desire to depict the truth about pre-abolition America. 'I wanted to see that story on film,' he said. 'It's that simple.' Beautiful Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o (left) impressed critics with her role as a cotton picker, while Sarah Paulson (right) plays the jealous wife of the plantation owner who becomes sexually obsessed with her.

'As . soon as [my wife] put it in my hand I didn't let it go, it was just . remarkable. I had an idea and then you see it in your hand as a book. Amazing.' Addressing comparisons to Tarantino's Django, the director said the timing of the two films was a coincide. Pictured at the Toronto premiere, Brad Pitt (left) plays an abolitionist in the film, while Benedict Cumberbatch (right) takes the role of Solomon Northup's first slave owner. He recalled bumping into Tarantino recently, saying: 'He said, ""I hope that it's okay to have more than one slavery film."" 'I said, ""Of course, it's like having more than one gangster movie or having more than one western."" 'They're two different movies about slavery.'

"Firebrand senator Jacqui Lambie has revealed Botox is partly responsible for her new look, describing the wrinkle-smoothing procedure as 'addictive'. The former Palmer United Party member has also spoken out about being single and has again hit out Prime Minister Tony Abbott, saying he needs to 'grow a pair'. The article, which features in January's issue of Australian Women's Weekly, is accompanied by pictures of Senator Lambie's promised new look, with her signature pulled-back bun replaced with loose tresses. Scroll down for video . The former Palmer United Party member has also spoken out about being single and has again hit out Prime Minister Tony Abbott, saying he needs to 'grow a pair' In one of the photos she is brandishing an Australian flag, which draws inspiration from her idol, former Nation One leader Pauline Hanson who has been arguably as controversial as the Tasmanian senator. Senator Lambie spoke to the magazine candidly about Botox and fillers as she prepared for the shoot. 'It's addictive. It's like ""Oh my God, here comes that wrinkle again"",' she said. Senator Lambie - who recently broke away from the Palmer United Party after a very public stoush over defence pay - also spoke about how she had been single for more than a decade. The Australian Women's Weekly article is accompanied by pictures of Senator Lambie's promised new look, with her signature pulled-back bun replaced with loose tresses . 'I basically haven't been with anyone for 10 or 11 years, ' she said. 'I'm open to it. It's just to have that human contact would be nice.' Ms Lambie had two children by the time she was 27 years old. She became pregnant at 18 with Brentyn and was with child while she trained for the army, which meant five-kilometre runs and 100 push-ups up until she reached the 20-week mark. Her second child, Dylan, was a result of a relationship with fellow soldier John Milverton at 22. They separated after years together as Senator Lambie does not believe in 'staying together for the sake of the kids' as it was 'a coward's way'. After this relationship break-up, her career with the army stalled due to an ongoing back injury during training. Here Jacqui Lambie in happier times with PUP leader and Queensland mining magnate Clive Palmer . To try and reduce the burden on her back, the army contributed funds to reduce Senator Lambie's double-D breasts after having two children, which she says 'were hanging down'. But she finally had to give up her army dreams after a trip to East Timor on her first deployment after she was strapped into a flak jacket, which 'was the end of me'. The drugs she took for her back pain, similar to those prescribed to schizophrenics which 'messes with the chemicals in your brain', led her to be cared for by her son, Dylan. But when he started going down the wrong path in life, Senator Lambie had to take him to a youth crisis centre and then she began questioning her capabilities as a parent. 'I began thinking ""What use am I to anyone? I might as well end it. I'm a waste of space"",' she said. This is the point where Senator Lambie attempted to take her own life when she was drunk and walked in front of a car. Senator Lambie says Tony Abbott 'doesn't wear the pants' in his office but chief of staff Peta Credlin does . Having spent 20 years working on her depression, the mother-of-two turned to politics and the Tasmanian senator catapulted herself into the spotlight with her frank - and sometimes shocking - opinions. Most infamously describing her ideal man as one with 'heaps of cash' and had 'a package between their legs', and her position on banning the burqa, which has landed her in hot water. But the final straw for PUP leader Clive Palmer was when Senator Lambie said she would vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal was reconsidered. Despite being very vocal about her opinions of her former boss in the past, this time Senator Lambie only had tough words for Prime Minister Tony Abbott who she says has to 'grow a pair'. 'Females scare the crap out of him but he's going to have to grow a pair because he has to deal with me,' she said. 'My vote's important so if I was Tony Abbott, I'd be saying ""Hey, Jacqui Lambie, let's have a cup of coffee"". 'But he can't do that, can he? Because he doesn't wear the pants. The female in his office [chief of staff] Peta Credlin – she's the one that wears the pants.'

"Philae may have taken the limelight following its landing on comet 67P, but its orbiting spacecraft, Rosetta, still has a few of its own daring manoeuvres to complete. In February, flight engineers in Darmstadt, Germany plan to bring the Rosetta spacecraft down to an incredible 4 miles (6km) from the comet's surface. This will be the closest the comet explorer will come to 67P throughout its mission, and could provide stunning views of the cliffs and craters. Scroll down for video . This animation shows comet 67P, with overlay boxes indicating the fields of view of three Rosetta cameras . Up until now, Rosetta's closet view of the comet has been six miles (10 km), which occurred shortly before releasing the Philae lander. Its orbit currently ranges between 12.4 miles and 18.6 miles (20 km and 50 km) as it monitors the comet's surface, attempting to find Philae's final resting spot. Any manoeuvre to bring Rosetta to the comet is risky, but a low flyby could provide scientists with an opportunity to obtain imagery with a resolution of a few inches (10 cm) per pixel. 'It is the earliest we could carry it out without impacting the vitally important bound orbits that are currently being flown,' said Matt Taylor, the Rosetta project scientist from the European Space Research and Technology Center, Noordwijk, the Netherlands. Closing in: This artist's impression of Rosetta and 67P show previous orbits that edge in closer to the comet's surface. Up until now, Rosetta's closet view of the comet has been six miles (10 km) Bounce back: The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was launched back out into space. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. 'As the comet becomes more and more active, it will not be possible to get so close to the comet. So this opportunity is very unique.' The imagery is expected to provide information on the comet's porosity and albedo – or how much it reflects sunlight. The flyby will also allow the study of the processes by which cometary dust is accelerated by the cometary gas emission. 'Rosetta is providing us with a grandstand seat of the comet throughout the next year. This flyby will put us track side - it's going to be that close,' said Dr Taylor. Last week, scientists revealed the dramatic moment that Rosetta's Philae comet lander bounced back into space has been captured in a remarkable image. Philae successfully landed on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, but not before a failure to launch its harpoons and a thruster caused it to bounce twice before settling. The blurry image captures the rapid motion in which Philae was bounced back. The probe was launched to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then to a much lower height of 65ft (20 metres) before coming to rest. True colours: The Max Planck Institute revealed the true colour of 67P (left).  On the right is an image taken taken by a Rosetta instrument dubbed Osiris . Reflection: This image, named 'Perihelion Cliff', shows a wall next to the robot, with reflections from Philae . Esa scientists also revealed a reprocessed Civa image taken by Philae  at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco. The image, named 'Perihelion Cliff', depicts one of the walls looming over the robot, with reflections from Philae shown by glare marks. Civa took sharper images of the 67P's terrain, but these were taken after the probe had fallen into a dark ditch, unable to get the sunlight it needed to recharge its batteries. Another image shows a reconstruction a model of Philae's final landing location. Rosetta engineers claim the plucky probe could come back to life as soon as March next year, as comet 67P gets closer to the sun. Toppled: In this graphic, Civa images have been used to construct a model of the final landing location. Scientists described the ground as being more like a 'trampoline' than rock, owing to its soft and powdery texture, which may have caused the unsteady landing .","This will be the closest Rosetta will come to 67P throughout its mission .

"A Chinese car manufacturer that billionaire Warren Buffet has a significant stake in suffered a mysterious plunge in share value. Shares in  BYD Co Ltd posted their biggest-ever single-day drop in Hong Kong on Thursday, wiping $1.2 billion from the Chinese car maker's market value and prompting it to hold emergency analyst calls. Various rumours swirled in the market but analysts said it was unclear what exactly drove the shares to their lowest close since June 2013. Shares of BYD, best known for making electric vehicles and 9.1 per cent owned by Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Energy Holdings Co, ended down 28.8 per cent at HK$25.05 in record trading volume, after falling up to 47 per cent in afternoon trade.

"Men taking the New York subway are being asked to sit more considerately as part of a new campaign to tackle 'manspreading on the city's public transport. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is set to unveil public service advertisements aimed at men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains. A poster will read: 'Dude...Stop the Spread, Please', alongside an image of two subway commuters forced to stand because a man is sitting in the typical 'manspread stance - legs splayed into a wide V-shape. Scroll down for video . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is set to unveil public service advertisements aimed at men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains . The campaign, which will carry the slogan, 'Courtesy Counts: Manners Make a Better Ride', is also targeting other subway users, such as those whose bulky backpacks get in the way of other riders. The new adverts come as more customers are crowding onto New York underground trains than at any other time in recent history. As many as 6.1 million riders were logged to have used the Subway on a single day in 2014, up from just under 5.1 million customers on the busiest day a decade ago. 'Manspreading' has become a hotly debated topic for subway riders, who go so far as to post photographs of the worst culprits on Twitter or even confront them on video. Last week, a reporter for The Gothamist set out to confront 'manspreaders' on the New York City subway . One commuter explains that his splay is to accommodate a bag, while another says that he is exhausted . Last week, a reporter for The Gothamist set out to confront 'manspreaders' on the New York City subway and did not have trouble finding interviewees. She asked each man  if they think their own 'leg splay' is appropriate given the people around them. Many insist this is not normal behavior. One commuter explains that his splay is to accommodate a bag, while another says that he is exhausted. And one defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space. Each man had their own ideas about when it was and wasn't appropriate to 'manspread' on the Subway . One man insisted it is biologically mandatory that men sit with their legs splayed when traveling on the trains . They are then asked to measure with a tape the appropriate amount of space allotted for a considerate 'manspread'. Here the results differ - from six inches to 18. The author of the report acknowledged that the MTA is about to launch a campaign to raise awareness about the issue, but added that 'we still have a long way to go. 'The next time you get on the train, look down at your own knees - how far apart are they? If there's space enough for a litter of puppies or a celebrity selfie group shot, you are taking up too much space. Pull it in. Don't make us find you.' Some insisted nobody around them appeared 'squished' when they spread their legs into a wide V-shape .","Posters are aimed at men who spread their legs and hog space on trains .

"Thirteen people have been injured after a known psychiatric patient drove into pedestrians shouting 'God is greatest' in Arabic in a French city. Two of those hit by the driver, who was believed to be drunk, were in a ‘very serious’ condition in the city of Dijon after being struck shortly after 8pm on Sunday night. The 40-year-old was arrested by police at the scene and may face terrorism charges, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Thirteen people were injured in Dijon when a psychiatric patient ploughed his car into a crowd of pedestrians. The 40-year-old, known to police in the area, was arrested at the scene . The incident comes days after a man was shot dead after entering a police station armed with a knife in another French town, slashing two officers while proclaiming his love of Islam. Speaking of the attack in Dijon last night, a police source said the man used a Renault Clio to run over 'as many people as he could' before being stopped. 'Many are suffering with very serious head injuries,’ the source added. Pictures showed the injured lying in the road around Place du Wilson as emergency vehicles and anti-terrorism officials arrived to take them to local hospitals. Among the injured was an 11-year-old child, according to local media. The man is known to police, and may have carried out a copycat attack based on terrorist related incidents in his home country, and in Australia. Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet confirmed that the man was a ‘psychiatric patient’ and used expressions including ‘Allahu Akbar’, or ‘God is Great’. He was also heard to say ‘For the Children of Palestine’, referring to deaths of more than 500 youngsters during the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip over the summer. ‘According to our information he was acting alone,’ said Mr Brandet. ‘He was arrested in the centre of the city, and was immediately placed in custody.’ He said the man, who has not yet been identified, ‘may face terrorist charges, but that will be a decision for the justice system.’ Local reports claim the man is thought to have been drunk when he launched the attack on the group of pedestrians . Investigators survey the scene at Place du President Wilson in Dijon. French authorities said the man, a known psychiatric patient in the area, may face terrorism charges . Dijon police arrested the 40-year-old man shortly after arriving at the scene this evening . Roads surrounding the square in the centre of Dijon remained closed for hours as police investigated . A visibly distressed woman is accompanied across the road by a police officer following the incident . The square in Dijon (pictured was cordoned off by police following the incident at around 8pm on Sunday . The driver was thought to be heading for a police station in Dijon, but only got as far as surrounding streets before his car was stopped. It follows security being stepped up at police and fire stations across France after a knife-wielding French convert to Islam was shot dead after attacking three police officers on Saturday. Bertrand Nzohabonayo was shot dead after entering a police station in the central town of Joue-les-Tours armed with a knife, seriously wounding two officers, including slashing one in the face. Nzohabonayo, who had posted an IS flag on his Facebook account, was a French national born in Burundi in 1994. He was also heard shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ during the assault, as local prosecutor Jean-Luc Beck said investigators would seek to determine whether ‘he acted alone or if he acted on orders.’ Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the scene of the attack on Saturday, saying he had ordered ‘security measures to be stepped up’ for all officers. The attack comes days after Bertrand Nzohabonayo was shot dead after entering a French police station with a knife and injuring two officers . Nzohabonayo had previously committed petty criminal offences but was not on a domestic intelligence watch-list. His brother was being watched, however, and had considered going to fight in Syria. Governments around the world have been braced for further ‘lone wolf’ attacks by individuals who show their support for IS, which now controls huge parts of Syria and Iraq. Last week in Sydney, Australia, Man Haron Monis , an Iranian-born Islamist with a history of extremism and violence entered a cafe and held people hostage for 16 hours. Three people, including the attacker, died in an assault by special forces. The main suspect in the murders of four people at Brussels’ Jewish Museum in May, is Mehdi Nemmouche, a Frenchman who spent more than a year fighting with extremists in Syria. Authorities in France believe around 1,200 French nationals are involved in jihadist networks in Iraq and Syria.

"Refutes claims: Cristina's lawyers say she is innocent of any wrongdoing (pictured arriving at court today) The Spanish king's sister, Cristina, will become the first member of the royal family ever to stand in the dock after a judge ordered her to stand trial for alleged tax fraud. The historic decision stemmed from four years of investigations that plunged the royal family into crisis and contributed to the abdication of King Juan Carlos in June. A court on the island of Majorca ordered Cristina, 49, to stand trial on two counts of accessory to tax fraud in connection with her husband's business affairs, in a written ruling seen by AFP. She is accused of cooperating in tax evasion by her husband, the former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin. He is accused of embezzling and laundering millions of euros in public funds. Cristina's lawyers say she is innocent of any wrongdoing. Cristina Federica de Borbon y Grecia is the youngest daughter of Juan Carlos and sixth in line to the throne. She married Urdangarin in 1997 in a glittering ceremony in Barcelona. The case is a big headache for Felipe who took the throne on June 19 promising an 'honest and transparent monarchy'. Public prosecutors had called on the court to shelve the case, saying there was a lack of evidence against Cristina and hinting that investigators were out to get the princess. But investigating magistrate Jose Castro at the court in Palma de Majorca upheld accusations brought by Manos Limpias, a litigious far-right pressure group. As well as Cristina and Urdangarin, the court on Monday ordered 15 other suspects to stand trial. Urdangarin is accused along with a former business partner of creaming off six million euros (£4.7million) in public funds from contracts awarded to Noos, a charitable foundation. Leaving court: Cristina Federica de Borbon y Grecia is the youngest daughter of Juan Carlos and sixth in line to the throne.

She married Urdangarin in 1997 in a glittering ceremony in Barcelona (pictured) Cristina sat on the board of Noos and Urdangarin was its chairman. Investigators suspect that a separate company jointly owned by the couple, Aizoon, served as a front for laundering embezzled money. Questioned in court by Castro in February, Cristina said she had simply trusted her husband and had no knowledge of his business affairs. A mother of four with a master's degree from New York University, Cristina was once considered untouchable as a member of the royal family. Happier times: Urdangarin (with Cristina after the birth of their fourth child, Irene, in 2005) is accused of embezzling and laundering millions of euros in public funds. Cristina's lawyers say she is innocent of any wrongdoing .

Royal Family: The case is a big headache for Felipe VI (far left, beside [left to right] wife Letizia, sisters Elena and Cristina and brother-in-law Urdangarin) who took the throne on June 19 promising an 'honest and transparent monarchy' But the so-called Noos affair fanned public anger against the monarchy and the ruling class during the recent years of economic hardship in Spain. The scandal soured the reign of Felipe's father Juan Carlos, who gave up the throne after 39 years so his son could freshen up the image of the monarchy. Investigations into the Noos affair were launched in 2010. Urdangarin and Cristina have been excluded from royal activities since 2011 when he was first named as a suspect in the probe.","Cristina Federica de Borbon y Grecia is King Felipe VI's younger sister .

"Murdered: NYPD officer Rafael Ramos tried to tell paramedics his name before losing consciousness, according to an ambulance worker on the scene . Fatally wounded NYPD officer Rafael Ramos tried in vain to tell paramedics his name before losing consciousness, the first EMT on the scene said yesterday. Tantania Alexander, 23, who works for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Volunteer Ambulance Corps, returned to the tragic setting where Ramos and fellow officer Wenjian Liu were murdered on Saturday. The pair were in their marked NYPD cruiser on a Brooklyn street when gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on them, then fled to a subway station where he committed suicide. Ms Alexander told the New York Post: 'I took charge of both patients. First was the driver [Ramos], he was in the car, his face was pushed to the side of the door. 'He was not moving. We called their names and no response. We pulled them out of the car onto backboards, and my partner started CPR. Each man had shots to the head. 'The driver was shot in the head, the chest and the thigh. [He] was conscious when I started working on him. He tried to tell me his name, and then he just went out.' The paramedic said Ramos was rushed to Woodhull Medical Center and was still alive when she left him in the hospital's trauma room. She describes the traumatic experience as an 'open wound' - claiming she still can't believe it happened. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said it is unlikely either cop had time to understand what was happening when killer Brinsley, an amateur rapper with a history of criminal convictions, stood by the front passenger window and fired a round of fatal shots into their heads. Both were taken to Brooklyn's Woodhull Medical Center where they were pronounced dead. Scroll down for video . Tragic setting: Forensic officers collect evidence at the scene where NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down while in their cruiser on Saturday . NYPD officer Wenjian Liu (left) was also killed by gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley in his depraved rampage . Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio met with Liu's parents and new bride at the hospital, and Ramos' teenage son, who 'couldn't comprehend what had happened'. 'Quite simply, they were assassinated,' Bratton told a press conference. Ramos, who celebrated his 40th birthday this month, joined the NYPD in 2012 after working as a school security officer. He was a lifelong Brooklyn resident, living in the same Cypress Hills section where he had grown up. He was married with two sons - one 13-year-old and another in college. His younger son, Jaden, posted a heart-wrenching tribute to his father on Facebook. He wrote: 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. Inconsolable: Rafael Ramos, pictured with his wife, (left) and youngest son Jaden (right) - who wrote on Facebook: 'I will always love you and I will never forget you.

'We have to move forward': Ramos' aunt Lucy Ramos told reporters the city needs to reach peace . 'I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.' Ramos' cousin, Ronnie Gonzalez, said the family has already forgiven the gunman. 'He's in the hands of God now,' Gonzalez said. 'We don't believe in vengeance, we just forgive.' Brinsley shot his former girlfriend in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday morning before traveling 190 miles to New York City with the same gun for his second attack. According to witnesses, Brinsley walked out of a home with a gun in his hand at 2.47pm, crept up behind the officers' patrol car, and systematically shot both men in the head through the passenger window. He then walked to the Myrtle/Willoughby G train subway station where he shot himself in the head. Murderer: Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who filled his online accounts with anti-police rhetoric, shot dead the two officers after traveling up from Baltimore, where he shot his girlfriend . Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand . The killings came two hours after he posted a picture of a gun on Instagram with the chilling message: 'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. 'They Take 1 Of Ours... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner (sic) #RIPMikeBrown. 'This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.' According to NBC, Brinsley - who was armed with a semi-automatic pistol bought in Georgia in 1996 - may have been visiting his child, who is based in Brooklyn. Gesture: New York Jets center Nick Mangold took to the stadium in an NYPD cap on yesterday . Worldwide statement: His message was broadcast across the world as he was filmed at the coin toss . Tributes: NYPD badges were seen strewn among the mementos, including Christmas wreaths and holly . Mourners attending last night's vigil sang This Little Light Of Mine and We Shall Overcome . Speaking at a press conference yesterday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce revealed a timeline which began with the shooting of an ex-girlfriend near Baltimore, and ended with Ismaaiyl's suicide on the subway platform. Describing the final moments, caught on surveillance cameras, he said: 'We have found on one of our videos two males who spoke with the perpetrator just prior to the event. 'He asks them three things: For their gang affiliation, he asks them to follow him on Instagram, then he says 'watch what I'm going to do'.

'He then walks north down on Tompkins, past the two officers in the car, circles back around, goes across the street, then comes up behind the officers.' Boyce added that Brinsley threatened to hang himself a year ago, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive. He said: 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month. 'Brinsley attempted suicide in the past and attempted to hang himself a year ago.' Last night, hundreds of New Yorkers gathered at the scene of the shooting with blue flowers, NYPD badges, Christmas wreaths and candles to pay tribute to officers Ramos and Liu. They sang This Little Light Of Mine and We Shall Overcome.

"Courtney Love's own father has made the sensational claim that his daughter was responsible for the death of Nirvana star Kurt Cobain - and he can prove it. Hank Harrison, the ex-manager of the Grateful Dead, said that while he can't prove his daughter pulled the trigger on the shotgun that ended the grunge star's life 20 -years ago, he 'can prove her involvement to a high degree of certainty.' Harrison, who is estranged from his rock-star daughter said that he became convinced she killed her own husband after the Seattle police released a note that Cobain held in his wallet mocking his wedding vows that called his wife a 'b***h with zits'. Daming: Hank Harrison with his daughter Courtney Love before their estrangement and before her marriage to Nirvana star Kurt Cobain in 1992 . Harrison told RadarOnline.com that he believes his 49-year-old daughter was complicit in her husband's death. Updated: Hank Harrison has said that his book Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain will be republished to include the proof of his daughters involvement . He is planning to publish his proof in his upcoming republished book, Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain. The final clue that sealed his opinion was the handwritten note inside the music legends wallet. 'Do you Kurt Cobain take Courtney Michelle Love to be your lawful shredded wife,' the note begins, 'even when she’s a b**ch with zits and siphoning all (your) money for doping and whoring.' Harrison, who is also suspicious of the Seattle police's motives for only releasing new evidence 20-years on, said that the note is key. 'If you read the true meaning of this small note, and place it in conjunction with the rest of the evidence, anyone with even half a wit will see that something dire and awful took place,' Harrison alleges. Indeed, his criticism of the Seattle police is strident. 'Nobody, except me, asked the obvious question: ‘Why weren’t they developed 20 years ago?’ he added to RadarOnline. 'They weren’t developed because the police had already decided it was a suicide and didn’t need any more evidence.' Just prior to April 1994: Kurt Cobain of Nirvana (right) with wife Courtney Love and daughter Frances Bean Cobain . Hank and Courtney's fractious relationship mirrored that of his with her mother Linda Carroll. The pair were hanging out together and tripping on LSD when their daughter, Courtney Michelle Harrison was born in 1964. They soon split and Love never became close with her father who specializes in medieval and Celtic history. The brief contact they did have was when he would mail her packages of of LSD and Ecstacy when she was living in Liverpool, England as a teenager. Harrison is banned from seeing Kurt and Courtney's daughter Frances Bean Cobain and has been concerned his daughter killed her own husband for years. 'She's a psychopath, she has a sociopathic personality like I do. I don't know who killed him. I know who benefited from his death: my daughter, for one,' said Harrison to NBC's Dateline in 2004. Indeed, the note found on Cobain has only add fuel to the fires of speculation regarding the circumstances of the grunge legend's suicide and what role his troubled marriage and personal life played in the final days of his life. Poetic play on words: This is the note that Kurt Cobain carried in his wallet that sarcastically mocked his marriage to wife Courtney Love . The release of the note by Seattle police last Friday is the latest revelation to come out of the departments decision to launch an internal review of the investigation into the rock star's death. Anticipating huge media interest over the 20th anniversary of the star's suicide by shotgun, the Seattle police have decided to release dozens of never-before-seen picture from the crime scene. They also released for the first time, the investigative detective's full report on the re-opening of the case - which came to the same conclusion of suicide, two decades on. However, the sarcastic note will provide fans and conspiracy theorists hours of debate as they attempt to decipher the meaning behind the words. Was the note written in anger by a resentful Cobain, desperate to escape his unhappy marriage? Or was it a play on words penned with the knowledge of Love, that the musician carried around to remind him of their unconventional bond? Those who believe that Love was involved in her husband's death will point to the fact that the content and tone of this note wildly differs from his handwritten suicide note. New evidence: In March police in Seattle announced that new photographs of the scene of Kurt Cobain's suicide have been uncovered and developed . Scene: A police officer stands guard on the back porch of Kurt Cobain's garage where Cobain's body was found early 08 April 1994 in Seattle, WA, after an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound . The short marriage parody calls his wife a 'b****' who is 'siphoning money for doping and whoring.' This is in stark contrast to his believed suicide note which calls Love a 'goddess....who sweats ambition and empathy.' Adding to the scuzzy appeal of the note, it is written on paper from the Phoenx Hotel in San Francisco's gritty, crime-infested Tenderloin district. The Phoenix's reputation is that of an achingly cool refuge for poets and artists, very much like New York's infamous Chelsea Hotel. And earlier this month on the eve of the 20th anniversary of Kurt Cobain's suicide, the Seattle Police Department released a cache of never-before- scene photos showing the room where the Nirvana frontman was found dead in April 1994. In March, the law enforcement agency announced that it had developed 35 photos taken by officers who responded to Cobain's Seattle-area home two decades ago. A set of photographs made public by police show the troubled singer's suicide note the way he left it before taking his life April 8, 1994. CBS News reported that most of the photographs were shot on a 35mm film, which has become discolored over the years, giving the images a greenish hue. A few of the pictures were taken with a Polaroid, among them outside shots of Cobain's garage.","Hank Harrison is the estranged father of Courtney Love and used to be the manager The Grateful Dead .

"It's the holy grail for Harry Potter and Star Trek fans, but it seems a bright blue headed lizard has already developed its own invisibility cloak. Biologists were baffled as to how male Iberian emerald lizards have evolved their vivid blue and green colouring. While the brightly coloured skin it useful for attracting a mate, it should also make them easy for predators to spot. However, researchers from the University of Valencia in Spain and the Unviersity of Porto, Portugal, have found that these 15 inch long lizards have a secret weapon against hungry birds of prey - their own cloaking device. Iberian emerald lizard's skin makes the invisible from above but gives them bright colours at ground level . They discovered that the lizards' skin is iridescent and reflects light in different ways depending on the angle it is viewed from. Scientists from the University of Rochester have discovered a way to hide large objects from sight using inexpensive and readily available lenses. Their device, called the Rochester Cloak, uses four lenses in a line at specific distances from each other to make objects at the right distance appear invisible. It is one of the first cloaking methods to hide objects in three directions when viewed at varying angles in visible light. They constructed the £600 device they aligned the lenses at a precise length. The lenses then need to be paired up and separated by the sum of their focal lengths - which is the distance from the lens that an object comes into focus. Doing this will make objects that are placed between the third and fourth lens, or specific positions between the others, invisible. The background behind the equipment, however, will remain visible when viewed through other lenses. Scaling up the sizes of the lenses can then also increase the size of the cloaking effect. When viewed from above, the creatures blend into their background and become almost invisible to birds. However, when viewed from ground level, the lizards still stand out brightly - meaning fellow lizards can easily spot those looking for mate. Dr Guillem Pérez i de Lanuza, a biologist at the University of Porto, say their findings are the first evidence of iridescent colours being used by animals to alter their visibility depending on viewing angle. He said: 'Our results suggest that the blue heads are less striking for a bird above the lizard than a lizard in the same plane. 'Birds see a less UV pure colour that is more whitish and less chromatically conspicuous when seeing the lizards from above. 'It seems that birds may be the more probable predators of these relatively large lizards - some snakes and probably mammals, which see lizards horizontally, can also predate on lizards, but more probably only on young lizards, which do not show the conspicuous blue heads.' Iberian emerald lizards, also named Lacerta schreibeiri, are mainly found in the open rocky shrubland in the mountainous areas of northern Spain and Portugal. They are currently classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List and mainly eats insects and other small lizards. While the females tend to remain fairly well camouflaged against the rock and shrubs that fill the landscape where they live, the males develop vivid green bodies and bright blue heads as they reach sexual maturity. As these reptiles hunt during the day, it means the males should be highly conspicuous. The male Iberian emerald lizard has a blue head and green body that the plain brown and green females find irresistible, but these bright colours actually help them blend into their background when viewed from above . The scientists measured the light reflected from the skin of male Iberian emerald lizards (labelled L) from different angles and found that birds of prey (labelled P), which normally see the lizards from above, find harder to see than female lizards (C) which will tend to be on the same level on the ground with the males . The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Naturwissenschaften, used 10 captured adult males from the Tejera Negra Mountains in Spain and measured the light reflected from their skin at different angles. They found that when viewed from the same level, the lizard's skin reflected the widest spectrum of light, making them appear more colourful. However, when viewed from above, their skin appeared far duller and reflected less light, particularly in the blue and ultraviolet end of the spectrum. As birds tend to see far more ultraviolet light than humans, this should make the lizards harder to see. However, the difference in reflection is difficult for human eyes to see vision in birds is quite different from our own. Physicists have been trying to create material that works like Harry Potter's invisibility cloak for decades but it appears the Iberian emerald lizard has cracked the problem already to hide itself from avian predators . The scientists then compared the amount of contrast the lizards had against different backgrounds found in their habitat, such as rock, wood and the laurel-leaved rock rose and the dried leaves from the Pyrenean oak. They found that the lizards' blue heads were far more conspicious to other lizards on the same plane as the lizards than to birds of prey flying above. This suggests their brightly coloured iridescent skin actually helps the male lizards to blend into their background. Dr Pérez i de Lanuza said their results suggested that if birds were able to view the lizards from the ground, however, they would find them easy to spot, while lizards would struggle to find potential mates if they viewed from above. This ability to direct certain colours of light in specific directions is what has allowed the lizards to develop such bright skin for attracting partners without being targetted by predators. Dr Pérez i de Lanuza said the iridescence is thought to be caused by pigments that are produced in the skin rather than the structure of the scales themselves. Although the lizard seems to stand out against the rocks shrubs of its normal habitat in the mountains of northern Spain and Italy, to birds that see more in the ultraviolet spectrum, they become hard to spot . This could allow scientists to develop new types of camouflage for the military if it can be adapted. Dr Pérez i de Lanuza said: 'Based on the data available, skin structures responsible for structural colours don’t change seasonally. 'These colours are developed during lizard development and often appear at maturity and may be modified with growth also in adults. 'Probably, the seasonal changes in this kind of colours is caused by the pigment components that interact with structures to generate animal structural colours.' Dr Pérez i de Lanuza said that their findings could also provide new ways of looking at iridescence in other species such as butterflies, snakes, birds and fish. He said: 'Assuming that the iridescence of blue heads is selected positively by the interaction of natural selection and sexual selection, we can hypothesize that the fact that birds can see the UV spectrum is one of the causes that favour iridescence. 'We think that this phenomenon may be more widely distributed. For instance, more insects and birds show iridescent colours, often with more striking changes in colour appearance depending on the angle of vision than lizard blue heads.'","Iberian emerald lizard is almost invisible to birds when viewed from above .

"Love them or hate them, the chances are that you will eat at least one Brussels sprout this Christmas. And now there's more to go round, because growers of the festive vegetable claim that the are the largest in a decade - at up to 30 per cent larger than usual - thanks to extra sunshine in September and October. While many may lament larger sprouts, experts claim they are in fact sweeter and tastier. Scroll down for video . Big and sweet: Growers of Brussels sprouts claim that they are at the largest in a decade, at up to 30 per cent larger than usual, thanks to ‘extra’ sunshine in September and October . Experts say that ‘near perfect growing conditions’ are responsible for the super-sized sprouts - citing unexpected extra sunshine, as well as just the right amount of rain and cooler temperatures later in autumn, as reasons for the bumper crop. Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, a product of the glucosinolates. While research is ongoing, studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer. This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties. ‘Not only are the sprouts generally larger this year but the overall quality is also better because of all the extra sunshine,’ Tesco vegetable buyer Luke Shutler said. ‘The larger size also means less work in the kitchen as the bigger they are the easier they will be to peel. ‘We also think that customers might find that they taste sweeter than in recent years.’ As a result, Tesco expects the vegetable to be more in demand than ever this year. It’s estimated that as much as 80 per cent of total British sprout sales take place in the two week Christmas and New Year period. An unconventional Christmas cake: Unexpected extra sunshine in September and October as well as just the right amount of rain and cooler temperatures later in autumn has led to a bumper crop. Growers say that the weather conditions have made the sprouts sweeter and they can even be used in cakes (pictured) British sprout growers are set to produce 7,000 tons of sprouts, or 50 million individual sprouts, which is the weight of 600 London buses. TH Clements, which is based in Benington, near Boston in Lincolnshire, is one of the UK’s largest suppliers of brassica, including Brussels sprouts. Brassica is a genus of plants in the mustard family and members include other cruciferous vegetables such as cabbages and the mustard plant. Richard Mowbray, commercial manager for TH Clements said: 'Not only did we have plenty of sunshine during the summer and into the autumn but also regular amounts of rainfall which created near enough perfect growing conditions. ‘Apart from being whoppers we believe this year’s sprouts taste sweeter and we have even taken to baking sprout cakes for staff and friends.’ Growers at TH Clements have made 'sprout cakes' for friends. Ingredients: . Two eggs, 150g sugar, ½ tsp cinnamon, 100ml vegetable oil, 125g self-raising flour, 125g carrots, 125g Brussels sprouts, 25g walnuts (or other nuts), 50g Dried Mixed fruit and ½ tsp fresh ginger, grated . Method: . • Beat the eggs, sugar and oil for a couple of minutes. • Add the flour, cinnamon, ginger and carry on mixing for a further minute. • Fold in the grated carrots, Brussels sprouts, nuts and mixed fruit . • Cook in the oven at 180C for 50 to 60 minutes until cooked in the middle . Hate sprouts? You've got a new excuse: A chemistry teacher argues that there may be a chemical and genetic reason why some people can’t stand the taste of Brussels sprouts . A chemistry teacher has created an infographic explaining the chemistry and genetics behind why some people can’t stand the taste of bitter vegetables. Those who loathe the seasonal greens, Andy Brunning explains, may be especially sensitive to naturally occurring chemical compounds called glucosinolates. The Bournemouth-based teacher, who runs the blog Compound Interest, explained that these compounds are broken down into chemicals called isothiocyanates when the vegetable is cooked. These compounds, while bitter to everyone, taste especially unpalatable to almost three quarters of humans. 'If you’re a Brussels sprouts hater, you can now suggest a potential chemical reason for your dislike if you’re ever berated for your perceived vegetable prejudice,’ he writes. Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, which is a product of the glucosinolates. While research is ongoing, it suggests that sulforaphanes may protect against neurodegenerative diseases and even cancer. This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigate for its antioxidant properties.","Sprouts are the largest in a decade thanks to 'perfect' growing conditions .

"Police departments across the U.S. are warning officers to wear bulletproof vests, not to patrol alone and to avoid making arrests 'unless absolutely necessary' after two NYPD cops were shot dead inside their patrol car this weekend. It came as New York City's mayor, Bill de Blasio, begged protesters to stop their activities while the city and police department recovers. The slayings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on Saturday afternoon in Brooklyn heightened fears about the safety of law enforcement officials nationwide, though there is no evidence any threats are imminent. It came as NYPD Commissioner BIll Brattom and de Blasio appeared together to praise the work of the NYPD, and call for protests to be suspended until the murdered officers' funerals can take place later this month. The gunman, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, had inflamed tensions by vowing in in an Instagram post to put 'wings on pigs' as retaliation for the recent slayings of black men at the hands of white police. Brinsley was black; the slain New York Police Department officers were Hispanic and Asian. Scroll down for videos . Warnings: Police stand guard at a memorial on Sunday, near to where the two officers were gunned down in Brooklyn on Saturday. Officers across the country are now on high alert . Show of unity: Embattled mayor Bill de Blasio put his hand on NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton's shoulder as they recalled protests and tensions in 1970s Boston . After the deaths, a union-generated message at the NYPD warned officers that they should respond to every radio call with two cars - 'no matter what the opinion of the patrol supervisor' - and not make arrests 'unless absolutely necessary'. The president of the detectives union told members in a letter to work in threes when out on the street, wear bulletproof vests and keep aware of their surroundings. Another directive warned officers in Newark, New Jersey, not to patrol alone and to avoid people looking for confrontations. At the same time, a memo from an NYPD chief asked officers to limit their comments 'via all venues, including social media, to expressions of sorrow and condolence'. Trainees in the NYPD academy have also been warned not to be seen in their uniforms in case it makes them a target, ABC News reported. In Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey urged the leaders of protests over the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown to 'call for calm and not let this escalate any further.' In Boston, Police Commissioner William Evans said police issued an alert to officers to warn them about the New York City slayings and added that the department had issued several alerts following the decision by the Ferguson grand jury. Meanwhile in a Monday press conference, Bill de Blasio attempted to put a halt on anti-police protests. He said: 'It's time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time.' NYPD officers: The gunman  fired a fatal round of bullets at Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) Gunman: Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, shot the cops dead after vowing to put 'wings on pigs' on Instagram . Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand . At a news conference in New York on Sunday, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce detailed Brinsley's long criminal record, hatred for police and the government and apparent history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago. Brinsley had at least 19 arrests in Georgia and Ohio, spent two years in prison for gun possession and had a troubled childhood so violent that his mother was afraid of him, police said. He ranted online about authority figures and expressed 'self-despair and anger at himself and where his life was,' Boyce said. Investigators are trying to determine if Brinsley had taken part in any protests over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose names he invoked in his online threat, or simply latched onto the cause for the final act in a violent rampage. The slayings come at a tense time as police nationwide are being criticized following Garner's death in a New York officer's chokehold and Brown's fatal shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. Protests erupted in recent weeks after grand juries declined to charge the officers involved. First attack: Shaneka Thompson, 29, was Ismaaiyl Brinsley's first target in his bloody rampage on Saturday . Hours before shooting the officers, Brinsley had shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend, Shaneka Thompson, at her home in Baltimore. Thompson's neighbor Yevette Seay told The Associated Press that Thompson's screams for help early Saturday jolted her out of bed. 'He shot me! I don't want to die. I don't want to die,' Seay recalled Thompson saying. Seay called 911 as Thompson lay on the floor, clutching her stomach. Authorities have said Thompson is expected to survive. After leaving Baltimore, authorities said, Brinsley took a bus north to New York City and used Thompson's phone to write on Instagram: 'They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs.' He ended the post with references to the Brown and Garner cases. Once in New York and shortly before he opened fire on the officers, Brinsley walked up to people on the street and asked them to follow him on Instagram, then told them, 'Watch what I'm going to do,' Boyce said.

Then he approached the squad car and fired four shots, killings the policemen. He ran into the subway station and committed suicide. At the site of the shooting Sunday, a makeshift memorial with an NYPD baseball cap, flowers, teddy bears and candles lay in remembrance of the officers. Ramos' 13-year-old son, Jaden, said in a Facebook post that Saturday was the worst day of his life. 'Today I had to say bye to my father,' Jaden wrote. 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help.' The grieving son of a New York City police officer shot dead execution style on a Brooklyn street Saturday posted a heart-wrenching goodbye to his slain father to Facebook. Jaden Ramos, 13, will never see his father Rafael Ramos again after he was murdered along with his partner 'just for being a police officer,' heartbroken Ramos said.

"Arrested 19 times: Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, had an extensive rap sheet in multiple states, documents reveal . The murderer who assassinated two NYPD officers threatened to shoot a pair of Con ed workers, who tried to tackle him - raising his gun and shouting: 'You want some of this?' The unnamed men had been working in Bedford-Stuyvesant - close to where Ismaaiyl Brinsley gunned down officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos at around 3pm on Saturday. The shocked workers witnessed the depraved killer ambush and open fire into the passenger's side of the police car and decided to follow him in their Con Ed truck as he fled the scene. Despite Brinsley still holding his silver Taurus semi-automatic - the brave men confronted him on the street and attempted to stop him, the New York Post reports. They only backed away when Brinsley raised his gun and threatened to shoot them - and they watched as he ran into the Myrtle/Willoughby G train subway station nearby. The Con Ed workers were able to tip off police as to Brinsley's whereabouts and have been commended for their efforts. One law enforcement source told the New York Post: 'That’s how the cops knew he was in there.' When police pursuing Brinsley ran into the subway station, the killer, who had been standing on the platform waiting for a train, turned the gun on himself. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, is said to have asked passers-by to follow him on Instagram saying to some 'watch what I'm going to do' before killing the two men. The 28-year-old had earlier posted to the social network boasting that he would take the lives of two policemen. Scroll down for video . NYPD officers: The gunman  fired a fatal round of bullets at Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) Followed him: Two Con Ed workers who witnessed Brinsley shooting the police officers tailed him in their truck and bravely attempted to stop him . Brave: The Con Ed employees jumped out their truck (like the one pictured) and tried to tackle Brinsley - but he raised his gun and threatened to shoot them, forcing them to back away . He wrote:  'I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today. 'They Take 1 Of Ours... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice #RIPErivGardner (sic) #RIPMikeBrown. 'This May Be My Final Post. I'm Putting Pigs In A Blanket.' Just hours later, he walked up behind the patrol car of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, parked up in Brooklyn, then fired four bullets at their heads, 'execution style'. It has since emerged Brinsley had already been arrested 19 times for offenses including concealing a weapon, disorderly conduct, and trespassing. 'Funny and intelligent'? A close friend of killer Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, described him as a nice guy and said he was cowardly for lashing out at officers . Charges: He was detained for, among other things, disorderly conduct, theft, and concealing weapons . Before: This picture and chilling message was posted on the alleged shooter's page two hours beforehand . He had also threatened to hang himself, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive. Speaking at a press conference yesterday, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce revealed a timeline which began with the shooting of an ex-girlfriend near Baltimore, and ended with Ismaaiyl's suicide on a subway platform. Describing the final moments, caught on surveillance cameras, he said: 'We have found on one of our videos two males who spoke with the perpetrator just prior to the event. Tributes: Dozens of flowers were left on the sidewalk near the site of the killing yesterday . Tributes: NYPD badges were seen strewn among the mementos, including Christmas wreaths and holly .

'He then walks north down on Tompkins, past the two officers in the car, circles back around, goes across the street, then comes up behind the officers.' Boyce added: 'His mother ... states he had a very troubled childhood and was often violent. His mother expressed fear of him and she hasn't seen him in one month.

He has  served jail time in Georgia and Ohio and it has also emerged today that has admitted to suffering mental health problems in the past. During a court hearing in Georgia's Cobb County in 2011, Brinsley was asked whether he had been in an institution or undergone treatment by mental health professionals, according to the New York Times. He answered yes. Police today revealed a timeline of Ismaaiyl Brinsley's movements on a day that began with the unauthorized entry into his ex-girlfriend's flat and ended with his suicide in a Brooklyn subway station: . 5.30am . Enters apartment of ex-girlfriend Shaneka Thompson in Owings Mills, Maryland with a key he should not have had. They argue. 5.50am . Brinsley fires a single shot at Thompson, reportedly into her stomach. He flees with her cell phone. 6.05am . Brinsley calls Thompson's mother to apologize for shooting her. He claims it is an accident, and that he hopes she lives. 6.35am . Baltimore County Police begins monitoring him. They track Thompson's cellphone to the I-95 freeway, where he is believed to have been riding a bus. During the journey he keeps phoning Thompson's mom, and reveals he is headed to New York City. 10.50am .

"Air New Zealand has issued a stern warning to staff after a handful of employees created a scandal with a series of drunken episodes. Four flight attendants resigned last week after a booze-fuelled night in Wellington reportedly led to one of the crew being recorded in an ‘intimate’ video. In the wake of employees’ well-publicised exploits the airline has cracked down on drinking, punished those who breached its code of conduct and told remaining staff to be on their best behaviour. Scroll down for video . Air New Zealand has been forced to deal with a series of incidents involving intoxicated employees . New Zealand’s flag carrier launched an investigation after the heavy drinking session came to light, the Herald on Sunday reported. The flight attendants had dinner with two pilots during an overnight stop in the capital on 31 October and continued to drink after the pilots had left. According to the newspaper, one became so drunk she reportedly had to be carried back to a hotel, and an ‘intimate’ video was recorded during the night. The investigation culminated with the four being stood down before resigning for breaching the airline’s code of conduct. The airline investigated reports that a flight attendant 'straddled' All Blacks fullback Israel Dagg (pictured) In an unrelated incident, another employee resigned after failing a breath test before working on a flight. Last month, the airline launched an investigation into reports that an intoxicated off-duty flight attendant ‘straddled’ All Blacks fullback Israel Dagg while she was a passenger on a plane. Following an investigation the flight attendant was warned and allowed to return to work, and the airline said suggestions that an off-duty crew member performed ‘any kind of dance’ were incorrect. After that incident management immediately stopped the consumption of alcohol for cabin crew working on short- and mid-haul flights. Air New Zealand cabin crew have been ordered to stop consuming alcohol on short- and mid-haul flights . In July, crew assigned to fly stranded passengers from Hawaii to Auckland were accused of drinking heavily and becoming unfit for duty if the plane had been airworthy, the Herald on Sunday reported. Bruce Parton, the carrier’s chief operations officer, told the newspaper: ‘Regrettably over the past two months we have had two isolated incidents involving cabin crew who were not operating at the time. ‘As a result of these two isolated issues all cabin crew are being reminded of the standards expected of them.'","Staff warned after a series of scandals involving intoxicated employees .

And three tight ends are also struggling with Joseph Fauria (ankle), Eric Ebron (hamstring) and Brandon Pettigrew (undisclosed) all doubts. ‘It just depends on what happens here in the next day or so. Brandon is the big question mark, 48 hours can make a tremendous difference,’ Caldwell said. He rated Fauria and Ebron as having ‘a very slim chance’ of playing against the Atlanta Falcons. Johnson, who is recovering from an ankle injury, throws the ball during training at their hotel in Bagshot . Eric Ebron (right), seen here chatting to Johnson, is also an injury doubt due to a hamstring problem .

"His parents are undoubtedly one of the most famous and best loved couples in the world. But as the Beckham family sat centre stage at Elton John’s winter wedding yesterday it wasn’t Victoria and David getting all the attention, it was their 15-year-old son, Brooklyn. Looking dapper in a navy suit and tie, gone was the baby-faced teenager and in his place was a stylish young man, seemingly well on his way to adulthood. Scroll down for video . Brooklyn Beckham has become increasingly famous in his own right in 2014. He posted this picture of himself and his designer mother, Victoria, at Elton John's wedding to his new Instagram account on Sunday . Over the last twelve months it is safe to say that Brooklyn has done some pretty serious growing up. Now, far from being over-shadowed by his parents' fame, it seems his is well on the way to becoming a celebrity in his own right. When he posted a picture of himself and his designer mother at the wedding to his recently opened Instagram account it garnered over three thousand likes in just a few hours. Likes which some might say are pretty symbolic of his growing popularity - Brooklyn only opened his account a few weeks ago and already he has over 12,000 followers. Brooklyn attended the Harper's Bazaar Women Of The Year Awards in November 2013 as his mother's plus 1 . Earlier this year Brooklyn sat front row at his mother's SS2015 show in New York alongside his father, David Beckham and Vogue editor Anna Wintour . Brooklyn's transformation first started in November 2013. When Victoria took him as her date to the Harper's Bazaar Women of the year awards, proudly showing him off to the press. Then in September he made headlines when he hit the FROW at his mother's SS2015 show in New York, taking a coveted seat alongside his famous father and Vogue head honcho Anna Wintour. In October he even took part in his first ever solo photo shoot for New York Times Style Magazine, looking very much the spitting image of his famous father. In August Brooklyn attended the If I Stay premiere in LA. Rumoured girlfriend Chloe Moretz stars in the film . Brooklyn will reportedly join Arsenal's training academy in March when he turns 16 . His rumoured relationship with Chloe Moretz, 17- neither part have confirmed or denied that they are together - has also helped to boost his profile.

One of a handful of appearances this year where neither his mother or father played chaperone. He also attended the premiere of If I Stay (in which Chloe stars) without them in Hollywood in August. But despite this move into the limelight Brooklyn, it seems, remains grounded. In fact, it has been widely reported that he has a job in a local coffee shop which apparently pays him just £2.68 an hour. He is also a hands-on big brother to his younger siblings Cruz, nine, and Romeo, 12, and sister Harper, three, often photographed carrying and cuddling her. Brooklyn leaves Dylan's Candy Bar in November 2008 with his Mother . And he still enjoys the same hobbies that most young teenagers enjoy such as skateboarding and hanging out with his friends.

"A former party girl shed an incredible 5st 7lb in just eight months after overhearing a friend insulting her at a Christmas party. Caroline Gooster was left devastated when it was remarked that she would 'hoover up' any leftovers at a festive gathering - and decided to that at 16st 2lb  she needed to lose weight. The now svelte 24-year-old admits her teenage lifestyle of binge drinking and takeaways caused her to balloon to a size 18. Scroll down for video . Caroline has managed to drop from 16st 2lb (left) to a slim 10st 9lb (right) in just eight months . On her first holiday abroad Caroline was too ashamed of her body to wear a swimsuit . Despite trying fad diets, Caroline from Irvine, Ayrshire, couldn't stick to a regime for longer than two weeks and became even more miserable. Even after her first foreign holiday where she covered up in sweltering 30 degree heat, it wasn't until she overheard the cruel 'joke' that she decided to act. Caroline said: 'I heard one of my friends whisper ""don't worry about the leftovers - Caroline will hoover them up"". 'I was mortified - I nearly broke down in tears there and then. 'I knew I was big but didn't realise what other people thought of me - especially what I considered to be a friend. 'Ironically, that nasty comment gave me the motivation to start and continue losing weight. 'Whenever I lost motivation or wanted to eat a burger I'd say to myself ""no, I'll show her"" - and I did.' At her heaviest, Caroline ate almost 4,000 calories a day getting through six rounds of white toast, two packets of crisps and snacking on cake and ice cream. By ditching her party girl ways in favour of a healthy diet of fresh foods Caroline (left, before and right, after losing weight) has totally transformed her body and how she feels about herself . As a result, she reached a dress size 18 and became even more miserable, resorting to comfort eating. When she went on her first holiday abroad in May 2013, Caroline dreaded what to wear and settled for covering up as much skin as possible. She said: 'Whenever I did wear anything showing a bit of skin, I felt so uncomfortable like everyone was staring and laughing. 'When I got home I looked through the pictures and couldn't believe they were me. Caroline (left before she lost weight and right, today) swapped dinners of macaroni, chips and garlic bread for chicken breasts, vegetables and sweet potatoes and discovered a love of running . 'I knew I was big but I looked horrible. 'The main reason I'd gained so much weight was my teenage ""party girl"" years. 'Every weekend I'd go out, binge drink and wolf down takeaways - pizzas and burgers were my favourite.' As soon as the New Year came, a determined Caroline bought a cross trainer and returned to a healthy eating regime. But after a month of dieting, she started to get bored, but this time, instead of quitting, she signed up to the Cambridge Weight Plan. With the help of her consultant she swapped dinners of macaroni, chips and garlic bread for chicken breasts, vegetables and sweet potatoes. In place of oil drenched packets of crisps and sweets for snacks, Caroline now grazes on apples and grapes. Breakfast: 4 slice of white bread toasted with butter. Morning snack: 1 or 2 packets of walkers crisps. Lunch: Noodles and 2 slice toast with butter. Afternoon snack: Handful of sweets e.g. Haribo etc. Dinner: Macaroni, chips and garlic bread. Pudding: Ice cream or cake or both . Breakfast: Porridge . Mid-morning snack: Apple . Lunch: Homemade butternut squash soup with wholemeal roll. Afternoon snack: 130g of grapes. Dinner: Chicken breast, sweet potato and veg. Supper: One slice of wholemeal toast with low fat spread . A newly energised Caroline said: 'After my first week on Cambridge, I lost a massive 7lbs. 'I realised this was the diet for me and I just kept dropping 5lb or 3lb each week. 'Of course there were a few weekend slip-ups but with the help of my consultant I just picked my spirits up and carried on. 'Coupled with that I just remembered what my ""friend"" had said and that just spurred me on even more. 'At the start I was doing light exercise, but as I increased the amount of food I ate I started to introduce more.

"Almost 11 million of Britons who buy a frozen turkey for their Christmas dinner leave it in an unsafe place - including the garage - to defrost. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) revealed 69 per cent have been thawing their bird in unsuitable places such as the bath and the garden shed. It has declared today National Defrost Your Turkey Day, reminding cooks that a typical large turkey weighing 11kg will take two days to thaw. Scroll down for video. A study by the Food Standards Agency revealed 69% of Britons are thawing their frozen turkey incorrectly . Start defrosting today: A typical large turkey weighing 11kg will take two days to thaw . Just one in four of those who bought a frozen turkey safely defrosted it in the fridge, leaving the rest putting themselves and their families at risk of food poisoning. The agency warned that incorrect thawing provided a platform for bacteria such as campylobacter to spread, leaving a turkey dinner that 'looks and tastes delicious but contains a hidden risk that can't be seen, tasted or smelled'. FSA head of foodborne disease Kevin Hargin said: 'We all love our turkey dinner at Christmas and this year should be no exception. 'It's the little things you do that can make a real difference. So if you make sure that your turkey is defrosted safely and in good time, you can enjoy your meal happily and safely.' If your turkey is partially frozen it may not cook evenly. Harmful bacteria such as campylobacter could survive the cooking process. Defrosting should be done in the fridge and separated from touching other foods, with a container large enough to catch the defrosted juices. Work out defrosting time in advance, so you know how much time to allow – it can take at least a couple of days for a large turkey to thaw. When you start defrosting, take the turkey out of its packaging, put it on a large dish and cover. The dish will hold the liquid that comes out of the thawing turkey. Remove the giblets and the neck as soon as possible to speed up the thawing process. Wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw turkey, giblets or any other raw meat. Before cooking, make sure there aren't any ice crystals in the cavity. Test the thicker parts of the turkey with a fork to tell whether the meat feels frozen. Turkey (and any other poultry) is best defrosted in a covered dish at the bottom of the fridge so that it can't drip onto other foods. Pour away the liquid that comes out of the defrosting turkey regularly to stop it overflowing and spreading bacteria. Be careful not to splash the liquid onto worktops, dishes, cloths or other food. Bear in mind what else is you have stored in the fridge. Cooked meats need to be covered and stored higher up. More than half of us have been thawing the Christmas bird in the garden shed (pictured) Campylobacter, pictured under the microscope, is the group of bacteria commonly associated with causing food poisoning. They are usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry . Campylobacter is the group of bacteria commonly associated with causing food poisoning. They are usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry. More than 3,000 cases of campylobacter were confirmed in England and Wales between late December 2013 and the start of January, according to FSA figures. The FSA advises that those preparing a turkey from frozen should follow the retailer's recommended defrosting time and defrost the bird in the fridge if possible or somewhere cool to slow the growth of germs. The turkey should be covered while defrosting, either within the original packaging or in a container to hold any thawing juices at the bottom of the fridge to avoid cross-contamination. It warns that turkey should be defrosted thoroughly as otherwise it may not cook evenly and harmful bacteria could survive the cooking process.","Today is the inaugural National Defrost Your Turkey Day .

The comedy stars James Franco and Seth Rogen as journalists who assassinate North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Earlier this month, Sony cancelled The Interview's premiere and delayed its 25 December release date, after  hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it. Four of the five major North American theatres chains - Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal Cinemas, and AMC Entertainment - also announced plans to pull the film. President Barack Obama said  Sony had 'made a mistake' in their decision to pull the film, to which Mr Lynton responded: 'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed.' During an interview with CNN, Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton (pictured) said the movie will be released, but it just needs to work out the best way of doing so. A statement from the firm added it was 'actively surveying alternatives to release the movie on a different platform' For example, the company owns video site Crackle (pictured), and could use that as a way to release the film online. Elsewhere, Mr Lynton said YouTube (right) was another option. But the firm may equally choose a subscription service, such as Netflix, to recoup some of the costs of the movie . Mr Lynton added: 'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet. But it's going to be distributed,' citing a digital release as a viable option.

Following the announcement of the film, the North Korean government is said to have issued statements warning against the film’s release to executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment. On 24 November 24, the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer network was breached, and employees were shown an image that revealed they had been hacked by a group called Guardians of Peace, or GOP. GOP said it had obtained, as well as wiped, data from Sony's servers including email exchanges between chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin. Other leaked documents revealed personal information about Sony employees, as well as pay details of actors, and copies of upcoming films including Brad Pitt’s Fury, Mike Leigh’s Mr. Turner plus a script for the newest James Bond film. On 24 November 24, the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer network was breached. The hackers said it had obtained, as well as wiped, data from Sony's servers including email exchanges between chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin. Other leaked documents included copies of upcoming films . The hackers then made demands and warned that the 'world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th September 2001.' Sony  cancelled the premiere of The Interview and four of the five major North American theatres chains - Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal Cinemas, and AMC Entertainment - announced plans to pull the film. Social media accounts, designed to promote the film, were taken offline and Sony said it would be delay the film's theatrical release. A statement from the FBI then explicitly linked the attack to the Korean regime, saying  technical details from the hack have Korean hallmarks. But Kim Jong-un's officials responded by calling FBI claims a 'fabrication', and describing U.S. actions as 'gangster-like'. North Korea called the hack a 'righteous deed' - and reiterated that it 'highly esteems' the attack - but said it had no idea where it came from. President Barack Obama said  Sony had 'made a mistake' in their decision to pull the film, to which Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton responded: 'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed.' Mr Lynton added, however: 'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. 'But it's going to be distributed.' But, Mr Lynton added that no 'major video on-demand distributor' had so far come forward or said it was willing to distribute the film. A statement from the firm added it was 'actively surveying alternatives to release the movie on a different platform.' 'It is still our hope that anyone who wants to see this movie will get the opportunity to do so,' the statement continued. Google, which owns YouTube, is not commenting on the claims. Netflix, and Sony have not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Online content site Ownzones told MailOnline that it is willing to release the film. The company has previously streamed feature-length content and said it is familiar with the premium content model. Ownzone's said it also wishes to work with Sony to ensure that a percentage of the proceeds from distribution are donated to a charity supporting the freedom of speech. Earlier this month, Sony cancelled The Interview's premiere and delayed its 25 December release date, after hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it. The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie also pulled it after these threats . On Friday, FBI officials  explicitly linked the hack to the Korean regime, saying  technical details from the hack have Korean hallmarks. But Kim Jong Un's officials responded by calling FBI claims a 'fabrication', and describing US actions as 'gangster-like'. The government also claimed to have 'clear evidence' the US government engineered the project as a 'propaganda' attack against North Korea. North Korea then threatened more attacks against the US government and other American institutions. Referring to America as a 'cesspool of terrorism', the country said  it had already lashed out at the 'citadels of the US imperialists', naming the White House and Pentagon in particular. According to the post, the North Korean government is also convinced  directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were under direct instruction from US officials, who told them to include extra scenes to 'insult the dignity' of North Korea. President Barack Obama said Sony had 'made a mistake' in their decision to pull the film. President Obama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism .","Terrorists made threats against Sony and cinemas earlier this month .

"Kim Jong-un is feared to be behind a hacking attack on computer systems controlling South Korean nuclear power stations . North Korea is suspected of being behind a hacking attack on computers controlling south Korean nuclear power stations, sparking fears Kim Jong-un may be planning a terror strike. Computer systems at The Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Co Ltd (KHNP) were successfully accessed last week with many immediately suspecting North Korea to be responsible. KHNP and the government said only 'non-critical' data was stolen by the hackers, and that there was no risk to nuclear installations, including the country's 23 atomic reactors. However KHNP has ordered two days of safety drills at the nuclear plants to ensure their safety in the event of a successful hacking attack. The hacking was reported as the United States accused North Korea of a devastating cyberattack on Sony Pictures. Experts voiced alarm that the controls of the nuclear reactors could be at risk. 'This demonstrated that, if anyone is intent with malice to infiltrate the system, it would be impossible to say with confidence that such an effort would be blocked completely,' said Suh Kune-yull of Seoul National University. 'And a compromise of nuclear reactors' safety pretty clearly means there is a gaping hole in national security,' said Suh, who specialises in nuclear reactor design. North Korea is believed to be employing an elite team of computer geniuses in a shadowy department known as Bureau 121 to hack into vulnerable systems in enemy states. The South Korean government is investigating but has not said who might be responsible. In 2013, South Korea accused the North of a series of cyberattacks on banks and broadcasters. Anti-nuclear activists in South Korea have also protested against the use of nuclear power. South Korea's energy ministry said it was confident that its nuclear plants could block any infiltration by cyber attackers that could compromise the safety of the reactors. Scroll down for video . Precautions: South Korean employees conduct a simulated drill to ensure the safety of nuclear power plants under cyber attacks following the hacking attack last week . 'It's our judgment that the control system itself is designed in such a way and there is no risk whatsoever,' Chung Yang-ho, deputy energy minister, told Reuters by phone. An official at the country's nuclear plant operator KHNP, which is part of state-run Korea Electric Power Corp , told Reuters that the hacking appeared to be the handiwork of 'elements who want to cause social unrest'. He said he had no one specific in mind and did not elaborate. 'It is 100 per cent impossible that a hacker can stop nuclear power plants by attacking them because the control monitoring system is totally independent and closed,' the official said. The plants operators and the government said only 'non-critical' data was stolen by the hackers, and that there was no risk to nuclear installations, including the country's 23 atomic reactors . They also said they could not verify messages posted by a Twitter user claiming responsibility for the attacks and demanding the shutdown of three ageing nuclear reactors by Thursday. The post also asked for money in exchange for the leaked data. The user who was described in the posting as chairman of an anti-nuclear group based in Hawaii said more documents from the nuclear operator will be posted if the reactors are not closed.","Computer systems controlling 23 nuclear power stations hacked last week .

"Your camera could be about to get a lot smaller. Researchers have succeeded in making one of the key components of cameras, the charge-coupled device (CCD), just one atom thick. And they say it could be employed in ultra-thin two-dimensional imaging devices in the future. Scroll down for video . Graduate student Sidong Lei displays a three-pixel prototype made with atomically thin layers of copper indium selenide (CIS) . The new material developed at Rice shows promise for two-dimensional electronics, possibly paving the way to extremely thin cameras in the future . The research, carried out by scientists at Rice University in Texas, was published in the American Chemical Society journal Nano Letters. The two-dimensional three-pixel prototype traps electrons when light hits the material, and holds them until released for storage. And its composition, namely copper indium selenide (CIS), apparently shows extraordinary promise for light detection. Researchers this month revealed a new way to take pictures called compressed ultrafast photography. While current phone can take several shots a second at best, it is able to generate two-dimensional (2D) colour images at up to 100 billion frames per second. The team at Washington University in St. Louis, led by Lihong Wang, PhD, the Gene K. Beare Distinguished Professor of Biomedical Engineering say the camera is the world's fastest. Wang and his colleagues have made movies of the images they took with single laser shots of four physical phenomena: laser pulse reflection, refraction, faster-than light propagation of what is called non-information, and photon racing in two media. Many modern digital cameras used an image sensor called a charge-coupled device (CCD). This fingernail-sized silicon chip contains millions of photosensitive diodes, which capture pixels for the photograph. The charge of each pixel is then converted into a series of numbers, creating a digital image of what the cameras has seen. Decreasing the size of the CCD, however, could allow for much smaller cameras to be made. Sidong Lei, a graduate student involved in the study, said: ‘Traditional CCDs are thick and rigid, and it would not make sense to combine them with 2-D elements. ‘CIS-based CCDs would be ultrathin, transparent and flexible, and are the missing piece for things like 2-D imaging devices.' Dr Robert Vajtai, a senior faculty fellow in Rice’s Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, said CIS pixels are highly sensitive to light because the trapped electrons dissipate so slowly. 'There are many two-dimensional materials that can sense light, but none are as efficient as this material,' he said. 'This material is 10 times more efficient than the best we’ve seen before.' Many modern digital cameras (stock image shown) used an image sensor called a charge-coupled device (CCD). This fingernail-sized silicon chip contains millions of photosensitive diodes, which capture pixels for the photograph. Decreasing the size of the CCD, however, could allow for much smaller cameras to be made . Rice researchers fabricated a sensor array (illustration shown) to test the two-dimensional compound's ability to capture image information. They started with  a thin silicon substrate, fabricated three pairs of titanium/gold electrodes on top of the CIS and then cut the CIS into three sections with a focused ion beam . Because the material is transparent, a CIS-based scanner might use light from one side to illuminate the image on the other for capture. For medical applications, Mr Lei envisions CIS being combined with other 2D electronics in tiny bio-imaging devices that monitor real-time conditions. In the experiments for the newly reported study, Lei and colleagues grew synthetic CIS crystals, pulled single-layer sheets from the crystals and then tested the ability of the layers to capture light. He said the layer was about two nanometers thick and consists of a nine-atom-thick lattice. The three-pixel prototype sensor based on CIS, a two-dimensional compound of copper, indium and selenium atoms, showed remarkable potential for its ability to capture and hold light in experiments at Rice. The prototype (shown) was was about two nanometers thick and consists of a nine-atom-thick lattice. Because it’s flexible, CIS could also be curved to match the focal surface of an imaging lens system, perhaps like a camera. He said this would allow for the real-time correction of aberrations and significantly simplify the entire optical system.","Rice University scientists in Texas create ultra-thin imaging device .

"Appeal: Helen Curran lost her Patricia last Christmas at the hands of her daughter's ex . A mother is urging people in violent relationships to speak out this Christmas, a year after her daughter was killed by her ex while she was preparing the turkey. Helen Curran’s 42-year-old daughter, Patricia, was stabbed five times by Clifford Burns, who also wounded his step-daughter, Megan, in the savage Christmas Eve attack at their home in New York. Mrs Curran said: ‘I can’t wait for Christmas to be over. It holds nothing but painful memories for me. I urge anyone in an abusive relationship to get out. I wish my Trish had.’ In her first interview since her daughter’s death, Mrs Curran has revealed she had doubts about Burns almost as soon as he and mother-of-three Patricia got together in 1997. ‘Patricia told me Clifford’s dad had abused his mother for years, once shooting her in the chest,’ Mrs Curran explained. ‘Then he killed himself after kidnapping her. Clifford had only been a teenager at the time. I dreaded to think what impact it could’ve had on him psychologically.’ But Patricia did not listen to her mother’s warning. Instead they married, going on to have two children, Harley and Autumn, together. ‘Patricia told me everyone has good in them,’ Mrs Curran said. ‘Except I knew Clifford didn’t. He beat Patricia but she always went back to him. As a mother, that was unbearable.’ Finally, after one particularly brutal attack, Patricia found the strength to have a five-year restraining order taken out against Burns. ‘Patricia moved to a new place with the kids and got a job as a nurse at the local hospice. It was perfect for my caring daughter,’ Mrs Curran said. But last year, Patricia confided in her mother that Burns had failed to pay child support. Patricia (left) was just 42 when she was savagely murdered by her ex-husband Clifford Burns (right) who is currently serving 23 years to life for the crime which took place last Christmas . Mother-of-four Patricia had finally left Clifford, who was abusive, and was starting a new life with her children . ‘I spoke to her on Christmas Eve and she sounded so much happier,’ she said. ‘We were all going over to her house for Christmas dinner and she told me she was popping out to get some last minute bits and couldn’t wait to see me.’ But that night, Mrs Curran was woken by her grandson Nicholas - Patricia’s eldest son - phoning with horrific news. ‘He was frantic and told me to turn on the television,’ she recalled. ‘I switched on the news and saw a photo of my smiling girl on the screen. The reporter said she’d been knifed at home and died in the ambulance. They also said Megan had gone to hospital with stab wounds. I couldn’t take it in.’ Megan (left) was with her mother Patricia (right) when the attack happened and suffered several stab wounds . Helen and her husband Gerald rushed to their granddaughter’s side. ‘There were police everywhere and medics surrounded Megan,’ she said. ‘I heard one of them say that if the blade had hit her artery she’d be dead.’ The 73-year-old listened in horror as her granddaughter explained what had happened. ‘She said Clifford turned up while she, Patricia and Autumn were preparing Christmas dinner. He was wearing camouflage and had a knife. Helen was altered to the tragedy by her grandson Nicholas (with her left), and rushed with her husband Gerald (together right) to be with their injured grand-daughter at hospital . ‘She told me her mum was begging for her life. She tried to get in the way but Clifford stabbed her as well.’ Daughter Autumn, just 14, had seen the whole thing. She called the ambulance and put pressure on her mother’s wounds. But it was too late. Burns was arrested following a high-speed car chase. At Warren County Court, New York, US, he pleaded guilty to second degree-murder. Helen is urging other women in abusive relationships to seek help (pictured: Helen and Patricia together) This Christmas the family will hold a remembrance for Patricia, pictured left and right . The court heard he had sent his 16-year-old daughter Harley a chilling text message which read: I have a special gift coming soon something for everyone to talk about and it will be hand delivered on foot not by car... Clifford Burns, 46, was sentenced to 23 years to life and barred from contacting Megan, Harley or Autumn ever again. He is appealing. ‘I went along and glared at him straight in the eye,’ Mrs Curran said. ‘I don’t feel it’s long enough. I had to listen as Autumn’s hysterical call to the emergency services was played where she pleaded with her mummy to hold on. It was heartbreaking. ‘The children and I have been handed our own life sentence, one without a wonderful mum and daughter. Christmas will never be the same. This year we will be holding a remembrance for her. ‘If I can stop one other family going through what my Trish did then that will be a start. I knew Clifford Burns was rotten to the core the day I met him. ‘I just wish Trish had seen what I did – a monster.’ If you or anyone you know is a victim of domestic abuse you can find help at Women's Aid, Refuge or by contacting your local police department .","Helen Curran's daughter Patricia was killed last Christmas Eve .

"A robotic stick insect that can walk up stairs and negotiate stony ground has been created by scientists. Researchers at Bielefeld University, in Germany, built the robot after studying how the legs of stick insects move. To copy nature's design, the robotics experts gave their six robot legs a total of 18 joints that are highly elastic, allowing it to cope with uneven surfaces. Video courtesy of CITEC/Bielefeld University . Each leg was packed with sensors to help the robot get feedback about the ground and enable the it to climb over objects. The legs are controlled independently to keep the robot stable, with each joint containing a drive that was designed to mimic the behaviour of stick insects. When it comes to building intrepid robots, Boston Dynamics has created some of the most impressive. Among the robots it has created in a project with the US Defence Department is a humanoid shaped machine that can run, climb and jump. The robot can even climb across pits filling with scorpions by pressing against the opposing walls. Another of the company's robots, named 'Cheetah', is built for maximum speed and has been filmed on a treadmill at speeds of up to 29mph, faster than Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. One robot called Big Dog can climb steep inclines and is even able to balance on ice. The researchers behind the robot believe it could be used to develop new types of autonomous search and rescue vehicles. It could also allow robots that can carry cargo over difficult terrain or help space scientists explore other planets. Professor Alex Schneider, head of the biomechatronics research group at Bielefeld University, said: 'The way that the elasticity in Hector's drives acts is comparable to the way that muscles act in biological systems. 'However, elasticity alone is not enough for Hector to be able to walk through a natural environment containing obstacles,' says Schneider. 'The challenge was to develop a control system that would coordinate the movements of its legs in difficult surroundings as well.' The hexapod cognitive autonomously operating robot, or HECTOR for short, has been developed to carry loads of up to three times its own weight. Made from carbon fibre and plastic, the exoskeleton weighs just 26lbs (12kg) but can carry a load of 66lbs (30kg). The hexapod cognitive autonomously operating robot, or HECTOR, can scale steps using sensors in each leg . The robotic stick insect can carry loads of up to three times its own body weight, making it perfect for carrying cargo over rough terrain or for carrying experiments to hard to reach locations on other planets . Stony and uneven ground can pose a problem for many robots but by using drives in each joint that are based on the leg of a stick insect, researchers have been able to create a robot that can adapt to the surface . Its movement is controlled using biologically inspired algorithms, based on the way stick insects themselves move and it is designed to learn from its experiences. The scientists have also now built a prototype that is capable of sensing its surroundings in more detail using cameras and tactile feelers. This has given the robotic insect the ability to see and feel obstacles in its path. 'A major challenge will now be to find an efficient way to integrate these far-range sensors with the posture sensors and joint control sensors,' said Professor Volker Dürr, another engineer on the project at the biological cybernetics laboratory at Bielefeld University. The scientists studied the legs of stick insects and developed a drive that can react to uneven ground . Sensors in the legs can detect obstacles like steps and stoney ground and help HECTOR to negotiate them .

"An undisturbed 6,000-year-old encampment, which was likely home to the forefathers of Stonehenge, has been discovered. Carbon dating last week established the ‘first proof’ of a settlement at Blick Mead in Wiltshire, which predates the famous monument nearby. A spokesman for the project, told MailOnline: ‘It’s the first proof of people living there earlier, and indicates that Stonehenge could have been planned for years. Scroll down for video . Carbon dating last week established the ‘first proof’ of a settlement at Blick Mead in Wiltshire, which predates theStonehenge, thought to be constructed in 2600 BC . They believe that further excavation of the site, which has so far revealed evidence of a permanent structure and burned animal bones, could help experts unravel why the mysterious stone circle was built. Archaeologists at the University of Buckingham, led by David Jacques, found the ancient site last October, which is around one-and-a-half miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge. ‘It’s the first indication of a settlement, not just people passing through and dropping tools,’ the spokesman said. Dr Jacques said that further inspection of the site could ‘rewrite British history’. Archaeologists at the University of Buckingham, led by David Jacques found the ancient site last October, which is around one-and-a-half miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge (pictured) Experts tested charcoal that was dug up from the site, to reveal that it dates from 4,000 BC. They also uncovered many tools (pictured left) and bone fragments (right) Last year, archaeologists discovered fragments of an 8,000 year-old charred toad leg one mile away from Stonehenge in Wiltshire, hinting that the English were feasting on frogs' legs 8,000 years before the French. The remains which were found alongside fish bones at the site are the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world, scientists say. Archaeologists unearthed the leg alongside small fish vertebrate bones of trout or salmon as well as burnt aurochs' bones (the predecessors of cows) at the Blick Mead dig site near Amesbury. David Jacques, senior research fellow in archaeology at the University of Buckingham, said: 'It would appear that thousands of years ago people were eating a Heston Blumenthal-style menu on this site, one-and-a-quarter miles from Stonehenge, consisting of toads' legs, aurochs, wild boar and red deer with hazelnuts for main, another course of salmon and trout and finishing off with blackberries. 'This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?' Experts tested charcoal that was dug up from the site, to reveal that it dates from 4,000 BC. The dig has also unearthed evidence of structures as well as proof of feasting, such as burnt flints and remains of giant bulls – aurochs – eaten by early hunter gatherers, as well as tools. ‘This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK,’ he said. ‘Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late fifth Millennium BC. However, the team is concerned that it could be damaged because of plans to build an underground tunnel past Stonehenge. A 1.8 mile (2.9 km) tunnel is part of a £2 billion plan to make the nearby A303 a dual carriageway. ‘Was Stonehenge built in part as a monument to the ancestors from the deepest part of Britain’s past?’ Dr Jacques asked. ‘Blick Mead could explain what archaeologists have been searching for for centuries – an answer to the story of Stonehenge's past. But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain’s history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead.’ The dig has also unearthed evidence of structures as well as proof of feasting, such as burnt flints and remains of giant bulls (pictured) – aurochs – eaten by early hunter gatherers, as well as tools . The Department of Transport said it would ‘consult before any building’. Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of the Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust, said: ‘Traffic congestion to one of the country’s most visited attractions will not be solved by a tunnel with one exit lane – the current tailback can extend five miles and can take two hours to get through. Any tunnel would need to be motorway standard, and even with four lanes there would still be tailbacks. ‘Concerns have been raised about the water table. Due to the chalkland landscape the tunnel would effectively become a dam, which would change the water course, causing problems. ‘Kilometres of chalk would have to be extracted. Air conditioning, water pumps, lighting and maintenance costs would be colossal. 'A much more practical solution would be to reroute the A303 supporting South Wiltshire as well as the West Country.’ A previous dig at the site, led by the University of Buckingham, revealed Amesbury is the longest continually-occupied place in the country and that burnt frogs’ legs from 7,000 years ago were a delicacy here long before the French took a liking to them. The highest density of Mesolithic burnt flints and tools anywhere in the UK was found in one small area at the site in a previous dig. A natural spring at Blick Mead would have been the attraction for both people and animals. The combination of a water of a constant temperature and a rare algae also produced the only colour-changing stones, which change from brown to pink, found at any archaeological site in the country. Professor Tim Darvill, of Bournemouth University described the findings as ‘The most important discovery at Stonehenge in over 60 years.’ The University of Buckingham has launched a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to enable students to explore some of the reasons why archaeologosts think Stonehenge was built, theories of those who built it and cultural responses to it. More than 1,000 people have already signed up to the MOOC, which will also enable students to evaluate responses to Stonehenge in art, literature, music, architecture and culture. Ancient Britons from far and wide were drawn to Stonehenge to see the area’s pink flint and the River Avon acted as an ‘A-Road’ carrying people to a nearby settlement at Blick Mead where feasts and tour guides were available even before the monument was built, one archaeologist claimed in May. It is thought that there was an established community in the area before the monument was built and that people travelled to the settlement in log boats. Carbon dating of bones from giant bulls and boars discarded at Vespsian’s Camp, Blick Mead - a settlement around a mile from the monument - prove that Amesbury is the oldest settlement in Britain and has been continually occupied since 8,820BC. Historic: The dig in Amesbury, which took place in October and was funded by the University of Buckingham, also unearthed the largest haul of worked flints from the Mesolithic period . Archaeologists think that the communities that built the monument lived and worked in the area for around 3,000 years and that Stonehenge was built as part of an established settlement, rather than a monument in an empty landscape. They have also ruled out the possibility of the monument being built by European immigrants and think the giant stones were placed by indigenous hunters and homemakers. The team found that Mesolithic cultures cleared land around Blick Mead between 7,500 and 4,600BC, which they had thought was an activity previously thought to be a part of the ‘farming package’ brought in by Neolithic immigrants from the continent in the 5th millennium BC. Dr Jacques said: The area was clearly a hub point for people to come to from many miles away, and in many ways was a forerunner for what later went on at Stonehenge itself. The first monuments at Stonehenge were built by these people. ‘In effect, Blick Mead was the very first Stonehenge Visitor Centre, up and running in the 8th millennium BC. The River Avon would have been the A-Road – people would have come down on their log boats. ‘They would have had the equivalent of tour guides and there would have been feasting.’","Carbon dating  established ‘first proof’ of Blick Mead settlement in Wiltshire .

"A mother who was left horrified by her size in festive photographs is looking forward to a slimmed down Christmas this year after losing an incredible five stone. Kelly Jo Hearsey, from Calvert Green, Buckinghamshire, had ballooned to a size 18 after years of gorging on takeaways, chocolate, crisps and sandwiches. But after she was left humiliated by a picture of herself tucking into her turkey dinner last year, Kelly became determined to become healthy, shedding a third of her body weight in just 12 months. Kelly Jo Hearsey has dropped five dresses sizes and lost a third of her body weight . It was this photo, taken by Kelly's husband Glen, that inspired her to change her diet and shed the pounds . As a vegetarian mother-of-two, Kelly had been stuffing herself with carbs and cheese, eventually tipping the scales at nearly 15 stone. But when she saw the snap, taken by her husband Glen, 41, she said it made her feel sick. In fact, Kelly revealed that when she looked at it she decided to make the most important New Year's resolution of her life. Since then she has dropped a whopping five dress sizes and lost a third of her weight - now weighing in at a healthy 9 stone 10lbs. And this year she is preparing to tuck in on Christmas Day with Glenn and kids Jay, 12, and Millie, 10, in full festive spirit. Kelly, a professional photographer went from an 18 to a tiny size 8 after just six months on a food replacement diet. She said: 'Every time I saw a photograph of myself I felt fat and ashamed. I always shied away from the camera. Kelly says she felt guilty and ashamed when she would see herself in shop windows, she is now a slim size 8 . 'When my husband showed me the Christmas dinner picture I felt horrible. I decided I needed a whole new mindset when it came to food.' She added: 'I used to walk past shop windows, glimpse my reflection and feel a huge wave of shame, guilt, horror and loathing. 'Now I have to do a double take and still can't believe it's me, I can't get enough of looking in the mirror. Kelly followed the Ideal Weight diet and believes her husband now fancies her more after shifting the pounds . Kelly revealed she couldn't bear to see how she looked in front of the camera . 'I've have had to buy a whole new wardrobe for myself, it feels amazing to try and clothes and find they just fit so easily. The Ideal Weight diet works on the idea that there is not one ideal weight for everyone. You go to the Ideal Weight team and specify the weight loss you would like to achieve and they create a plan especially for you. There are different plans including the 4 plan - a kickstarter where you fast on 600 calories a day for four days. There is also a maintenance plan for when you have lost the weight and wish to keep it off which is based around eating 1400-1600 calories a day. 'My husband has always been so supportive of me, and has never really known me a different size, but I think he finds me more attractive now, though he'd never say it.' Kelly followed the Ideal Weight diet - which includes eating nutrition packs such as milkshakes, soups, meals and bars as replacements for meals. She now just has one regular healthy meal in the evening which include low-carb salads and lots of veg. Kelly, who loves cooking Christmas dinner for her family, said she won't be holding back on Christmas Day. She said: 'It's been so long since I've been this slim and I'm at the stage where I have to maintain the weight. 'But I'm going to enjoy Christmas this year and I won't hold back, I really enjoy the time of year. 'My stomach has shrunk and I can't eat the way I used to now and I'll go back on the diet in the new year just to get back to where I was again.' This year Kelly will still be tucking into her Christmas dinner but will be going back to her diet in the New Year .","Kelly Jo Hearsey was disgusted with herself after ballooning to a size 18 .

"The popularity of Disney’s smash hit Frozen has led to a surge in web searches for family holidays in Norway. Calling it the ‘Frozen effect’, travel website Expedia.co.uk is reporting a 60 per cent increase in the number of searches for destinations in the Nordic country, including Naeroyfjord, the municipality that inspired the animated film’s snowy setting. It suggests Britons are looking to take their children to a ‘real-life’ frozen fantasy land similar to Arendelle, the fictional kingdom that is home to orphaned sisters Anna and Elsa, the film’s lead characters. Fictional Arendelle Castle is the home of Anna and Elsa in Disney's animated film, Frozen . Oslo’s Akershus Fortress served as the inspiration for Anna and Elsa's castle in Arendelle . Andy Washington, managing director of Expedia.co.uk, said: ‘The unprecedented popularity of Frozen has increased the mystique and allure of wintery destinations and demand for Norway has increased over 2014 as a whole. ‘Now, with Christmas and the new year around the corner parents are looking to make the movie a reality for their children.’ The name Arendelle is based on Arendal, a port town on Norway’s southern coast, while buildings in Oslo, Bergen and other cities served as inspiration for some of Frozen's scenes. Elsa (left) was voiced primarily by Idina Menzel in the film, while Kristen Bell served as the voice of Anna . Naeroyfjord (pictured in spring) is the municipality that inspired the animated film’s snowy setting . Oslo’s Akershus Fortress, for example, was used as the basis for Anna and Elsa’s castle in Arendelle. Price comparison website Icelolly.com said it frequently receives enquiries from parents whose children want to visit the land that inspired the film’s setting. Arendal and Norway are among its most popular winter holiday destinations for 2015, in addition to Lapland, France and Canada. Suniel Makh, brand director at Icelolly.com, said: ‘The nation has taken Queen Elsa, Princess Anna and snowman Olaf into their hearts and we've seen a growing number of people desperately wanting to visit their mythical world.’ The company is now looking at offering Frozen-themed trips, he added.","Norwegian municipality of Naeroyfjord inspired Frozen's snowy scenes .

"Pope Francis today issued a blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy that serves him while delivering a Christmas message to cardinals, bishops and priests who run the Holy See. Rather than offering a traditional good-willed festive greeting, the pontiff described how some of those under him lust for power at all costs and lead hypocritical double-lives . He suggested others suffer from 'spiritual Alzheimer's' and forget they're supposed to be joyful men of God - while offering a sobering catalog of the 15 sins of the Curia. Scroll down for video . Attack: Pope Francis seen today issued a blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy that serves him . The sins, or ailments as he called them, included how the 'terrorism of gossip' can 'kill the reputation of our colleagues and brothers in cold blood.' Another of the sins was how cliques can 'enslave their members and become a cancer that threatens the harmony of the body' and eventually kill it by 'friendly fire'. He said: 'The Curia is called on to always improve itself and grow in communion, holiness and knowledge to fulfill its mission. 'But even it, as any human body, can suffer from ailments, dysfunctions, illnesses.' Non-traditional: Rather than offering a good-willed festive greeting, the pontiff described how some of those under him lust for power at all costs . Francis is the first Latin American pope and never worked in the Italian-dominated Curia before he was elected. He has not shied from complaining about the gossiping, careerism and bureaucratic power intrigues that afflict the Holy See. But as his reform agenda has gathered steam, he seemed even more emboldened to highlight what ails the institution. The cardinals were not amused. The speech was met with tepid applause, and few were smiling as Francis listed one by one the 15 'Ailments of the Curia' that he had drawn up, complete with footnotes and Biblical references. The annual Christmas greeting comes at a tense time for the Curia, the central administration of the Holy See which governs the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church. Not amused: The cardinals in attendance were said to have met the speech with muted applause . Meticulous: The Pope read a list of sins the Holy See were guilty of - calling it the 15 Ailments Of The Curia . Francis and his nine key cardinal advisers are drawing up plans to revamp the whole bureaucratic structure, merging offices to make them more efficient and responsive. The Vatican's finances are also in the midst of an overhaul, with Francis' finance czar, Cardinal George Pell, imposing new accounting and budget measures on traditionally independent congregations not used to having their books inspected. Yet it was perhaps Pell that Francis had in mind when he complained about the temptation to lust for power even if it means defaming or discrediting others 'even in newspapers or magazines, to show themselves as more capable ... in the name of justice and transparency'. Cardinal Pell recently wrote an explosive essay in Britain's Catholic Herald in which he said his team had discovered that the financial situation of the Holy See was 'much healthier than it seemed because some hundreds of millions of euros were tucked away in particular sectional accounts and did not appear on the balance sheet'. Getting tough: The sins on the list included how the 'terrorism of gossip' can 'kill the reputation of our colleagues and brothers in cold blood' All smiles: At the end of the speech, Francis asked the prelates to pray that the 'wounds of the sins that each one of us carries are healed' The Vatican later clarified that the money hadn't been hidden and that nothing illicit was going on -  just that the funds didn't appear on the Vatican's balance sheet. Over the weekend, the Jesuit magazine America reported that an internal Vatican memo had undercut Cardinal Pell's claim of having found the cash in the first place. It said the funds kept in the Vatican Secretariat of State were well-known, duly reported, were used to cover Vatican losses and special projects and actually had been well-managed over the years. Francis started off his list with the 'ailment of feeling immortal, immune or even indispensable'. Then one-by-one he went on: Being vain. Wanting to accumulate things, having a 'hardened heart', wooing superiors for personal gain. Having a 'funereal face' and being too 'rigid, tough and arrogant,' also made into on to the shameful list . Muted applause: Few were smiling as Francis listed one by one the 15 'Ailments of the Curia' that he had drawn up, complete with footnotes and Biblical references . Other faults were having a 'funereal face' and being too 'rigid, tough and arrogant,' especially toward underlings - a possible reference to the recently relieved Swiss Guard commander said to have been too tough on his recruits for Francis' tastes. Some critiques could have been seen as worthy of praise: working too hard and planning too much ahead. But even those traits came in for criticism as Francis noted that people who don't take time off to be with family are overly stressed, and those who plan everything to a 'T' don't allow themselves to be surprised by the 'freshness, fantasy and novelty' of the Holy Spirit. 'How good it is for us to have a healthy sense of humor,' he said. At the end of the speech, Francis asked the prelates to pray that the 'wounds of the sins that each one of us carries are healed' and that the Church and Curia itself are made healthy. During today's Christmas speech Pope Francis read out 15 sins that he believed the Curia was guilty of complete with footnotes and Biblical references. These included: . 1) Feeling immortal, immune or indispensable. 'A Curia that doesn't criticize itself, that doesn't update itself, that doesn't seek to improve itself is a sick body.' 2) Working too hard. 'Rest for those who have done their work is necessary, good and should be taken seriously.' 3) Becoming spiritually and mentally hardened. 'It's dangerous to lose that human sensibility that lets you cry with those who are crying, and celebrate those who are joyful.' 4) Planning too much. 'Preparing things well is necessary, but don't fall into the temptation of trying to close or direct the freedom of the Holy Spirit, which is bigger and more generous than any human plan.' 5) Working without coordination, like an orchestra that produces noise. 'When the foot tells the hand, 'I don't need you' or the hand tells the head 'I'm in charge.'' 6) Having 'spiritual Alzheimer's.' 'We see it in the people who have forgotten their encounter with the Lord ... in those who depend completely on their here and now, on their passions, whims and manias, in those who build walls around themselves and become enslaved to the idols that they have built with their own hands.' 7) Being rivals or boastful. 'When one's appearance, the color of one's vestments or honorific titles become the primary objective of life.' 8) Suffering from 'existential schizophrenia.' 'It's the sickness of those who live a double life, fruit of hypocrisy that is typical of mediocre and progressive spiritual emptiness that academic degrees cannot fill. It's a sickness that often affects those who, abandoning pastoral service, limit themselves to bureaucratic work, losing contact with reality and concrete people.' 9) Committing the 'terrorism of gossip.' 'It's the sickness of cowardly people who, not having the courage to speak directly, talk behind people's backs.' 10) Glorifying one's bosses. 'It's the sickness of those who court their superiors, hoping for their benevolence. They are victims of careerism and opportunism, they honor people who aren't God.' 11) Being indifferent to others. 'When, out of jealousy or cunning, one finds joy in seeing another fall rather than helping him up and encouraging him.' 12) Having a 'funereal face.' 'In reality, theatrical severity and sterile pessimism are often symptoms of fear and insecurity. The apostle must be polite, serene, enthusiastic and happy and transmit joy wherever he goes.' 13) Wanting more. 'When the apostle tries to fill an existential emptiness in his heart by accumulating material goods, not because he needs them but because he'll feel more secure.' 14) Forming 'closed circles' that seek to be stronger than the whole. 'This sickness always starts with good intentions but as time goes by, it enslaves its members by becoming a cancer that threatens the harmony of the body and causes so much bad — scandals — especially to our younger brothers.' 15) Seeking worldly profit and showing off. 'It's the sickness of those who insatiably try to multiply their powers and to do so are capable of calumny, defamation and discrediting others, even in newspapers and magazines, naturally to show themselves as being more capable than others.","Pope Francis issued blistering critique while delivering festive message .

"David Helens, 25, was arrested after making a false 999 call where he claimed a 'friend' had been shot . A man frantically called 999 to report a shooting and said his friend had stopped breathing but he was actually playing the computer game Grand Theft Auto, a court heard. David Helens, 25, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, had been playing a long session of the violent video game when he rung emergency services saying his friend 'Max' was bleeding badly. He told a call handler that the man had suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was 'slipping in and out of consciousness' before telling her he thought he was dead. The defendant then began screaming and shouting and said he had been attacked by a third person. Two ambulances were quickly dispatched to the house where they discovered the call was a complete fantasy and the events had in fact taken place in the video game. Helens was arrested when he told police he had been playing the  guns and gangsters game shortly before making the call. Christopher Rose, prosecuting, said: 'The call lasted for approximately 12 minutes. 'The caller said he was at an address and that he was with another man called Max who had suffered a gunshot injury to his chest. 'He said the man was slipping in an out of consciousness and bleeding badly. 'An ambulance had to be dispatched and, once the call handler was told the man had stopped breathing, and that he might be dead, this information had to be treated as a possible cardiac arrest and a second ambulance was called.' He added: 'The defendant then said he himself had been attacked by a third person and feigned screaming and shouting. 'The call taker said that this caused her to be very concerned for his safety and that of 'Max'.' Helens admitted making the malicious 999 call on November 8, and was sentenced to a 12 month community order when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court. The court heard a police interview in which Helens admitted making the call, and said that none of things he claimed while speaking to the call handler had actually happened. Helens had spent a long session on notorious and violent video game Grand Theft Auto before making call . He said he knew of the inconvenience he had caused to the ambulance and police services. The call taker, from North East Ambulance Service (NEAS), told the court in a victim impact statement that she had been left 'shaken' by the incident. The best-selling game has caused controversy over its adult content and violence . She said: 'This man's behaviour on the telephone made me feel concerned. The whole incident has left me feeling a bit shaken.' Laura Johnson, defending, told the court: 'It would appear that the phone call made to the emergency services coincided with him playing a violent shooting game on his computer. 'He tells me that he has very little recollection of the phone call. 'Mr Helens has significant health needs. He is deaf in his left ear, partially blind in his left eye and has speech problems. 'He accepts that he caused disruption and upset to the call taker and he apologises for his actions.' A spokesman for NEAS said: 'We welcome the result of this court case. 'This inappropriate call lasted 12 minutes and resulted in the dispatch of two ambulances, resources which will have been needed elsewhere for genuine emergencies. 'I hope it sends out a clear message to others who might consider misusing our services or abusing or assaulting our staff.' Helens was told to complete 120 hours of unpaid work and will be subject to a supervision requirement for 18 months. He must also pay £85 in costs and a £60 victim surcharge.","David Helens had been playing a long session of the violent video game .

"Keys belonging to missing student Shane Montgomery have been found in a river close to where he was last seen, his family has revealed. Montgomery, a 21-year-old student at West Chester University, left a bar in Manayunk, Pennsylvania in the early hours of Thanksgiving Day and was caught on surveillance footage heading towards a parking lot - but has not been seen since. His disappearance  sparked a massive hunt and the offer of a $65,000 reward but searches, which have mostly focused on the Manayunk Canal, have so far turned up nothing. But on Sunday, divers searched the nearby Schuylkill River and found his keys in the water just south of the parking lot, his mother told the Philadelphia Daily News. Clue: Keys belonging to Shane Montgomery, pictured, have been found in the Schuylkill River, close to where he was last seen on November 27. He vanished after leaving a bar following a night of drinking . 'My heart is broken,' Karen Montgomery said. 'My son is somewhere in that river, and I need to find him and I need to bring him home.' His uncle Kevin Verbrugghe, told WPVI that the keys, which were on a Philadelphia Eagles lanyard, definitely belonged to his nephew because he tested them in Montgomery's front door. But there is still no sign of the student. 'It's just a piece to the puzzle,' Verbrugghe told WPVI. 'The puzzle is definitely not done.' Montgomery had been escorted out of Kildare's bar in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia at 1.50am on November 27 after he stumbled over the DJ's table. Final moments: A map shows the location of the bar where the 21-year-old student was last seen in Manayunk, Pennsylvania and his walk across a nearby bridge. The area is a district of Philadelphia, indicated top left . Last seen: The student was seen on surveillance footage crossing a footbridge, pictured, over the Manayunk Canal on November 27 - although the actual footage has not yet been released by police . Search: His disappearance has sparked a huge search involving the FBI, K-9 units and helicopters . He had spent the night of November 26 there with friends. It later emerged that he had a tab for $17 at the bar, indicating that staff had not served him an excessive amount of alcohol. The bar's owner said that he did not seem drunk and, when he accidentally bumped into the table, he was polite about it. One of the bar's employees walked him to the exit and saw him leave. Surveillance footage captured him walking across a footbridge over the Manayunk Canal to a parking lot on the other side. He was not seen returning. The footage has been withheld by authorities. Missing: Montgomery, a student at West Chester University, has this Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder . Questions: His distraught parents, Karen and Kevin, have said they are thankful for everyone's prayers . Search: Teams searched the nearby canal last month but turned up no signs of Montgomery there . The FBI has joined the search and K-9s, helicopters and marine units have been used to help find the student - but there has been no sign of him. He is 5ft11 and 130lb, with short brown hair and green eyes. He was wearing a buttoned-down gray shirt, gray hoodie and jeans when he left the bar. He has a Celtic cross tattoo on his shoulder. His father, Kevin, previously told NBC: 'We're waiting for him to walk in the door, but you realize that each hour goes... it's just harder and harder.' A $65,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his whereabouts. Anyone with information is asked to contact Philadelphia Police Northwest Detectives at 215-686-3353.","Keys belonging to Shane Montgomery were found in the Schuylkill River in Manayunk, Pennsylvania during a search on Sunday .

"The introduction of driverless cars is being greeted with cautious optimism, as people begin to consider putting their lives in the hands of a machine - rather than their own. But while sitting in an automated car might be disconcerting, one company has claimed it could save hundreds of lives every year. They say for every 10,000 errors made by a human, just one is committed by a computer - so their predicted widespread introduction in 15 years cannot come soon enough. The claims were made by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) in Stevenage, UK. The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) in Stevenage, UK says driverless cars (Google's car shown) will make roads much safer. They say for every 10,000 human errors, a computer makes just one. This will save lives when automatic cars are widely adopted as predicted in the next 15 years . They said that driverless cars, for which extensive testing starts in the new year, could be on the roads by 2030. And the £19 million ($30 million) trials of driverless cars - officially called autonomous vehicles - have also been welcomed by road safety group Brake, which believes they could lead to 'significantly reduced casualties on our roads'. Likely to start towards the end of January 2015, the trials will see driverless cars - albeit with a qualified driver sitting passively in the driver's seat unless they need to take control - take to public roads in Greenwich in south London, Bristol, Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire and Coventry. Coventry and Milton Keynes: Engineers involved in the Autodrive Programme will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads. Driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of Milton Keynes. Greenwich: The Gateway project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking. Bristol: The insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the Venturer consortium. The programme will also look at how cars cope with the city's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public. But aside from full automation, the IET also predicts that AI-assistance will become more prevalent in the next decade or so. 'Within 15 years, we predict that the performance of cars could be altered to fit the driver,' they said. 'A learner or teenager who has recently passed their test may have their speed limited automatically. 'However, a more experienced driver getting in the same car would be able to travel much faster.' In addition they said: 'Automated cars could also travel in platoons, which would be linked up to traffic light systems to keep them moving and avoid congestion. 'There is likely to be growth in car clubs, with few people owning their own vehicles. Taxis are likely to become redundant. Speeding may become a thing of the past as cars are likely to be fitted with speed-limiting devices. Phil Blythe, chairman of the IET's transport policy panel, said: 'I think it's an exciting opportunity for the UK.' Driverless cars will not only save lives; it's also expected that they will help solve growing traffic issues around the world (stock image of New York shown), by allowing cars to be linked together and travel at the same speed. The IET also thinks they might one day make human-driven taxis redundant as well . Tests of driverless cars have already been carried out off-road but the trials, which will last from 18 to 36 months, will be the first time such vehicles have been tested on public roads. Each of the four test centres will look at different aspects of autonomous vehicles. The Bristol project, for example, will investigate the legal and insurance aspects and explore how the public react to such vehicles. The towns in which the trials are taking place were chosen by the Government-funded body Innovate UK. Nick Jones, lead technologist at Innovate UK, said: 'Cars that drive themselves would represent the most significant transformation in road travel since the introduction of the internal combustion engine and at Innovate UK, we want to help the UK to lead the world in making that happen. 'There are so many new and exciting technologies that can come together to make driverless cars a reality, but it's vital that trials are carried out safely, that the public have confidence in that technology and we learn everything we can through the trials so that legal, regulation and protection issues don't get in the way in the future.'","Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) in Stevenage, UK says driverless cars will make roads much safer .

"EasyJet passengers in France are facing disruption as flight attendants from the budget airline’s French branch plan to walk off the job over the Christmas holiday. The workers are planning to strike from 12:01am on Christmas Day to 11:59pm on Boxing Day in a dispute over pay and work schedules. Francois Bacchetta, general director of easyJet’s operations in France, said the Luton-based airline expects to cancel less than half of its flights from French airports. EasyJet's cabin crew in France are planning a strike on Christmas Day and Boxing Day (file photo) He said: ‘On Monday, we will pre-emptively cancel a certain number of flights in order to transfer passengers, so they can adjust their plans.’ There are no flights scheduled on Christmas Day, so the labour action will only affect travellers on Boxing Day. Aviation workers are required to announce strikes 48 hours in advance, meaning EasyJet will know the extent of the cancellations on Tuesday. EasyJet expects to cancel less than half of its flights in France during the two-day walkout . In a statement, easyJet told MailOnline Travel that it ‘will do everything possible’ to minimise the disruption for travellers, although some flights will be cancelled. Passengers on the affected flights will be contacted and offered a full refund or the opportunity to rebook at no cost. EasyJet apologised to passengers and said it will issue a final cancellation list on Christmas Eve once it has final details from the SNPNC and UNAC cabin crew unions. The airline said: ‘On 26 December easyJet had more than 1,200 flights scheduled to operate. ‘The strike action will affect French domestic flights and currently no UK touching flights are cancelled. EasyJet will assure a minimum service on every route affected by cancellation.’ The carrier added: ‘EasyJet crews are in the vast majority employed under permanent contract and among the best remunerated crew in France. ‘Every year easyJet conducts negotiations with its employees and their representatives and this strike has been called while the negotiations have just begun. EasyJet remains open and committed to find a suitable resolution with the unions.’ The walkout will affect travellers on Boxing Day as there are no flights scheduled on Christmas Day . Laurent Nicolas, a representative of the SNPNC-FO union that represents 600 easyJet flight attendants, said workers are upset over schedules that ‘can change 20 times per month’. He said the scheduling makes it impossible for employees to spend quality time with their families. The union argues that the airline can afford a pay increase for flight attendants as its operating profits were up 21 per cent this year, reaching €728m (approximately £571m). That has translated into huge bonuses for management and income that is up to 300 times the average salary of an easyJet flight attendant, the union claims. Mr Bacchetta acknowledged the demands of the industry are ‘complicated’ and that he understood the ‘frustration’ of workers. But he was less understanding with complaints over salaries, and he said annual negotiations are underway.","Cabin crew from the airline's French branch are set to walk off the job .

"There are plenty of calendars on offer for 2015 featuring scantily-clad men and women - but none are quite like 'Splash Heroes'. The models who pose for each month have only milk to protect their modesty. The innovative images were created by Polish photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz, who specialises in working with liquid. Super shot: The naked models are splashed with coloured milk and three cameras capture the fluid motion . It's raining milk: The character Storm from The X Men is recreated thanks to liquid being thrown at the model . Woman Woman: Polish photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz is the whizz behind the images . Each girl is covered in pints of milk and then Wieczorkiewicz takes a number of shots using three different cameras. As the jugs of milk are thrown at the women, the movement of the liquid is captured using fast exposure. The individual frames are then layered in Photoshop to create the finished result. Wieczorkiewicz, who is now based in London and has founded the Aurum Light Studio, said: 'We work with specific light and pretty normal cameras, there is no magic behind it.' Girl power: The photographer chose the superhero theme because he wanted something 'colourful and cool' Calcium caped crusader: It took five days to shoot the Splash Heroes calendar which is available to buy . Cat that got the cream: Cat Woman's suit is all thanks to milk coloured with pigments and food colourisers . This is not the first time the photographer has had success with his milk works of art. Last year, he created the 'Milky Pin-ups' calendar using models covered in milk in a Fifties theme, with one parodying Marilyn Monroe's famous pose in a white dress from The Seven Year Itch. The pictures impressed Coca Cola so much they used them in a U.S. ad campaign for Fairlife Milk. Speaking about the inspiration for the superhero calendar, Wieczorkiewicz writes on the Aurum Light blog: 'This time we wanted to make a very relaxed and colourful series… simply, something really cool!' Action shot: The movement of the liquid is captured using fast exposure to create the striking images . Taste of success: London-based Wieczorkiewicz has previously impressed with his 'Milky Pin-ups' calendar which was used for a national advertising campaign in the U.S . Strong look: The Hulk tribute is created using green lighting and a very toned model . He explains how his parodies of superheroes like Bat Girl and Wonder Woman took five days to shoot. 'Milk was coloured with pigments and food colourisers to match the concepts. The biggest challenge was to accomplish a specific shapes for the illustrations,' he explains. 'In terms of the gear: We were shooting on three different cameras: Nikon D800, Phase One IQ280, Phase One IQ240 mounted on my favourite Manfrotto tripod platform.' The limited edition 2015 Splash Heroes calendar costs £39.99 and is available to order via www.aurumlight.com/calendar/ .","Images were created by Polish photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz .

"A longtime fire department employee is fighting back after being dismissed for what her supervisors called racially-charged comments on Facebook about the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Crystal Eschert was a fire investigator for the Charlotte Fired Department when she took to Facebook wonder why a police shooting near Ferguson wasn't getting the same level of attention as Brown's death. 'Where is Obama?' she wrote on Facebook. 'Where is Holder? Where is Al Sharpton? Where are Trayvon Martin’s parents? Where are all the white guy supports? So WHY is everyone MAKING it a racial issue?!? So tired of hearing it’s a racial thing. If you are a thug and worthless to society, it’s not race -- You’re just a waste no matter what religion, race or sex you are!' Scroll down for video . Crystal Eschert was working for the Charlotte Fired Department when she took to Facebook wonder why a police shooting near Ferguson wasn't getting the same level of attention as Brown's death . WFAE reports that that Charlotte City Manager Ron Carlee said the comments were considered discriminatory. When someone emailed the comments from the page - which had been sent to private - to city hall, Eschert was fired. At least one legal expert says the post should be considered protected free speech. When someone emailed the comments about Brown's death from the page - which had been sent to private - to city hall, Eschert was fired . 'She said something that at best was racially insensitive, but on a public issue on a private page,' Guy Charles of Duke University’s Center on Law, Race and Politics told reporters. 'Between the hand that she’s holding and the hand that the city’s holding, I think I’d prefer to have her hand.' But UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh says it's not so clear cut. 'I’m inclined to say the employee has a pretty strong case here, but when it comes to the government acting as an employer, the legal rules are quite vague,' he said. Eschert said she believes she really lost her job for raising concerns about a building being used by fire employees . Eschert said she believes the Facebook post is just a convenient excuse for the real motivation behind her firing. She had recently raised concerns about a building that fire employees were using on North Graham Street. 'There was an elevator that went from the basement up and it was wooden. And when we went in the spring, it didn't want to work too well. So we had to jump to make it function,' Eschert told WSOCTV. 'I saw wires hanging down, whether they were phone wires or electric wires,' she said. 'I didn't feel at that point it was safe -- absolutely not.' Her recent performance reviews had also praised the quality of her work. Eschert said she couldn't keep silent about the building's issues, and strongly believes that it was her objections to safety issues that made her a target. 'The type of work that we do, security is a massive concern,' she said.","Crystal Eschert was a fire investigator for the Charlotte Fired Department when she took to Facebook wonder why a police shooting near Ferguson wasn't getting the same level of attention as Brown's death .

"Earth’s true colour has been revealed in amazing detail by a Japanese weather satellite. From a distance of 22,240 miles (35,790km), the satellite shows what our planet looks like before any filters or image enhancements are made to the shot. And the incredibly high resolution image also highlights stunning details on Earth including clouds, oceans and Australia’s vast desert. Scroll down for video . The Japan Meteorological Agency's Himawari-8 satellite has returned its first true colour image of Earth, seen here. It wascaptured using all 16 image bands from the satellite.  Testing of  Himawari-8's systems, including related ground facilities, are reportedly going well . The image was taken by Japan’s Himawari-8 weather satellite, which  launched on 7 October 2014 and is said to be the first true-colour image returned by the satellite to Earth. A huge 11,000 by 11,000 pixel version is available on the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) website, although the makes advise downloading the file, rather than view it in a browser, because the image can take a long time to load. The satellite was placed in a geostationary orbit above Earth, which means it stays above the same portion of the planet - in this case Australia, Japan and the other regions seen. The instrument used to take the image was the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on the spacecraft. Himawari-8 is actually one of two twin satellites that will be used to provide continuous observation of the East Asia and Western Pacific regions. The next satellite, called Himawari-9, will launch in 2016. The use of the words ‘true colour’ is a little bit of a misnomer, as this is not exactly what the planet would look like to the human eye. Most images we see of Earth are colour-corrected to show how humans would see them. This image, however, was taken in multiple bands and shows the natural appearance of Earth from space. The image is said to be 'true colour' as it shows what the planet would look like from space without a human eye. However, to us the planet appears slightly more blue and colourful. By brightening the picture, shown, more detail and features can be revealed . The stunning 11,000 x 11,000 pixel shot reveals a huge amount of detail. Here can be seen the north coast of Australia, with the sun's light glinting in the Arafura Sea, while wisps of clouds can also be seen at the bottom of the image . Data from the Rosetta spacecraft taken from comet 67P suggests Earth's water may have come from asteroids, not comets. The Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis - or Rosina - on the spacecraft 'sniffed' the comet's atmosphere as it remained in orbit and analysed its composition. It found that water in the comet's atmosphere had a different ratio of deuterium-to-hydrogen than water on Earth. This may be the final nail in the coffin for the theory that comets brought water to Earth - and it may have finally proven that we have asteroids to thank for allowing life on our planet to thrive. In the centre of the image, the sun’s glint reflecting off the ocean, just north of Australia, can be seen. Further north, partially covered by clouds, is Japan and the rest of East Asia. To the right is the vast Pacific Ocean, perhaps highlighting one of the most striking things about the image; namely, how much of our planet is covered by water. Earth’s surface is  71 per cent water, with the other 29 per cent being the continents and islands. A whopping 96.5 per cent of this water is contained in the ocean as salt water, with the remaining 3.5 per cent being freshwater lakes and ice. But despite covering the vast majority of the surface, water accounts for just 0.02 per cent of our planet’s mass as, relative to the planet itself, the oceans are not very deep. Where exactly all this water came from has been a cause of much debate in recent years. As Earth was scorchingly hot early in its life, it’s widely believed that water was brought to Earth by space rocks: asteroids or comets. A few weeks ago, however, results from Esa’s Rosetta mission indicated that the water contained on the comet it is orbiting, 67P, differs from that on Earth. This supports the theory that water was brought to Earth by asteroids, not comets - although scientists note that further findings and studies will be needed to confirm the theory. Himawari-8, illustration shown, is actually one of two twin satellites that will be used to provide continuous observation of the East Asia and Western Pacific regions. The next satellite, Himawari-9, will launch in 2016 . Other images of Earth, such as Nasa's famous Blue Marble images (Western Hemisphere shown), use image enhancement and colour correction to show what the planet would look like to the human eye from space .","An image taken by a Japanese satellite launch on 7 October 2014 has snapped the true colour of planet Earth .

"Hundreds of thousands of families could be risking food poisoning by defrosting their turkeys in an unsuitable place – like the bath or the garden shed. Some 69 per cent of Britons who buy a frozen bird for their Christmas dinner – almost 11 million people – leave it in an unsafe place to thaw out. Just a quarter allow their poultry to defrost correctly in the fridge, a survey by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) revealed. Nearly 70 per cent of people who opted for a frozen turkey in the UK are defrosting it unsafely, in the bath, garage or garden shed, rather than the fridge, the Food Standards Agency has warned. People are left with a turkey dinner that looks and tastes delicious but contains a hidden risk that can’t be seen, tasted or smelled. Those who use an unrefrigerated area such as the garage, the shed or the bath can allow the spread of dangerous bacteria such as campylobacter – which is most commonly associated with food poisoning and responsible for an estimated 280,000 cases each year and up to 100 deaths. The FSA warned that failure to prepare a turkey for cooking correctly could leave a dinner that ‘looks and tastes delicious but contains a hidden risk that can’t be seen, tasted or smelt’. Last Christmas there were more than 3,000 confirmed cases of campylobacter in England and Wales, according to figures from the watchdog. The bug is usually found in the intestinal tract of poultry. But the Mail reported last month how seven out of ten fresh chickens are carrying campylobacter on the skin, according to latest figures from the agency. It declared yesterday as the national day to begin defrosting turkeys, reminding cooks that a typical large turkey weighing 11kg (24lb) will take two days to thaw. Kevin Hargin, the FSA’s head of food-borne disease, said: ‘We all love our turkey dinner at Christmas and this year should be no exception. It’s the little things you do that can make a real difference. ‘So if you make sure that your turkey is defrosted safely and in good time, you can enjoy your meal happily and safely.’ The FSA advises that home cooks should follow the retailer’s recommended defrosting time and thaw the bird in the fridge if possible or somewhere cool to slow the growth of germs. The bird should be covered, either in the original packaging or in a container to hold any thawing juices at the bottom of the fridge to avoid cross-contamination. Defrosting the turkey unsafely can spread food-causing bacteria such as campylobacter (pictured under a microscope). The FSA advises keeping the turkey in the fridge as cold temperatures stop bacteria growing . If the turkey is not defrosted thoroughly, it may not cook evenly and harmful bacteria could survive the cooking process. Online butcher Donald Russell advised using a coolbox. The company posted on Twitter: ‘Got a Donald Russell turkey? Take it out to defrost today – use the coolbox to save space in the fridge!’ However, some home cooks preparing for Christmas Day were already ignoring the safety advice yesterday. One user asked on Twitter: ‘Large son is bringing a large frozen turkey. Our small fridge and freezer is already packed solid. I can defrost it in the garden, right?’ Another said: ‘The only thing Christmassy in my house is the turkey defrosting in the sink.’","Nearly 70% of people opting for a frozen turkey are unsafely defrosting it .

"If you thought your Christmas decorations were the ones to beat this year, look away now. With 100,000 lights choreographed to a five-minute medley of Star Wars songs played by the London Symphony Orchestra, Tom BetGeorge has categorically put everyone in the world to shame. More than three million people have watched the video in just a few days. Incredible: Tom BetGeorge transformed his Bay Area bungalow into a Star Wars-themed 100,000-light show . Dramatic: The five-minute show synchronizes the lights to John Williams' compositions to tell the story . And if those figures don't sound convincing, have a look for yourself. BetGeorge worked for two months crafting handmade props and wiring 12,500 channels around his humble bungalow in Bay Area, California. For every minute of music, he spent 10 hours programming. He then dedicated his time to synchronizing each flash of light to tell the story of George Lucas' blockbuster - complete with light saber sound effects. Good cause: BetGeorge spent two months manufacturing the stunt to raise money for his local church . Keen to keep it fresh, BetGeorge has also prepared a light show using the same display for songs including Let It Go from Frozen and Daft Punk by Pentatonix, he told the Guardian. As the elaborate stunt was built to raise money for his local church, Centerville Presbyterian, BetGeorge said his gracious neighbors have been surprisingly supportive. Posting a high-quality video of the five-minute light show on YouTube, he wrote: 'Here's my tribute to my favorite songs on Star Wars! 'The neighbors are very supportive especially since I use the display to raise money for the poor and homeless through my church.

'A lot of people have been asking about how to donate to my church's free dining program online - if that's on your heart, please use this link and God bless!' The reaction, he insists, has been humbling. 'Honestly, it’s a little surreal. It’s humbling.

"The world could run out of computer space by 2020, a leading data storage company has warned. Seagate said we are facing a data capacity deficit of more than six zettabytes - nearly twice the data produced in 2013. Mark Whitby, the company’s vice president for branded products, said that there was ‘stratospheric demand’ for computers and that the industry has simply not kept up. Seagate said we are facing a data capacity deficit of more than six zettabytes - nearly twice the data produced in 2013. The warning serves as a reminder for users to clean out their hard drives (stock image) The warning serves as a reminder for users to clean out their hard drives and make the most of the space they have on their machines, rather than just buy more space. In an interview with Techradar, Mr Whitby said: ‘Data has never been more important. 'As valuable as oil and just as difficult to mine, model and manage, data is swiftly becoming a vital asset to businesses the world over’. Mr Whitby called the looming crisis a ‘data capacity gap’ and said that last year the total amount of digital data produced around the world was 3.5 zettabytes. By 2020, that will increase to 44 zettabytes of data annually, which is six zettabytes more than will be produced at the time. Mr Whitby called the looming crisis a ‘data capacity gap’, which, by 2020, will be which is six zettabytes more than will be produced at the time - the equivalent of 206,158,430,208 smartphones, assuming a typical device has 32GB of storage (the iPhone 6 is pictured) To put that into context, a single zettabyte is the equivalent of 34,359,738,368 smartphones, assuming a typical device has 32GB of storage. Mr Whitby said: ‘While the ability to squeeze ever more dense data onto the same amount of space is a real testament to human ingenuity and engineering, it's starting to reach the point where new technologies will have to take over.’ Mr Whitby blamed the hard drive industry for not developing new products, which could lead to consumers being frustrated (stock image) In the interview, he blamed the hard drive industry for not doing enough research into new products. Mr Whitby said Seagate was looking into heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) as one experimental technology to increase space. This technology uses lasers to heat the storage device and magnetically record data onto it. Techradar reported that this could lead to 50 terabits of storage per square inch, compared to the few hundred gigabits now . The report said: ‘To put this in perspective, a digital library of all books written in the world would be approximately 400 terabytes - meaning that in the very near future conceivably all such books could be stored on as few as 20 HAMR drives.’ Computers have followed Moore’s law since the 1970s - early computers had just five megabytes of capacity - which states their capacity will double every two years. The law was proposed by Intel founder Gordon Moore in a paper in 1965, but has a natural limit due to the materials used to make circuits. Only so many chips can be put together on a piece of silicon before they stop working properly, unless new materials are found - graphene has been suggested as one option. A typical external hard drive currently has a five terabytes of space. It costs around £200 ($312) and can store 2.5 million songs, 1,000 films and two million photos. For people who work with highly sensitive documents and official secrets - or are extremely paranoid about protecting their personal data - there is now a range of self-destructing hard drives. Reminiscent of the gadgets in Mission Impossible, the drives can be wiped instantly simply by sending a text message - but they come with a spy price tag of £1,000 ($1,600). There are three self-destructing drives available from London-based Secure Drives, as well as a Master Kill Switch. Prices start at £938 ($1,500), for the Autothysis DSP, while the Autothysis128s costs £967 ($1,560) and the top-of-the-range Autothysis128t costs £1,027 ($1,663). The Autothysis128s and Autothysis128t (pictured centre and right) are 2.5-inch solid state drives, that are controlled using a free smartphone app. When a user loses the drive, they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically. An authentication token (left) adds an extra level of security . The Autothysis128s is a 2.5-inch solid state drive (SSD), that is controlled using a free smartphone app available on Android and iOS. More than one smartphone can be linked to a drive, and if the phone is lost or stolen, the connection can be broken using a PIN code. The drive has 128GB of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers, or connected externally using a USB port. It also has built-in GSM, or cellular technology, which means it can receive text messages. When a user loses the drive, or wants to permanently delete the data on it, they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically. The technology is designed to fragment, or scramble, the data, making it impossible to extract or read, plus a built-in security measure stops any attempts made to recover the data. In addition to a text message, the data can be destroyed by turning off the GSM signal, entering a PIN too many times incorrectly, removing the drive from a PC, when the battery falls below a certain level, or using an optional authentication token.","Experts claim we are facing a data capacity deficit of more than six zettabytes - nearly twice all the data produced in 2013 .
Seagate said industry has not kept up with demand for data storage .
The warning serves as a reminder for users to clean out their hard drives .

"A white Milwaukee police officer who was fired after he fatally shot a mentally ill black man in a downtown park in April won't face criminal charges, the county's top prosecutor said Monday. Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said in an emailed press release that Christopher Manney won't be charged because he shot Dontre Hamilton in self-defense. Manney is at least the third white police officer to avoid charges in the past month after a confrontation that led to a black man's death. Christopher Manney who was fired from the Milwaukee Police Department in connection with the shooting and killing of Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill man in a downtown park in April, but will not be charged . Dontre Hamilton's mother, Maria Hamilton, whips her eyes as she is is flanked by her sons Dameion Perkins, right, and Nate Hamilton on the steps on the federal courthouse Monday . 'This was a tragic incident for the Hamilton family and for the community,' Chisholm said in a statement. 'But, based on all the evidence and analysis presented in this report, I come to the conclusion that Officer Manney's use of force in this incident was justified self-defense and that defense cannot be reasonably overcome to establish a basis to charge Officer Manney with a crime.' After waiting eight months for the decision, Hamilton's family reacted with disappointment and anger. At a chaotic news conference on the steps of the federal courthouse, family attorneys said they had asked the U.S. attorney in Milwaukee to seek a federal investigation. They also urged that protests be peaceful 'so as not to dishonor Dontre's name and the Hamilton family name.' But Hamilton's brother Nate spoke bitterly, saying the family had ""cried too long"" and ""we don't have to be the voice of reason."" Dontre Hamilton's mother, Maria Hamilton and brothers Dameion Perkins, left, and Nate Hamilton lead a protest Monday . Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm demonstrates bullet trajectory at news conference Monday, Dec. 22, 2014, in Milwaukee . 'We need to take our communities back. We need to protect each other. We need to stop the violence in our communities so we can get rid of these pigs that kill us,' he said to shouts and applause. 'Because that's what they are. They feed, they feed off of us. And we can't let them do that no more.' His remarks came just two days after two New York City police officers were ambushed in their patrol car. Police said that attack was carried out by a man who posted online about putting 'wings on pigs.' Jon Safran, a Hamilton family attorney, later said that Nate Hamilton doesn't condone 'any type of violence.' 'Obviously the family is dealing with great anxiety and frustration right now,' he said. 'They believe they were not provided the justice they hoped they were going to get.' Manney's attorney did not return a message seeking comment. Dontre Hamilton's brother, Dameion Perkins cries  on the steps of the federal courthouse . Chisholm announced that there would be no charges against former police office Christopher Manney in the fatal shooting of Dontre Hamilton . Chisholm consulted with experts on the use of force by police officers, who concluded Manney's conduct was justified. Emanuel Kapelsohn of the Peregrine Corp. said all the shots were discharged in 3 or 4 seconds and there was no evidence that Manney continued firing after Hamilton hit the ground. Manney suffered minor injuries, including a bite to his right thumb, a neck strain and neck contusion, the report said. He was treated for post-concussion syndromes, a mild traumatic brain injury and had physical therapy for bicep and rotator cuff injuries, the report said. Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney in October. He said at the time that Manney correctly identified Hamilton as mentally ill, but ignored department policy and treated him as a criminal by frisking him. Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney in October, saying Manney instigated the fight with an inappropriate pat-down . Manney shot 31-year-old Hamilton on April 30 after responding to a call for a welfare check on a man sleeping in the park. Manney said Hamilton resisted when he tried to frisk him. The two exchanged punches before Hamilton got a hold of Manney's baton and hit him on the neck with it, the former officer has said. Manney then opened fire, hitting Hamilton 14 time - including in the back. Hamilton's family said he suffered from schizophrenia and had recently stopped taking his medication. Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney in October, saying Manney instigated the fight with an inappropriate pat-down. The chief said Manney correctly identified Hamilton as mentally ill but ignored his training and department policy, and treated him as a criminal. 'You don't go hands-on and start frisking somebody only because they appear to be mentally ill,' Flynn said when he announced Manney had been dismissed. Hamilton's family said he suffered from schizophrenia and had recently stopped taking his medication . Hamilton's death preceded those of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City, but the case hasn't attracted as much attention despite frequent, mostly peaceful protests. Hamilton's family has used the protests to try to raise awareness about mental illness. Others said his death underlined race concerns, chanting ""people of color are people, too,"" and carrying signs that read ""black lives matter."" The Milwaukee Police Association condemned Manney's firing as a political move, and members voted no confidence in Flynn soon after the firing. Manney has appealed his firing and applied for disability, saying the shootings in Milwaukee and Ferguson have cost him sleep and made it difficult for him to think clearly. He also has said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The Wisconsin National Guard started calling up members over the weekend and are in position to respond rapidly if needed, said Maj. Paul Rickert. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. requested the Guard's assistance after 74 protesters were arrested for blocking rush hour traffic Friday night on Interstate 43. On Monday, the state Department of Military Affairs activated its emergency operations center to monitor the situation in Milwaukee and coordinate activities between any affected state agencies. The Milwaukee Police Association condemned Manney's firing as a political move, and members voted no confidence in Flynn soon after the firing . Raymond Dall'Osto, a former Milwaukee public defender and former legal director of the ACLU's Wisconsin chapter, said before Chisholm's announcement that it was a difficult case. He said some people are employed in professions that run a greater risk of personal injury or death, 'but that doesn't give you a greater right to take someone else's life.' Milwaukee police announced in December they would accelerate training that equips officers for dealing with crises, including encounters with the mentally ill. Only about 20 per cent of the force's roughly 1,800 officers have had the training . Sputnik news is already worrying the situation could spark public outcry similar to the Ferguson case with 74 arrested Friday in a mass protest that caused a three-mile traffic jam. The Wisconsin’s Attorney General, JB Van Hollen, told Fox 6 Now he had kept himself at a 'deliberate distance' from the case. In the past, he fought against legislation that required an outside agency investigate officer involved deaths. 'We didn't have an example of how the prior system was broken. The way these were being investigated, people may not have liked the outcomes, but I didn't see any cases where changing the outcomes of the investigations would have changed the outcomes,' he said.","Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said in an emailed statement that Christopher Manney won't be charged because he shot Dontre Hamilton in self-defense .

"Michael Phelps' self-proclaimed 'intersex' girlfriend has been offered a role in a porn film to act out their alleged fling. Taylor Lianne Chandler has been approached by porn baron Vivid Entertainment boss Steve Hirsch, who has made millions from hardcore pornography films for the internet. Chandler, 41, told TMZ who reported the news, that she was still in the 'wine and dine me' stage of negotiations. Scroll down for video . Michael Phelps' (left) self-proclaimed 'intersex' girlfriend Taylor Lianne Chandler (right)  has been offered a role in a porn film to act out their alleged fling . Porn baron: Steven Hirsch  poses with Savanna Samson, one of his Vivid Entertainment stars. Hirsch, who has made millions from hardcore pornography films for the internet, reportedly approached Chandler . Last month Chandler claimed that the most decorated Olympian of all time pursued her on Tinder – but that they are no longer an item. Phelps has yet to comment on Chandler’s claims. Chandler, claims to have had a romance with the US athlete, 12 years her junior, before he went into rehab in September and that they became involved after he approached her on the dating app. However, such is Phelps' fame, that she wasn't sure if the messages were coming from a made-up account. I'm yelling Tinder: A look at Phelps' alleged Tinder profile, which is how he and Chandler first met . She told The Daily Beast's Aurora Snow: 'He pursued me [on Tinder]. He was actually outside the age range for what my account was setup for. But what I've learned is when someone looks at whatever and likes you, even if they're younger it shows up in your feed. 'But at the time I just didn't think it was real. You just figure it's fake.' Chandler explained that once they'd met up, their relationship seemed quite serious. She said: 'We talked about the fact that I wasn't looking to get involved with someone unless it was serious. I'm not ugly, so its not like men don't approach me, but I wanted something real. And it felt real with him. I've been to his house four times, we talk everyday, and I've slept with him more than once.' Chandler admitted on a Facebook post that she'd been born an 'intersex' - someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries . Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore . Feet in the sand: Chandler has been a champion for gender rights . Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia . The blonde says that she had a fulfilling sex life with Phelps, who made her feel 'like the most beautiful woman in the world'. The pair are no longer together, but for reasons that Chandler won't disclose. She insists that the split is not because she was forced to admit her past, and says that the reason  is for Phelps to disclose. Chandler admitted on a Facebook post that she'd been born an 'intersex' – someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries - with the name David Roy Fitch. She later had surgery. She wrote: 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man. 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.' GUILTY: Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps walks into a courthouse Friday morning for a trial on drunken driving and other charges. He pled guilty . After his arrest Phelps went to rehab. He was busted with a .14 blood alcohol level. He has since gone to rehab . She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer. 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland. Showing some skin: Photos of Michael Phelps in a jail cell after his DUI arrest have been released . The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident. On Friday Phelps pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and received 18 months of supervised probation and a one-year suspended jail sentence. The 18-time Olympic gold medalist was arrested for drunken driving early on September 30 after speeding and then crossing the double yellow lines inside a Baltimore tunnel, police said. 'The last three months of my life have been some of the hardest times I've ever gone through, some of the biggest learning experiences I've ever had,' Phelps, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, told reporters. 'I'm happy to be moving forward. I'll continue to grow from this.' Phelps, 29, was clocked by radar at around 1:40 a.m. traveling 84 miles per hour (135 kph) in a 45-mph (72-kph) zone, police said, adding that he blew a .14 on a Breathalyzer, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Maryland. He faced up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. 'I hope we don't have this conversation again and I'm optimistic that we won't have this conversation again,' Judge Nathan Braverman told Phelps during his sentencing. Police said an officer followed Phelps' 2014 Land Rover onto northbound Interstate 95, through the Fort McHenry Tunnel, and pulled him over just beyond the tunnel's toll plaza. The drunken-driving arrest was the second for Phelps, who has spent most his life working feverishly in the pool but admits he likes to have a good time when not competing. Following his arrest, Phelps, who is eyeing a spot on the U.S. team for the 2016 Olympics, was suspended for six months by USA Swimming and barred from representing the United States at the 2015 FINA World Swimming Championships in Russia. Phelps said he completed a 45-day rehab program at an Arizona treatment center following his arrest, continues aftercare in Baltimore, and will participate in Alcoholics Anonymous.","Taylor Lianne Chandler claims to have dated US swimmer Michael Phelps .

"A baby boy with a flattened head is on the road to recovery thanks to a special helmet which encourages his skull to grow in a normal shape. Six month old Freddie Summersgill was diagnosed with flat head syndrome, a condition which causes his forehead to bulge out because the back of his skull has become flat. His family managed to raise the £2,000 needed for the custom-built helmet and special pillow to treat the condition, so that Freddie's head would develop without an unusual shape. After wearing the helmet for a month, the flattened bit of Freddie's head has already grown by 7mm and his family hope the progress  will continue. Six month old Freddie Summersgill now has a custom-built helmet to cure his flat head syndrome, thanks to fundraising efforts from the local community, who raised £2,000 for his care . Freddie's mother Becci Oram noticed her son's ears were lopsided and his forehead pushed out, so she took him to a specialist who diagnosed flat head syndrome. Here, she is pictured with her son now he has a special helmet which will help his head grown normally . Freddie's mother, Becci Oram, 24, from Billingham, County Durham, said first spotted the change in the shape of her son's head when he was two months old. She was told it was due to tight muscles in his neck and was nothing to worry about. However, it got progressively worse to the point where Freddie's ears were lopsided and his forehead pushed out, and Ms Oram decided further checks were necessary. A trip to the specialist clinic when he was four and a half months old revealed he had flat head syndrome, which is medically known as plagiocephaly and brachycephaly. This common condition causes the head to become either flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical and distorted, or flattened at the back, which can cause the forehead to bulge out. Sometimes the ears may not be the same height and the head may look like a parallelogram when seen from above. The head can be flattened in the womb, and the condition is more common in babies born prematurely because they're squeezed through the birth canal when their skulls haven't fully developed. But the most common cause is because babies now sleep on their backs every night – a position doctors advise to prevent cot death. Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually from sleeping on their back. It's known as 'flat head syndrome' or 'moulding' and there are two types – plagiocephaly and brachycephaly . Plagiocephaly is the most common type and occurs when the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical and distorted. For example, the ears may be misaligned and when seen from above the head, looks like a parallelogram. Brachycephaly is when the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen. To compensate, the front of the skull sometimes bulges out. The head can be flattened in the womb, and the condition is more common in babies born prematurely because they're squeezed through the birth canal when their skulls haven't fully developed. But the most common cause is because babies now sleep on their backs every night – a position doctors advise to prevent cot death. When they lie on their backs, the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat. The conditions is not thought to be medically dangerous, and it will often correct itself over time. When they lie on their backs, the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat. Although not thought to be medically dangerous, the flattened head shape can become permanent - which can have psychological implications for children as they grow up. Doctors say if parents move their babies onto their tummies during the day, as well as changing them from different chairs, so there isn't constant pressure on the back of the head, the condition should improve within eight weeks. However, Mrs Oram was told of a private treatment called helmet therapy, in which babies wear a custom-built helmet which applies pressure to the bulging parts of his skull and relieve pressure from the flatter parts, allowing growth in these areas. The controversial treatment is not available on the NHS as doctors say there is not enough evidence it works if parents change their babies position in the day. Mrs Oram decided this treatment would be best for Freddie, but as the helmets cost £2,000, she couldn't afford it. The family could manage to fund a £500 deposit, but desperately wanted to raise the rest of the money to ensure that Freddie received the treatment. They were astonished when the local community rushed to aid them, offering to hold a fundraiser at Billingham Synthonia Club, so Freddie would receive a helmet. Local businesses donated prizes for a raffle, including a brand new car and a football signed by Middlesbrough FC. Family, friends and other members of the community also made donations. They have now been able to buy the helmet, which Freddie must wear 23 hours a day, taking it off for only half an hour in the morning or evening. Ms Oram, who is also a mother to three-year-old Leo said she wanted the treatment as she was worried having an oddly shaped head would affect Freddie in later life. She said: 'I was told that he would not be able to wear a bike helmet when he was older. 'Little boys also have short hair so you would have been able to see it. 'When we put the helmet on the first few times he would have a cry but he is used to it now. You forget it is there. The only thing is you can't kiss him properly so when it is off you get the kisses.' Ms Oram and her mother Val want to thank everyone in the local community who helped raise money for Freddie's treatment. Ms Oram said: 'It is nice to know that people I don't even know have shown their support. With it being so close to Christmas too and people still handing out donations, it has been brilliant.' Freddie has been wearing the helmet for around a month now a recent check revealed the flat part of his head has already grown by 7mm. After a month he is no longer in the 'serious' category for flat head syndrome, instead he is now in the 'moderate' category, his mother said. The £2,000 raised will be used to pay for Freddie's helmet as well as a special pillow for when he no longer has to wear it. Ms Oram said: 'I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone. If I could afford to pull £2,000 out of my own pocket then I would. 'It is nice to know that people I don't even know have shown their support. With it being so close to Christmas too and people still handing out donations, it has been brilliant.'","Six month old Freddie Summersgill has flat head syndrome .

"Pioneering lens implants that promise to restore vision to those plagued by failing eyesight have been used for the first time. The lenses are designed to help those suffering from not only long and short-sightedness, but also cataracts or astigmatism. The plastic lenses – which are inserted in a simple operation and should never need to be replaced – use tiny circular grooves to change the way light is bent and offer smooth shifts in focus. Pioneering lens implants that promise to restore vision to those plagued by failing eyesight have been used for the first time (file picture) They cost around £3,900 for each eye and are not funded by the NHS. London’s Claremont Clinic is one of the first places in the world to offer the procedure. One patient, Susan Wright, 57, a charity consultant from Macclesfield who suffered from cataracts and long-sightedness, said: ‘I have never had particularly good eyesight. I had cataracts and long-sightedness and I would get a sense that there was a blank space in part of my vision. ‘Now my mid and long-range vision is absolutely excellent and I have been told my short range vision will continue to improve. Colours are much brighter and everything is sharper.’ Previous correctional lenses have had problems causing glare and halo bursts and do not focus smoothly like the natural eyes. Trials showed 81 per cent of users reported 20/20 long-distance vision after the surgery, 98 per cent said they no longer needed glasses for distance vision, 96 per cent for middle distance, and 73 per cent for near distance. The lenses are designed to help those suffering from not only long and short-sightedness, but also cataracts or astigmatism (file picture) Jenny Brindley, 58, who had to wear glasses at seven, said: ‘Before the operation my eyesight had deteriorated a lot. Gradually things were becoming more and more yellow. I was quite short-sighted and that had got worse and things were quite misty. ‘I like art and visiting galleries and watching foreign films so my eyesight was stopping me doing a lot of things. ‘I wore prescription glasses from the age of seven, but I work with children with autism and they grab at them a lot. ‘After the first operation it was the first time I could see the end of the bedroom clearly. I noticed for the first time that my husband’s jumper was purple. I had always thought it was brown. It’s really much better than I expected.’","Pioneering lens implants that restore vision are used for the first time .

"A rise in the numbers of tourists visiting the Antarctic is increasing the chances of penguins catching deadly diseases. With humans only having started to travel to the continent around 200 years ago, in the period 2013-14, more than 37,00 people are believed to have visited the area, in addition to a large number of researchers. And with penguins in particular believed to have a weaker immune system due to their isolation from normal pathogens found in the rest of the world, tourism is proving a threat to numbers. Scroll down for video . A rise in the number of new diseases killing penguins is believed to correlate to the increase in tourists visiting Antarctica . Nearly 40,000 tourists visited the Antarctica in the year 2013-14, as well as thousands of researchers . Wray Grimaldi, from the University of Otago in Denuedin, New Zealand told the New Scientist: 'The effects of both a growing tourism industry and research presence will not be without consequences . 'Penguins are highly susceptible to infectious diseases.' A survey that  originated in 1947 discovered the birds had contracted diseases such as Salmonella, E. coli, West Nile virus and Avian pox virus infections. The team at the New Zealand University reported in their journal Polar Biology that thousands of penguins' deaths can be attributed to catching foreign diseases. Tourists are warned to sanitise their footwear when they arrive in the Antarctica, but as the penguins' immune system is unable to identify foreign pathogens, they are at risk . Avian pox was discovered to have killed more than 400 gentoo penguins in 2006, and caused 60 per cent mortality rates throughout another outbreak in 2008. Tourists are advised to sanitise their footwear when they visit Antarctica to help combat the chance to spreading disease. Scientists say it is also possible many diseases could be spread to the flightless birds by other animals who migrate to the continent. Norman Ratcliffe of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, told the New Scientist: 'The tour companies are quite careful to make sure everyone cleans their boots before they go ashore, they don't allow any animal products to be taken ashore.","Almost 40,000 tourists and researchers visit the Antarctica each year .

"He is known around the world for his huge talent.

At a first look you can't say it is Ronaldo - but it's a nice statue and does not pass unnoticed.' Another man, asked about the sculpture, said: 'I don't think the statue looks like him.

"Barack Obama has apparently chosen sides in the pitched battle between New York City's mayor and his police commissioner – and Mayor Bill de Blasio came out on the losing end. The White House said Sunday that the president called New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton – but not de Blasio – during the Obama family's extended Hawaii vacation to offer 'his full support for any possible assistance in the days and weeks ahead.' The president then left his vacation home to play golf. De Blasio and Bratton have been at each other's throats since Saturday's cold-blooded murder of two beat cops in Brooklyn. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton (front) got a call of support from the president over the weekend, but his boss -- Mayor Bill de Blasio (background) -- got only the sound of Obama's silence . MEMORIAL: One of New York's Finest walks past a makeshift memorial to two police officers gunned down by an agitator angry about two recent high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of white cops . NATURAL HABITAT: Obama is shown golfing last January in Hawaii, where his entire family is currently on an extended holiday vacation . The police commissioner blames the mayor for stoking anti-police sentiment in the aftermath of the July 17 choking death of Eric Garner at the hands of a Staten Island patrolman. Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, the gunman who killed the officers over the weekend, suggested on his Instagram account that his double-murder was retaliation for the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown, shot to death by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Both of the dead men were black. Both officers are white. 'I'm putting wings on pigs today,' Brinsley wrote 'They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs.' Brinsley killed himself on a subway platform shortly after firing into the closed window of a patrol car, killing officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. While the administration was quick to publicize the president's call with Bratton, it has been mum about any de Blasio sightings on his calendar. HEROES: Officers Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) were shot and killed Saturday in the Brooklyn borough of New York. The suspect, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, ran to a subway station and killed himself . Actor and Academy Award nominee James Woods tweeted broadsides at Al Sharpton and Mayor Bill de Blasio over the weekend, including this image showing the mayor (center) making his way through a police gauntlet at a Brooklyn hospital while cops on both sides of the hallway turned their backs on him . The White House has not responded to questions from DailyMail.com about whether Obama has spoken with de Blasio at all since Saturday. Obama followed his call to Bratton with a shortened round of golf and an afternoon on the beach at Bellows Air Force Base on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. A White House pool reporter described 'a 20-minute drive through scenic lush Oahu countryside ringed by mountains' on the way from the golf course to the Obama family's beach hideaway. The president's golfing foursome on Sunday included White House Deputy Political Strategy and Outreach Director Joe Paulsen, intellectual property attorney Preston Heard, and longtime friend Bobby Titcomb. Titcomb attracted unwanted attention in 2011 when he was arrested for soliciting an undercover Honolulu police officer for sex, thinking she was a prostitute, during a sting operation. He pleaded no contest to the charge and six months later it was removed from his record, according to the terms of a court agreement. If Obama has actively chosen sides in the Bratton-de Blasio tiff, it would signal a critical loss of support for the embattled mayor. Republicans including former New York Governor George Pataki have sided with Police Commissioner William Bratton over de Blasio -- the same choice President Obama seems to have made . After the far-left mayor offered support for liberal protesters who disagreed with a grand jury decision to clear the officer who killed Garner, hundreds of New York City police signed petitions circulated by their union that ask de Blasio to stay away from their funerals if they die in the line of duty. On Saturday, hours after Ramos and Liu were pronounced dead, de Blasio visited the Woodhull Medical Center to pay his respects. Dozens of police on hand physically turned their backs on him as he walked down a long, cop-lined corridor on his way to meet the fallen officers' families. Presidents of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association, the two largest police unions, both participated in the show of disdain. Bratton, the police commissioner, told NBC's Today show that the display of frustration was the wrong signal to send at the wrong time. 'I don’t think it was appropriate, particularly in that setting, but it’s reflective of the anger of some of them,' he said. Police unions, however, are united in the full-throated condemnation of the mayor. 'Mayor de Blasio, the blood of these two officers is clearly on your hands,” sergeants association president Ed Mullins said in a statement Saturday night. 'It is your failed policies and actions that enabled this tragedy to occur. I only hope and pray that more of these ambushes and executions do not happen again.' CALM WATERS: Five time zones away from New York City, the president is protected by Secret Service on land and the Coast Guard in the ocean as he golfs, dines and shops with the first lady and their children . The president of the patrolman's union, Patrick Lynch, has also issued scathing criticism of de Blasio for failing to offer support to two police lieutenants who were assaulted during protests at the Brooklyn Bridge following the grand jury decision in the Garner case. 'That blood on the hands starts at the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor,' Lynch said late Saturday. 'After the funerals, those responsible will be called on the carpet and held accountable.' New York Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel slammed the unions in a rare show of anti-labor sentiment from onw of Washington's most liberal lawmakers. 'They should be conducting interviews, mourning those that they lost and their family, talking about ""how do insane people get firearms?"" and not criticizing – but seeing how we can stop insane people from getting an opportunity to get firearms to kill anybody,' he said on MSNBC's 'The Rundown.' 'Two human beings were shot dead, we should not be pointing fingers at the mayor of the city of New York.'","President is on extended vacation as racial tensions reach boiling point in New York City .

"Embattled Mayor Bill de Blasio and the city's five police unions are cooling off tensions at least until the two NYPD officers who were brutally murdered over the weekend are put to rest. De Blasio has been under heavy fire from the unions serving the NYPD's 35,000 employees for what they have called an anti-police stance from City Hall. But on Monday, hours after visiting the family of the slain, the mayor and police Commissioner Bill Bratton asked for a cease fire from all sides — with no protests or politicking until families and friends can properly mourn and bury officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. Scroll down for video . Mayor Bill de Blasio and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton on Monday met with the leaders of the city's five police unions, who agreed to hold off on protests until the slain officers can be properly memorialized . De Blasio visits the home of Officer Rafael Ramos, who was brutally murdered in the line of duty . 'This is a time for every New Yorker to think about these families—focus on these families, put them first,' de Blasio told reporters at NYPD headquarters.  'We can do that by respecting their pain, respecting their time of mourning. 'I'm asking everyone across the spectrum to put aside protests, put aside demonstrations until these funerals are past. Let's focus just on these families and what they've lost. 'I think that's the way to build toward a more unified, decent city.' Bratton said he spoke with the heads of NYPD's five unions on Monday and they agreed to focus on the fallen Finest. 'After the funerals, then we can continue the dialogue that has begun about issues and differences that exist,' the commissioner said. 'I think it's appropriate that the focus has to be on our fallen officers' families.' Ramos will be mourned at a viewing service Friday at Christ Tabernacle in Glendale, Queens, and buried the following day. Liu's funereal arrangements are pending the arrival of his family from China. De Blasio's visit comes a day after Ramos' family said they were disappointed that the mayor hadn't stopped by to offer them condolences . De Blasio stopped for a somber visit the distraught families of officers Ramos and Liu, who were assassinated by a deranged killer hellbent on killing cops as retribution for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The mayor said the families of the officers 'are now our family and we will stand with them.' 'They are suffering an unspeakable pain right now,' added de Blasio, who was accompanied by first lady Chirlane McCray and police Commissioner Bill Bratton in visiting Liu's home and Ramos' distraught widow and two teenage sons. 'Our first obligation is to respect these families in mourning,' he said. 'Our first obligation is to stand by them in every way we can — and I call upon everyone to focus on these families in these next days.' The shooting was 'an attack on every single New Yorker and we have to see it as such,' de Blasio concluded. De Blasio was accompanied by first lady Chirlane McCray (center) and police Commissioner Bill Bratton (right) NYPD boss Bratton on Sunday received a call from President Obama expressing condolences and an offer of 'full support' in handling this crisis. De Blasio, meanwhile, appears to have been snubbed by the White House. Officers Ramos and Liu were sitting in their squad car in Brooklyn's crime-ridden Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood Saturday when shooter Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, killed them 'execution style.' Brinsley posted a series of posts on social media decrying police action and saying he would 'put wings on pigs' over the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown and the chokehold death of Staten Island father Eric Garner. Cops and NYPD supporters have publicly criticized Mayor de Blasio because he didn't throw his blind support behind police. Many cops in New York City have signed a pledge asking the mayor to not attend their funerals if they die in the line of duty. On Saturday, as dozens of police stood in a hospital hallway after hearing news of the Brooklyn slayings, many turned their backs to de Blasio as he walked in. Mayor de Blasio greets officers standing guard outside the Ramos home in Brooklyn . Police and politicians have  accused de Blasio of stoking up an atmosphere of police hatred that contributed to the police murders over the weekend. Rudy Giuliani, mayor of the city from 1994-2001, said de Blasio should admit he was 'wrong about his view of things.' If he were at the helm of City Hall, Giuliani would say: 'Maybe I was wrong about putting too much emphasis on police misconduct, when in fact police misconduct is a minor part of the problem. 'Community serious violent crime is a much bigger part of the problem. I think I would say to them, the people who are saving black lives in the city are you: the New York City Police Department.' Murdered: NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) were assassinated in cold-blood while they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood Saturday . Former New York governor George Pataki also piled in, calling the killings a 'predictable outcome of the mayor's behavior. Bratton shot back accusations that the mayor is to blame for an increase threat to officers. 'I don't believe that at all,' the NYPD boss said on NBC's 'Today Show. 'I've spent a lot of time with this man. I have received this year over $400 million outside of my normal budget to improve our training, to improve our facilities, to acquire technology.' NYPD brass and de Blasio are expected to hold a press conference at the department's 1 Police Plaza headquarters this afternoon. The grieving son of a New York City police officer shot dead execution style on a Brooklyn street Saturday posted a heart-wrenching goodbye to his slain father to Facebook. Jaden Ramos, 13, will never see his father Rafael Ramos again after he was murdered along with his partner 'just for being a police officer,' heartbroken Ramos said. Once given the incomprehensible news, Ramos took to social media to publicly celebrate his adoring father and condemn his cold-blooded killer. Bereaved: Jaden Ramos wrote the message in a public post after his father was murdered on Saturday . Gift: Jaden posted this picture online some days ago as a birthday present to his father . 'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' Jaden posted. He continued: 'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.' It was a somber addendum to an earlier December post in which he honored his dad's 40th birthday. 'Happy birthday to the best dad in the world, you are always there for me even when it's almost impossible,' he wrote December 9. 'We have so many good times it's not even funny, I love you so much.' Love: The 40-year-old lived with his wife Margarita and celebrated his 40th birthday on December 12 . Officer Ramos' family on Sunday said they were 'disappointed' that de Blasio hadn't visited them to express his condolences. 'It would be nice for him to come here and say something to us that can lift our spirits and give us hope for the future,” cousin Ronnie Gonzalez, 54, told the New York Daily News. At the time, the mayor and Commissioner Bratton had been attending a somber mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. Police officers pay their respects at a makeshift memorial near the site where New York City police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were murdered in Brooklyn . Meanwhile, Gov. Andrew Cuomo stopped by the Ramos' home in Brooklyn's Cypress Hill neighborhood as the heartbroken family sought 'some wisdom, some answers,' the New York Post reported. 'It’s just unimaginable, there are no words,' the governor said afterward, according to the newspaper. Cuomo was asked: 'Why, why my dad? What has my dad done? What did my dad do wrong?' 'The truth is, his father did everything right,' he said afterward, according to the Post. 'His father was a beautiful public servant who protected me and my family and you and your family and we have to remember that this holiday season.'

"Last season, Arsenal were top of the Premier League on Boxing Day. This season, they are 6th. Click here to read the five things the Gunners need to do to reach the top four . Liverpool were runners-up in the Premier League last season, but this year they're struggling to break into the top half. The sale of Luis Suarez and injury to Daniel Sturridge have seen them struggle to score goals, and defensive troubles have left them leaking goals. After 17 games last season, Liverpool were top of the Premier League with 36 points. Now, they are 10th with 22. Here, Sportsmail look at the five things they need to do to right their wrongs, and climb into the top four of the Premier League. SEND FOR STURRIDGE . Liverpool have a nine-point gap to make up if they want to gatecrash the Champions League placings and for that they need goals and more goals. It is hardly rocket science to suggest a return to fitness for striker Sturridge would make a huge difference to a squad desperately short of forwards. He scored 24 times for Liverpool last season, remember. Sturridge’s arrival would provide a psychological boost and surely Raheem Sterling will be especially delighted to have someone to provide the finishing touches to his runs and crosses. Daniel Sturridge has struggled with injury, but Liverpool desperately need him back in the New Year . MAKE HISTORY . Liverpool have 22 points from 17 games this season. No side with that total has finished higher than sixth in Premier League history. Boss Brendan Rodgers said after the draw against Arsenal on Sunday that a similar run to last year’s 11 wins on the spin could do it. Liverpool are tenth, seven points above the relegation zone. They may be going in the right direction but that is a lot of catching up to do. For a period on Sunday, it looked like Liverpool would kick-start their season - now they need to make history . SIGN A CECH . Simon Mignolet has been taken out of the firing line after his error-strewn season but Brad Jones is only ever going to be an interim measure. Brendan Rodgers needs an experienced, reliable stopper between the posts and if Mignolet does not get his confidence back, then it might be worth a punt for someone in January, even on loan. So how about Petr Cech, currently No 2 to Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea? Rodgers and Jose Mourinho are mates, after all. Petr Cech is No 2 to Thibaut Courtois at Chelsea - perhaps Liverpool could sign him in January? FIND A WINNING FORMATION . Rodgers has tweaked and fiddled this season, partly out of necessity and partly because most of his summer signings have struggled one way or the other. Has he accidentally stumbled on a winning formula with 3-4-3? Stacking midfield seems to suit Lazar Markovic and it also gives Steven Gerrard a bit more room for manoeuvre, although it does put the defence under pressure. Mamadou Sakho was hardly Mr Stability against Arsenal while Kolo Toure is off to the Africa Cup of Nations, which suggests Rodgers may have to get that chalkboard out again. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is under pressure to find a winning formation for his team . VIDEO Rogers buoyant despite mistakes . DISCOVER THE REAL DEJAN . Anyone who saw Dejan Lovren play for Southampton and then for Liverpool would struggle to believe it was the same player. The central defender has been a mistake waiting to happen since his summer move but this is someone who is usually comfortable on the ball and, in theory, perfectly qualified to slot into a 3-4-3. The groin injury he picked up on Capital One Cup duty could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. It gives him a chance to re-group, which should be to Liverpool’s gain because he is a class act. Dejan Lovren suffered an injury in the cup, but his performances on the pitch have left a lot to be desired .

He revealed that he was receiving treatment for the disease in September, before announcing that he had been given the all-clear in early November. The 31-year-old ran the Buenos Aries marathon in October to raise money for Argentine cancer charity FUCA (Foundation for Research, Teaching and Cancer Prevention). The 31-year-old midfielder – who last appeared for Newcastle 14 months ago - has successfully battled the illness on two occasions and says he is now only looking to the future. 'I am good, happy and enjoying every training and every day,' he said. 'I am just looking forward. You never know what can happen in football. The most important thing for me now is to be back and to try to get fit and to be ready if I have a chance of playing. The only thing I can do is do my best.'

He hasn't been around much but he's in pretty good shape and we are hoping that in two or three weeks he could be back in and around the first team. 'He's keen to earn his right to play but, like any player here, I have to give him an even keel in terms of access to the first team. It's now up to Jonas but it will certainly be emotional for us and for him when he returns, and we will look forward to it.'

"Scott Sinclair is expecting his first child, with 24-year-old former Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan. The Manchester City winger's girlfriend is reportedly three months pregnant, and a source told The Sun she is 'bursting with excitement. The insider said: 'It's a much-wanted pregnancy which makes it all the sweeter. Helen is so thrilled. She was bursting with excitement.' Scott Sinclair (right) and his actress girlfriend are set to welcome their first child into the world next year . Sources close to Helen Flanagan (left) have revealed she is pregnant with Sinclair's baby . Sinclair has found game-time hard to come by since his move to the Etihad Stadium, but made a rare substitute appearance against Crystal Palace on Saturday, coming on in the 89th minute. He has only made three appearances in all competitions this season, all of which from the bench, and only one in the Premier League. Sinclair's girlfriend Flanagan was seen showing off her baby bump on a recent holiday in Dubai, where she sported a turquoise bikini. MailOnline has contacted Helen's representatives for comment. VIDEO Courtesy of FHM . Flanagan is well-known for her appearance on the ITV reality show, 'I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here' After a brief split last year, Flanagan and Sinclair have reunited and are now reportedly set to become parents . While she appeared to be in high spirits in Dubai, Flanagan has admitted to being unwell recently, with friends telling The Sun that she has been experiencing bad morning sickness. On December 2, Helen tweeted: 'Nothing better than your mum looking after you when your feeling ill (sic).' And just a few days earlier, she shared with her fans that she was 'poorly in bed'. The pair have been together for six years, although they had a brief split in 2013. They broke up amid claims the sportsman had sent a series of saucy text messages to TV presenter Donatella Panayiotou after they met while on holiday in Cannes. But they reunited soon afterwards and in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Flanagan said: 'I don't think I'm ready for marriage, but I've always wanted to have children. I always feel broody, I've been broody since I was about 18! I absolutely love children, I really really do.

"A pill to combat obesity is a step closer today after scientists discovered cells that transform 'bad' fat to 'good'. The cells, known as ILC2s, are involved in converting white fat, which causes people to put on weight, into brown fat, which helps burn excess energy. The U.S. researchers believe that by targeting the body's metabolic pathways, where these cells work, could help combat obesity. They said the breakthrough could lead to a new way of treating obesity-related diseases. Scientists at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York have discovered a specific type of cell, known as ILC2s, help convert white or 'bad' fat into 'good' brown fat. They believe the study could pave the way for a pill to treat obesity, and help combat obesity-related diseases . The human body has two types of fat tissue. When a person eats too many calories without burning them off, they are stored as white fat cells. That is what causes a person to put on weight. Brown fat cells burn excess energy and subsquently reduce the size and numbers of white fat cells. The new study found ILC2s, which live in white fat tissue and limit the development of obesity by increasing energy levels, play a part in controlling weight gain. They help transform white 'bad' fat into brown 'good', in turn helping combat diabetes, heart disease and other life-threatening conditions linked to obesity. Past studies have revealed problems with the function of these cells has been found to cause obesity in mice. But more recent experiments on white fat tissue have revealed the abnormalities are also present in humans and have an impact on energy metabolism. This new piece of research found ILC2s stimulates the browning of white fat in response to a signalling protein called IL-33. The new research was carried out by researchers at New York's Weill Cornell Medical College. Professor David Artis and colleagues also showed that when mice are injected with IL-33 they accumulated more ILC2s in their white fat, which burned up calories and decreased their weight compared with animals not given the treatment. White fat cells, right, accumulate in the body when a person eats too many calories, but fails to burn them off. Brown fat cells, left, burn excess energy, and help reduce the size and number of white fat cells, thus helping a person to lose weight . One in four adults in England is obese and these figures are set to climb to 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women by 2050. Obesity and diabetes already costs the UK over £5 billion every year which is likely to rise to £50 billion in the next 36 years. As well as helping people to lose weight a drug which turned white cells into brown cells would reduce the chance of developing type 2 diabetes and protect against heart disease. Professor Artis, of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said: 'Here we identify ILC2s in human white adipose tissue and demonstrate decreased ILC2 responses are a conserved characteristic of obesity in humans and mice. 'Interleukin (IL)-33 was found to be critical for the maintenance of ILC2s in white adipose tissue and in limiting adiposity in mice by increasing caloric expenditure.'","Scientists in New York found ILC2s help convert white fat into brown .

"It's football's favourite wet blanket. No matter how breath-taking the accomplishment, there will always be some cynic who queries, half-seriously, whether they could have done it on a wet midweek in Stoke. 'Lionel Messi has just scored a wonderful hat-trick in the Clasico!' 'Yeah great, but I bet he couldn't do it on a windy, wintry night at the Britannia.' It is a real compliment to Stoke City that a visit there is regarded so difficult it has become the subject of a million pub retorts.

But, as Chelsea prepare to make the trip to the Potteries on Monday night, is playing Stoke in their own backyard really that daunting for the Premier League elite? Well, it depends who you are. While Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City have found the place a graveyard in recent years, Chelsea and Manchester United seem to thrive there. Indeed, the Blues' 3-2 reverse there last season is their only loss at the Britannia since Stoke came into the Premier League in 2008. Chelsea have won three and drawn two of their trips there, the most memorable being a 4-0 thrashing in January 2013 built on two own goals by Jonathan Walters. Jose Mourinho s still chasing his first win on the ground but with Chelsea in imperious form, they will start as strong favourtes on Monday night.

Manchester United also slipped up there last season, losing 2-1, but were unbeaten under Sir Alex Ferguson's leadership. They twice won by a single-goal margin and twice by a two-goal margin, with the meeting in September 2011 ending in a 1-1 draw. By contrast, the prospect of a visit to Stoke strikes fear into the hearts of Arsenal fans - and Arsene Wenger.

The Gunners have won just once in seven visits there, losing on four occasions, and the trip inevitably ends in injuries, accusations of being soft and Wenger moaning about Stoke's bully-boy tactics. They have already made the trip this season, back at the beginning of the month, and went down 3-2, with Peter Crouch scoring after 19 seconds and Calum Chambers seeing red. A Walters penalty did for them last season and he rounded off a 3-1 win for Stoke back in May 2011.

Five of their six meetings have ended all-square, while James Beattie's goal proved the winner for 10-man Stoke back in January 2009. Even in their title-winning campaigns, City have been incapable of winning at Stoke. It finished 0-0 last season and ended 1-1 back in March 2012, when Yaya Toure cancelled out a Crouch opener. So, there is certainly plenty of evidence to suggest there is truth in the 'wet night in Stoke' put-down but some teams seem to have cracked the code.

"India is stepping up its tourist provision by introducing dedicated carriages for visitors on trains. The government's Ministry of Tourism announced that the new plans that will take effect on routes that travel through or terminate at the country's more popular attractions. Research will be carried out prior to passengers setting foot on the tourist carriages, so that specific information can be passed out that can help guide the tourists. Tourists may escape the India rush on trains with their own dedicated carriage to travel in . Speaking to the Hindu Business Line, Mahesh Sharma, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Tourism said: 'We will have complete information of any passenger who books a ticket for this coach. The ticket for this may be 5-10 per cent costlier than the regular coach fare. 'We are also looking at the possibility of a surveillance camera in the tourist coach.' Sharma has indicated that as the prices will be slightly higher for the tourist carriages compared to the rest of the train, the facilities will be of a higher standard. Attractions such as the Taj Mahal but be continually cleaned to provide the ultimate tourist experience . 'What we are planning is end-to-end tourism encompassing cleanliness, safety and security and high level of hospitality for tourists,' he added. The tourist train carriages are just part of a wider programme to improve the India experience, led by the BJP Centre-led government. The idea of specific tourist train carriages follows several high profile cases of travellers being attacked in the country. In January this year, two men were accused of gang raping a 51-year-old Danish tourist in New Delhi who stopped them to ask for directions. Violence against women in India has caused increasing alarm since the fatal gang rape of a 23-year-old Indian physiotherapy student in New Delhi in December 2012. Several foreign tourists also have been targeted in attacks that often get international attention, although Indian women are assaulted far more frequently. The Indian government wants to improve the tourist experience for foreign visitors . Tourism figures fell significantly in the three months following the 2012 gang rape, with visits by women dropping 35 percent, according to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. Although the industry appears to have bounced back,negative publicity still swirls following attacks on foreign women. Plans to spruce up monuments and heritage sites are also important to help boost tourism to India, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr Modi also urged the separate state governments that it is their responsibility to provide a hassle-free prgramme for tourists. Speaking to NDTV Sharma said: 'If we receive a person at the airport, work out their itinerary, take them around in India and finally drop them off at the airport with the assurance that they are looked after by the government as guests, concerns about touts and harassment would disappear.' The full announcement on India's re-think on tourism is expected to be announced on Christmas Day.","Plans part of a wider tourist drive by Prime Minister Modi's government .

Stansted said neither the main terminal nor the runway were affected and that passengers were being taken by bus to their flights. The Stansted Airport Terminal, where delays have been caused by a power failure (stock photo) On Christmas Eve last year a power failure caused by flooding at Gatwick airport in West Sussex led to severe delays and a number of flight cancellations.

"Best-selling author Hilary Mantel has revealed how her fantasies about killing Margaret Thatcher inspired her new short story about her assassination. The 62-year-old has recalled how she once spotted the former Prime Minister standing unguarded near her Windsor flat in 1983 and imagined shooting her. The fantasy was the inspiration for her short story, The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher, which will be published at the end of the month. But her comments have already sparked anger with one Conservative MP describing them as 'shocking'. Tempted: Hilary Mantel (left) spotted Margaret Thatcher (right in 1983) in an unguarded window in her flat . Miss Mantel whose best-selling novels about the Tudors have been adapted into a BBC series called Wolf Hall, has told how she feels ‘boiling detestation’ for the politician. In an interview with The Guardian, she said Baroness Thatcher was an anti-feminist and ‘psychological transvestite’, who did ‘long-standing damage’ to the country. It is not the first controversy the author has been caught up in. In 2013, she said the Duchess of Cambridge had gone from being a ‘jointed doll on which certain rags are hung’ to a woman whose ‘only point and purpose’ was to give birth. The new short story tells of a well-off woman waiting in her Windsor flat for a plumber. The man she lets in turns out to be an assassin who wants to use her bedroom to shoot Baroness Thatcher as she leaves the private hospital opposite after an eye operation. Mantel described how she used her finger and thumb to form a gun when Baroness Thatcher wandered into view at noon on Saturday, August 6, 1983. She said: ‘Immediately your eye measures the distance, I thought, “if I wasn’t me, if I was someone else, she’d be dead”.’ Waving: The story, published in the Guardian, was inspired by a 1983 sighting of Mrs Thatcher in a window . Nadine Dorries, Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, told MailOnline this morning: 'I cannot quite believe it. I am gutted because Hilary Mantel is one of my favourite authors. 'It is shocking as it is so close (to Margaret Thatcher's death) and she still has living family and children. It is about a character whose demise is so recent.' Later in the interview Miss Mantel reveals she did not considered herself to be either of the two characters featured in the short story and instead was 'standing by the window with the notebook'. Miss Mantel, a two-time Man Booker prizewinner, said the book had taken 30 years to write, but dismissed the idea she had been waiting for Baroness Thatcher’s death to write it. ‘I am concerned with respect, I’m not concerned with taste,’ she said, adding: ‘I would have happily concluded the story in her lifetime but couldn't – it was my technical difficulty, not any delicacy. I believe in walking that line. You mustn't be too timid to risk getting it wrong.’ The story has been hotly anticipated ever since news of its title was unveiled in January this year. In the interview, she describes Mrs Thatcher as having caused ‘long-standing damage' in many areas of national life. She says the former Prime Minister was a 'fantastic' character to write about about and that 'as a citizen, I suffered from her but as a writer, I benefited.'","She said former PM was an anti-feminist and a 'psychological transvestite'

"After Steven Taylor became the latest in a long line of defenders who have suffered in the line of duty, we look at the top ten nastiest knocks that will make you think twice about appearing in your local team's rearguard this coming weekend. Footballers have a reputation of being overly pampered, well accustomed to feigning injury, and not being keen on the physicality of yesteryear. However, fortunately on rare occasions, we are all reminded of the dangers of professional sport, and we are forced to reevaluate our perceptions, with the disturbing images of Taylor's clash with a post against Newcastle at St James' Park prime example. In no particular order, we look at the ten of the worst injuries defenders have suffered down the years to help remember the sacrifices some our our idols have made. Terry Butcher, England v Sweden, September 1989 . Terry Butcher after his heroics against Sweden in a 1990 World Cup qualifier - one of football's iconic images . It is one of the most iconic images of our time, and whenever a player's bravery or extra effort for the cause is mentioned, it immediately evokes memories of Terry Butcher's blood-soaked England shirt after an heroic display against Sweden in 1989. The match is question was pivotal to England and boss Bobby Robson. The Three Lions needed a draw to qualify for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, but the plucky Scandinavians represented tough opposition. However, predominantly thanks to Butcher's solid display, despite suffering a nasty head wound that needed heavy bandaging and changed the colour of his jersey a darker shade of red, England held out for a 0-0 draw, and all of our memories of Gazza crying, David Platt's late, late equaliser and more penalty heartache at Italia 90 exist as a result. John Terry, Chelsea v Arsenal, Carling Cup Final, February 2007 . John Terry is stretchered off after a sickening injury in the 2007 Carling Cup final against Arsenal . Literally the definition of putting your neck on the line, John Terry did his utmost to keep the scores level in the 2007 Carling Cup final as the ball dropped in Chelsea's penalty area, but as he flung his head in the way of Abou Diaby's boot, the Arsenal midfielder followed through and caught Terry on the side of the head. That is obviously dangerous territory for any sportsman, but luckily enough, despite being employed by the opposition, Arsenal physio Gary Lewin rushed to the Chelsea skipper's aid, and, it was later revealed, helped clear Terry's windpipe which had become blocked. The sickening images of Terry slipping out of consciousness were stark reminder of what can happen in the blink of an eye. Phil Babb, Liverpool v Chelsea, October 1998 . Former Liverpool defender Phil Babb was the victim of one of the most eye-watering injuries in history . For the male population of this country, this is the injury that hits home the most, and the clip still proves difficult to watch in its entirety even to this day. Hurtling in at break-neck speed as Chelsea's Pierluigi Casiraghi rounded Liverpool goalkeeper David James and fired the ball goalward, Babb was just too late. However, as the net bulged, Babb's slide was halted only by the post, with a leg either side, and the eye-watering images still resonate today. Gary Mabbutt, Tottenham v Wimbledon, November 1993 . Gary Mabbutt had to wear this protective mask after being elbowed by John Fashanu in 1993 . Strikers in the 1990's loved to throw their arms in the face of defenders in their backs, before referees began clamping down on such brutality. John 'Fash the Bash' Fashanu loved leaving the flailing elbow in more than most, but his attack on Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt in Spurs' clash with the artist formerly known as Wimbledon bordered on assault. Fashanu's swing of his right arm actually fractured Mabbutt's skull, and meant the Spurs skipper had to wear this protective mask for several weeks. Gareth Southgate, Newcastle v Middlesbrough, April 2005 . Somehow Middlesbrough captain Gareth Southgate managed to carry on after this injury against Newcastle . The Mail on Sunday revealed rugby’s fears over concussion earlier this year. Lewis Moody, World Cup winner and former England captain,  launched The Mail on Sunday’s campaign for action over the alarming rise of concussion in rugby. If you have experience of concussion in a rugby match, let us know by emailing campaign@mailonsunday.co.uk. A lesser-known injury, but one that sticks on the memory of Tyne-Tees derby clashes from Middlesbrough's time in the Premier League. Against an attacking Newcastle side, the visitors were under the cosh right from the word go, but skipper Gareth Southgate lead by example, and kept the Magpies at bay. The determined centre-back took a nasty knock to the head, but was determined to carry on, and Southgate was patched up and helped his team secure a 0-0 stalemate. Martin Skrtel, Liverpool v Arsenal, December 2014 . Martin Skrtel released this picture of the staples he needed following connection with Olivier Giroud's boot . Made more impressive after heading a late equaliser despite being bandaged up, Martin Skrtel had to have staples in his wound after being trodden on against Arsenal at Anfield. The Slovakian looked to be in trouble after being caught by Olivier Giroud's boot, but soldiered on and grabbed the headlines. Skrtel also required staples in a head wound in January 2014 following a clash with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman during an FA Cup tie. Jonathan Woodgate, Hull v Tottenham, February 2009 . Jonathan Woodgate suffers yet another injury and misses out on a cup final after this knock against Hull . Notoriously unlucky with injuries, Jonathan Woodgate's jinx struck again as he was ruled out of Tottenham's Carling Cup final clash with Manchester United after picking up this head injury. Woodgate's collision with his own team-mate Vedran Corluka ended with the former England defender leaving the field and needing stitches. But once again, Woodgate missed another key game as the head injury kept him out of the final five days later. Pepe, Real Madrid v Valencia, August 2012 . Nasty images of Pepe's head injury made their way around social media in Spain, generating much support . Another example of team-mates clashing, Portuguese defender Pepe came off worse from an aerial collision with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas in Los Blancos' clash with Valencia, and ended up spending the night in hospital. The images were broadcast around Spain, and caused several colleagues to offer their support. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was one of those stars to send their well wishes, tweeting: 'I just saw the images on TV. They are chilling. Hopefully it's nothing serious and that you will play soon! #BestwishesPepe.' Javier Mascherano, Argentina v The Netherlands, World Cup semi-final, July 2014 . Javier Mascherano was the victim of several tough tackles against The Netherlands in Brazil World Cup . The World Cup produced several encounters rife with physicality, but Javier Mascherano's treatment at the hands of the The Netherlands in July's World Cup semi-final stands out. One particular clash led to the fearless centre-back collapsing to the ground, with images of team-mates and the Argentina coaching staff's panic exemplifying the seriousness of the injury. Thankfully, Mascherano made a full recovery after a long delay, but the whole episode was proof even the toughest of competitors are not immune. Steven Taylor, Newcastle v Sunderland, December 2014 . Steven Taylor's sickening injury caused a long delay in Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park . The reason the issue of head injuries has come to the fore once again, Steven Taylor's clash with the post at St James' Park proved difficult to watch for all involved. One of the toughest characters around, Taylor couldn't avoid running head-on into the post, with the noise on impact one of the most difficult aspects for those close by to deal with. Luckily, Taylor managed to get to his feet, but the scars will take some healing after such a nasty injury.","Steven Taylor and Martin Skrtel both received  head injuries on Sunday .

"Freddy Adu, who made his professional debut aged 14, is again without a club having been released by Serbian side FK Jagodina. The American hit the headlines in 2004 after signing for Major League Soccer's DC United but 10 years on, Adu has failed to live up to his star billing. The 25-year-old forward was a member of the USA's 2008 Olympics team but was let go by Jagodina having failed to make an appearance during a six-month stint with the club. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Freddy Adu score for Benfica . Freddy Adu hit the headlines ten years ago when, aged just 14, he was eligible for the MLS 2004 superdraft . Former USA star Adu remains the only player to score hat-tricks in the Under-17 World Championships . Despite struggling for regular first-team action, it seems Adu is still able to enjoy the footballer's lifestyle if the former USA forward's Instagram account is anything to go by. Adu, who trained with Blackpool in February, regularly poses with a bevy of blondes and recently shared an image of his brand new diamond watch. Once labelled as 'the next Pele' during the early stages of his career, the Ghanian-born forward has played just 59 minutes of competitive football since the end of the 2012 MLS season. Adu appears to still be living the footballer's lifestyle despite playing just 59 competitive minutes since 2012 . Adu recently shared an image of his brand new diamond watch via his Instagram account . In 2006 he moved to Real Salt Lake, before Portuguese giants Benfica signed him a year later. He dabbled in Ligue 1 after failing to hold down a first-team spot in Lisbon, joining Monaco on loan for the 2008-09 season. The next season he was back in Portugal with Belenenses, before he moved to Greek side Aris in January 2010. Thirteen months after that he joined Turkey's Caykur Rizespor, but that spell was short-lived and he returned to the US half a year later. Adu spent four seasons with Benfica but made just 11 appearances for the Portuguese club . Adu finally appeared to be settled after spending two years at MLS side Philadelphia Union, only to suddenly join Bahia in April 2013. He was released by Bahia in November and had trials with Blackpool in February and in June former US boss Bob Bradley offered him a chance at Norwegian side Stabaek. Adu failed to impress Bradley enough to secure a long-term deal, which led to a trial with Eredivisie side AZ Alkmaar before his move to Serbia.","Freddy Adu released by Serbian side FK Jagodina after failing to play .

"A tiny Spanish village that became famous after it was painted blue for a promotion is set to become home to the world's first Smurf theme park. The traditional Andalucian village was once white-washed, but locals agreed to the unusual colour change in 2011 when approached by Sony about the release of The Smurfs in 3D movie. The PR stunt involved painting all the houses in a Spanish village blue and made the village such an unexpected tourist destination that villagers voted to keep the unusual house colour. The Spanish village of Juzcar was painted blue in 2011 as a publicity stunt for the Smurfs movie . Now the village of Juzcar, 13 miles form the historic town of Ronda, will receive a £37million investment to create the world's first Smurf theme park. The unusual village has so far managed to attract more than 200,000 tourists with the unique colour scheme and the theme park will be a direct result of the public interest. Local council officials say the theme park will create 200 jobs in the region when it's finished. Sony offered to return the buildings to their original whitewashed state, but villagers decided to keep their homes blue as they were attracting tourists . The unusual blue village has seen more than 200,000 visitors since changing colour . It will cost £36.9million to build, but tourism officials hope it will bring in at least £11million a year to the region. In Spain Smurfs are known as 'pifutos' and project managers say that they hope the family theme park will target families of children aged two to 12. While the Smurfs - originally the creation of Belgian comics artist Pierre Culliford - have enjoyed huge success as toys, and as television, film and video game characters, the Spanish theme park would be a world's only such location dedicated to the little creatures. A local Smurf-related industry has popped up in the area, spurring the idea of creating a theme park . Officials hope the Smurfs theme park will give the area an £11million-a-year boost . Small sections of other theme parts notably in America were briefly dedicated to this Smurf's but mostly were later phased out. It means that the Smurf park will be the only tourism site in the world totally dedicated to 'les Schtroumpfs' as they are known in their original French version. A Smurf-themed park, Big Bang Schtroumpf, operated in France in the 1980s and 1990s but Smurfs disappeared from the venue after the park was bought out by another company.","Spanish village of Juzcar was painted blue in 2011 for Smurfs film release .

"Premier League strugglers Hull City have recalled Tom Ince and Maynor Figueroa from loan spells to bolster their options across the Christmas period. Winless in 10 league games, the Tigers have slipped to 19th place in the table with only Leicester keeping them off the bottom. And a statement on the club's website announced: 'Tom Ince and Maynor Figueroa have been recalled from their loan spells with Nottingham Forest and Wigan Athletic respectively. Maynor Figueroa (pictured last season against Manchester United) has been recalled to Hull City from his loan . Tom Ince has also been recalled from his loan spell at Championship side Nottingham Forest . 'Both players will be available for selection for the Boxing Day fixture against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.' England Under-21 winger Ince was a summer signing from Blackpool but barely made an impression on Steve Bruce's team, save for a goal in the Capital One Cup defeat to West Brom, before joining Forest on a temporary basis. But with Hatem Ben Arfa's unsuccessful loan from Newcastle at an end, Ince will be given the opportunity to compete with the likes of Gaston Ramirez and Robbie Brady for first-team action. Steve Bruce's Hull side are struggling in 19th place in the Premier League, and have recalled two loan players . Figueroa rejoined his former club Wigan in October and, like Ince, made six appearances during his loan spell. The Honduras international has predominantly played at left-back in his Hull career but is likely to provide much-needed cover in the centre with Michael Dawson out for a month, Paul McShane out of favour and both Curtis Davies and Alex Bruce coming off with calf complaints in Saturday's loss to Swansea.","Tom Ince was on loan at Championship club Nottingham Forest .

"Cesc Fabregas admits he would 'love' to have his former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi join him at Chelsea. The pair played together as youngsters before being reunited at the Nou Camp following Fabregas' transfer from Arsenal in 2011. The Spain international has since moved to Stamford Bridge  and has been one of the Blues' most consistent performers during their rise top the top of the Premier League table - racking up more assists than any other player. Cesc Fabregas has been a revelation since arriving at Stamford Bridge from Barcelona . Fabregas has admitted he would like former team-mate Lionel Messi (right) to come to Chelsea . When asked if he thinks Messi should join him in west London, Fabregas told Radio Marca: 'I wish! Why not? I'd love that to happen. I'd be all for it. 'As a Barca man, I believe that Messi deserves to retire there for all that he has given the club. 'He is a legend that has changed Barca's history. But, as his team-mate and friend, without doubt I'd love to have Leo by my side. 'This season Barca are Messi and 10 others. Messi has saved his team on many occasions.' The Spain international also claims that Jose Mourinho would be able to manage at the club where he started his career as a translator. 'Legend' Messi deserves to retire at Barcelona for all he has done for the club, says Fabregas . Jose Mourinho's philosophy at Chelsea is similar to Barcelona's, according to the Spanish midfielder . 'I'd say that Barcelona have a style that he (Mourinho) has already experienced and understands perfectly,' he said. 'Chelsea play a very similar game: we want to be the protagonists, have possession and look to score. We may have a different system, but the philosophy is similar. 'Mourinho adapts to the players he has. What makes him so great as a coach is that he adapts to any situation and his teams can play in many different ways. It's a very intelligent way of managing.'","Cesc Fabregas would love to have Lionel Messi play with him at Chelsea .

"Liverpool are continuing to discuss the possibility of new additions to their squad should Brendan Rodgers get money to spend. A goalkeeper and striker remain the objectives but key could be the departure of £10million-rated Fabio Borini. Sunderland remain interested but the Italian is not keen to join and Inter Milan have yet to firm up tentative interest. Borini is clearly surplus to requirements but wanted to fight for his place with Liverpool short on in-form and fit strikers. The Reds would also likely have to pay Borini to leave and that is not something they are overly keen to do. Liverpool striker Fabio Borini could leave the club in January with Inter Milan and Sunderland both keen . Chelsea's Petr Cech and Jack Butland of Stoke are names in the frame for the goalkeeping position but these deals are not straightforward for January. Swansea's Wilfried Bony remains a player Rodgers likes but his cost will see any deal likely shelved until the summer and the loan market may be Liverpool's best route. Lille confirmed that Liverpool have yet to make any call on bringing in Divock Origi ahead of schedule but, when asked, Lille director Jean-Michel Vandamme said: 'Origi to Liverpool? We haven't received any proposal, but they could offer £5.5m in January.' Meetings will continue this week over potential targets. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony  is a long-term target for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . Liverpool are also considering moves for Chelsea's Petr Cech (left) and Stoke City's Jack Butland (right0 . Lassana Diarra is unlikely to join QPR despite being a free agent. Manager Harry Redknapp, who remains keen on Tottenham's Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend plus Manchester City's Scott Sinclair, wanted to sign the former France midfielder Diarra in the summer after his fall-out with Lokomotiv Moscow. However, after delays in his release paperwork from Lokomotiv, Redknapp moved for Sandro at Tottenham instead. Diarra, 29, has been training with West Ham's head of medicine and sports science Stijn Vandenbroucke to maintain his fitness and, if anything, would prefer to join up with his former colleague at Upton Park. Former Anzhi Makhachkala midfielder Lassana Diarra (left) is unlikely to join QPR as a free agent . Diarra worked with Vandenbroucke at Anzhi Makhachkala and has always held the Belgian in high regard. Diarra though also has offers to return to Russia while there are clubs in China and Spain also showing an interest. QPR, who have opened talks about a new contract for striker Charlie Austin, will likely have to deal in loans or free transfers, even more rare at this time of year, as they remain fearful of what punishment they will be given over breach of Financial Fair play guidelines. Rangers are expected to face a substantial fine because in 2012-13, which resulted in relegation to the Championship, the club lost £65m despite earning Premier League income of £61m. QPR paid their staff, including players, £78m in the year to May 31, 2013. Tottenham winger Andros Townsend (left) is a transfer target for QPR boss Harry Redknapp . If, in their promotion season QPR did not cut their wage bill enough to compensate for the loss of Premier League income and made a loss as high as the previous year, they could face a fine of £54m. The rules impose a fine of approximately £7m for a loss to £18m, then pound for pound above that. The club will be told of their punishment before January 1. West Brom are watching Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong and Crystal Palace's Sullay Kaikai. Everton, Celtic, Hull and Sporting Lisbon have also watched Armstrong, 22, and Albion sent along scout Stuart Millar to watch the Scotland man against Aberdeen last week. Crystal Palace winger Kaikai, 19, has been on loan at Cambridge United in League Two and has Wilfred Zaha and Yannick Bolasie ahead of him in Palace's first-team squad. Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong (centre) is being watched by Everton, West Brom, Celtic and Hull . Wolfsburg will demand £25m for Manchester City target Kevin de Bruyne. The Belgium midfielder only joined the Bundesliga side from Chelsea for last summer in a deal worth £18m. City are scouting alternatives should James Milner fail to agree terms on his contract and de Bruyne is a player with limited Premier League experience but one who can play a number of roles. The 23-year-old can play left or right wing and behind the striker and has scored six goals this season. He left Stamford Bridge as he wanted to play regular football and that would be another consideration should City follow up their interest. Wolfsburg want £25million from Manchester City for Belgium international Kevin de Bruyne (right) City will evaluate the returns of Stevan Jovetic, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero before considering moves in January. Although they have no immediate plans to buy they will see what deals arise. Jovetic is expected to be back this week with Dzeko around the second week in January from his calf injury. City are wary of such injuries arising again and threatening their title challenge but any new player will not be allowed to play in the Champions League anyway due to restrictions placed on City's squad by UEFA this season. Premier League scouts are watching Doncaster striker Jack McKay. Representatives from clubs across the country were out in force last week to watch FA Youth Cup holders Norwich at Doncaster, many waiting to see Norwich's latest prospects but it was 18-year-old McKay who stole the spotlight with a hat-trick as Doncaster ran out 3-1 winners. Everton, Leicester and Crystal Palace were already following McKay, whose twin brother Paul plays at centre-back. Jack, who is 6ft 3in tall, converted a first half penalty and struck twice in extra time after Michee Efete had headed home a last gasp equaliser for Norwich City. New York Red Bulls' Tim Cahill is weighing up a return to England. Cahill, who was wanted by Sunderland and QPR last summer, believes he could continue playing for another four seasons, into his 40th year and said: 'I've got another year left on my New York Red Bulls contract. The main feeling for me is every time I'm at a club, I like to be there for a long time. 'To be totally honest, I could have gone back to the Premier League on loan after the World Cup and I decided to stay with Red Bulls for the remainder of the season and still (have) options to go back to the Premier League if it's the right one for me. 'So when you put everything into one, the decision I make will be a methodical one, like I've always made it. It will take a month or so but I think people will be quietly impressed with what I'm trying to do.' New York Red Bulls midfielder Tim Cahill is open to a Premier League return when his contract expires . Manchester United are watching Birmingham teenager Josh Martin. The 15-year-old centre back was given a first-team squad number by former manager Lee Clark and has been widely tipped to break Trevor Francis's record of being the youngest player to represent the club. Francis made his debut in 1970, aged 16 years and 139 days and Clark, now boss at Blackpool said: 'I think before the season finishes he will play in the first team and break Trevor Francis’ record. I think he's that good. At 15 years of age to be considered for first team football is an unbelievable achievement and tells you about the player.' Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool have also watched Martin but United are hopeful they can beat them to the Bournville School pupil. Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool have all watched Birmingham defender Josh Martin . USA right back DeAndre Yedlin will join Tottenham Hotspur in January after securing a work permit on appeal. Tottenham announced in August that Yedlin had agreed a four-year deal to move to White Hart Lane from MLS franchise the Seattle Sounders for a fee of £2.5m, but he could not secure permission from the Home Office for the switch. Yedlin has won the right to work in the UK on appeal after being granted a Governing Body Endorsement. He will be officially unveiled on January 1.

"It is not only Arsenal struggling for form this term. Click here to read the five things Liverpool can do to infiltrate the top four . On Boxing Day last season, Arsenal were top of the Premier League tree. Twelve wins from their first 18 saw them one point ahead of Manchester City, two in front of Chelsea and three above Liverpool. This season, it ia a different story entirely. Arsene Wenger's side are 6th in the Premier League after just seven wins from their first 17, a massive 12 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table. Here, Sportsmail look at the five things Arsenal need to do to right their wrongs, and climb into the top four of the Premier League. HANG ON TO A LEAD... Arsenal have dropped 11 points from winning positions this season and that suggests either a mental or physical weakness in the team. Arsene Wenger’s team dropped nine in total last season but there appears to be a soft underbelly this campaign, which could be explained by the rotating injury list but is still not good enough. The sight of Per Mertesacker ducking at Anfield on Sunday will not have gone down well with either manager or fans. Laurent Koscielny is a big miss and if Wenger does decide to buy in January, then a central defender has surely to be his first priority. Kieran Gibbs had his head in his hands at full-time on Sunday after Arsenal squandered another lead to draw . GET WALCOTT BACK ON THE PITCH... When Theo Walcott ticks, so do Arsenal. The winger was on the bench at Anfield so he is getting closer. Walcott provides pace, vision, finishing and is a marvellous link-up player. Imagine if Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexis Sanchez all clicked at the same time. There would be sear marks on the pitch. Walcott’s intelligence also means he can adapt his role as required. Welcome back, Theo. Theo Walcott is back in training, and was on the bench against Liverpool on Sunday . WHAT TO DO WITH WELBECK... Danny Welbeck likes to be the main man but the return of Olivier Giroud means he is required out wide where his work-rate is unquestioned but where he struggles to have an influence. The situation is unlikely to change any time soon with fit-again Giroud back in the goals and only really able to play as a central striker. So Wenger has to get inside Welbeck’s brain and persuade him that he can utilise his pace or  play two centre forwards, which is about as likely as the manager being made a freeman of Stoke. The return of Olivier Giroud  means that Danny Welbeck is required in a wide position for Arsenal . SORT OUT CENTRAL MIDFIELD... Easily said, far harder done. If Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Mesut Ozil are all fit, and Walcott, Santi Cazorla and Oxlade-Chamberlain stay so, Arsenal have an abundance of midfield riches. But, at the moment, the only ‘proper’ not-injured defensive central midfielder available is Mathieu Flamini, who had a nightmare against Liverpool. The 30-year-old Frenchman is also a disciplinary risk. Arteta, Ramsey and Wilshere can operate there but they are all occupying the physio room at present. Hurry back, boys. Arsenal only have Mathieu Flamini fit as a 'proper' defensive midfielder and he is a disciplinary risk . STICK WITH LE BOSS... Arsenal fans should be careful for what they wish for. Calling for Arsene Wenger’s head, halfway through a season, is not the way to inspire the team to a top-four position. Even when Arsenal win – The Hawthorns springs to mind – there was a banner asking Wenger to go. The obvious question is who would replace him? Knee-jerk decisions are not the Arsenal way and the sooner every fan shelves their negative feelings the better it will be for the team. Arsene Wenger has been criticised by some Arsenal fans, but they need to be careful what they wish for .
