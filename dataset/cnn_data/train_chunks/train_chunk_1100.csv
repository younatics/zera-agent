'The best thing we achieved today was the result and the winning three points,' Japan coach Javier Aguirre said. 'That was not an easy game for both of us because of the strong wind. 'In modern football it's not easy to win by four goals. So as for tonight's result I am happy by winning by four goals.' Ahmed Mahajna was sent off in the 73rd minute to make it a tough first tournament start for the Palestinians, who qualified by winning the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup in the Maldives. Japan have won four Asian Cup titles in the past six tournaments and are seeking a record fifth continental crown in Australia.

Keisuke Honda, scorer of Japan's third goal against Palestine, weaves through a pack of players . Honda gestures to the Japanese supporters at the full-time whistle, as Japan overcame Palestine with ease . 'Endo's early goal was great,' said Okazaki, who was named man of the match. 'It gave the team great momentum. We played well, however, we could have been better. 'We are not satisfied with four goals. We should have scored more.' The Palestinians sat deep in defence to negate Japan's intricate passing and movement but had no answer for Takashi Inui's strong run and cross that found Kagawa, who sent a shot from the edge of the box. Okazaki stooped low with his head to deflect the ball past Saleh in the 25th minute. It wasn't until the 40th minute that the Palestinians managed a scoring chance with Ismail Alamour's shot sliding wide of Eiji Kawashima's goal.

Yoshida scored from a powerful header from Kagawa's cross just after halftime as Japan tried to put last year's disappointing World Cup showing behind them. 'The most important thing we achieved today was the confidence we achieved,' Okazaki said. 'And also to gain back the confidence from the poor result from the World Cup campaign.'

'People may think Japan was superior over Palestine but it was not an easy game today,' Aguirre said. 'They've played against China and Uzbekistan and they drew with China and Uzbekistan` to score only one goal against them.' Despite the lack of chances, a small contingent of Palestinian fans in the crowd of 15,497 waved flags, beat drums and sang for the duration of the match.

"Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart has shown off his skills in a remarkable video with F2 freestylers Billy Wingrove and Jeremy Lynch. Hart was put through his paces by the pair, who had provided a number of challenges for the former Shrewsbury Town stopper. There was no sign of the jitters that saw him questioned by supporters last season as he showed off his talents for Rio Ferdinand's 5MAG. The Manchester City goalkeeper watches the ball he threw land in a bucket on the back of a golf cart . While there's little doubting Hart's talent as a footballer, some of the tricks on show appeared to portray the 27-year-old as almost superhuman. Only Chelsea and Southampton have conceded fewer goals in the Premier League so far this season, and after this video it's clear to see why. Freestylers Wingrove and Lynch have previously done videos with stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Robinho, and performed at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in 2012. Joe Hart managed to hit the crossbar with the ball from a number of improbable angles . Hart smiles as he learns of the challenges the freestyle duo have in store for him .

"Juventus demolished Hellas Verona 6-1 to reach the Italian Cup quarter-finals on Thursday and remain on course for a league and cup double in Massimiliano Allegri's first season in charge. Sebastian Giovinco scored twice and won a penalty, which Alvaro Morata converted in front of a sell-out crowd. Roberto Pereyra, Paul Pogba and substitute Kingsley Coman also netted for Juventus, while Nene grabbed a consolation for Verona. Serie A leaders Juventus will meet bottom club Parma on January 28.

Goal: Nene 57 . Along with Roma, Juventus holds the record for most Italian Cup victories, but their ninth and last title was in 1995. Allegri rested the likes of Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo and Gianluigi Buffon, while Arturo Vidal had tonsillitis. Giovinco got Juventus off to the perfect start with a 25-yard free kick, to which Rafael failed to keep out. Pereyra doubled Juve's lead, dummying past Guillermo Rodriguez before a lovely finish into the far side of the net for his first goal for the club. Verona rarely threatened, and Giovinco completed his brace in first-half stoppage time. Stephan Lichtsteiner squared the ball across the goalmouth, and the Italy forward was on hand to tap in for his fifth goal in his past six Italian Cup matches. After the break, Pogba bundled the ball home eight minutes in, after it rebounded off a defender and took an awkward bounce. Verona reduced the deficit when Nene got the final touch on Rafa Marquez's glancing header, although the ball was probably going in anyway. Juventus restored its four-goal advantage six minutes later after Giovinco was tripped by Marquez, and Morata fired the resulting penalty into the bottom left corner. Coman added the icing on the cake with a stunning strike which crashed off the underside of the crossbar. It was the 18-year-old's first goal for the club.

"Hull City will pay Blackpool £2million for Tom Ince after a tribunal determined the fee plus add-ons for the player's sale back in July 2014. The initial payment of £2m could be boosted by a series of additional instalments, such as Ince making a set number of appearances and if Hull avoid relegation. The son of former England captain Paul Ince was linked with several clubs after his contract expired at Bloomfield Road. Tom Ince joined Hull in the summer on a free transfer after leaving Blackoop at the end of his contract . Blackpool will receive £2m cmpensation for Ince because he was only 22 when he left for nothing . After interest from the likes of Liverpool and Inter Milan, he subsequently joined the Tigers on a two-year contract. Ince’s first club, Liverpool, will also benefit from the deal, with 35 per cent or £700,000 of the fee going to Brendan Rodgers’ side for their part in developing the player. The 22-year-old started the first three games of the Premier League season before being sent out on loan to Nottingham Forest on loan.

"In-demand Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba believes his transfer value is worthless if he doesn't perform every single time he steps out on to the pitch. The former Manchester United youngster is already viewed as one of the best all-round midfielders in Europe, despite being only 21. United, who let Pogba leave for Turin on a free in July 2012, have been linked with a move for the midfielder while Sportsmail revealed in December that Manchester City were also mooting a club-record £40million bid for the star as a replacement for Yaya Toure. Highly-rated Juventus star Paul Pogba believes his value is worth 'zero euros' if he doesn't perform well . Pogba enhanced his reputation further with a superb strike to open the scoring in Juventus' 4-0 win against Verona in Serie A on Sunday night. Yet despite another stellar performance, the France international was rather modest about his transfer valuation. 'I am worth zero euros. I am worth nothing unless I work on the field in every single game,' he told reporters. 'I need to do more because I want to be a champion just like Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo and Giorgio Chiellini. 'I want to be one of the best players in the world and to be able to reach this level, I need to play well. I focus on working on the pitch and giving all I've got for the squad.'

I think you would need to win a Champions League, European Championship or World Cup, but he's got the potential to get there.' The former AC Milan boss added: 'He needs to understand that certain things can only be done in certain areas of the pitch, but he put in a great display against Verona.'

"Swansea's new striker Nelson Oliveira has revealed how Portugal team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo influenced his move to the Barclays Premier League. And Oliveira hopes his loan switch from Benfica ends up with him celebrating a special moment against the 'Special One' on Saturday when Jose Mourinho's Chelsea visit the Liberty Stadium. Oliveira has won 14 caps for Portugal but his club career has never really got off the ground in Lisbon and the last two seasons has seen him loaned out to Deportivo La Coruna in Spain and Rennes in France. Portugal international Nelson Oliveira wants to get one over on his compatriot Jose Mourinho on Saturday . Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo advised Oliveira to move to the Premier League . But Oliveira admits Real Madrid superstar Ronaldo told him the Premier League was the place to be because the intensity of the competition was so high. 'I spoke to Cristiano and asked him whether I would find it easier to play in the UK or in Spain,' Oliveira said. 'He told me he loved playing in England with Manchester United. 'He thinks that in England it is more intense with the fans playing a big role, whereas in Spain it is easier to play because the intensity is not so high and the pressure is lower. 'Cristiano is an example to many players in Portugal because of what he has achieved and the Premier League is something any young boy aspires to play in.' Oliveira made his Swansea debut as a substitute in last weekend's 1-1 home draw with West Ham and showed some nice touches as Garry Monk's men went in search of a winner. The 23-year-old might again have to settle for a place on the bench against league leaders Chelsea with Bafetimbi Gomis leading the line in the wake of Wilfried Bony's departure to Manchester City. But he admits that it would be a memorable occasion coming up against his Portuguese compatriot Mourinho and former Benfica team-mates Nemanja Matic and Ramires. Oliveira (right) made his Swansea debut in the 1-1 draw against West Ham United last weekend . 'Every team wants to beat Chelsea and that would be a great moment, not only for the fans and the club but for myself,' Oliveira said. 'Mourinho is admired by everyone in Portugal and only this week he was considered by Portuguese people as the best manager of the last 100 years. 'He does a great job everywhere he goes and has opened a lot of doors for Portuguese managers as well as being an inspiration to everyone. 'I watch the Chelsea games and I've played with Matic at Benfica and against Oscar in the Under-20s World Cup. 'Matic is a big player for them and I can't see any weaknesses, his technical ability on the ball is very good and is he is both intelligent and a hard worker.' Oliveira's star was on the rise when he scored in Portugal's 2011 Under-20 World Cup final defeat to Brazil and was named the second-best player in that tournament in Colombia. Oliveira said that Chelsea boss Mourinho is 'admired by everyone' in Portugal . Less than a year later he was playing for his country at Euro 2012 and he was soon being linked with a £24million move to Manchester United, but he had to leave Benfica to get regular first-team football. 'Yes, I knew something through my agent,' Oliveira said of United's reported interest in 2012. 'But I leave that to him and things should happen when they are right. 'It happened before so perhaps now is the right time to come to the Premier League and succeed. 'I have settled very well at Swansea and love it here. 'The club have been great to me and if things go well I would love to stay. 'Nothing has changed in my head, I've come here to work hard and succeed - but maybe now Bony has left I will have a better chance.'","Nelson Oliveira could ease Swansea's striker woes after Wilfried Bony exit .

He told the club's official website: 'I have to compliment them all on their attitude.

"While his namesake Cristiano Ronaldo was collecting a third Ballon d'Or on Monday, the original Brazilian Ronaldo was also a big winner... at a major poker event. The World Cup winner, and former three time FIFA Player of the Year himself, collected $42,180 (£27,824) at the PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) Main Event in the Bahamas. The tournament, which is still under way in the Bahamas, will see the winner collect a top prize of more than $1.4 million (£923,000).

"In the first Hot or Not? of 2015, Ian Ladyman delivers his verdict on the big issues in the world of sport, revealing what helped him beat the winter chill and what left him feeling cold inside. WHAT'S HOT . Phil Neville . During the Neville brothers’ years at Manchester United people used to joke that they liked Phil simply because 'he’s not Gary' and even the older sibling has softened enough to laugh at that one these days. This week, though, brother Phil has shot up further in my estimation in the wake of his embarrassing revelation to Sportsmail’s Matt Lawton that he had never made a cup of coffee in his life. Phil Neville, who was a Manchester United coach under David Moyes last season (right), proved he was game for a laugh when he posted a picture on Twitter in response to his wife's revelations about household chores . Neville's wife Julie landed him in it when she went on the radio but the ex-Everton man saw the funny side . Lampooned widely and without mercy, Neville’s domestic shame was deepened when his own wife Julie appeared on BBC Radio 5 Live to reveal that Phil had never used any of their household cleaning appliances either. Faced with such embarrassment, Phil had a simple choice: Hide in a broom cupboard - provided he knows where it is - and wait for the storm to pass or join in the laughter. His decision to subsequently post a photo of himself on Twitter alongside mop, hoover and cleaning trolley spoke volumes for a self-awareness lacking in too many sportsmen these days. Phil Neville: More than just Gary-lite. David Warner . Thirteen months ago I sat at the Adelaide Oval as Warner headed back to the pavilion in the first innings of the second Ashes Test having scored a modest 29. After a poor and controversial Ashes summer in England that year - where he averaged 23 and tried to punch Joe Root in a Birmingham bar - I was confident enough to Tweet that he: 'will never be a Test batsman.' Since that day in South Australia, Warner has played 24 Test innings and scored 83 not out, 60, 112, 9, 25, 16, 16, 12, 115, 70, 66, 135, 145, 133, 29, 19, 58, 145, 102, 29, 6, 0, 40 and 101. David Warner celebrates scoring a ton in the fourth Test against India at Sydney Cricket Ground . Warner kissed the ground after scoring 63 runs at the ground where Phillip Hughes was fatally injured . To save you reaching for the calculator, that represents an average of 63.7. Those tests have been played against England, South Africa, Pakistan and India, the quartet who - along with the Aussies themselves - make up the top-five Test teams in the world. What’s more, his latest century this week came at the same Sydney Cricket Ground where Warner watched his great friend Phillip Hughes lose his life just two months ago. Warner is 28 and makes his runs in the most testing environment the game can offer, from the top of the batting order. Looks like I was wrong. Sam Vokes . Even the most optimistic among us have days when we don’t feel very, well, optimistic. Welcome to the career of Burnley centre forward Vokes. Prior to this campaign, the 25-year-old had spent three seasons at a Premier League club without scoring a single goal or indeed making a start. Ostensibly a Wolverhampton Wanderers player during their three years in the top division between 2009 and 2012, Vokes spent most of that time being shunted around Championship clubs on loan. Leeds, Bristol City, Sheffield United, Norwich City, Burnley and Brighton & Hove Albion all found a peg in their dressing room for Vokes during those three years. Sam Vokes opened his account for the season with a goal in the FA Cup draw with Tottenham Hotspur . His own club? Nah, no thanks. Last season, Vokes - benefiting from the sale of Charlie Austin to Queens Park Rangers - eventually got his career moving at Burnley, forming a partnership with Danny Ings that drove the Lancashire club to promotion to the Premier League. Then, in March, he bust his knee. So, that Premier League start - that moment of validation - still awaits him. But he was back on the pitch on Monday night, fit again and scoring in the FA Cup against Tottenham Hotspur. On Saturday, Burnley are at home to QPR. Keep an eye on the team sheet….. WHAT'S NOT . Stuart Pearce . When the owners start sending their spies to watch training and - even worse - begin asking your players about you then it’s time to put the house up for sale and make sure you haven’t left any money down the side of the seat in the company car. For Nottingham Forest manager Pearce, the writing may just be on the wall at the City Ground. Laurie Whitwell’s revelations in Sportsmail that the Forest hierarchy are showing attention to detail in terms of their manager’s day-to-day workings may not concern supporters as much as a run of results that goes LLLDDDLWWLLLDLDDDLD all the way back to mid-September but they do add to the feeling that Pearce’s second coming by the Trent may be short. Stuart Pearce's days as Nottingham Forest manager appear to be numbered after a miserable run of results . There won’t be many people in England - except maybe in Derby - who wouldn’t wish a former England captain well but Pearce’s appointment always looked optimistic from the start. The emotional appeal was obvious for Forest but did Pearce really have the credentials to take the job on in the first place? His managerial CV contained two seasons in the Premier League with Manchester City (14th and 15th) and a spell as coach of the England Under 21s. Prior to this season he had never worked in the Championship. That would be a ‘no’ then. Football tourists . I write this item from a position of disadvantage. I am 5ft 6in tall. Therefore anyone - and it’s just about everybody these days - holding a camera phone above their head at a concert, sporting event or museum - yes, that does happen - will receive black marks and possibly a nudge at the back of the knee from me. Imagine, therefore, the horror at seeing football fans turning up at Barclays Premier League grounds with selfie sticks this season. A Tottenham fan is caught on television brandishing a selfie stick while celebrating a goal . Bolton boxer Amir Khan (holding the stick) appears to be a fan of the new gadget . They're fine in Times Square - just don't bring them to Premier League matches . For the uninitiated, the selfie stick is a long piece of metal you can attach your camera phone to the end of. When held out in front of you, it gives you an ability to take photos of yourself from a range and angle that previously only Mr Tickle had enjoyed. Fine, perhaps, for a day out in Hyde Park but not, one would guess, for an afternoon at the football when it’s quite possible there may just be someone sitting behind, alongside or in front of you. Happily, Arsenal and Tottenham have taken the lead in banning these monstrous things. If other clubs follow suit we may finally be able to return to our national sport to those who are actually interested in watching it. Ben Stokes . A stunning score of 77 from 37 balls for Melbourne Renegades in Australia’s marvellous ‘Big Bash’ competition should stand out as one of the young English all-rounder’s top career moments. Sadly, Stokes’ efforts may only prompt him to ask himself just why he is not in the England squad for the forthcoming World Cup. Ben Stokes was on fire for Melbourne Renegades, hitting 77 from 37 balls against Hobart Hurricanes . He may have his allies on Twitter - though an endorsement from Kevin Pietersen is not necessarily worth the phone it’s written on these days - but, among the England selectors, notice has understandably been taken of the 23-year-old’s relatively poor international form and question marks over his discipline. Certainly Stokes emerged from last winter’s Ashes debacle as a positive, displaying skills and attitude that appeared quite beyond some of his senior colleagues. Kevin Pietersen, on Twitter, questioned why Stokes was not going to the World Cup with England . Since then, however, the Durham all-rounder will maybe have learned that it takes more than the ability to throw, catch and hit a ball to become an established international cricketer. Hopefully, while basking in the deserved praise that has followed his terrific innings, he will listen not to those with axes of their own to grind on social media but to the voices inside that will no doubt be reminding him that he has not done himself justice since his rise to prominence in Australia last January.","Phil Neville posted a picture on Twitter showing himself doing chores .

"Davide Santon might be forgiven for inviting the advances of AC Milan and escaping the Premier League - for his last five matches have returned an aggregate score of 0-18. The Newcastle United defender returns to the English top flight this weekend after eight months of painstaking rehab doing the 9-5 shift at the club’s training ground in a bid to overcome a lingering knee injury. During that time there has been interest in the former Inter Milan full back from their San Siro rivals, but Santon - given his Nerazzurri debut by Jose Mourinho - is instead targeting a new deal on Tyneside. Davide Santon (left) in Newcastle United training last week as he aims to return after eight months out . Santon trying to hold off Robert Snodgrass during a clash with Norwich almost a year ago . ‘I am happy here - I still have one and a half years left on my contract and I will probably have to speak to Newcastle soon,’ he said. ‘I’ve always said I am happy here.’ Before being struck down by injury in April of last season, however, Santon and his team-mates were far from happy. They were in the midst of a six-match losing run and boss Alan Pardew was coming under increasing pressure from the terraces. A 4-0 defeat at home by Manchester United would prove to be Santon's last outing for the man who brought him to St James’ Park for £5million in 2011. The  full back, battling David Beckham in a 2009 Milan derby, has been linked with a return to former club Inter . Italian full back Santon advances with the ball during an Under 21 match against Bolton Wanderers on Monday . Before that, the Italy international had himself come in for criticism. Indeed, his previous four matches had returned 4-0 losses against Southampton and Spurs and 3-0 reverses at the hands of Chelsea and Sunderland. The last time he played in a side which scored was in January of last season during a 3-1 win at West Ham United. Santon, though, says he is returning a stronger player for the pain of the past 12 months. ‘I have come back stronger. I've been training hard for six months now and have been finishing at 5pm every day,’ he said. ‘That is making me stronger. But now I just want to play - for my fitness and for myself. I am only 24 years old. Santon on the ball during training for Newcastle last week as he looks to make his top-level return . ‘But it has been difficult. My family helped me a lot - my fiancee and my baby and my mum and my dad - it was important to have all of those people around me. If you are by yourself, it's difficult. It has been a long time.’ Santon was always a favourite under Pardew but must now set about proving himself to a new boss and winning back his place in the team, lost to academy graduate Paul Dummett. He added: ‘Now, for me, the competition is not a problem. I'm used to that. I had a good time with Pardew when he was here, and I wish him good luck. ‘Now we have to go on to the next page and start a new chapter.’ Santon is no doubt relieved to close the book on what was a depressing 2014.

"Swansea face a battle to hold on to striker Bafetimbi Gomis after Borussia Dortmund and Schalke stepped into the race to sign the France international. The 29-year-old is keen to leave and play Champions League football but it would leave Swansea needing to sign two strikers in light of losing Wilfried Bony to Manchester City. Crystal Palace have already lodged a £9.3million offer for Gomis but he wants a bigger club and Swansea had resolved to keep him until the end of the season when he has a clause set at £8m.

"Life after Wilfried Bony didn't start well for Swansea City after they were humiliated 5-0 by Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium. Oscar and Diego Costa both scored first half braces before Andre Schurrle added a fifth as Garry Monk's side capitulated in worrying fashion. Here, Sportsmail gives their player ratings. Swansea City's players look dejected during a first-half performance that saw them concede four times . SWANSEA CITY (4-4-2) Lukasz Fabianski - 5 . A good save to deny Eden Hazard in the second half and not directly implicated for any of the goals, but how much positive feedback can you take from a 5-0 defeat? Dwight Tiendalli - 4 . Never got close to controlling Hazard. Federico Fernandez - 4 . Horrendous backpass for Chelsea’s third. The low point of a poor performance. Ashley Williams - 4.5 . Won headers and fought hard but failed to lift or organise an outclassed defence. Ashley Williams attempts to block Oscar's shot but it evades both him and Lukasz Fabianski and goes in . Neil Taylor - 4.5 . Part of a poor defensive unit. Could have been stronger in the tackle in the build up to Chelsea’s fifth. Nathan Dyer - 4 . Barely got a sniff of the ball. Tom Carroll - 4 . Got tangled up in first-goal mess and over-run thereafter. Midfield needed bodies so he looked as though he was on a hiding to nothing. Gylfi Sigurdsson - 5 . Lose pass let Chelsea in for opener before hitting the bar. Former Shakhtar Donetsk winger Willian tries to protect the ball from Swansea defender Neil Taylor . Wayne Routledge - 5.5 . Lacked service before injuring his calf while misplaying a pass after 32 minutes. Nelson Oliveira - 4.5 . Loan signing looked quick but generally ineffective. Came short to try to find possession but Swansea couldn’t hold on to ball long enough to supply it. Bafetimbi Gomis - 5 . He will have easier games in his effort to prove himself as a replacement for Wilfried Bony. Tried hard but with no service what can you do? Subs: Marvin Emnes for Routledge (32, 5.5), Fulton for Oliveira (66, 5), Modou Barrow for Dyer (74). Not used: Tremmel, Rangel, Amat, Bartley. Garry Monk - 4 . Two men up front meant an overrun midfield. That said, not sure a wall would have kept Chelsea out. Nelson Oliveira dribbles with the ball while being closed down by Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic . The Chelsea players celebrate during the first half - during which they managed to score four goals . CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Petr Cech - 6 . Poor guy hasn’t had much playing time this season so you have to feel for him when he gets a game but nothing to do. Looked bored. Branislav Ivanovic - 6.5 . Nothing to do defensively but, as always, a surging presence down the right flank. Hard as nails and subtle when he needed to be, such as the touch and pass to create Chelsea’s fifth. Gary Cahill - 6 . Won a couple of first-half headers and sat back and enjoyed the game. John Terry - 6 . See Cahill. Former Barcelona and Arsenal midfielder Fabregas is challenged by Oliveira during the second half . Filipe Luis - 6 . Got forward well but not much to do defensively. Nemanja Matic - 7 . Along with Fabregas, he controlled the middle of the pitch, which is where the match was won. A superb player. Cesc Fabregas - 7.5 . All roads pass through him – he sets the tempo and plots the routes. Big part of the group that made the second. Willian - 7.5 . Always moving, often incisive and helped make the fourth with lovely run and shot. Two efforts against the woodwork. Chelsea's Brazilian midfielder Oscar fires in the opening goal of the game at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday . Oscar - 8.5 . Lovely finish from 25 yards for first and equally clinical for second. The creative spark of a wonderfully impressive performance. Eden Hazard - 7 . Forced save after 19 minutes and teed up good chance for Fabregas early in second half. Effective without being the main threat. Diego Costa - 8 . Two goals and an assist. What a magnificent signing. Subs: Loic Remy for Costa (74, 6), Ramires for Fabregas (74, 6), Andre Schurrle for Willian (76). Subs not used: Courtois, Zouma, Mikel, Salah. Jose Mourinho - 7 .

"The Football League is investigating whether Carson Yeung is still wielding significant influence at Birmingham from his prison cell. Yeung has been barred as a director of the club and is serving a six-year prison sentence in Hong Kong for money-laundering. However, Birmingham's parent company Birmingham International Holdings Limited (BIHL) has made a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange regarding changes Yeung - who owns 27.9 per cent of BIHL - wants to make to its board. Carson Yeung arrives in court in Hong Kong in June 2011 to face money-laundering offences . Yeung, pictured leaving court later that day, was later sentenced to six-years in prison for the charges . BIHL said Yeung is trying to force through changes to replace three directors with his own nominees and told the stock exchange it is 'very concerned about the concerted efforts' of Yeung and his associates. The Football League has now contacted Birmingham for clarification about Yeung's involvement. A Football League spokesman said: 'We have been in ongoing dialogue with the club in recent months with regard to changes in the shareholding of Birmingham International Holdings Limited (BIHL). Further to that, we have now become aware of the announcement made yesterday by BIHL to the Hong Kong stock exchange. 'As a result, the Football League has written to Birmingham City today to ask for clarification as to whether this statement demonstrates that Carson Yeung should be defined as a 'relevant person' under the Owners and Directors' Test while being subject to a disqualifying condition.' Yeung and Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish celebrate Birmingham's Carling Cup victory in 2011 . It is understood Birmingham are keen to be as transparent as possible - it was BIHL itself which raised the issue with the stock exchange. A statement from the club said: 'The club is in receipt of correspondence from the Football League in respect of its holding company Birmingham International Holdings Limited (BIHL) following an announcement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. 'The club is seeking clarification of the matters contained therein from the BIHL board and will revert to the Football League in due course.' The Football League can take action against the club if it finds Yeung is still significantly involved with the running of the club, with possible sanctions including fines, points deductions or a transfer embargo. The Football League has now contacted Birmingham for clarification about Yeung's involvement  with the club . The BIHL statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange questioned the appropriateness of the new directors suggested by Yeung and flagged up a connection with another major shareholder which would take him over the percentage of club ownership he is allowed. Former hairdresser Yeung, 54, was jailed for six years in March for money-laundering - he continues to deny any guilt. The BIHL statement said Yeung was trying to remove the chairman and two other directors and replace them with three others: Wang Man Li, Li Wen Jun and Arjun Kumar Gurung. According to reports Wang Man Li is his common-law wife and Arjun Kumar Gurung is his driver and bodyguard.","Carson Yeung is serving a six-year prison sentence in Hong Kong for money-laundering .

"Stephen Myler was acclaimed on Friday night for becoming only the second Northampton player to score 2,000 points, but Newcastle gave the champions an almighty fright with a gloriously spirited and daring performance. The Franklin’s Gardens crowd had come to witness a massacre, but it didn’t materialise. The home fans accorded their England fly-half a thunderous ovation when he reached his personal landmark – emulating the club’s record scorer, Paul Grayson – but they were soon gripped by tension as the visitors took the Aviva Premiership leaders to the wire. Newcastle simply would not lie down. When Myler departed they were 32-10 down, but far from fading away, they launched a stirring late rear-guard action which eventually brought them a bonus point for scoring four tries. Stephen Myler kicks a conversion as he becomes only the second Northampton player to score 2,000 points . Myler scored a try, three conversions and two penalties as he finished the game with 17 points . Dean Richards’ team were adventurous, organised and competitive. While individuals such as Mark Wilson, Chris Harris and Tom Catterick stood out, the overall impression was of a well-coached side armed with attacking cohesion and the fearlessness of youth. By the end, Newcastle had really shaken the title holders and Richards said: ‘We’ve got a good crop of youngsters coming through and they just want to have a go. They are given free licence to do that and their flair and skill came out. They are holding their own in the top flight. There are things we have to tighten up but when we do that, we will win a lot more games.’ The former Test No 8 is particularly delighted with the form of his player in that shirt – Wilson, adding: ‘He has been playing well enough to earn recognition from England soon.’ Calum Clark of Northampton dives over for a try during as the champions beat Newcastle on Friday night . Saints' Luther Burrell holds off Adam Powell as Northampton extended their winning streak to seven games . Northampton were far from their best but this was another bonus-point win to continue their title defence. Myler passed the 2,000-point mark by claiming a try, three conversions and two penalties last night. He touched down at the end of a sensational first-half move involving slick running and inter-play between Ben Foden and the Pisi brothers – Ken and George. Newcastle hit back as Harris touched down after strong charges from Andy Tuilagi and Wilson, and a deft kick through by Catterick, only for some similarly fancy footwork by Myler at the other end to create a try for George Pisi, which put the Saints back on track. The second half was surreal. After another Myler penalty, Foden and Ken Pisi combined to set up a try for Calum Clark and just before the hour came a penalty try for the hosts as Newcastle dragged down a maul close to their line. But once Myler had departed, the tables turned. Tom Catterick of Newcastle is tackled by Mike Haywood as Saints move six points clear at the top of the table . George Pisi touches down for a try as Northampton are given a fright by a spirited Newcastle . A strong lineout drive by the Falcons pack yielded a try for George McGuigan and moments later, Harris surged into space and Tom Penny’s pass sent Alex Tait over for his side’s third try. Back came the Saints with North’s left-wing run paving the way for Luther Burrell to score, but the last word went to the defiant visitors, as the Newcastle forwards drove Richard Mayhew over for a deserved bonus. Jim Mallinder, the Saints’ director of rugby, paid fitting tribute to his No 10 points machine, saying: ‘Stephen has been here longer than I have and he is still playing well and kicking goals. To get to that milestone is phenomenal.’","Northampton Saints beat Newcastle Falcons in the Aviva Premiership .

Adams said: ‘I firmly believe we’re still on course for a crack at promotion back to the Premier League. That’s where this club belongs. However, I feel it is in the best interests of the team that an immediate change is made to ensure a positive impact on results.’ The 49-year-old will take a break from football but will return for a role at the club, as yet undetermined, in July.

"Mike Phelan's aim of becoming a manager in his own right after 12 years on Sir Alex Ferguson’s backroom staff has moved a step closer after he was put in temporary charge of Norwich City. The 52-year-old is now favourite to take over at Carrow Road on a permanent basis, having served his old club as assistant to Gary Megson in the mid-90s and, more recently, first-team coach under Neil Adams. Sportsmail assesses Phelan’s credentials for the job and looks at how some of Ferguson’s other right-hand men have fared on their own. Mike Phelan (right) stands on the touchline alongside former Norwich City manager Neil Adams . Mike Phelan – 2008-2013 . You couldn’t wish for a much better grounding than to work under one of the most successful British managers of all time, and Phelan’s CV is impressive indeed; a Champions League, three Premier League titles and two League Cups during his five-year stint as Ferguson’s No.2, having spent the previous seven years as first-team coach at Old Trafford. He brings an insatiable winning mentality and knowhow that is tried and tested at the highest level. The problems encountered by David Moyes and, to some extent, Louis van Gaal prove that success at United is far from guaranteed despite having a first-class set-up and a world-class squad. Some would argue that Phelan lacks experience as a manager in his own right, and the ‘buffer’ role he played so well to smooth the relationship between Ferguson and the dressing-room will be of little use as he makes the step up. But according to Phelan, he was manager in all but name during his time as Ferguson’s assistant before Moyes deemed him to surplus to requirements following his appointment at Old Trafford in the summer of 2013. Phelan (left) stands beside Sir Alex Ferguson during a Premier League match at White Hart Lane in 2013 . ‘That’s what I was doing for the last five years, albeit with the title of assistant boss,’ says Phelan, who took charge of United once – a League Cup tie at Scunthorpe in 2010 – when Ferguson was in Spain to watch David de Gea before signing him from Atletico Madrid. ‘Sir Alex was the head of the establishment, there’s no doubt about it and rightly so. He didn’t get to where he’s got through not being a big decision-maker but he’ll be the first to admit that a lot of people played their part in that. ‘We weren’t the face of what was going on but that was our job. You were decision-making so I’m more than capable of handling that.’ Now that Phelan has the opportunity to put his experience to use at Norwich, it will be interesting to see how he gets on considering the mixed fortunes enjoyed by the rest of Fergie’s assistants down the years. Phelan (left) joins in the celebrations after Manchester United won the Premier League in 2009 . Archie Knox – 1986-91 . Ferguson’s No.2 at Aberdeen made the move to Old Trafford with him in 1986 and stayed for more than four years before taking over as Walter Smith’s assistant at Rangers a week before United were due to meet Barcelona in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final. Knox helped Smith win six Scottish titles in seven years before they moved to Everton, and has been a serial No.2 since at Millwall, Coventry, Livingstone, Bolton, Blackburn, Motherwell and Aberdeen again. The 67-year-old is now in charge of scouting and recruitment at Dundee. Archie Knox (left) poses with Ferguson for a photo in the dugout at Old Trafford in 1986 . Brian Kidd – 1991-98 . Kidd left Ferguson’s side to take over as manager of Blackburn Rovers and it proved to be a disastrous move as he lasted less than a year at Ewood Park. The split also prompted Ferguson to criticise Kidd in his first autobiography, accusing him of going behind his back to complain to the Old Trafford board. However, a coach who is credited with polishing United’s Class of ’92 into first-team stars has gone on to find great success on the backroom team at Manchester City, helping the noisy neighbours win two Premier League titles. Brian Kidd (left) and Ferguson hold the Premier League trophy aloft after United were victorious in 1997 . Steve McClaren – 1999-2001 . Moved from Derby during United’s famous Treble-winning season and went on to help Ferguson land three titles in as many years before leaving to take over at Middlesbrough. McClaren became the club’s most successful manager in Boro’s history, winning the League Cup and reaching the UEFA Cup final during his five years in charge. The 53-year-old has since enjoyed great success at FC Twente in Holland and is prospering back at Derby. However, moves to Wolfsburg and Nottingham Forest did not work out, and he will always be haunted by his ill-fated spell in charge of England and that ‘Wally with the Brolly’ tag. Steve McClaren (right) watches United take on Coventry in November 2000 alongside Ferguson . Jimmy Ryan – 1998-99 and 2001-02 . The Scot served as assistant either side of McClaren’s arrival and even took charge of the team for a 3-2 defeat at Middlesbrough in 1998 while Ferguson was attending a funeral. But it was only ever a short-term measure and Ryan was appointed head of the club’s youth academy and worked for another 10 years before his retirement in 2012. Jimmy Ryan (centre) stands beside Ferguson (left) as United are knocked out of the 2000 Champions League . Carlos Queiroz – 2002-03 and 2004-08 . The much-travelled Portuguese coach twice left his role as Ferguson’s assistant and it didn’t go to plan on either occasion. After following David Beckham to Real Madrid in the summer of 2003, Queiroz lasted less than a year as head coach at the Bernabeu as his star-studded Real side finished fourth in La Liga. Then he quit Old Trafford again in 2008 to take charge of Portugal, but after needing a playoff to qualify for the 2010 World Cup he was sacked when they failed to score in three out of four games in South Africa. The 61-year-old enjoyed a happier World Cup in 2014 in his current job as coach of Iran. Carlos Queiroz (left) and Ferguson watch United take on Chelsea in a Premier League match in April 2008 . Walter Smith – 2004 . Smith helped United win the FA Cup during his short-term spell at Old Trafford before taking the Scotland job, having previously worked by Ferguson’s side at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. However, he is better known as a manager in his own right and had two hugely successful spells as manager of Rangers and four years in charge of Everton. Walter Smith (right) stands with fellow Scot Ferguson as they watch United against Fulham in March 2004 . Rene Meulensteen – first-team coach, 2007-13 . Another key member of Ferguson’s backroom team who was released with Phelan following the appointment of Moyes, Meulensteen has struggled to find his feet elsewhere. The Dutchman lasted just 16 days in charge of Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala, and was then sacked as Fulham boss after little more than two months at Craven Cottage.

"Jeremy Menez may have fired eight goals in 14 starts for AC Milan, but the France international is seeking inspiration from the very best strikers in Italian football to improve his game. The 27-year-old is using Roma's Francesco Totti and his coach Filippo Inzaghi to learn how to become even more clinical in front of goal. Menez told Corriere dello Sport: 'I would like to do as he (Inzaghi) did, every day I try. I want to improve my instincts in the box, too.

"Northampton will defend their serial miscreant Dylan Hartley at an RFU disciplinary hearing on Tuesday following his red card for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. Hartley has been banned four times in his career and another suspension could have dire consequences for his international career. Northampton were left fuming by referee JP Doyle’s decision to send their captain off, with injured prop Alex Corbisiero claiming on television that Smith ‘deserved an Oscar’ after Hartley’s elbow caught him square on the nose following a brief grapple between the pair. VIDEO Scroll down to see Dylan Hartley meeting his inspirational childhood coach . England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens . Hartley (right) was adjudged to elbow Leicester's Matt Smith (left) before the pair had to be separated . Hartley cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue . April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor. March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain. March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test. June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain. December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best. May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing. December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder added: ‘The red card was disappointing. Dylan’s got to keep his arms down but he was being held. I don’t think there was any malice in it. In the nature of the game I don’t think it justified a red. ‘I think Smith went down easily, which was disappointing. It’s a tough game and Dylan plays to the edge. You won’t change him.’ England coach Stuart Lancaster was understood to have been incensed by Hartley’s yellow card during last month’s Test against South Africa and read the riot act to the hooker before dropping him to the bench against Samoa. It remains to be seen how he views Hartley’s latest indiscretion. Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill said: ‘If you strike someone in the face you are liable to get yourself in trouble. You would have thought he might have learned by now.’ Vereniki Goneva touches down his second try during the 23-19 defeat at Northampton on Saturday .

Centre Luther Burrell was named man of the match, while locks Courtney Lawes and Christian Day also impressed as Northampton stayed top of the Aviva Premiership table. ‘We got what we deserved,’ Cockerill said. ‘Defensively we were poor and they outplayed us in the second half.’","Northampton captain sent off for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith .

"Northampton captain Dylan Hartley could miss at least the start of England's RBS 6 Nations campaign after he was sent off for elbowing an opponent in the face at Franklin's Gardens. The controversial hooker's career has been scarred by repeated disciplinary episodes, including a 26-week ban for eye-gouging in 2007 and an 11-week suspension for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the 2013 Aviva Premiership final against Leicester. That latter ban led to him missing the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, and Rugby Football Union disciplinary chiefs could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion. Referee J P Doyle shows Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley a red card in the 17th minute . Nortampton lock Courtney Lawes gets an offload away despite the attention of Julian Salvi and Blaine Scully . Leicester winger Vereniki Goneva crosses for the first of his two tries at Franklin's Gardens . It happened after just 17 minutes of a titanic East Midlands derby that 14-man Northampton won 23-19 thanks to substitute Jamie Elliott's 77th-minute try that fly-half Stephen Myler converted from the touchline. Saints had earlier delivered tries for prop Alex Waller and replacement Ben Foden, plus two Myler penalties, with the lead changing hands five times during a pulsating second period. Wing Vereniki Goneva claimed two touchdowns for Tigers, which followed an early penalty try, while Owen Williams and Freddie Burns each kicked a conversion. Saints prop Alex Waller is all smiles after he crashed over in the corner for the home side . Referee J P Doyle seemed happy to award a yellow card when Hartley's elbow caught Tigers centre Matt Smith in the face. As Smith fell to the ground, a brawl broke out involving several players, but television match official Sean Davey urged Doyle to watch further replays, and he responded by sending 61 times-capped Hartley off. England open their Six Nations campaign against Wales in Cardiff on February 6, and given 28-year-old Hartley's poor record - biting and punching offences also appear on his charge-sheet - another lengthy suspension appears likely, with a disciplinary hearing set to be convened before Christmas. And the only current consolation for Hartley is that Saints will lead the Premiership going into the festive period after they showed immense character to keep Tigers out. Northampton and England centre Luther Burrell (left) makes a strong run as Owen Williams puts in a hit . England centre Luther Burrell returned to Northampton's starting line-up, while two changes up-front following last Saturday's 67-0 European Champions Cup stroll against Italians Treviso saw starts for locks Christian Day and number eight Samu Manoa. Leicester, meanwhile, showed four changes - all in the pack - following their defeat against European champions Toulon seven days ago, with hooker Tom Youngs, lock Graham Kitchener, flanker Tom Croft and number eight Jordan Crane all featuring, and prop Marcos Ayerza made his 200th Tigers first team appearance. The initial flurries were fast and furious, but Leicester held their own in set-pieces and open play, with skipper Ben Youngs kicking cleverly to put his team in the right areas as England coaches Andy Farrell and Graham Rowntree looked on. But it quickly became a nightmare for the red rose hierarchy as Hartley was red-carded, before Leicester rammed home their dominance with a penalty try that Williams converted. Northampton replacement Jamie Elliot crosses for the match-winning try three minutes before full-time . Hartley's exit sent shock-waves reverberating around the ground, and Saints forwards coach Dorian West appeared particularly animated as he spoke with the fourth official after Hartley had trudged dejectedly off. Northampton, though, did not lose their poise in such circumstances, and two Myler penalties - the second after Croft was sin-binned for a high tackle on Saints wing Ken Pisi - brought the home side back to 7-6 behind by half-time. And with Croft still off, Saints went ahead for the first time after cleverly recycling possession, and Waller, who scored a dramatic late try to secure Premiership title glory for Northampton at Saracens' expense seven months ago, touched down. Elliot is mobbed his his team-mates as the 14-man Saints celebrate a famous win over their arch-rivals . Full-back James Wilson missed the conversion attempt - Myler was off receiving treatment after being hit by a high Smith tackle - but Northampton had put down a marker, despite being one man short. Leicester took a time to weather the storm, yet they hit back after 61 minutes when replacement fly-half Burns, who took over from Smith as Williams moved out one position, made a sharp break before Goneva touched down under little pressure. Williams could not add the conversion, but Tigers took a 12-11 advantage that lasted just four minutes as Myler's brilliant pass highlighted a slick handling move that was finished off by Foden. Back came Leicester, though, through Goneva's second try that was sparked by his fellow wing Miles Benjamin's burst, yet Saints were not to be denied and Elliott administered the finishing touch of a scintillating contest.","Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley was sent off in the 17th minute .

"Bermane Stiverne has been released from University Medical Centre where he had been taken after losing his WBC heavyweight title to Deontay Wilder on Saturday night. Stiverne looked a shadow of the fighter who twice beat Chris Arreola, latterly to win the title, as he lost a wide points decision at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. He was taken to the nearby hospital and treated for severe dehydration while his promoter Don King revealed that former champion Larry Holmes had texted him during the fight to urge him to have water poured on Stiverne. Deontay Wilder (left) lands with a left hand on his way to beating Bermane Stiverne in Las Vegas . Stiverne was released from hospital on Monday having suffered from dehydration after the fight . ‘It turns out that Larry Holmes is a very wise and observant man and knows of that of which he speaks,’ King told Yahoo Sports. ‘I came over to the hospital as soon as I heard, and they’re saying it was amazing that he was able to stand up; this explains to me why he fought the way that he did. ‘I’m watching him and I’m saying to myself, “Where is the guy who fought Arreola twice?”. ‘We didn’t see that guy and I was shocked. Now, we know why.’ Meanwhile, Wilder will have scans to determine whether he broke his right hand in the fight. Wilder was in control for the vast majority of the fight while Stiverne struggled to make an impression . Stiverne fell to the canvas at the end of the second round but it was adjudged not to be a knockdown . According to a report in the Tuscaloosa News, the Alabama native was sent for an X-ray which showed a fracture in the knuckle area of his ring finger. He will be examined by Dr Joseph Sherrill who previously operated on the new world champion’s hand in 2009. Wilder’s manager Jay Deas said: ‘We won’t know the extent of the injury until we get more information but we don’t think it will keep him out of training long. ‘He was going to be off to heal up after a very difficult fight. Now is a great time to get everything fixed. We don’t expect any change in the schedule, which would have him back in the ring in the summertime.'

"England have officially added Kent wicketkeeper Sam Billings to their provisional World Cup squad, in place of Craig Kieswetter. The International Cricket Council acceded to England's request to add uncapped 23-year-old Billings, following Kieswetter's announcement that he is likely to be unavailable for the whole of 2015 due to injury. The Somerset wicketkeeper has suffered complications to an eye problem, having resumed playing since being hit in the face by a short ball last summer only to encounter subsequent difficulties with his vision. Sam Billings' impressive One-Day form for Kent last season has earned him the provisional World Cup call-up . Billings is the third wicketkeeper in England's squad, alongside Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow . England have two other wicketkeepers in their 30-man squad, first choice Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow. Kieswetter Tweeted his support for Billings, describing his replacement as a 'future star', . 'Congratulations to @sambillings for being called up to the 30 man World Cup squad. A seriously talented player = future star,' the Somerset player wrote. Confirmation from the England and Wales Cricket Board that Billings will be a third coincides with the ICC's publication of 12 of the 14 squads from countries taking part in the World Cup - which begins in February next year in Australia and New Zealand. Kieswetter, who has been ruled out for the whole of 2015, congratulated his replacement on the announcement . Only Ireland and Australia's squads are yet to be publicised, by those countries' requests. England are expected to pare their 30 down to 16 next week, when they name the touring party for the tri-series in Australia which will precede their World Cup campaign. All squads must be reduced to 15 in early January, five weeks before the global tournament gets under way. Scotland recently announced a squad of only 24, although anything up to 30 is permitted at this stage. They will be led by Preston Mommsen.","Craig Kieswetter ruled out of whole of 2015 with serious eye injury .

"Geraint Jones never dreamed he would earn a 50th one-day international cap eight years after his 49th, let alone that it would come with a country other than England. Yet Gloucestershire’s new captain began another chapter in the most diverse of careers when he played for Papua New Guinea in their first two official 50-over internationals. Jones, 38, has been involved with the country of his birth for three years and lined up against Hong Kong last month in their first games since being given full one-day international status. Former England wicket keeper Geraint Jones has taken up playing ODIs for birth country Papua New Guinea . Jones (right) was part of the England team that defeated Australia to win the 2005 Ashes . Jones plays a shot during Papua New Guinea's World Cup qualifier against Hong Kong . ‘It’s absolutely fantastic,’ said the man who was England’s wicketkeeper in the fabled 2005 Ashes triumph. ‘When I started playing for PNG I never believed it would lead to my 50th cap but the improvement in their cricket has been dramatic. ‘Most of the guys play professionally in Australia now and I thoroughly enjoy being a part of what they are doing. There is pressure to perform, without all the pressure that surrounds playing with England. ‘I don’t keep wicket, I play as a batsman and try to pass on my experience. The players are hugely proud and passionate but you can just get on with it without huge scrutiny and that’s refreshing.’ It is the latest step in quite a journey for the son of a pair of Welsh teachers who spent 10 years in Papua New Guinea before settling in Australia. Jones came to Britain to explore his roots but ended up forging a long and successful career with Kent that earned him 34 Test caps with England. Most notably he was an integral part of Michael Vaughan’s side that thrillingly claimed the Ashes and took the catch that clinched what has since been described as the greatest Test of them all. The snaffling of Michael Kasprowicz off Steve Harmison’s bowling by Jones when all seemed lost for England, and the slow raising of Billy Bowden’s crooked finger, earned the most extraordinary two-run victory at Edgbaston and remains one of the iconic moments in English sporting history. Jones came to England and built an impressive county cricket career playing for Kent . England players celebrate after taking the last Australia wicket during the second Test at Edgbaston . England may have won the Ashes three times since 2005 — and been thrashed 5-0 twice since then, too — but nothing can quite compare with the series in which England defeated the great Australians in their prime. ‘People still tell me that they watched that Edgbaston game on TV from behind their sofa,’ said Jones. ‘It was incredible to take the winning catch there and to put on runs with Freddie Flintoff at Trent Bridge. ‘I scored 85 in that game and if I have one regret it’s that I didn’t go on and make an Ashes hundred. Other than that I’m extremely satisfied with what I did with England. ‘It’s amazing to think that Ashes series was nearly 10 years ago and I know there are a few things being lined up for the anniversary. I will always look back and be hugely proud of what we achieved.’ Now he not only has a new international challenge with Papua New Guinea, but also a new one in the county game, having left Kent for Bristol. ‘I thought my career might be coming to an end and started to seriously consider umpiring,’ said Jones. ‘But the chance has come up to lead Gloucestershire in four-day cricket and I’ve jumped at it. I’ve got to prove I can still do it and I know I will have to particularly work at the physical side of things because Gloucester put huge emphasis on that but it’s very exciting to be captain of a young side.’ Jones and Andrew Flintoff celebrate after reclaiming a memorable Ashes on home turf in 2005 . (L-R) Jones, Kevin Pietersen, Michael Vaughan, Marcus Trescothick and Flintoff celebrate victory . Jones is looking forward to captaining Gloucester . The end at Kent came after he lost his place last season to one of the domestic game’s most exciting young talents in Sam Billings. ‘I’m delighted for Sam and there are certainly no bad feelings on my part,’ said Jones. ‘He’s always had huge potential but he went to Australia last winter, threw himself into improving and everything clicked for him. ‘He has incredible potential and I can see him playing ODI cricket in the near future because he is the sort of dynamic player England are crying out for. As well as batting and keeping I think he is the best fielder in the country and I could see him playing in an England side alongside Jos Buttler.’ Billings, who was added to England’s provisional World Cup squad when Craig Kieswetter was forced to pull out, could even come up against Jones if Papua New Guinea come through qualifying for the World Twenty20 in India in 2016. ‘The qualifiers are in Scotland and Ireland next July and I hope my Gloucestershire commitments allow me to be there,’ said Jones. ‘I never made it to a World Cup with England so that would be quite something.’ Whatever happens it has been quite a career, considering professional cricket was the last thing on Jones’s mind when he ventured to Wales from his adopted home in Queensland. ‘I didn’t play professional cricket until I was 24 so it’s been quite a journey,’ added Jones. ‘I’ve got a two-year contract at Gloucestershire which will take me up until I’m 40 and I’m quite proud of that. ‘My wife tells me that none of it would have happened if I hadn’t met her soon after arriving here because I would probably have gone back to Australia. She’s probably right, too.’","Former England wicket keeper now plays ODIs for the country of his birth Papua New Guinea .

"Scott Redding’s rise up the MotoGP ranks has been as rapid as it has been impressive, and the Brit is determined not to let the upward trajectory stall next term.

Scott Redding has impressed many this year on the Gresini Honda in his first year in MotoGP . 2008: Blusens Aprilia Junior (125cc - 11th) 2009: Blusens Aprilia (125cc - 15th) 2010: Marc VDS Racing (Moto2 - 8th) 2011: Marc VDS Racing (Moto2 - 15th) 2012: Marc VDS Racing (Moto2 - 5th) 2013: Marc VDS Racing (Moto2 - 2nd) 2014: Gresini Honda (MotoGP - 12th)* . *Before final race in Valencia . Redding hopes he can improve on a best finish of seventh this year by fighting for a maiden MotoGP podium in 2015, but admits while he may have a factory Honda to ride next term, he won’t have the same machinery used by the Japanese giant's primary duo of double world champion Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa. Redding said: ‘My target next year will be some top five results, if I could squeeze up on to the podium a couple of times through the season that would be perfect. ‘The bike is pretty much the same, but not the same. It's almost there but not, there are just aspects a full factory team get but the satellite team won't.’ Redding has spent this season at the Gresini team, having spent the previous four years at VDS in Moto2. Despite decent on-track results, the Brit has admitted his frustrations of the work ethic within the Italian outfit. As a result, Redding claims he is looking forward to a VDS return and their stricter approach as the Belgian outfit make their debut in the premier class. Scott Redding navigates his way around Brno during the Moto2 Czech Republic Grand Prix last season, where the Brit narrowly missed out on the title that year with Marc VDS RAcing . Scott Redding will be riding in the last MotoGP race of the season at Valencia shown live on BT Sport . 'I don't like the way they work, the Gresini team, but not in a bad way, Redding added. 'But everyone has their preferences. 'I like to be 10.30 is 10.30. When you go, you go. 'But in the Italian team, 10.30 can be 10.40 or whenever you want. I'm used to working in the stricter VDS team. 'I am going to be having a different crew but I'm looking forward to going back with the same team, I've spent a lot of time with them this year off the track.'

"Ben Foden may not have topped the charts with his Christmas Eve cameo on Hollyoaks but the full-back helped ensure Northampton were flying high in the Aviva Premiership by beating Harlequins at Twickenham. The England back had a relatively quiet game but, watched by a sell-out crowd of 82,000 at HQ, his side secured a gritty victory to round off the most successful year in their history at a venue where they won the title in May.

Harlequins were ambassadors for running rugby but, despite 71 per cent of first-half possession, they trailed at the break. They missed the leadership of Chris Robshaw and Joe Marler, while Saints were also without their skipper, Dylan Hartley. The hooker was serving a three-match ban and watched from the stands as Saints conceded the first try to George Lowe after six minutes. Short-term signing Tim Swiel missed the conversion, but found his range to exchange penalties with Stephen Myler. Quins were making all the hard yards early on, the Saints showed the resolve of champions to take the lead. Samu Manoa, the American No 8, touched down off the back of a driving line-out.

England prop Alex Corbisiero came on as Saints looked to consolidate their 12-point advantage, having been out since September.

"Northampton hardly broke sweat as they stayed firmly on course to reach the European Champions Cup quarter-finals by thumping Treviso 67-0 at Franklin’s Gardens. The Saints, with their juggernaut wing George North in destructive form on his first appearance since being concussed during Wales’ clash against New Zealand three weeks ago, had a bonus point wrapped up inside 35 minutes. And it proved to be their record European win, smashing a 68-21 success against another Italian side - Overmach Parma - during the 2006-07 season. Samoa winger Ken Pisi crosses for the first of his three tries for Northampton at Franklin's Gardins . Welsh winger George North (right) was in destructive form for the Saints . Powerhouse American Eagles forward Samu Manoa scored three tries after coming off the bench . An early penalty try was followed by a short-range North touchdown before scintillating flowing moves led to scores for scrum-half Kahn Fotuali’i and wing Ken Pisi, with two Stephen Myler conversions leaving Pool Five whipping boys Treviso 24 points adrift at half-time. North, his leg strapped, went off early in the second period - his departure looked precautionary - but there was no let-up from Northampton as further tries followed for George Pisi, Ben Foden, two more by Ken Pisi and a 13-minute hat-trick for substitute forward Samu Manoa, while Myler finished with four conversions and full-back James Wilson two. English champions Saints’ 11-try haul took them to 15 points in the group, and victories in their final two pool games next month away to the Ospreys and at home against Racing Metro will guarantee a last-eight place. Northampton fly half Stephen Myler makes a strong run through the Treviso defence . Northampton strengthened their quest to retain control of Pool Five by recalling a number of their international stars, including North, plus the England forward trio of Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes and Tom Wood. And after just 12 minutes an awesome display of Northampton scrummaging power led to French referee Pascal Gauzere awarding a penalty try that Myler converted. Treviso conceded seven penalties in the opening 15 minutes, and although Gauzere initially opted against awarding any yellow cards, the visitors found themselves under relentless pressure that resulted in a simple finish for North. It was North’s fifth try of the current European campaign, and came following impressive approach work by number eight Phil Dowson and Fotuali’i, before Saints rounded off a one-sided opening quarter by conjuring a stunning 80-metre score. England star Tom Wood (right) returned to Northampton's starting line-up . Wing Ken Pisi, Wilson and George Pisi were all heavily involved, and Fotuali’i provided a spectacular finish by turning Treviso full-back Jayden Hayward inside out to put Northampton out of sight. And the bonus point try arrived six minutes before half-time after North ran powerfully from his own half, then without breaking stride he slipped a one-handed offload to flanker Calum Clark, whose pass sent Ken Pisi sprinting over unopposed for a 24-0 lead. The try came with Treviso temporarily down to 14 men after lock Marco Fuser was sin-binned, and Gauzere found his patience tested as the visitors began to infringe at regular intervals in the face of unremitting set-piece pressure. Saints backrower Phil Dowson is tackled by Treviso's Francesco Minto (left) and Joe Carlisle . George Pisi crossed within four minutes of the restart from close range, then Wilson’s angled run created an opening for Ken Pisi’s second score. Lawes was denied a try when the television match official ruled the giant Saints lock had made a double movement. The closing stages belonged to Manu as the United States international claimed two tries in four minutes after he replaced Clark, while Treviso collected another yellow card when substitute prop Cosma Garfagnoli received his marching orders for a technical offence. Manoa then effortlessly completed his hat-trick at the base of an advancing Northampton scrum, and Ken Pisi also delivered a treble before North’s replacement Foden added the final touchdown during a blistering finish.","Northampton on course to reach European Champions Cup quarter-finals .

"Rugby fans are being ripped off by ticket touts charging up to £2,000 a ticket to watch Six Nations tournament matches. Anonymous sellers are flogging their tickets via agencies for up to 35 times their original face value. Two tickets behind the posts at Twickenham for England’s game against France in March are advertised by one firm called Get Me In for £1,650 apiece. Chris Robshaw will be at Twickenham Stadium but genuine fans could miss out because of ticket touts . But the firm also charge a whopping processing fee of £610 on the tickets which originally cost £55 when they went to sale. Meaning rugby fanatics will need to stump up a whopping £3,910 for a pair of tickets. It’s a similar situation on Stubhub who are charging £1,041 for Wales’ opening clash against England in Cardiff next month. Leigh Halfpenny will be keen to take to the Millenium Stadium pitch in front of an abundance of home fans . Fans interested in going to the World Cup final at Twickenham will have to fork out £3,449 if they want to buy their tickets with Viagogo. The sites, which are totally legal, are designed to let fans buy tickets from other fans rather than touts. But critics say more and more people are buying as many tickets as they possibly can to make a fast buck with expensive re-sales. In reply, Viagago said: 'We have a wide range of prices on the site, starting from £59 (for Tonga vs Namibia), Scotland vs USA from £98, England vs Fiji from £117, England vs Australia from £249 and tickets for the Final starting from £564. 'Sellers can list tickets at any price, but high prices rarely sell as they can be compared with others at lower prices.

"Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure believes the Africa Cup of Nations is a chance for players to paint a positive picture of the continent. Ebola, terrorism and the violent activities of Islamist militants Boko Haram have all kept Africa in the headlines over the last year. Even the Africa Cup of Nations itself was affected by the ebola epidemic when original hosts Morocco requested a postponement, which eventually resulted in the tournament being moved to Equatorial Guinea. Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure believes the Africa Cup of Nations will be a boost to his troubled continent . It finally kicks off on Saturday with Toure hoping the 14 nations involved can put on a show to make the continent feel proud. 'A lot of us play for top clubs in Europe but when you have the opportunity to make African people happy you have to take it,' the 33-year-old said. 'It's one of the continents which suffers every single minute. 'When we go to the Africa Nations Cup they are so proud to see us. You can feel the joy in everybody. 'Nobody will think about ebola or war, or anything else. They will just focus on football. 'For me that's why it's very important to bring them that joy because the continent deserves that.' The ebola outbreak has hit western Africa the hardest and while Toure's homeland has escaped the worst ravages of the disease it does not mean he and his team-mates are not acutely aware of the disaster. Toure, pictured in action against Sunderland, has been part of a struggling Liverpool side this season . In November they played a qualifier against Sierra Leone, one of the countries hardest hit by the outbreak, in November with the match switched to the Ivory Coast capital Abidjan over fears about the spread of the disease. While the players had to focus on football Toure said they were conscious there was an important message to be relayed. 'As Africans we need to show solidarity,' he added. 'I didn't speak to them about how it had been in their country but for me it was really important to show they are part of the continent and that we want to help them. 'We don't want to push them away. After the game we just talked to them and hugged them to show we were supporting them.' The Africa Cup of Nations will be Toure's international swansong and he will bow out having made more than 120 appearances over 15 years with the national team. Toure (second from right) will retire from international football at the end of the Africa Cup of Nations . His call-up came at a time when he was just starting to re-establish himself in Liverpool's starting line-up, which was particularly crucial as his contract expires in the summer. 'This kind of situation when you leave your club during the season is always difficult,' he added. 'You don't like to miss matches but when the time comes, for us as Africans we want to make our continent and our country proud. 'I am finished after this, it's the end of my international career. 'I hope I will finish on a high. 'It's been 15, 16 years for me in the national team with lots of ups and downs. I hope the greatest moment is still to come.'","Kolo Toure will represent the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations .

"A driver has deliberately rammed his vehicle into a family car in a shocking road-rage attack. The victim, named Stephen, was driving along a NSW Central Coast street with his wife when a driver in front of him stopped at a green light. When Stephen tooted the driver of the blue sedan, the motorist took it as a personal attack, responding with extreme force. The attacker, pictured here abusing Stephen, the driver of the vehicle, right before the attack . The motorist pursued Stephen after he tooted him for stopping at a green light . After having his car rammed into by the side, Stephen's car hurtled out of control, nearly slamming into a telegraph pole . When they noticed the Sedan was pursuing them down the street, Stephen's wife started filming out the window, anticipating that something serious could happen. The driver appears to say 'F*** you buddy' before slamming his own car into the side of Stephen's vehicle, at which point the footage goes blurred from the impact. Stephen’s car came within centimeters of colliding with a telegraph pole, an collision which could have had fatal consequences. He has since posted extensively about the incident on Twitter, in particular what he sees as the negligent response from police. In one post, Stephen wrote: 'What you don't see on that video is me gaining control of the car and steering past a telegraph pole... missed it by centimetres.’ ‘So a road rager just deliberately rammed our car...nearly sending us into telegraph pole....and @nswpolice couldn't have given one f***.’ Stephen says his wife called 000 immediately afterwards. Police advised them to pick up his children and wait in a local service station, where they would meet him. But after waiting for 20 minutes, Stephen gave up on the police and drove his family home, fearing the attacker could identify them from their damaged car. Stephen looks to the camera, visibly shaken after the shocking road rage-attack . In another tweet, Stephen wrote: 'still on phone to @nswpolice ..so now we have 3 kids in our smashed up car that is barely driveable but no hint from police they are coming.' 'Telling @nswpolice what happened...gotta pick up our kids from nearby ....did they send anyone? Nope...so we grab kids and drive away...' He added he was concerned for his family's safety, writing: 'For all we know @nswpolice this bloke could be driving the streets looking for us. Smallish community here.. he knows roughly our location.' Stephen says police arrived at his home that night to take his details, but claimed they would be unable to deal with the incident for at least a fortnight. Stephen vented his frustration in another tweet, writing: 'Question for @nswpolice .. why does threatening and attacking someone with a car not warrant same response as if it was a knife or a gun?' A spokesperson from NSW police told Daily Mail Australia  ‘police advised the driver to leave the area as they were concerned for their safety. They later met with the driver at their home address.' ‘The incident is under investigation.’","Stephen tooted a vehicle in front of him for stopping at a green light .

"Bundesliga side Wolfsburg is going ahead with its planned training camp in South Africa despite the death of midfielder Junior Malanda in a car crash on Saturday. 'It wasn't an easy decision but we're sure that it's absolutely the right one. He wanted success, to achieve great things with us, and it's the least we could do for him,' Wolfsburg general manager Klaus Allofs said. The team's rescheduled departure for Cape Town was set for Sunday evening. Wolfsburg starlet Junior Malanda was tragically killed in a car accident on Saturday . The 20-year-old was a passenger in the car when it crashed into a tree in bad weather conditions . The 20-year-old Malanda, a Belgium youth international, died when the Volkswagen Touareg in which he was a back-seat passenger crashed off the motorway near Bielefeld. He was on his way to meet teammates for Saturday evening's planned departure to the training camp. Wolfsburg was bringing in counselors to help players cope with the loss of their teammate. 'Everyone is completely distraught. The players are in a terrible state,' Allofs said. Allofs later told Sky television: 'Everybody loved him.' Malanda was en route to meet team-mates to leave for South Africa for a planned training camp . Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking fought back tears when saying Malanda would 'leave a big gap' Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking struggled to hide his grief and fought back tears at Sunday's press conference. 'Junior was an exceptional young player - talented and full of life. He leaves a big gap,' Hecking said. Several hundred fans gathered to express their sorrow with a silent march on Sunday. Many left flowers, candles, pictures, and banners in the club's green and white colors at Wolfsburg's stadium, where the club opened a book of condolences for the young player. Malanda was considered one of Belgium's top prospects. He played at every youth level for his country from under-15s to under-21s. 'Heaven is now your playing pitch, but we will not forget you,' the Belgian Football Association said on its website. Malanda scored two goals and set up four more in 17 Bundesliga games for Wolfsburg, which he joined from Belgian Pro League side Zulte Waregem in January 2014. He previously played for the reserve side of French club Lille, which he joined as a 12-year-old from Belgian side Anderlecht's youth setup.","Belgian youngster Junior Malanda was killed in a car accident on Saturday .

"James Hook wants Gloucester to kick on from recent domestic successes and book a place in this season's European Challenge Cup quarter-finals. Victory over Kingsholm visitors Oyonnax on Saturday would secure a last-eight spot one game inside the distance. And after starting the year with successive Aviva Premiership wins against Exeter and Saracens - the latter success secured by Hook's long-range penalty in injury time - Gloucester are raring to go again. James Hook is hoping some  good domestic results can buoy Gloucester into the European Cup quarter-finals . ""We have been given a huge confidence boost,"" Wales international Hook said. ""We beat a good side in Exeter, and we beat a champion side in Saracens. ""We have to build from those results. The atmosphere was brilliant against Saracens - I have never known an atmosphere like it at Kingsholm - and we now move back to European competition. ""We have to try and get a home quarter-final, and we know Oyonnax are a tough team, but we need to go again."" Gloucester rugby director David Humphreys' team selection reflects the importance of Saturday's Pool Five game, with Hook - who moves from fly-half to full-back - being joined by fellow internationals like Billy Twelvetrees, Jonny May, Greig Laidlaw, Richard Hibbard and John Afoa, while Gareth Evans replaces injured England number eight Ben Morgan. England international Billy Twelvetress (left) will be in the Gloucester team to face Oyonnax on Saturday . Humphreys said: ""The two recent wins have given some real self-belief to the squad, and Europe has brought the best out of the team so far this season. ""For us now, it's about making sure we are as well prepared for Oyonnax as we were for Saracens last week. ""Training has gone well, and we're looking forward to hopefully getting the win which would ensure that we win the pool."" London Irish, now under the guidance of interim head coach Glenn Delaney following rugby director Brian Smith's departure earlier this week, will keep the heat on Pool One rivals Cardiff Blues if they beat Madejski Stadium visitors Grenoble on Saturday. Irish show two changes from the side that beat Exeter five days ago, with Jebb Sinclair starting in the second-row and centre Eamonn Sheridan replacing Eoin Griffin. London Irish will make a change as Eamonn Sheridan comes in for Eoin Griffin, Jebb Sinclair also starts . In Pool Three, Newcastle will overtake Saturday's Kingston Park visitors Newport Gwent Dragons as group leaders with victory on Tyneside, but the Welsh side are likely to provide testing opposition. ""I made it to the semi-final of the Heineken Cup as a player with Gloucester and the quarter-finals with Sale, and the pool stages were the hardest parts,"" Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones said. ""I have been to Newcastle many times as a player and a coach, and it's a tough place to go, but I am sure we will rise to the challenge."" Edinburgh, meanwhile, will remain top of Pool Four if they defeat Lyon on Saturday, with Sunday's action taking Pool Two leaders Exeter to Galway for a clash against their closest group rivals Connacht. Ben Morgan will miss the game for Gloucester after being stretchered off during the game with Saracens .","A win against Oyonnax would secure Gloucester a place in the last-eight .

"Roberto Martinez knew the moment he had to make his move. Sitting in the stands of the Maracana, his eye was drawn to the scurrying No 7 who was pestering Lionel Messi. This was the biggest game of Muhamed Besic’s life: Bosnia v Argentina. It was Bosnia’s first World Cup game watched by a capacity crowd inside one of football’s cathedrals. But, for 45 minutes, the combative midfielder bothered the greatest player in the world to distraction. Muhamed Besic has played in all of Everton's games so far this season . Besic produced a sterling display against Argentina superstar Lionel Messi at the 2014 World Cup . ‘He marked Messi out of the game in the first half,’ Martinez recalled, as he explained why he had to sign Besic for £4million from Ferencvaros last summer. ‘I first became aware of him as a young boy at Hamburg. He’s a young man with incredible potential.’ Messi, ultimately, won the battle, scoring a magnificent goal in a 2-1 win but Martinez knew he had to bring Besic to Goodison Park. Without that performance, the 22-year-old would have been getting ready for a Champions League clash with Liverpool on Tuesday. The Barcelona forward was completely marked out of the game in the first half by the impressive Besic . Besic, seen in action against Hull last Saturday, has started the Toffees' last three Premier League games . ‘It was a big step up for me,’ Besic explains. ‘If I hadn’t gone, maybe I wouldn’t be playing here. I’d be in Switzerland with Basle. 'They were interested. But after the World Cup Everton came in and clubs from Italy and Spain as well.’ It changed his life but it didn’t change him. Sat in the media room of Everton’s Finch Farm training base, with a woolly hat pulled tightly down on his head, it quickly becomes apparent it takes a lot to ruffle Besic; not even a mistake on his debut against Chelsea that led to a goal bothered him unduly. He is economical with his words but that does not mean he isn’t an engaging interviewee and the story about going toe-to-toe with Messi gives an insight into his character. ‘It was good,’ he says with a smile. ‘Did I swap shirts? No. No. I always keep my shirts as playing for Bosnia means so much. I don’t have idols. 'I liked Bayern Munich when I was younger for how they played. I’ve never supported a player or a team. I know it sounds strange but that’s how it is.’ Besic looks to hold off the challenge of Wolfsburg midfielder Junior Malanda in the Europa League . Besic has been up against some top opposition this season, none more so than Gareth Bale . That is why he won’t be losing any sleep over this afternoon’s trip to Manchester City. Besic will be in the heart of Everton’s midfield, charged with stopping Yaya Toure’s rampaging runs — but he will not be flinching from any challenges. ‘I do like to tackle,’ he says, with a glint in his eye. ‘But I am a little bit skinny so I need a bit more weight on me but I will make progress with that in time. 'I am in the gym a lot, every day doing a little bit. I go at 100 per cent with every tackle. If a yellow card comes then I go slower.’ Born in Berlin, Besic began his career at Hamburg but ended up moving to Hungary after a fall-out with manager Thorsten Fink. One story claimed that Fink pinned Besic against the wall by the throat during a disagreement but he quickly dispels that story. He also firmly explains why there was not the slightest hint of regret when he saw the country where he was born winning the World Cup this summer. The German FA made attempts to get him into their system but Besic would not be swayed. ‘I have no regrets at all,’ says Besic. ‘I had an approach to play for the Under 19s. Maybe it would have been better for my career at that time to choose Germany but my heart always said Bosnia. It was just inside my heart, I could never say what. Besic has also established himself as a regular starter for his country, Bosnia . ‘My parents never tried to influence me or said “You have to play for Bosnia”. They just let me make my decision. All the Bosnia players are like this. 'The people have a strong mentality. I can’t explain why but back in Bosnia I feel better.’ He will be back among friends at the Etihad Stadium as Edin Dzeko is there to welcome him. They do not have plans to share dinner after the game but it is clear that Dzeko has helped Besic and his girlfriend, Jessica, settle into life in England. ‘Edin said I would have to be patient when I arrived because the league is so different,’ Besic explains. ‘He said it’s the best league in the world. Roberto Martinez then told me about Everton and how the fans were so passionate. He explained about the club’s history. ‘So far I have shown about 50 per cent of what they will see. I need a bit more time but I hope in another half year, when I am really settled, my quality will come out. My ambitions? My ambition is to win every game I play. Whether it is Manchester City or whoever — I want to win.’ And Lionel Messi, for one, can verify that combative streak.","Muhamed Besic has appeared in every Everton game this season .

The 22-year-old knows his man-marking display on Lionel Messi played a huge role in his move to Everton .

"As you step off the plane in Malabo, a nurse stops you and takes your temperature. Another forces you to wash your hands with alcoholic hand gel, before a third questions you on which countries you've visited in the last few months. Welcome to the Africa Cup of Nations. It’s a remarkable feat that this competition is taking place at all. It’s been just two months since Morocco confirmed that they would not be hosting the tournament, and only 64 days since Equatorial Guinea stepped in as the hosts. People gather outside the Bata Stadium before opening match between Equatorial Guinea and Congo . The opening ceremony for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations gets underway at the Bata Stadium . Doezens of balloons are released to celebrate the grand opening of the tournament in Equatorial Guinea . Even for a country with the infrastructure already in place that would prove a tough task – and here it still feels like a near impossibility as the football gets underway. While Malabo and Bata, the two larger cities, hosted games in the 2012 edition of the Cup of Nations, for Ebebiyin and Mongomo were less than prepared. The pitch in Mongomo, birthplace of the Equato-Guinean President Teodoro Obiang, now looks pristine, but it was a mess just a few days ago, and there can be little confidence about how it will hold up after 180 minutes of football on Monday. Dancers perform at the Bata Stadium ahead of the first game of the Africa Cup of Nations . Workers put up flags of African countries competing in the Africa Cup of nations near Bata stadium in Bata . And when the tournament leaves town, having provided the town with six group games and a quarter final, the 8,000 inhabitants will have themselves a 10,000 capacity stadium. Lucky Deportivo Mongomo. Away from the stadiums, there are other major concerns. While Malabo is reasonably well-stocked with hotel rooms, finding a place to stay in Bata is proving a real difficulty, not just for the fans and journalists that have made it out here, but for the teams. Cup of Nations veteran Claude Le Roy, the Congo manager in his at his eighth tournament, branded it ‘unacceptable’ when his side arrived at their hotel to find there were no beds for seven of the party of 35. In Ebebiyin Tunisia turned up to find that the power had gone down. When it returned, three and a half hours later, the players discovered, to their disgust, that the hotel had no running water, no bed sheets or towels, no televisions and no soap. Streamers are released as the crowds gather in Equatorial Guinea . In Mongomo, meanwhile, the four teams face drawing lots to decide who gets to use the one available practice pitch at any given time. None of this seems to matter very much to the locals, particularly in Malabo where the Cup of Nations seems to have snuck up on everyone. Ask a taxi-driver if they are planning to go to any of the games and the most you get is a shrugged ‘maybe’. Travelling fans are rarely a feature of the competition, and despite the President’s attempt to boost attendances by providing 40,000 free tickets, it is hard to see how any matches, bar those involving the hosts, will come close to capacity. The exception to the low-key build-up came from a group of Malian migrant workers, who, it seems, decided to take it upon themselves to make Malabo feel like a city hosting a continental competition. Algeria will have to make do without Essaid Belkalem (left) after the defender was ruled out through injury . As we sat in a coffee shop in the centre of the town on Friday, a cacophony of noise interrupted the city’s quiet anticipation. Around 150 Mali fans, clad head-to-foot in yellow, waving flags and scarves and standing on the back of six or seven pick-up trucks, screamed their support for their country. The convoy honked their horns loudly, bringing the traffic – difficult to negotiate at the best of times – to a complete standstill. For ten minutes we were treated to the noise, passion and colour one associates with African football – before the convoy moved on to greet their heroes at the airport, and calm again descended on the capital. Against this backdrop, a tournament that is notoriously difficult to predict at the best of times, has become impossible to call. The conditions for the favourites Algeria, out in Mongomo, could prove a real hindrance to their chances, despite the incredible array of attacking talent they possess. West Ham United striker Diafra Sakho withdrew from the Senegal squad because of a problem with his back . They kick-off their campaign tomorrow against Senegal, also blessed with a wide selection of forwards (despite the withdrawal of West Ham star Diafra Sakho), perhaps the best front-line in the tournament, but have struggled to find a tactical balance recently. With a strong but unpredictable Ghana side, managed by former Chelsea boss Avram Grant, alongside them in group C, and the much-improved South Africans, the group in the remote corner of the jungle could turn into a real scrap. Two other fancied sides, Cameroon and Ivory Coast, have the benefit of being based in fancy hotels in Malabo, and playing all their games in the rather beautiful stadium just south of the city in Banapa. The Ivorians, however, for all their Premier League talent, looked woeful at times in qualifying, and a friendly defeat to a weak Swedish side this week does not suggest they have done much to improve. However, with Manchester City stars past present and future in their line-up, with Wilfried Bony joining Yaya and Kolo Toure, they have the firepower to go a long way if everything clicks. Brothers Kolo Toure (left) and Yaya Toure (right) will be hoping the Ivory Coast can go all the way to the final . New Manchester City recruit Wilfried Bony will hopeful of bringing his fine domestic form to the tournament . But the most remarkable team based in the capital are Guinea, the squad whose presence is a constant reminder of what this tournament has accomplished, simply to be happening. As you drive back into town from the stadium, amid the billboards advertising flights to Bata and showing off the new mascot Chuku Chuku (a squirrel which looks suspiciously like a porcupine), one slogan is repeated constantly. ‘Todos contra el Ebola’ – Everyone against Ebola. For the Guineans, who qualified against all odds while their country was ravaged by the outbreak, this will be an emotional tournament. The tournament's squirrel mascot Chuku Chuku is raring to go despite looking more like a Porcupine . They are determined to make their country famous for matters on the pitch, rather than as a medical disaster. It has become clear that 64 days is not long enough to plan and deliver a tournament of this magnitude. What is a relief for all involved, from CAF to the players, and certainly the fans, is that now, finally, we can stop talking about the preparations, and start talking about the football.

"Midfielder Sardor Rashidov scored a goal in each half to give Uzbekistan a 3-1 victory over Saudi Arabia  and a spot in the Asian Cup quarter-finals. Uzbekistan will next face South Korea in Melbourne on Thursday after finishing second in Group B to China, which completed a clean sweep of the group stage with a 2-1 win over already eliminated North Korea. China already secured top spot in the group with wins over Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan, and face hosts Australia on Thursday in Canberra. Sardor Rashidov scored a brace to help his side progress to the Asian Cup quarter-finals . Uzbekistan midfielder Rashidov, pictured scoring against Saudi Arabia, scored either side of the interval . Uzbekistan took the lead after just 90 seconds when Rashidov stole the ball against the run of play just inside the Saudi half before beating three defenders and sliding a shot between the legs of Saudi goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah. Saudi Arabia pushed relentlessly into the Uzbekistan half for no reward either side of the interval until Mohammed Al Sahlawi finally equalised from the penalty spot in the 60th minute when Naif Hazazi was brought down by Vitaly Denisov in the area. Uzbekistan looked to have scored from a free-kick just two minutes later, but an apparent goal was called back after the referee ruled a Saudi defender was pulled down while standing in the wall. Second-half substitute Vokhid Shodiev restored the lead for Uzbekistan in the 71st when he leapt to meet a long Shavkatjon Mulladjanov cross and powerfully headed the ball inside the near post. Rashidov claimed his second goal to put the win beyond doubt in the 79th when he gathered a long, centering pass from Jasur Khasanov inside the area and outran the Saudi defence before firing the ball past Abdullah in the Saudi net.

"Jimmy Savile’s £4,000 grave is to be dismantled on orders of his family 'out of respect for public opinion', it was announced yesterday. The astonishing U-turn by the Savile family was revealed only minutes after the Metropolitan Police press conference. Sources said the relatives were 'emotionally drained' by the sheer force of the allegations as police announced a huge inquiry into allegations that Sir Jimmy Savile 'sexually assaulted underage girls over four decades'. Scotland Yard said they are due to investigate 120 lines of inquiry from alleged victims, witnesses and third-parties. The late Sir Jimmy Savile has been accused of abusing girls in his dressing room . The number of the late DJ's alleged victims is . reported to be between 20 and 25  victims, some of whom were underage when . the abuse happened, it is claimed. Scotland Yard has formally recorded . eight criminal allegations against the star, including two of rape and . six of indecent assault. Commander Peter Spindler, head of Specialist Crime Investigations, said the allegations span four decades and information so far suggests abuse was on a 'national scale'. He said there are currently 120 lines of inquiry, although some could be duplicates. Mr Spindler told reporters: 'Information is coming in as we speak probably. 'The reality is this really has captured . the public’s mind. We are getting calls from victims, from witnesses . and third parties who believe they know something about it. 'We have formally recorded eight criminal allegations against Savile. Two of those are rape, six of indecent assault. A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them . 'These are primarily against girls in their mid-teens, so between 13 and 16 and it spans four decades of abuse.' He said the first dated back to about 1959 but most seemed to be in the 70s and 80s. Scotland Yard has been in contact with ITV and the BBC to gather information, and they are contacting alleged victims they have been talking to to see if they will co-operate, he said. 'We believe there are probably another 20 potential victims there,' Mr Spindler added. 'It is too early for us to give you an accurate picture of what 120 lines of inquiry will distil down to but we believe we will come up with between 20 to 25 victims.' Mr Spindler said they are working to identify anyone who could be subject to criminal investigation. The BBC is not being investigated, he said. Asked if allegations related to any institutions other than those mentioned in previous claims - the BBC, the Jersey children's home, or the school in Staines - he said he had contacted Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and Leeds Royal Infirmary. 'The pattern of his offending behaviour does appear to be on a national scale,' he said. Mr Spindler said police will produce a joint report with the NSPCC to look to see what lessons can be learned and what conclusions can be drawn, which can be shared with other agencies. Calling it an 'assessment', rather than an investigation, he said it is being carried out by Scotland Yard and being led by its Serious Case Team, which looks at complex and history cases. There are seven officers working on the case, but that will go up to 10 tomorrow, 'because we are keen to draw this to a swift conclusion', he said. Mr Spindler said a provisional search of Scotland Yard's records could not find any record of any previous investigation into Savile, and they were only previously aware of the involvement of Surrey Police. Although it is in its early stages, he said allegations suggested Savile's 'predilection for teenage girls'. As police seek to investigate the scandal, they are expected to speak to celebrities and former Corporation staff in relation to the inquiry, the Evening Standard reported. The DJ's family, from left,  Michael Johnson . (nephew) with partner Phanu Kapur, Roger Foster (nephew) and Janet . Humble (niece) with partner Ronald Matthews. His relatives have asked the gravestone be taken away . The headstone will be removed by undertakers after his family said they wanted to respect public opinion . 'There is a pattern of behaviour that . is being presented to us which ultimately we will hope to analyse and . present in a final report in some weeks time,' he said. Peter Liver, from the NSPCC, said . over the last five days the charity has received 40 calls following the . claims of abuse committed by Savile. Of these, 24 have been referred to . police or other agencies that can support victims of abuse, he said, and . 17 directly relate to Savile. Mr Liver said there were also 21 unrelated calls to the helpline that stemmed from publicity over the allegations. He said they consisted of 'people coming forward to report abuse as a result of the attention that has been drawn to this'. As the scandal deepens, undertakers were hoping to remove the star's . triple headstone – which they only put up on September 20 -  last night . subject to consents from Savile’s relatives. The family said in a statement: . 'Members of the family of Sir Jimmy Savile have decided to remove his . headstone from the grave in Scarborough. 'The family members are deeply aware of the impact that the stone remaining there could have on the dignity and sanctity of the cemetery. 'Out of respect to public opinion, to . those who are buried there, and to those who tend their graves and visit . there, we have decided to remove it.' Memory: Jimmy's coffin 'lay in state' at the . Queens Hotel, Leeds, West Yorkshire after he died and thousands of fans . arrived to pay tribute to the veteran entertainer, who has now been accused of sexual assault . There had been concern about security . at the cemetery following a vandal attack on a commemorative plaque to . Savile outside his former home on Scarborough seafront. Other mourners with loved ones buried . in Woodlands Cemetery were concerned despite regular security sweeps – . now extended into the evening. One of the closest plots is the last . resting place of soldier David License whose sister Janet Taylor, from . Leeds, said: 'Me and my brothers are all worried. 'We are all very concerned because of the way things have turned out. No one knows what’s going to happen. 'There are always some nutters out there and we don’t want any of it going our David’s way. 'Jimmy Savile just happens to be . buried next to two very brave soldiers – my brother and the man in the next . grave which is also military.' David Cameron hinted that Savile could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood . Mother in law Carole Taylor, of Scarborough, added: 'They say there’s security but they can’t be here 24 hours a day.' Savile’s gaudy six-foot wide and four-foot tall memorial spanning three plots was unveiled two weeks ago. He was buried under the epitaph he dreamed up years ago – 'It was good while it lasted.' Three 18ins thick slabs contain poetry, a potted biography of the star, and a list of charities he supported. The past two weeks have seen most of the star’s connections with Scarborough severed. On Sunday a footpath named after him – . Savile’s View – was dismantled following an attack on his nearby . memorial plaque which was daubed with the words paedophile and rapist . the previous week. Plans for a statue were also scrapped. There is no suggestion at this stage . that Savile's remains will be removed. His body was entombled in . concrete last November to deter grave robbers in search of bling - . although the coffin contains no valuables. The announcement came as the BBC's Director General George Entwistle apologised to alleged victims and promised a full inquiry into the scandal surrounding the former Top Of The Pops presenter. David Cameron has added to the scandal by hinting that Savile could be posthumously stripped of his knighthood . in the wake of allegations of sexual abuse against young girls. The . Prime Minister stopped short of revealing whether he felt the former DJ . should lose the honour, but suggested that the case should be . considered by a Whitehall committee which has the power to recommend . forfeiture. His comments came after the chairman of the BBC Trust gave his backing to inquiries by police and the corporation. Lord Patten said the allegations against Savile could not be excused as behaviour from a time when 'attitudes were different'. The . radio and TV presenter and charity fundraiser, who died in 2011, has . been accused by a growing number of women in the last few weeks of . sexual abuse over a number of years. Mr . Cameron told ITV1’s Daybreak programme today: 'These stories are . deeply, deeply troubling and I hope that every organisation that has . responsibilities will have a proper investigation into what happened, . and if these things did happen, and how they were allowed to happen, and . then of course everyone has to take their responsibilities.' Asked . if Savile should lose his knighthood, Mr Cameron said: 'We have . something called a Forfeiture Committee. It is not chaired or sat on by . me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of . honours, and obviously they have to do their job too.'","Police have two formal allegations of rape and six formal allegations of indecent assault against presenter .

"Iran's President Hassan Rouhani arrived home today to shouts of 'death to America' from hardline protesters. While hundreds of Iranians gathered at the airport to cheer his return to the country after a week of UN talks, around 100 others gathered outside to throw eggs and shoes at his car. The hardline activists also waved a banner and some threw stones, according to Iran's news agency. Hassan Rouhani has spent the week away for international talks including a summit at the UN . Rouhani and Obama shared a phone call after a handshake opportunity earlier in the week didn't happen . They appeared to be protesting against Rouhani softening relations with the West, and particularly a 15 minute phone call he shared with Barack Obama yesterday. News of the call surprised reporters after a handshake between the two leaders failed to materialise at the United Nations headquarters. They spoke through an interpreter in the first direct contact between a U.S. and Iranian President in more than 30 years. Obama told journalists at the White House the the call was the result of Iranian officials 'reaching out' though Rouhani has since claimed it was a U.S. initiative. Iran's political leaders have been slow to react to the news, but Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of national security and foreign affairs, tentatively welcomed the conversation as a sign of the Islamic Republic's 'position of authority'. 'This (phone call) shows that Iran's place in the world is of critical importance. That the president of America insists on a telephone call is a sign of sincerity.' While Obama spoke to journalists Rouhani used his Twitter account to share the news . Obama also asked Rouhani about the fate of three Americans imprisoned in Iran: Saeed Abedini, Amir Mirzai Hekmati and Robert Levinson. Abedini was imprisoned for setting up home-based Christian prayer meetings, Hekmati was sentenced to death for espionage, and Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared. Rouhani also found himself as the subject of scorn earlier in the week when he admitted in an interview that the holocaust had happened. Though Rouhani's more moderate stance has won over Western diplomats he face stiff opposition in his home country . The acknowledgement marked a break from eight years of holocaust denial by Rouhani's predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as part of his rhetoric against the Jewish State of Israel. Though Rouhani said the exact numbers and scale of the massacre were best left up to historians, the remark still prompted Iran's news agency to accuse CNN of mistranslating his comments. Rouhani has since gone on to repeat the admission, and CNN says it stands by its work. The news comes at the end of a week which has seen a dramatic thawing of relations between Iran and the West. Rouhani . has said he wants to end the stand-off between Iran and America over . his country's nuclear programme, which Ian claims is for peaceful . purposes but the West has long suspected will be used to make atomic . bombs. Addressing a UN summit on the issue, Rouhani said he would . like the dispute to be resolved in 'months rather than years' and called . for Israel to sign up to a treaty on nuclear weapons. He has . consented to more international inspections and diplomats will have to . deliver a detailed plan to fresh UN talks next month aimed at dispelling . fears that the country is developing nuclear weapons. In return . Rouhani has said that he expects all sanctions on his country to be . lifted, which have cut oil exports in half, devalued the Iranian . currency and crippled the economy.","Around 100 protesters gathered outside the airport .

"Hamza Aldaradreh's dominating four-goal performance against Palestine has given Jordan coach Ray Wilkins a selection dilemma ahead of his team's must-win final group match against Japan. Man of the match Hamza became just the fourth player to score four goals in an Asian Cup match to help Jordan keep its tournament hopes alive with a 5-1 win over Palestine on Friday. Wilkins said Hamza was just the third-choice striker when Jordan started its Asian Cup campaign, behind Odai Al Saify and Ahmad Hayel.

'Now Hamza's given me a horrible bloody headache that I have to try and sort out,' the former England midfielder said. 'Nevertheless I'm delighted for him and I'm delighted for the lads as well.' Jordan shares the Group D lead with three points ahead of the match between fellow leaders Japan and Iraq later Friday in Brisbane. Palestine is now eliminated after two losses. 'We lost because we didn't score in the first half or 25 minutes,' Palestine coach Ahmed Al Hassan said. 'Then (we conceded) two goals in two minutes.' Palestine looked the more organized early in the match, but it was Jordan that made the breakthrough in the 33rd minute when midfielder Yousef Ahmad Mohammad gathered a Hamza pass in the area and sent a long, curving strike into the top corner of the net. The Jordan players celebrate their opening goal of the match against Palestine in Melbourne . A Jordanian supporter waves a flag in the crowd midway through the Group D match on Friday . Hamza scored another just over a minute later when he met an Abdallah Deeb cross in front of goal and slid it inside the far post. The striker scored his second goal in first-half stoppage time when he raced into the box and connected with a Saeed Murjan cross, volleying past Palestine goalkeeper Ramzi Saleh. Hamza completed his hat trick in the 75th minute when he burst onto a Deeb pass and sent a low shot into the net, then brought up his fourth five minutes later by beating Saleh with a low strike from just outside the box. 'I felt the score line was a little bit heavy in our favor if I'm perfectly honest. They had a number of chances and Amer Shafi made some very good saves for us,' Jordan coach Ray Wilkins said. 'I think defensively, both sides would not have been as happy as they were offensively.' Yousef Ahmad scores a goal for Jordan, their first of the match at AAMI Park on January 16 .

It plays its final match of the tournament against Iraq on Tuesday in Canberra. For Jordan, preparations will now start for its final group match against tournament favorite Japan in Melbourne. 'We play in four days' time, so immediately we get back I'll take a look at the video and we'll see the end of the Japanese game and we'll see where we go from there,' Wilkins said.

'But it's back to the drawing board because the game we face now is critical for us. We've done a good job tonight, but the next game is crucial.' Wilkins said he hoped to have Hayel available to play against Japan after he missed Friday's match due to dehydration. Hayel experienced dizziness, nausea and vomited during a protracted attempt to submit a urine sample after Monday's 1-0 loss to Iraq in Brisbane. 'He's improved very well indeed ... we got a lot of fluid into him and it looks as though he'll be OK to train tomorrow,' he said.

"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declined to meet with Obama during the UN General Assembly session this week, but spoke with him on the phone Friday . President Barack Obama surprised reporters in the White House press briefing room Friday by saying he had spoken personally with Iranian president Hassan Rouhani about a resolution to his nation's nuclear standoff with the West. The call, a senior White House official said, was initiated when Iranian officials 'reached out' to the White House about a conversation between the two leaders. 'Just now I spoke on the phone with President Rouhani,"" Obama said, adding that he communicated 'my unique respect for the Iranian people.' 'We're mindful of all the challenges ahead,' he told reporters. 'The very fact that this was the first communication between an American and Iranian president since 1979 underscores the deep mistrust between our countries.' 'But,' he added, 'it also indicates the prospect of moving beyond that difficult history. I do believe that there is a basis for a resolution.' Ultimately, Obama said, he sees 'a new opportunity to make progress in Tehran,' and 'believe[s] we can reach a comprehensive solution.' The two men spoke through an interpreter, the White House said, boasting that Obama was able to offer a farewell in Farsi at the end of the call. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit the White House on Monday in what promises to be a tense meeting. In a conference call with reporters, a senior official said the U.S. would 'continue to keep the Israeli government updated on the process of this diplomatic effort,' and conceded that 'the Israeli government has every right to be skeptical of the Iranian government' given past 'inflammatory statements' Tel Aviv has seen coming out of Tehran, including 'threats towards Israel's existence.' The Drudge Report, an influential news clearinghouse website, pointed out after Obama spoke that he had, in the same press event, both announced his negotiation with Tehran over its nuclear program and insisted that he would refuse to negotiate with Republican lawmakers in Congress over a budget deal for the 2014 fiscal year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March in Jerusalem, but relations will be strained by the White House's decision to talk directly with Iran, whose nuclear ambitions Israel sees as a existential threat . Obama spoke minutes after Rouhani posted, and then deleted, a tweet breaking the news that the two had spoken on the phone . Secretary of State John Kerry (L) and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (R) shared laughs during a special meeting of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany on Thursday . The . U.S., Israel and the United Nations have long suspected that Iran was . developing a nuclear weapons system. But Obama insisted that since . Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei has 'issued a fatwa' against . the use of nuclear weapons, America is willing to endorse Iran's right . to use nuclear reactions to produce energy. The senior White House official said that the bulk of the Obama-Rouhani call focused on the nuclear issue, and that the two parties agreed their staffs should 'work expeditiously' to resolve the conflict. The official underscored the 'need to build trust' with Iran, and repeated Obama's call for 'meaningful, transparent, and reliable actions' from Rouhani. Rouhani on Friday referred to the U.S. as a 'great' nation, breaking decades of precedent. He was wrapping up his week-long UN trip and returning to Tehran. 'I want it to be the case that this trip will be a first step, and a beginning for better and constructive relations with countries of the world,' he told reporters, 'as well as a first step for a better relationship between the two great nations of Iran and the United States of America.' Obama, originally expected to address only the budget stalemate in Congress, stunned reporters by leading off with a description of his phone call with the Iranian leader . Rouhani, outwardly less of a hard-liner than his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has said he is willing to work with the U.S. government, but he may just be angling for relaxed economic sanctions . Obama also asked Rouhani about the fate of three Americans: Saeed Abedini (L), Amir Mirzai Hekmati (C) and Robert Levinson (R). Abedini was imprisoned for setting up home-based Christian prayer meetings. Hekmati was sentenced to death for espionage. And Levinson, a former FBI agent, disappeared. 'The environment that has been . created is quite different from the past,' Rouhani said in a markedly . conciliatory tone, praising his foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif . and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry for their historic meeting on . Thursday. As a result, . he said, 'the understanding between our peoples will grow and our . governments will first stop the escalation of tensions, and then defuse . those tensions.' Skeptics, . however, have insisted that Iran is buying time as it completes a . nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel and throw the entire Middle . East into a new level of turmoil. Iran is suffering under the weight of crushing economic sanctions, with only nations like Syria, Russia and North Korea willing to trade and infuse hard currency into the Islamic republic. Any bilateral agreement with America is likely to include the relaxation of those sanctions, providing new economic activity that could equip Iran to double-cross the U.S. and pursue its nuclear-weapons ambitions more quickly. Netanyahu warned the UN last year that Iran was nearing the point of no return beyond which it would be impossible to stop it from arming itself with weapons of mass destruction. House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Ed Royce, a California Republican, warned that Obama shouldn't let up the pressure on Iran. 'Our . damaging sanctions have gotten Rouhani on the phone,' said Royce. 'We . must increase the economic pressure until Iran stops its nuclear drive.' Royce . told Fox News this week that the U.S. should 'double down' on sanctions . in order to avoid repeating mistakes the American government made with . North Korea, which stalled for time while marching its weapons program . forward. Rouhani addressed a high-level meeting on nuclear disarmament during the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, saying that his country sought only the peaceful use of nuclear technology for energy production . Rep. Ed Royce (R) told Fox News this week that the U.S. should 'double down' on sanctions against Iran in order to avoid repeating the mistakes the American government made with North Korea . The senior White House official added that Obama had inquired with Rouhani about the fate of two Americans being held in Iranian prisons, and a third man who has gone missing there. Saeed Abedini faces an eight-year prison sentence in Iran for setting up a network of home-based Christian prayer meetings. Amir Mirzai Hekmati awaits retrial for espionage after his death sentence was overturned in 2012. Both men are dual U.S.-Iranian citizens. Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent, went missing in 2007 on an island off the Iranian coast, while he was investigating cigarette counterfeiting there. Rouhani sent a tweet at 3:35 p.m. Friday – and later deleted it – saying that he had spoken with the U.S. president. Obama was expected to speak at 3:30 p.m., but was delayed for 11 minutes.","Israel's Netanyahu will see Obama on Monday in what promises to be a tense meeting .

"The Eiffel Tower, Tower Bridge, the Sydney Opera House and the Lincoln Memorial - we couldn't imagine our cities without them. But what of the discarded designs that never made it off the drawing board? How different would our skylines have looked? Vincze Miklos from iO9 has unearthed some incredible drawings of great architectural landmarks that failed to get commissioned. A proposal for the Lincoln Memorial by John Russell Pope, 1912. With no classical tradition within the U.S. to draw from, Pope instead looked towards the Greek and Egyptians to create a  pyramid proposal for the Lincoln Memorial . One of the more unusual designs is a drawing put forward by architect John Russell Pope in 1912. With no classical tradition to draw from in the U.S., he instead looked towards the Greek and Egyptians to create a pyramid proposal for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Some historians believe that Pope put forward the zany design because he wasn't a fan of the original site chosen for the Lincoln Memorial. They believe it was his last-ditch effort to discourage decision-makers from using the location by briefly presenting his strange pyramid idea, before strongly pitching ideas for other sites in Washington. Eighteen years earlier, a number of . potential designs for Tower Bridge were published by The Engineer in . 1894 in a book written by J.E. Tuit. A number of potential designs for Tower Bridge were published by The Engineer magazine in 1894 . Among them were three by Joseph Bazalgette. He proposed a series of designs for a very high-level bridge that would have allowed shipping to pass beneath . All three of Bazalgette's designs were rejected as they would have required a huge spiral ramp on the bank of the Thames to allow traffic to flow down at a reasonable slope . The book, which will today set you back between £100-£150, reveals a number of other potential designs as well as building plans for the bridge and images of its construction. Among the designs were three put forward by Sir Joseph Bazalgette, chief commissioner to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the architect of London’s great sewer. All three, however, were rejected because they would have required a huge spiral ramp on the southern bank of the Thames to enable traffic to move down at a reasonable angle. Another design by F.J Palmer had two moveable platforms at either end of the bridge with a roadway in place at all times, even when ships were passing through. Another design by F.J Palmer had two moveable platforms at either end of the bridge with a roadway in place at all times, even when ships were passing through . Not long after the Tower Bridge commission, architects . in London started drawing up plans to rival and outdo the Eiffel Tower. Recently uncovered . documents revealed how an intense competition was held to find a design for . what was to be called the Great Tower of London. The winning entry was to be built in Wembley Park, North West London and was intended to be a centerpiece of a new funfair. However the building of the ambitious . octagonal structure hit a stumbling block as the project ran out of . money after only completing the first floor. These pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue.

The winners received a prize of 500 guineas and according to documents was . 215 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower . These pictures show the amazing designs that were submitted by 68 talented architects that were published in a catalogue. Some look like carbon copies of the Eiffel Tower itself, while others resemble bizarre structures of the future . In 1957, architect Anatol Kagan participated in the competition for the Sydney Opera House, which he prepared during a brief stay in that city. While his entry was unplaced, his drawings were later displayed as part of an exhibition to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the competition. Other designs that were never built include a Masonic temple complex created by Waddy B. Wood in 1922 and a drawing the U.S. Capitol with high dome by William Thornton in 1797.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has been crowned as the best player on the planet for the third time - and he celebrated by clenching his fists and then yelling inaudibly into the microphone. The Real Madrid and Portugal forward claimed the 2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or award at a ceremony in Zurich on Monday evening after he received 37.66 per cent of the vote ahead of Lionel Messi (15.76 per cent) and Manuel Neuer (15.72 per cent). And upon taking the stage and receiving the award from former Arsenal and France legend Thierry Henry, Ronaldo gave a short speech before celebrating by shouting something largely inaudible.

'I want to get better as the days go by. I want to say to all the Portuguese that I never thought I could win this trophy on three different occasions. Of course it is something that is always with me, I want to become one of the greatest players of all time, and this requires a lot so I would like to thank you for all this evening.'

"The Ballon d’Or score moved to Ronaldo 3 Messi 4 on Monday night in Zurich and the good news for football is that with so much playing time potentially still ahead of them the greatest head-to-head in the game’s history might still have years to play out. ‘Don’t bet against it being 5-4 to Ronaldo in a couple of years,’ was the sentiment of one Madrid commentator in this morning’s celebration of their man winning the Ballon d’Or 2014 and it’s easy to see why even non-Madrid supporters might agree that Ronaldo now has everything in his favour to glide past Messi by winning World Player of the year two more times. But to doubt Messi’s ability to bounce back in this two-man tug-o-war for world supremacy is to massively underestimate someone who is still only 27 – in any normal career he would now be entering his prime. Cristiano Ronaldo poses with his Ballon d'Or trophy as he returned to training with Real Madrid on Tuesday .

Ronaldo beat his rival to the award as he was crowned the 2014 Ballon d'Or winner after a stellar 12 months . Barcelona may be in turmoil with elections called 12-months early for the end of the year, a change of coach on the horizon, and a transfer ban to be suffered until 2016 but there were signs of life in their weekend win over Atletico Madrid. The enduring image from the game of Messi celebrating the third goal arm in arm with Neymar and Luis Suarez is another clue as to why it might not be all downhill from here for the Argentine. He rose to prominence in that wonderful triangle of mesmerizing movement and short passes made up of Andres Iniesta and Xavi. The Messi, Suarez, Neymar holy trinity is very different – one compromised of attackers not midfielders but it inspires awe all the same. He can’t complain that he is not in the right company as he attempts to get back on top in Spain. Ronaldo celebrated winning the Ballon d'Or for the second consecutive year with a loud scream . Portuguese magazine Abola says Ronaldo's rallying cry means he is now looking to match Lionel Messi . Ronaldo, we know, will drive on and on until his supreme physique can no longer carry him. He will be 30 next month but seems to only be getting stronger. His agent Jorge Mendes told Spanish radio on Monday night that his star client would play on until he was 40. ‘He will still score 20 goals a season with his head when he is 39, mark my words’ he said. The implication of that statement was that even when he can’t sprint as he does now he will not lose his aerial prowess. Having started his career as a wiry winger and become a wide forward he could easily finish up an out-an-out centre-forward who can no longer create the chances quite so freely, but can still take them. Messi also looks capable of adjusting to suit the passing of time. He has a few more years in him yet as a forward but he has shown at the start of this season and during the last campaign that he also has it in him to become king of the assists and occupy a slightly deeper position in the team. Ronaldo scored a staggering 56 goals in 51 appearances for Real as they won four trophies in 2014 . The 27-year-old (centre) scored 50 goals in 52 appearances for Barcelona last season . Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo . Women's world player of the year: Nadine Kessler . Puskas award: James Rodriguez . World coach of the year for men's football: Joachim Low . World coach of the year for women's football: Ralf Kellermann . World XI: Neuer; Lahm, Ramos, David Luiz, Thiago Silva; Di Maria, Iniesta, Kroos; Messi, Ronaldo, Robben . FIFA presidential award: Hiroshi Kagawa . FIFA fair play award: FIFA volunteers . For now both will keep doing what they have been doing for the last five years. Each player has 252 goals in that time and Ronaldo at least left no-one at Zurich in any doubt that his hunger for more is not about to be lost with phrases such as ‘my best goal is always the next one I’m going to score’ and ‘I am not going to stop I want to reach Messi. I don’t lose sleep over it but it excites me.’ ‘Reaching Messi’ will not just mean winning another Golden Ball but also another European Cup and if he does it this season then he will have gone one better than his rival by becoming one of the first players to win back to back Champions Leagues. Both men will also be pushed on by competition from within their own clubs. In a non-World Cup year Gareth Bale will have a chance to go for major individual honours this season and Ronaldo could be travelling to Zurich with the Welshman next January. Bale already has a better free-kick scoring ratio – one every nine attempts over one every 15 – and it was the former Tottenham forward who stepped into Ronaldo’s shoes last season when injury kept him out of the Copa del Rey final to score the winning goal. There seemed to be a frosty atmosphere between Messi and Ronaldo during Monday's press conference . At Barcelona, Neymar is emerging as Messi’s long-term heir and like Bale he will expect to feature at least in the team of the year at the FIFA gala in 2016. The principle motivation for both remains the same though – being better than Messi and Barcelona for Ronaldo, and being better than Real Madrid and Ronaldo for Messi. The two men were more comfortable in each other’s company this year than in previous ceremonies. They remain worlds apart in terms of temperament and personality. If Messi does lift the FIFA World Player award next year there will be no primal scream celebration and Ronaldo probably won’t be wearing a burgundy tuxedo. But what does seem very likely is that both men will be back on the podium. They have years ahead of them – this duel has only just have begun.","Cristiano Ronaldo won the 2014 Ballon d'Or title on Monday evening .

"England and Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley is likely to learn the outcome of his latest disciplinary hearing before Christmas. Northampton look set to mount a robust defence of their captain after he was sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face at Franklin's Gardens on Saturday. Hartley could miss at least the start of England's RBS 6 Nations campaign following the latest episode in a career scarred by repeated disciplinary episodes. Hartley (right) was adjudged to elbow Leicester's Matt Smith (left) before the pair had to be separated . England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens . Hartley cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue . April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor. March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain. March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test. June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain. December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best. May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing. December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. The Rugby Football Union has yet to confirm when 28-year-old Hartley's hearing will take place but moves are afoot for it to be held on Tuesday evening. Hartley was handed a 26-week ban for eye-gouging in 2007, and an 11-week suspension for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the 2013 Aviva Premiership final against Leicester. That latter ban led to him missing the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, and RFU disciplinary chiefs could easily take a dim view of his latest indiscretion. It happened after just 17 minutes of a titanic Premiership east midlands derby that Northampton won 23-19 thanks to substitute Jamie Elliott's 77th-minute try that fly-half Stephen Myler converted from the touchline. Referee JP Doyle initially seemed happy to award Hartley a yellow card, but television match official Sean Davey urged Doyle to watch further replays, and he responded by sending 61 times-capped Hartley off. England international Luther Burrell attempts to avoid the tackle of Owen Williams on Saturday afternoon . 'It was disappointing,' Northampton rugby director Jim Mallinder said. 'Dylan has got to keep his arms down, but he was being held and I don't know there was any malice in it. 'The nature of the game didn't justify a red card. I think Smith went down pretty easily, to be honest, which was disappointing. 'It is a tough game. That 80 minutes of rugby was hard, physical with some great tackles, but I don't think there was any malice in that. I think JP's initial reaction of the yellow card would have been the correct decision.' Vereniki Goneva touches down his second try during the 23-19 defeat at Northampton on Saturday . England open their Six Nations campaign against Wales in Cardiff on February 6, and given Hartley's poor record - biting and punching offences also appear on his charge-sheet - another lengthy suspension appears likely. 'It's a tough game, and Dylan plays to the edge. You wouldn't change Dylan. He is competitive,' Mallinder added. 'It is a difficult one. I think he should have kept his arms down - we are not saying that what he did was right - but what I am probably saying is that the opposition made it a lot easier, and a yellow card was sufficient.' Northampton replacement Jamie Elliot crosses for the match-winning try three minutes before full-time . Asked for his reaction to the Hartley dismissal, Leicester rugby director Richard Cockerill said: 'If you strike someone in the face you are liable to get yourself in trouble. That's the nature of it. 'You would have thought he might have learnt a lesson by now. That's just the way it is.' Elliot is mobbed his his team-mates as the 14-man Saints celebrate a famous win over their arch-rivals .","Dylan Hartley was sent off for elbowing Matt Smith in the face .

The 34-year Wasps fly half, who was born in Coventry and attended the city’s King Henry VIII school, produced a superb display to collect eight penalties, two conversions and a second-half try that brought him 33 points — one better than the previous best shared by Niall Woods (London Irish, 1998), Dave Walder (Newcastle, 2000) and Tim Stimpson (Leicester, 2002).

Goode broke the London Irish line to claim his touchdown during his side's emphatic 48-16 victory . Goode successfully kicks one of eight penalties on his way to a 33-point haul at the Ricoh Arena . ‘It sounds a bit cheesy but that’s what dreams are made of,’ said Goode, a lifelong Coventry City fan. ‘It couldn’t have gone any better. I didn’t sleep that well last night. ‘I’ve been up here a fair few times to watch Coventry City play but to run out on the field was unbelievable. ‘I got a hammering from my little girl for missing five kicks last week (against Castres). She made me change my boots and everything. 'As I came off the field she was there and she said, “You’re keeping those boots forever, Daddy”.’ There were clear first-half nerves, not least from rookie referee Tom Foley, whose whistle threatened to ruin any hope of a fluid game. Goode took advantage with unerring accuracy, kicking six penalties in the first 40 minutes after Exiles prop Geoff Cross had briefly threatened to spoil Wasps’ party with an opportunist try for the visitors on 16 minutes . Christian Wade bursts free before setting up Wasps scrum half Joe Simpson to score . Simpson is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring one of Wasps' four tries against the Exiles . Wasps pulled away in spectacular fashion in the second half with Joe Simpson’s try opening the floodgates before London Irish hooker David Paice was sinbinned. Wasps took full advantage with three tries to seal an all-important bonus point. Goode, Elliot Daly and Andrea Masi all crossed as Wasps moved above Quins and Leicester into sixth in the Aviva Premiership table. Just as importantly, the club which so nearly went bankrupt last season finally appears to have found a home. Wasps full back Andrea Masi crashes over his side's final try during the rout of London Irish . Players from both teams receive a warm welcome ahead of Wasps' first game at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry . High Wycombe’s Adams Park felt a long way away in every sense by the time Foley blew his final whistle. The only concern was the worrying manner in which the pitch cut up during the course of the afternoon. No doubt fans of Coventry City will be keeping a close eye on that situation. ‘It was a big occasion for everybody but I’d have taken that before the game,’ said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young. ‘There was some emotion about beforehand. But the bonus point was the icing on the cake.’","Andy Goode scored 33 points in Wasps' 48-16 win against London Irish .

"We are having the wrong debate! All the talk is about Alastair Cook and the England captaincy when what we should be urgently discussing is the England coaching job. The role and responsibility of Peter Moores needs to be massively increased while the role and identity of the England cricket captain is a lesser issue. English cricket traditionally lionises the captain and makes him central to everything — WG Grace, Jardine, Hutton, May, Illingworth, Brearley, Gower, Atherton, Hussain, Vaughan, Strauss, Cook. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alastair Cook: I'm desperate to carry on as England captain . Ease the pressure: Sir Clive Woodward believes all the pressure should be on Peter Moores rather than Alastair Cook . Resilience: Alastair Cook says he will go down fighting against India . Last chance saloon: Cook knows his side can't afford to lose the third Test in Southampton . The fabled role of the captaincy is a cornerstone of cricketing tradition but just recently the landscape has changed radically and has created overwhelming pitfalls for the captain. He should not be the totemic figure any more, that must be the head coach. The media scrutiny is infinitely bigger than ever before and that is a problem. I can’t imagine what it must be like to have every ball and every single decision you make in the course of five days, across a five-Test series minutely scrutinised by Michael Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Ian Botham, Shane Warne, Andrew Strauss, Michael Holding, David Gower, David Lloyd, Bob Willis, Michael Vaughan, Graeme Swann and Geoffrey Boycott to list just the first dozen Sky and BBC TMS pundits that come to mind. And that’s before you take into account the minute-by-minute blogging and tweeting. The majority of those concerned were captains, some more successful than others, and will argue they had to cope with similar pressures. But they did not, not to this extent. This is way off the scale. An England cricket captain can now find himself pinned up against the wall for five days — there is no escape, and no right of reply. You can’t get involved in arguments with media pundits mid-Test. The result for the England captain can almost be paralysis by analysis when things aren’t going well. It’s an unprecedented, unrelenting, barrage of expert opinion. How can one man out in the middle, under the cosh, compete against that brains trust? How can it not affect him and wear him down? The biggest problem of all, however, is how the England captain still seems to be central to everything when the man in charge must be the coach. The captain should have no role in the composition of a team or squad. Preparation: England practiced at the Ageas Bowl ahead of the crucial third Test against India . Netting: England captain Cook is without a century since May 2013 against New Zealand . Such a system can only be compromised by his relationship with other players. Nor should there be selectors either, that system is archaic. Selection must be totally down to the coach. Why on earth did Cook become involved in the Kevin Pietersen sacking and exile? It should have nothing to do with him. When I was the England rugby coach I would consult trusted lieutenants such as Andy Robinson and Phil Larder but I alone always picked the team and squads. The captain wasn’t consulted although I did sit down with my captains AFTER I had made my decision but before the side was announced. I would explain my thinking and we would have a good ‘grown-up’ discussion about the team. I would never risk Martin Johnson’s performance by opening him up to the complications which arise  in the selection process. The England cricket coach must start taking total ownership of the team. In a five-day Test he will, almost by definition, spend 50 per cent of that time in the England dressing room talking to the players. He has great potential to influence tactics in every conceivable way — batting orders, bowling rotations, field settings — and generally lift the mood or dampen euphoria if huge. It is his team, yet the captain takes all the heat. I’m looking for Peter Moores to step up. He is in charge and when the going gets rough the pressure should come on the coach, not the captain. During the actual course of a Test the first port of call for all the main media interviews every day must be the coach. Whenever Chelsea play the first voice is always Jose Mourinho. He is not out there on the pitch but he is definitely in charge and is happy to be held to account. The ECB should downgrade the captaincy. There is so much information now available, how can he process all that and still perform with the bat? It’s not quite like football where there is that mentality that you could throw the armband to almost anybody. The role of England cricket captain will always carry greater weight, but it doesn’t need to be so central to a team’s ability to perform. It’s more a hand on the tiller. Glove work: Jos Buttler prepares for his Test debut as he comes in for Matt Prior . Drill: England bowler Stuart Broad dives as he practices his fielding while Cook watches on . Many will read this and say ‘it is what it is’, and look at other Test captains and Test teams who are doing just fine. Indeed, MS Dhoni, India’s captain is a prime example. Having watched cricket first hand in India I can tell you he is under huge pressure from fans at home and I greatly admire how he leads his team. But that’s no argument for continuing in the same way, in fact it’s the opposite. In Cook we have an outstanding cricketer who I believe can be a great leader. We should be asking why this is happening, and then move heaven and earth to remedy the situation; not simply to dismiss one of our great players and pass the baton on to another who will inevitably become worn down by the same pitfalls.","Role and responsibility of head coach Peter Moores should be increased .
Too much pressure and expectancy placed on captain in modern cricket .
Captain should have no role in team composition or selection .
Moores should be taking far more of the media burden off Alastair Cook ."
"Scientists have revealed new insight into the evolution of flight by carrying out a series of wind tunnel experiments based on dinosaur fossils. After new fossil discoveries sparked debate over the evolution of birds and their abilities to fly, the history of feathered dinosaurs and their flying functions became less clear. But a group of researchers at the University of Southampton believe they have put an end to speculation by examining the flight performance of the early Microraptor. Scroll down for video . To figure out how exactly Microraptor might have flown, a team of scientists from the University of Southampton in the UK designed an anatomically accurate model and tested its abilities for stability and speed in a wind tunnel . The species of dinosaur reveals another stage in the evolution of bird flight aside from the five-winged theropod . The scientists at the University of Southampton designed the model and conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to achieve the fascinating results . The first dinosaur described with feathers on its arms legs and tail lived around 140million years ago and had five potential lifting surfaces. But the Microraptor implies the evolution of bird flight passed through a four-wing phase, representing an important stage in the evolution of gliding and flapping. The scientists performed a series of wind tunnel experiments and flight simulations with winds of 45mph, using a full-scale representation of the dinosaur with surprising results. The experiments showed the Microraptor would have  been most stable gliding when generating large amounts of lift with its wings. The wind tunnel demonstrated this had certain advantages as the high lift coefficient allows for slow glides, which can be achieved with less height loss. The early Cretaceous dinosaur was a paravian--a classification of dinosaurs that were closer to birds than species like the T. Rex . Dr Gareth Dyke and colleague Dr Roeland de Kat adjusted the Microraptor's wing and tail position to see the effect it had on stability . Fossils revealed the Mircroraptor had feathers on its arms, legs and tail as well as wings leading to debate over the evolution of bird flight . For gliding down from low elevations, such as trees, this slow, and aerodynamically less efficient flight was the gliding strategy that results in minimal height loss and longest glide distance. The results prove debate surrounding the position and orienatation of the dinosaur's legs and wind shape is irrelevant, as these variables made very little difference to the Microraptor's flight. Gareth Dyke, a senior lecturer in vertebrate palaeontology at the university and co-author of the study, said: 'Significant to the evolution of flight, we show that Microraptor did not require a sophisticated, 'modern' wing morphology to undertake effective glides, as the high-lift coefficient regime is less dependent upon detail of wing morphology. A representation shows two multicolored Microraptors in flight over wet land in prehistoric times . The University of Southampton's recreation of the dinosaur reveals its feather wings and paddle-like tail . 'This is consistent with the fossil record, and also with the hypothesis that symmetric 'flight' feathers first evolved in dinosaurs for non-aerodynamic functions, later being adapted to form aerodynamically capable surfaces.' His co-author, Roeland de Kat, said: 'What interests me is that aerodynamic efficiency is not the dominant factor in determining Microraptor's glide efficiency. 'However, it needs a combination of a high lift coefficient and aerodynamic efficiency to perform at its best.' The study - Aerodynamic performance of the feathered dinosaur Microraptor and the evolution of feathered flight - is published in the latest issue of Nature Communications.","Researchers at the University of Southampton spent a month constructing a life-sized Microraptor .

"If ever a game had it all, this was it. Northampton Saints produced one of the greatest backs-to-the-wall performances ever witnessed in the Aviva Premiership, shrugging off the red card shown to their serial miscreant Dylan Hartley to somehow secure an epic victory in a seething East Midlands derby. Hartley’s moment of madness will attract plenty of attention — and rightly so. But anyone present at this game will remember one of the most committed, brave and high-quality displays of recent times by 14-man Saints. In what was unquestionably the finest game of the season so far, Northampton centre Luther Burrell still managed to deliver a performance that stood out from the crowd. VIDEO Scroll down to see Dylan Hartley meeting his inspirational childhood coach . England international Dylan Hartley seems perplexed at why he has been sent off at Franklin's Gardens . April 2007: Banned for 26 weeks after gouging Wasps’ James Haskell and Jonny O’Connor. March 2010: Claims of gouging versus Scotland dropped when alleged victim, Ross Ford, chose not to complain. March 2012: Banned for eight weeks for biting Ireland flanker Stephen Ferris during Six Nations Test. June 2012: Sin-binned against South Africa in first game as England captain. December 2012: Given a two-week ban for striking Ulster’s Rory Best. May 2013: Eleven-week ban after being sent off for swearing. December 2014: Sent off for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. A fractured hand sustained against the Ospreys robbed the 17 stone centre of a chance to impress for England in the autumn. But on this evidence, Stuart Lancaster can already pen Burrell’s name on his team-sheet to face Wales on February 6. He was that good. Hartley was sent to the stands by referee JP Doyle for a reckless elbow to the face of Leicester centre Matt Smith. But Burrell and his team-mates rolled their sleeves up to deliver one of the great Franklins’ Gardens wins. Replacement Jamie Elliott scored the 77th-minute winning try that will etch his name into Northampton folklore after Vereniki Goneva looked to have won the game for the visitors five minutes earlier. But there were heroes all over the field for director of rugby Jim Mallinder’s team, with Burrell and lock Christian Day to the fore. Hartley (right) was adjudged to elbow Leicester's Matt Smith (left) before the pair had to be separated . Spare a thought for Saints centre Tom Stephenson, who was replaced 16 minutes into the game following Hartley’s latest disciplinary meltdown. Even he will surely have toasted this remarkable win last night. ‘We said at half time we’ll do this for Dylan and we’ll do this for Stevo,’ said man-of-the-match Burrell. ‘That’s what it means to play for this club. It doesn’t get much better than that in a local derby.’ The tone was set before Hartley was sent off for the second time in his career amid an atmosphere unrivalled in English club rugby. Hartley cuts a dejected figure trudging off the pitch after his sending off as his disciplinary woes continue . Last year, Saints prop Salesi Ma’afu was sent off for punching Leicester hooker Tom Youngs. The pair exchanging digs from minute one yesterday. But Hartley, who was last night facing the fifth ban of his career, left his side facing over an hour without their leader. Luckily for him his troops raised their game in epic fashion in a match which saw the lead change hands six times. Goneva’s try — created by a stunning, weaving run from replacement wing Miles Benjamin — looked to have sealed victory for coach Richard Cockerill’s side as Freddie Burns converted to make the score 19-16 with less than 10 minutes left. But, after turning down a kickable penalty which would have drawn the scores level, Northampton claimed a line-out and Burrell charged up the middle to set up a platform which led to Stephen Myler putting Elliott in for the vital score. Vereniki Goneva touches down his second try during the 23-19 defeat at Northampton on Saturday . ‘Fitness is one thing we pride ourselves on,’ said Burrell. ‘Our conditioning staff are fantastic. We like to play a high-tempo game. ‘We knew going down to 14 players was going to be tough. It takes a lot to come from a try down. What an amazing feeling.’ While Burrell was sensational, Hartley’s replacement Mike Haywood was almost his equal. Day also carried the ball impressively, while Myler controlled the game superbly from stand off. He was, however, inexplicably allowed back onto the field after appearing to be knocked senseless in the lead-up to Ben Foden’s second-half try. Ben Foden of Northampton plays the ball out of the ruck as the Saints prevailed 23-19 winners . Leicester, who lost Tom Croft to the sin bin for a high tackle on Ken Pisi just before half time, will be distraught to have lost a game they really should have closed out in Hartley’s absence. But they lacked ballast in the midfield and, a superb scrummaging performance apart, their forwards lacked bite. When Northampton used width, the visitors defence was all at sea. Both sides scored three tries, with Leicester’s coming through a brace from Goneva and a 21st-minute penalty try, while Alex Waller, Foden and Elliott touched down for Saints. England international Luther Burrell attempts to avoid the tackle of Owen Williams on Saturday afternoon . Mallinder said: ‘It was a tremendous, spirited performance with a lot of good technical and tactical work which was so pleasing.’ This match really did have it all.","Northampton captain sent off for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith .

"Former Russian spy Anna Chapman is launching her own fashion brand, it was revealed yesterday. The 31 year old redhead - once married to a British man - launched her line of 'casual clothes' at a show in the Turkish resort of Antalya. Moscow's most glamorous secret agent hired talented young designers from Russian fashion colleges, said a spokesman for Fondservisbank, her main employer. Fashionable: The range includes dresses and women's handbags that are said to resemble books by famous radically-minded Russian writers . Launched at the Dosso Dossi Fashion show 2014, she wanted to produce clothes 'you could wear anywhere, from a big city to a backwater village', it was reported. 'Reporters and fashion magazines' buyers from all over the world will have a chance to see the first women's clothing collection by Anna Chapman,' said the spokesman. Her fashion range includes women's handbags resembling books by famous radically-minded Russian writers, it is understood. One is a mock-up of the book 'Who is to Blame?' by Alexander Herzen, a 19th century writer and thinker known as the father of Russian socialism. Variety: Anna Chapman (left) said she designed the clothes so they could be worn in a city or village . Designs: The former secret agent's interest in a clothes brand began three years ago . Another is modelled on Nikolay Nekrasov's 'Who can be Happy and Free in Russia?'. A third features revolutionary democrat Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 'What is to be Done?' The brand will be called Anna Chapman - the surname she took when she wed British former public schoolboy Alex Chapman who she met on a trip to London. The daughter of an alleged KGB officer, the flame haired agent was busted by New York police in 2010 on accusations of being part of a network of sleeper agents. She was deported in a Cold War-style spy swap along with nine others, and was then greeted by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin who took part in a patriotic sing-song with her. Since her return to Russia, Chapman has dabbled in politics, taken part in risque photoshoots for men's magazines, and hosts  a TV show about the mysteries of the world. Inspiration: A spokesman for the company said she wanted a Russian dress that would 'please her soul' Her interest in a clothes brand 'all began three years and three months ago when Anna returned to Motherland after jail in a prison shirt,' said a statement. 'She disliked these alien clothes and Anna went on  to search for a Russian dress that would please her soul. She kept looking for it but did not find' She was previously reported to be interested in designing new uniforms for Russian cosmonauts, though the project failed to materialise. In July she hit the headlines with a Twitter proposal to wed  American whistleblower Edward Snowden, who was at the time stranded in a Moscow airport. The femme fatale walked out of an  interview on US television when she was questioned about the proposal. 'I'm not going to discuss this,' she told  NBC's Richard Engel. 'OK, the interview is finished. I'm sorry.' She explained: 'I'm a very private, discreet person and I still don't do many interviews because I just don't like to share. 'I don't believe that people would be interested in knowing about somebody's life.' By . Misty White Sidell . Opinion: The designs are 'unimaginative and poorly constructed' While the concept of a spy-created fashion label is intriguing, Anna Chapman’s designs are unimaginative and poorly constructed. In the three photos provided to MailOnline, Ms Chapman’s work displays serious execution issues including rippled hemlines and skewed seams. If Ms Chapman wanted to impress with a novelty clothing line worth looking at, she would have created the kinds of sharply tailored separates that viewers of shows like Homeland and Scandal have come to associate with fashionable spies. Our fascination with fictitious, beautiful spies would have provided Ms Chapman with a vast demographic to sell her goods. But instead she has created conservative cotton-candy dresses that look like Disney Princess Halloween costumes – for the bible-toting set. A long, blue A-line dress – worn on a blonde model posing in an antiquated library – looks like a less magical version the dress Aurora wears to prick her finger in Sleeping Beauty. Its improperly-fitted bodice and twisted hem highlight the design’s likely cheap, synthetic fabric. Adding to the fairytale attempt is a book clutch design that mimics the signature miniaudieres of French label Olympia le Tan. But Ms Chapman’s book clutch does not boast the same handcrafted intelligence as the Olympia le Tan originals she tries to emulate. It’s brown velvet cover and machine-processed embroidery negates the concept’s overall charm.","The 31-year-old introduced her range of 'casual clothes' at a show in Turkey .

"Liverpool and Manchester United target Martin Odegaard has been training with Bayern Munich. The Stromsgodset midfielder, who turns 16 on Wednesday, spent two days at Liverpool last week and trained with the first team but has been to Munich this week and is also due to visit Dutch side Ajax. The 15-year-old, the youngest player ever to represent his country, spent last week at Liverpool – the latest in a string of giants to fight for his signature. 15-year-old wonderkid Martin Odegaard has been training with German champions Bayern Munich . Celtic boss Ronny Deila revealed last week that he still hasn't given up hope of luring his former prodigy from Stromsgodset – despite the 15-year-old Norwegian midfielder being the most wanted youngster in Europe. ‘He is a very good player but we have to stand in line - there are 20 clubs, maybe more, who want him,’ Deila said. ‘He has been to clubs all over Europe; to Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich Dortmund and Liverpool. PSG wanted him but he hasn’t had time to visit so there is some hard competition. ‘I have control over that situation, I know what is happening there. This is more about his choices. What is his thinking now? Is it go to a big club and try to break in there? Or go to a smaller club in not such a good league but (where) it easier to get into the first-team? ‘I think it is up to Martin. If he chooses Real Madrid, it would be what they want to pay. If he chooses Celtic, then there are different prices. He has one year left on his contract and I think it’s important Stromsgodset get money back for him.’ Celtic boss Deila (right) gave Odegaard his debut at Stromsgodset before leaving for the Scottish giants . Deila says Celtic have not made their interest in Odegaard known officially to Stromsgodset but believes his contacts in Drammen will keep him informed of any developments. ‘I haven’t (made Celtic’s interest clear),’ he added. ‘But I have control over the situation. ‘I know what’s happening. He’s in the town where my kids live and I know a lot of people there. ‘We’ll see. If there are possibilities, of course, we will try it. But it’s a very hard competition.’ At 15, the teenage sensation is the youngest player ever to represent Norway . With five loan signings on Celtic’s books just now, Deila has not discounted the possibility of attempting to bring Odegaard to Glasgow for a season were he to head for the continent. ‘You never know, but we want to have players that we want to get something for if we develop them,’ he said. ‘You can’t have too many players from other clubs. We need to have players who we can earn money on or who can stay at our club.’ Asked if Odegaard was good enough at the moment to play for Celtic, Deila replied: ‘It’s very hard to say. He’s only 15 years old and will be 16 this month, but he is very special and every time he gets to a new level, he takes his chance. His attitude is great - he always wants to learn and he listens to everything you say, He’s special.’","Martin Odegaard has been training with Bayern Munich .

"Shotgun Paddy’s connections are praying for better luck on Saturday when the gelding defends his title in the Betfred Classic Chase. The eight-year-old, a six-length winner of the Warwick marathon 12 months ago, was strongly fancied for the Coral Welsh National but, after jumping away on terms first time in what was judged a false start, he missed the kick second time round prior to making an early error which left him detached. Jockey Leighton Aspell pulled up on the first circuit ensuring he is fresh and ready for a repeat bid on Saturday.

"Traditionally thought of as continental delicacy particular to France, it seems snails are crawling their way across the channel. According to food industry sources, Britons are demanding mollusc meat in ever increasing quantities - and British suppliers are struggling to keep up. Aylesbury Escargot in Buckinghamshire, owned by husband and wife team Sophie and Mike Wharton, have expanded from indoor boxes to a 1,000 square metre field so they can increase supplies by as much as three times to meet demand, with the farm now housing around half a million snails. Sophie Wharton at the Aylesbury Escargot farm she owns and runs with her husband Mike . The new 'free range' fields will increase the snail harvest of the farm by up to three times to meet the growing UK demand . The farm has around half a million snails on it in both the indoor and outdoor pens . The family-run farm supplies both snails and ‘snail caviar’ (the snail’s eggs) to restaurants, brasseries, and retail - not forgetting individual customers for private consumption. Though the traditional French way to serve escargot is to place them back into their shells after cooking, often marinating them in butter, garlic and parsley, English chefs are increasingly exploring the diversity of the humble snail in modern dishes. Aylesbury Escargot owner Sophie says the increased demand is due to people being more adventurous and more aware of their diet and what they eat. ‘People are buying tinned snails from abroad because British suppliers just aren’t meeting demands. Snails breeding: The farm allows the snails to breed naturally by just placing them together . The farm is run by Sophie and her husband Mike (left) but their grand-daughter sometimes helps out with the harvest (right) ‘Snail is a low fat, high protein meat,’ she says, ‘people nowadays are much more focused on their diet and eating healthily. ‘They are also much more aware of how their food is produced and where it comes from. ‘The new outside breeding area allows the snails to thrive as they are in their natural habitat. ‘Our breeding methods are efficient and very sustainable and we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of care from hatch to harvest, keeping us at the forefront of fresh produce supply.’ The farm breeds Aspersa snails, which look very much like a garden snail. From eggs they are closely monitored until they morph into a tiny snail, at which point they are called hatchlings, taking a further four months to reach maturity. As well as three indoor breeding buildings, all of which are temperature and humidity controlled to suit the snails, the free range farm now runs from May to October, and will produce a harvest big enough to meet demand until the next harvest. Snail caviar or 'Escargot Pearls' are the eggs snail lay and bury in the soil and are said to have a 'ferny' salty taste . Sophie cleans and prepares the eggs (left) which are sold in 75 gram jars, costing £90 (right) The free range snails have a daily ‘shower’ via a sprinkler system and enjoy biscuits as well as their natural leafy food. From hatch to harvest is approximately 16 weeks at the farm. As snails are nocturnal and sleep during the day, harvesting them is relatively easy as they can simply be picked up. The snails are then purged to enable them to clear their digestive system - fed only water for three days - and hibernated prior to going out on order. As for the snail caviar' Sophie says: ‘We have named them 'Escargot Pearls',  as they have a pearl-like appearance. ‘You couldn’t compare them to sturgeon caviar as they are not at all fishy in flavour. ‘They have a slightly earthy, ferny taste and are fairly salty. ‘They are luxurious and add a glossy finish to a variety of dishes and also create a great talking point amongst diners,’ Sophie admits. Sophie is one of the few producers of fresh snail caviar in Europe and like all caviar it is a tedious process to produce and to harvest and process just a few grams is a labour of love. The Escargot Pearls are supplied in 75 gram jars, and are described as ‘a luxury item with a price tag to match',  costing £90 a jar. The snails themselves are gently braised by Sophie before sale, and alongside the Pearls, can be bought from their website, or at Fortnum & Mason.

Spoon small dots of the batter into a medium-hot frying pan with a tiny bit of oil, cook until golden on both sides. Mix salad ingredients (apart from pearls) together and spoon a generous helping onto a blini. Top with a few pearls. Most land snails are hermaphrodites with a full set of reproductive organs of both sexes, meaning they can all mate with any snail, and are prolific breeders. Each fertilisation usually results in a brood of about 100 eggs which are buried in the topsoil, and will hatch, if not harvested, after 2-4 weeks. Aylesbury Escargot owners Sophie and her husband Mike collect the eggs from the soil and carefully clean them. Sophie uses a fine-tipped paintbrush and magnifier to select the best ones, then cures them so they can be eaten raw. The white luminous eggs range in diameter from 3-6mm and are sold in 75 gram jars, for £90. These tiny eggs, which have a mineral . finish can be marinated in herbs - the have a delicate taste. In the . past they have been known as Pearls of Aphrodite' for their supposed aphrodisiac quality.

"The issue of small fields rears its ugly head again with Saturday's Grade One Tolworth Hurdle attracting just four runners. Thankfully, there are a couple of decent handicaps on the Sandown card for punters to attack and WILLIAM’S WISHES (Sandown, 1.50) could be the answer to the 32RedSport.com Handicap Chase. The 10-year-old defends his crown on Saturday having landed the last running of this event two years ago and his two runs this season have indicated he is being primed for a repeat bid. Sandown plays host to the Grade One Tolworth Hurdle on Saturday afternoon for William's Wishes . A tidy comeback behind The New One over hurdles precluded a very fair performance in the Tingle Creek Chase which saw the selection beaten just 14 lengths by Dodging Bullets. While it is dangerous to take that run too literally, it did at least confirm William’s Wishes is in excellent heart and his last two runs in handicaps resulted in two decisive victories, including in this race in 2013. There looks a good chance of a decent gallop, too, with the likes of Mr Mole and Dance Floor King in opposition and that should aid a horse who traditionally travels strongly. The likeable L’Ami Serge is likely to be a fairly short-priced conveyance for the Tolworth following a couple of facile victories. However, there could be some margin in supporting JOLLY’S CRACKED IT (Sandown, 2.25), who has impressed in both his starts this term and may offer a better-value wager. Any overnight rain — there is eight to 10 millimetres forecast — would play to the strengths of Harry Fry’s charge who hails from a yard in rampant form. Jolly’s Cracked It clearly loves racing right-handed too and, but for a sloppy leap at the final two flights at Ascot last time, would have won considerably more easily. Connections have had this race in mind for some time, while it appears an after-thought for the favourite and only other serious rival Shelford, who bids to give trainer Harry Skelton his first Grade One winner. Grade One Tolworth Hurdle winner last year, William's Wishes, leaps a hurdle at Haydock in November 2014 . There is some excellent fare on the all-weather and JACK OF DIAMONDS (Lingfield, nap, 1.25) could trump his rivals in the mile handicap. A narrow defeat of the talented Razor Wind over course and distance reads well in the context of today’s event and Malaysian Boleh, who was back in eighth, was only narrowly touched off on Wednesday at a big price. The stop-start nature of a four-runner conditions race didn’t suit last time and Jack Of Diamonds should go well back in a handicap on Saturday. CASTILO DEL DIABLO (Lingfield, nb, 2.00) was another undone by a sluggish gallop last time and appears a fair bet to go a couple better with some front-runners in opposition Saturday afternoon.","William's Wishes will defend his crown at Sandown on Saturday .

"The daughter of the first American soldier killed in the war in Afghanistan has shared her heartbreak at learning that his killer - a Taliban leader - was freed by the U.S in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl. Alison Spann was just nine when her father, CIA operative Johnny Micheal Spann, was killed during a prisoner uprising at a compound where he was interrogating Taliban fighters on November 25, 2001. Mullah Mohammad Fazl, the leader of the prisoners at the compound, ended up in Guantanamo Bay - until two weeks ago when he and four others were switched for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'My initial reaction was shock,' Spann told Fox. 'I was . shocked that our president would release five of the most high-risk . prisoners being held in Guantanamo in exchange for one American. Missed: Alison Spann, pictured left with her father, Johnny Michael Spann, and right, said she was shocked when she learned that the U.S. had released the Taliban leader responsible for his 2001 death . 'As a whole, my family was extremely upset and . saddened that our government would do something like this, especially in . light of the fact that it seems that people in the intelligence . community are fairly united in their belief that these terrorists are . likely to seek to further harm Americans in the future.' She said she still cannot understand why the county that her father fought for would release the man responsible for his death. 'I do not believe that it was the right move by the administration,' she added. 'You cannot release someone of such a . high caliber within the Taliban community and expect him to suddenly . emerge as a peaceful being.' Her father, who had served in the Marines for eight years before he joined the CIA, was 32 when he died at the Qala-i-Jangi . compound near Mazari Sharit in northern Afghanistan early in the war. Leader: Mullah Mohammad Fazl, left, was the leader of the prisoners during the uprising that killer Spann, right . Deal: The Taliban leader was released in exchange for U.S Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, two weeks ago . Before he . left, he had told his daughter: 'You know people want to kill us and . they're trying to kill us.

National Cemetery, where then-CIA Director George Tenet said he had . given up his life trying to build a 'better, safer world'. Alison Spann . 'To that place of danger and terror, . he sought to bring justice and freedom,' Tenet said. 'For Mike . understood that it is not enough simply to dream of a better, safer . world. He understood that it has to be built – with passion and . dedication, in the face of obstacles, in the face of evil.' Fazl had been deputy defense . minister and commander of all Taliban troops in the northern Afghanistan . region at the time of the September 11 attacks and he had also been accused of personally supervising the . murders of thousands of Shiite and Tajik Sunni Muslims, Fox reported. More than 2,300 Americans have died in Afghanistan since Spann's death. Bergdahl . returned to the U.S on Friday after his release from five years in . captivity in Afghanistan in the controversial prisoner swap with the . Taliban. Daughter: Alison, a recent college graduate, said her whole family was upset by the government's decision . Loved: Alison and her siblings, Emily and Jake, visit his grave at Arlington Cemetery. Jake was just six months old when his father was killed during a prisoner uprising in a compound in Northern Afghanistan .

The Idaho native was captured in Afghanistan in June 2009 and released by the Taliban on May 31 in a deal struck by the Obama administration in which five senior Taliban officials were released from detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

"A recent review of studies has found bikini waxing could be linked to an increased risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection . For thousands of women across the globe a bikini wax is part of their regular beauty regime. But experts say the procedure should come with a health warning. A recent review of studies, which appeared in the journal of JAMA Dermatology, found waxing could be linked to an increased risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The findings show the action of removing pubic hair can cause 'deficits in the mucocutaneous barrier' - the membrane of the skin - allowing viruses or bacteria to enter the body. Sexually promiscuity is found to be linked to pubic hair removal, another reason given for the increased risk of developing an STI. The study states: 'Pubic hair grooming is becoming an increasingly common practice among women of all societies and demographic groups. 'In the United States, women are more likely to groom for reasons that are sexually driven and are more likely to stop grooming when lacking a current sexual partner. 'Further, pubic hair removal is significantly associated with a greater interest in sex and having a casual sex partner.' Although generally deemed to be a safe beauty procedure, waxing can cause micro-trauma to the skin and its underlying structures. That in turn can cause folliculitis - an infection of the hair follicles - local spread of infection, burns and the development of syringoma - benign tumours. Bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be among the infections people are at risk of contracting. They can be transmitted via contaminated waxing tools or from the person performing the procedure, the review highlighted. The researchers reported: 'Pubic hair waxing can also cause burns, with most being superficial or partial-thickness burns. The report, published in the journal JAMA Dermatology, found waxing can cause microtrauma to the skin's surface allowing viruses and infections to pass into the body. Experts say sexual promiscuity could be to blame, as more women remove their pubic hair when they are sexually active . 'Severe burns requiring debridement and split skin grafting have been described follwing the use of self-waxing kits. 'Waxing causes deficits in the mucocutaneous barrier that may be sufficient for viral entry and transmission, potentially increasing the risk of aquiring sexually tranmitted infections (STIs). 'One study demonstrated a correlation between sexually transmitted molluscum contagiosum and the use of pubic hair removal practices.' Experts said due to the popularity of waxing, beauty practitioners should be made aware of the potential dermatological complications. 'While it has been shown that pubic hair waxing directly correlates with increased sexual prevalence, more studies are necessary to further elucidate the risk of STI transmission after waxing,' the report states. 'Individuals who wax their pubic hair should be informed of this possible risk and perhaps be advised to abstain from sexual activity for a certain period of time after waxing.' The human papilloma virus (HPV), pictured, is among the most common STIs, with most sexually active people contracting it at some point in their lives . Previous studies have found that bikini waxing, rather than increase the risk of STIs, can help prevent specific infections. Doctors say hair removal could be helping to eradicate public lice. Waning infestations of the bloodsucking insects have been linked to a rise in the prevalence of waxing. Australian scientists noted that Sydney's main sexual health clinic had not seen a woman with pubic lice since 2008, and male cases had fallen 80 per cent from about 100 a decade ago. Basil Donovan, head of sexual health at the University of New South Wales's Kirby Institute, said last year: 'it used to be extremely common, it's now rarely seen. 'Without doubt, it's better grooming.'","A review of studies found hair removal causes microtrauma of the skin .

"Saracens responded to Harlequins’ verbal jabs with a knockout victory at The Stoop orchestrated by Charlie Hodgson. Quins England duo Mike Brown and Joe Marler had taunted their opponents in the build-up to the London derby but their sabre rattling counted for nothing as they were easily outmuscled on their home patch. And after a three-try mauling, it is Saracens who can continue to claim to be the capital’s top club, having won 11 of the last 12 meetings between the rivals. As an early-season test, one that leaves their title credentials looking seriously weak.

Charlie Hodgson orchestrated the 39-0 win for Saracens over London rivals Harlequins on Friday night . Charlie Hodgson is congratulated by by Saracens team-mates after scoring the opening try of the match . What had the makings of an explosive contest started with some scrappy exchanges. England backs coach Andy Farrell was watching and he would have been unimpressed when Chris Robshaw clumsily knocked on shortly after kick-off. Then Brown was beaten to a high ball inside his own 22 and — in spite of a bone crunching tackle from Kyle Sinckler on Chris Ashton — Quins were coming off second best in most contests. Marler and his pack struggled to make themselves felt in the scrum, while Saracens’ England contingent, particularly full back Alex Goode, all thrived off front-foot ball. Hodgson slotted an 11th-minute penalty and Saracens almost grabbed the opening try nine minutes later, only to be denied by a remarkable tackle from Brown. Duncan Taylor had the line at his mercy, but the Quins full-back intervened to spectacularly dislodge the ball from under the centre’s arm. Owen Farrell was once again on the Saracens bench but former England fly-half Hodgson, 33, continued to show why he has been entrusted with the starting jersey with another penalty to double the advantage. Richard Wigglesworth breaks free with the ball during the London derby between Harlequins and Saracens . Harlequins suffered their third biggest-ever margin in defeat when they lost 39-0 to London rivals Saracens . He then charged down a clearance kick from Nick Evans to finish under the posts, before adding a third penalty to put Saracens 16-0 up at half time. Hodgson was shown a yellow card for a deliberate knock-on early in the second half but Ben Botica was unable to capitalise, striking the resulting penalty against the post. Quins were unable to make use of their one-man advantage and instead, with Hodgson still in the sin-bin, Sarries extended their lead with a penalty from Goode. The pre-match spice resurfaced when Saracens skipper Alistair Hargreaves was shown a yellow card after a mass outbreak of handbags and he was joined shortly after by Quins replacement prop Rob Buchanan. Hodgson added two more penalties either side of Buchanan’s yellow card, Ashton touched down in the 70th minute and Will Fraser went over to complete the rout.

"The largest rocket in America launched a spy satellite Wednesday from California. Taking off from Vandenburg Air Force Base, the Delta IV-Heavy rocket lifted off just after 2pm Wednesday afternoon. The highly secretive payload, known as NROL-65, is believed to be the most advanced spy satellite ever launched. It is not known what intelligence will be gathered by the latest addition to the US spy network.‘Today's launch is dedicated to the men and women who serve for our nation's freedom,’ said a commentator early in the launch. See video of the launch below . Liftoff: An unmanned Delta 4 Heavy rocket, the largest booster in in the U.S. fleet, carries the NROL-65 into orbit . The giant rocket is built by ULA, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, according to the contractor’s site. It stands 235-feet-tall and generates two million pounds of thrust, according to ULA. The largest and by far most powerful rocket in America, it was first built in 2004, said the contractor in a statement. The massive hydrogen-fueled engines provided 17million horsepower each and took less than three minutes to consume half their weight in fuel, according to the LA Times and a ULA webcast of the launch. The largest in America: The Delta IV stands 235 feet tall and generates 2million pounds of thrust . Top secret: The NROL-65 is believed to be a $1billion satellite able to determine a car;s make and model from hundreds of miles above . Delta rockets have made over 360 flights, with the Delta IV’s making 24. Eight of those flights have been for the National Reconnaissance Office, the contractor noted. The NRO is responsible for building and operating the US’ spy satellites. NROL-65 is believed to be a $1billion ‘high-powered spy satellite capable of snapping pictures detailed enough to distinguish the make and model of an automobile hundreds of miles below,’ reported the Los Angeles Times. And it's gone: In only a few minutes, the rocket was almost out of sight to the naked eye . Big as it may be, the Delta IV is about to lose king of the hill status to the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA)’s Space Launch System designed to send the Orion spacecraft towards asteroids and to Mars. SLS will come in at 321 feet tall, eventually evolving into a 3845-foot-tall beast capable of taking 130 metric tons into space. It is expected to come on line in 2017. Even sooner is the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, according to NBC News.

"Intelligence reports on the Syrian chemical attack far from prove that President Bashar al-Assad was responsible, US officials said last night. One admitted the evidence was ‘not a slam dunk’ - a pointed reference to language used by the CIA to describe intelligence on weapons of mass destruction ahead of the Iraq war. Despite those doubts, United States is expected to go it alone to launch a limited airstrike on Syria. Military intervention: A US Air Force plane lands at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey yesterday. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said the inspection team in Syria is expected to complete its work by today . President Barack Obama is prepared to go ahead despite last night’s rejection of military action by Britain, according to senior US administration officials. Last night the White House briefed national security staff and senior lawmakers to lay the groundwork for missile strikes, which could come as soon as tomorrow. On Wednesday, President Obama declared that the Syrian regime was responsible for the chemical attack. Yesterday he ordered a classified report which makes America’s case for intervention to be made public. But Washington officials insisted that the report was ‘not a slam dunk’. The basketball term was a deliberate reference to claims made by former CIA director George Tenet in 2002. He said US intelligence showing  that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a ‘slam dunk.’ That intelligence turned out to be wrong. Plan: President Barack Obama is prepared to go ahead with a limited airstrike on Syria despite last night¿s rejection of military action by Britain, according to senior US administration officials . The declassified report does not . contain a smoking gun directly linking Assad to the massacre that killed . at least 350 people last week, officials said. American . satellites have captured images of Syrian troops moving trucks into . weapons storage areas and removing materials, but analysts have not been . able to track what was moved or, in some cases, where it was relocated. This means a possible series of US cruise missile strikes aimed at crippling Assad’s military infrastructure could hit newly hidden supplies of chemical weapons, accidentally triggering another attack. The US also intercepted a phone call in which Syrian military officials discussed the strike, but the staff were only low-level, the officials said. It did not contain any direct evidence tying the attack back to Assad or even a senior Syrian commander – the link the White House is looking for. It wants to rule out the possibility that a rogue element of the military decided to use chemical weapons without authorisation. So while Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday that links between the attack and the Assad government were ‘undeniable,’ US intelligence officials are not certain that it was carried out on Assad’s orders. Claim: Secretary of State John Kerry said on Monday that links between the attack and the Assad government were 'undeniable' They are not even completely sure it was carried out by government forces. Despite these reservations, Mr Obama was said to be confident that there was sufficient evidence to act once UN inspectors have left Syria tomorrow. The strike is likely to be a cruise missile bombardment from US destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, probably only lasting for a couple of days. A fifth US warship was expected to arrive in the region today. A US State Department official said President Obama would not wait for Britain, explaining: ‘We can’t wait. We need to act according to our own national interests. We need to act. Why do we need to wait for a UN report to tell us what we already know?’ Asked why the US had to go it alone in Syria while Europe hesitated, congressman Eliot Engel, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: ‘It’s difficult to answer that question.’ He didn’t openly criticise Britain, but added: ‘As the US we stand for something. We stand for democracy. We stand for human rights. In the US we have principles. 'These are difficult decisions. We don’t take them lightly. I think the world has to show its revulsion and this is a way of doing it. The worst choice we can do is to do nothing.’","Phrase 'slam dunk' is a reference to CIA language used ahead of Iraq war .

"The Dukan Diet, said to be followed by Carole Middleton, has been voted the worst diet of the year again by nutrition experts . One recommends sitting in a cold bath after drinking black coffee, while another involves being fed through an intravenous drip. They are among the top five celebrity fad diets that experts have warned should be avoided in the New Year. The British Dietetic Association said that diets followed by the rich and famous were becoming ‘more extreme’ and increasingly involved ‘medical intervention’. Dieticians warned there really is ‘no quick fix’ to a slim, trim body for 2013 and said that following celebrity fads could lead to health problems. Among the most disturbing  entries was the Ketogenic Enteral Nutrition Diet, said to be followed by top fashion models. The KEN diet involves eating nothing at all. Instead, a liquid formula is administered through a feeding tube inserted through the dieter’s nose. You are attached to a portable pump and liquid bag for ten days and can unhook yourself for only 60 minutes every 24 hours. BDA consultant dietician Sian Porter described the procedure as ‘shocking’ and something ‘usually reserved for the chronically ill’. The list also included the bizarre Party Girl IV Drip Diet. Offered at private clinics for about £225 a time, it involves a high-dose cocktail of vitamins and nutrients administered via a drip of the type used to treat the severely malnourished and clinically ill, supposedly providing a ‘power boost’. Mrs Porter said: ‘There is very little evidence that this even works in well people. Even if it did, food and drinking water or other healthy drinks is preferable to having an IV drip inserted into your body.’ She added: ‘Our concern is that many of these diets are quite invasive. It shows the extreme lengths that people are willing to go to in order to lose weight. ‘Eating is a pleasure and people should enjoy their food.’ The carb-free Dukan Diet was named as the worst offender for the third year in a row. The Dukan Diet became the bestselling diet book of all time, with more than a million copies sold in Britain alone. It is credited with Carole Middleton’s svelte figure at her daughter Kate’s wedding to Prince William. But the BDA described it as ‘confusing, time-consuming, very rigid’ and warned it could cause ‘lack of energy, constipation and bad breath’. The Six Weeks To OMG [Oh My God] Diet was dismissed as ‘six weeks of hell and isolation’. Its London-based creator, Venice A. Fulton, recommends doing exercise first thing in the morning after drinking black coffee, and sitting in a cold bath to burn stored fat. The BDA attacked as ‘madness’ the increasingly popular Alcorexia or Drunkorexia Diet, which encourages followers to shun calories during the week so that they can binge on alcohol at the weekend. Mrs Porter said: ‘After Christmas, people often look for a quick fix. They see air-brushed celebrities and aspire to look like that. ‘But if it looks too good to be true, it usually is. We see new health fads and diets every year but there is no substitute for exercising and a balanced diet.’ Helen Davies, spokesperson on behalf of the Dukan Diet, said: 'The BDA's only criticism of the Dukan Diet is that it's 'confusing, time-consuming [and] very rigid' - some would say this is a very necessary part of changing any sort behaviour pattern - and somehow the BDA judge this to be worse than feeding yourself via a drip or replacing food with alcohol?'","Dukan diet, said to be followed by Carole Middleton, named as this year’s worst offender – for the third year in a row .

'Is Pogba's price tag around €80million (£66m)? He is one of the most expensive players on the market,' Raiola told Italian radio broadcaster RAI Sport. 'Considering his age, he has room for improvement and he is among the best. Of course, the asking price always depends on eventual buyers.'

"Clinging to each other in the shadow of the sunken hull, this young couple are united even in death. Harrowing underwater footage of the migrant ship that sunk killing more than 300 last autumn has emerged, following another tragic shipwreck off the coast of Lampedusa. As police divers explore the sunken wreck, the bodies of those that did not survive can be seen on board and scattered on the surrounding sea bed . In one heartbreaking image a young couple had remained in a loving embrace even as they drowned. Scroll down for video . Clinging to each other in the shadow of the sunken hull, this young couple are united even in death. Harrowing underwater footage of the migrant ship that sunk killing more than 300 last autumn has emerged, following another tragic shipwreck off the coast of Lampedusa . The . ship caught fire and sank last September, just two miles off the island . of Lampedusa, killing 366 migrants mostly Somalis and Eritreans. Following . the disaster, the worst since 2000, and amid much soul searching, the . Italian navy and coastguard stepped up rescue operations. But . the authorities have struggled to intercept boats as gangs of . smugglers, encouraged by the rescue efforts, have increased the number . of crossings. Already this year 36,000 migrants have landed by boat in . Italy, eight-fold last year's arrivals. This . week a boat carrying hundreds of migrants sunk 100 miles south of . Lampedusa. Despite desperate rescue attempts, at least 17 migrants . drowned, with many more still missing. Last week at least 40 perished in . another wreck when their trawler sank off the coast of Libya. The . release of the footage following the new tragedies recalls the full . horror of last year's wreck when rescue workers described 'a cemetery in . the sea'. At the time . police diver Renato Sollustri said he had not slept since he brought up . two corpses, a baby hidden in the folds of his mother's white leggings, . under pulled-down trousers. Video courtesy of Repubblica.it . The body of an African would-be migrant washed up on the shore of al-Qarboli in Libya . It is thought the man was travelling on a boat that sank off the coast of Libya headed for Italy on Sunday . A Libyan official surveys the scene and writes down notes as he stands next to the body of the migrant . He . said: 'It was three in the afternoon when we finally got into the last . cabin in the bow after having got past a wall of bodies.' The divers . still had ten minutes oxygen left when they got through a wall of bodies . to the last cabin in the bow and saw a mother with a baby bump. He . told La Repubblica: 'We couldn't leave without doing something for her. We took her out forming a human chain with our arms. Then we lay her on . the sea bed. With a rope we joined her to the other bodies and with . buoyancy aids we took them towards the light. 'It . wasn't until we passed the body to our colleagues in the boat that they . made the shocking discovery-in her leggings was a newborn baby. None of . us could believe it. We all began to cry-my mask was full of tears.' The . police marshall said he had never before lost control in the job. 'But . in front of that newborn baby I lost my cool. The baby may never have . seen light- only the darkness at the bottom of the sea. It was a . horrible job.' Earlier today the body of a . migrant who tried to flee Africa for a new life in Europe washed up . on a Libyan beach. The . gruesome discovery was made on the shore of al-Qarboli, east of Tripoli . days after the trawler he is thought to have been travelling on sank . off the Libyan coast claiming at least 17 lives. The sinking, which has so far led to two arrests, comes amid claims . hundreds of thousands more would-be illegal immigrants are preparing to . set sail for southern Italy. Those rescued from the sunken ship were taken by the Italian navy to Catania harbour in Sicily . The ship, Grecale was sent to rescue the migrants off the coast of Tripoli where they were stranded . 17 bodies have so far been recovered by the Italian navy. Here coffins containing the bodies were carried off the rescue ship . The body, . which has not yet been identified, is one of 17 so far recovered while . 206 people were rescued by patrol boats and merchant ships from the . wreck in international waters between Libya and Italy. Italian . media have cited coastguards as saying there were around 400 people on . board, which would mean dozens are still unaccounted for. Survivors include two Eritrean children who lost their parents and siblings. Italian . authorities have now detained two Tunisians suspected of smuggling . migrants aboard the boat having arrested them on suspicion of murder. Italy, . with its southernmost island, Lampedusa, just 70 km off the coast of . Africa, is the first port of call for many seeking a new life in Europe. Now the country has threatened to send asylum-seekers across Europe without more help to stem the tide of arrivals. So far this year more than 36,000 migrants have arrived by boat on Italy’s shores, with authorities warning the rate is even faster than the record number of 2011 during the Arab Spring. Migrant traffickers often mix with their passengers only to abandon them when accomplices in speedboats arrive to return the smugglers to base. Italian intelligence says that another 800,000 would-be migrants are on the African coastline ready to set sail. Italy’s . Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that, without more help with sea . patrols, Italy would defy EU rules obliging migrants to stay in the . country where they land and allow them to travel on to northern Europe. 'We'll just let them go,' he said. 'Since migrants do not want to stay in . Italy, they should have the opportunity to exercise their right of . political asylum in the rest of Europe. Otherwise we transform Italy . into the prison of political refugees.' Survivors of the sunken vessel were temporarily taken to a sports hall in Catania where they were given makeshift beds . The migrants are staying there while police and mediators work on identification and reunification of families . Officials list the identifications of migrants in a sports hall in Catania which has been converted into a makeshift home for survivors . He said that Europe should intercept migrants in Libya, setting up camps and offering humanitarian aid to migrants, before they set sail for Europe. ‘The humanitarian reception must start in Africa. Europe must go there, put up tents and take care of migrants there,’ he added. The Interior Minister of Libya Saleh Maziq said that they could not cope with the influx of migrants transiting through from sub Saharan Africa saying that ‘Europe must pay the price’. Libya has descended into lawless chaos since the failure of the Arab Spring, powerless to stop the criminal gangs of human traffickers shipping thousands of migrants to Europe, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels. After the tragic shipwreck that killed more than 300 off the island of Lampedusa last autumn, an EU wide sea patrol from Malta was planned, but has so far failed to materialise.","Footage of the migrant ship that sunk killing more than 300 last autumn .

"Liverpool have reportedly expressed interest in Marseille central midfielder Mario Lemina, according to reports in France. L'Equipe claims that Brendan Rodger's side has 'enquired' about the 21-year old Gabonese-born French player, although specific details over the potential transfer have been kept to a minimum. Lemina arrived at Marseille for 4m Euros in 2013 and has a contract with the Ligue 1 club until 2018, meaning the Reds would have to pay a sizeable fee to complete a deal for the defensive midfielder who has made a single appearance for France's Under-21s. Marseille defensive midfielder Mario Lemina (left) is reportedly a target for Premier League side Liverpool .

Juventus have a challenge on their hands to keep Paul Pogba from leaving for Real Madrid . Silvio Berlusconi has critcised AC Milan following their 1-0 defeat to lowly Atalanta . The Turin club's director general Guiseppe Marotta told Tuttosport: 'I think Paul will stay, we have the strength to refuse any offer even if it will be hard for him to say no to some wages.' However, La Gazetta dello Sport, have perhaps gauged the situation more pragmatically with the headline: 'Juve's crazy idea, keeping Pogba'. Finally, former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi appears to have deflected attention from his own troubles by laying in to AC Milan and, in particular coach Pippo Inzaghi, claiming: 'It’s unacceptable to lose to a team which earns one fifth what our players do,' in reference to the Rossoneri's recent 1-0 defeat to Atalanta.","Liverpool have expressed an interest in Marseille midfielder Mario Lemina .

"Every England player had a half-hour private meeting with team psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters before the Euro 2016 qualifying win in Switzerland. Coach Gary Neville said the sessions were part of a plan to take away the fear of failing from Roy Hodgson’s team. ‘Over the years I have seen young players overwhelmed by fear of the consequences when things go wrong.

And Neville reckons England have been transformed by Hodgson as the Three Lions embark on their new killer strategy. ‘Roy has transitioned the side into a more adventurous outfit. It’s virtually a brand new team,' Neville continued. 'As we gathered to discuss the options for the Switzerland game he was categorical about using the diamond, which is one of the most complex formations to get right. He was adamant that he wanted Wilshere to play in that role. 'He was enthusing about his talent and arguing that he wanted to see him pass creatively from a deep position. It might fail.

"Tottenham have been warned they could face the nightmare prospect of a move to their proposed new ground shelved until 2020. Chairman Daniel Levy has secured a compulsory purchase order on the land surrounding White Hart Lane, but the last remaining tenant has been given leave to appeal to the High Court. The decision forced Spurs to admit this week that they were ‘highly unlikely’ to move into a new stadium for the start of the 2017-18 season. WATCH Scroll down for 'Pochettino on his club's ownership and potential stadium move' Tottenham Hotspur have revealed it's 'highly unlikely' they will move into their new stadium in 2017 . Olympic Stadium . Capacity: 60,000. Distance from White Hart Lane: 4.95 miles. Likelihood: It fits the bill, but Spurs’ rivals West Ham, who will move into the stadium in 2016, would oppose the idea. Stadium mk . Capcity: 30,500. Distance from White Hart Lane: 40.05 miles. Likelihood: The capacity isn’t much smaller than the 36,240-seat White Hart Lane, but the distance between the grounds is even greater than that travelled by Coventry fans to see their team play in Northampton last season . . . and that went down very badly. However legal experts believe the delays could be even longer and that Spurs could find themselves tied up legally for another four years if the case goes all the way to the European courts. In addition to resolving the dispute, it is expected the new 56,250-capacity stadium will take two years to complete once construction work begins, meaning the club won’t be able to move until the 2020-21 season. Spurs have been wrangling with a local business for seven years over the final piece of land on the stadium site before work can start at White Hart Lane. Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is run by the Josif family, are refusing to leave until they are given adequate compensation for the inconvenience of relocating. Jay Das, a planning and compulsory purchase expert at law firm Wedlake Bell explained: ‘Spurs face the prospect of an appeal to the High Court and Archway could appeal that decision too. This whole process could take up to two years in a worse case scenario. Tottenham Hotspur will have to play away from White Hart Lane for one season . Fulham and QPR: The west London clubs shared Loftus Road for two season between 2002 and 2004 while Craven Cottage was being redeveloped. Crystal Palace/Charlton/Wimbledon: Crystal Palace shared Selhurst Park with Charlton between 1985 and 1991 before playing hosts to Wimbledon until their extinction in 2003 . AC Milan and Inter: Both called the San Siro home since 1947 in a move that his little impact on the success of either club and the two Milan teams have acquired almost 100 major titles between them. ‘Archway may even decide to pursue the European Courts, which would bring another two year delay. This all means the club may not be able to begin stadium construction for another four years. ‘In 99 per cent of these types of cases a deal is agreed between the two parties. 'It seems inevitable Spurs will have to do a deal with Archway if it wants to avoid these delays. 'The question is how much will it take to reach an agreement?’ As well as holding back the construction of the new stadium, legal experts estimate Spurs’ legal bills are likely to exceed £1million before the issue has been settled.

"Christopher Michael East is alleged to have beat his neighbor, 75, for cutting his nails outside their apartment building . A 75-year-old man was allegedly beaten over the head with a baseball bat for cutting his nails on the steps of his apartment building. Bill Newell was sat outside his home in Naples, Florida, when he was allegedly approached by Christopher Michael East, his 39-year-old neighbor. East is said to have told Mr Newell to 'get off his stairs', but he refused, continuing to sit on the steps and clip his nails 'because he lives in the building'. Mr Newell was then struck from behind, inflicting a large gash on the top of his head. Police officers found the pensioner lying bloodied in the fetal position, with the baseball bat a few feet away. He also had bruised legs, a bruised back and his manicure set had been stolen, the Naples Daily News reported. He spent eight hours being treated at North Naples Hospital on Tuesday but  the next day said he was doing 'OK'. 'When someone beats you up with a baseball bat, you don't recover right away,' Mr Newell said. Before the alleged attack, Mr Newell said he had one previous encounter with East. Last year, Mr Newell said he went upstairs to East's apartment to inquire about his Comcast television reception. When he answered, Newell said East curtly told him he had DIRECTV and promptly slammed the door. East is facing charges of aggravated battery using a deadly weapon and unarmed robbery. Mr Newell said: 'I just want to let the courts take care of everything.'

"Manchester United youngster Will Keane is close to joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan until the end of the season. The forward is due to complete his move to the Championship club in the next 24 hours. The England Under 21 international has been told he can leave Old Trafford this month in search of regular first-team football and Wednesday manager Stuart Gray looks to have won the race to land the United starlet. Sheffield Wednesday are close to completing the signing of Will Keane on loan until the end of the season . Stockport-born Keane graduated from Manchester United's youth academy in 2011, but has found first-team opportunities hard to come by. He has spent time on loan at Wigan Athletic and QPR in previous seasons and has represented England from Under 16s level to Under 21s. Keane's contract at Manchester United expires at the end of the season and the striker will need to impress while on loan at Wednesday if he is to earn a new deal.

"Active choice: The new TOPS implant will help patients with back pain without restricting future movement . An amazing new spinal ‘joint replacement’ implant is curing severe back pain by replacing worn-out vertebrae without any of the restrictions on their ability to move that  are associated with more traditional treatment. Thousands of people have surgery to fix damaged vertebrae in the spine that cause back pain because they pinch the spinal cord or touch on nerves. Until now, one very common solution to the condition, known as spinal stenosis, has been to deal with the problem by ‘fusing’ several vertebrae so they don’t cause any more pain. But while the surgery is generally very successful, there is a price to pay. The spine can no longer make the full range of movement, so it is more difficult for the patient to bend and twist. Now Israeli medical scientists have developed the new titanium Total Posterior Solution implant – known as TOPS – that replaces the damaged or worn vertebrae. The implant is sandwiched into the spine and is a capable of giving the sufferer a full range of movement – without any pain. Ron Sacher, who has spent ten years developing TOPS, says many patients with spinal stenosis are relatively young and would like to resume an active life after surgery. He adds: ‘Fusion is the standard option if nothing else works to get rid of the pain. It stabilises the spine but it will limit the range of movement. For older patients, that might not be a problem. But many having this surgery are in their 40s and 50s and might still be taking part in a variety of sports.’ The surgery has been available in Europe for a while, but recently arrived in the UK, although, as yet, it is not on offer to patients through the NHS. ‘The most frequent spinal disease in people over-40s is spinal stenosis,’ says Sacher, ‘and that drove our company to find a better option than fusion.’ Dan Plev, one of two spinal surgeons using the implant at the London Spine Clinic, believes the operation is an excellent option. ‘A lot of our younger patients are seeking relief from pain but don’t want to be restricted,’ he says. ‘So we need an option that allows people to resume normal activity  quite quickly. ‘Recovery from spinal fusion surgery can take months but this implant gets people back to where they want to be within a few weeks.’ The TOPS implant not only gives patients normal pain-free mobility – doctors say it offers protection to adjoining parts of the spine, preventing those bones from collapsing; a common effect of fusion surgery which can lead to even more immobility. Research shows that as many as  one in four back fusion patients will require a second operation within two years because of complications. After completing five-year follow-ups on patients from trials in the US, Belgium and Israel, Premia Spine, which makes TOPS, believes its results are significantly better than those achieved by fusion. The drawback is its relative expense. But its makers say that is balanced by fewer complications than fusion, where  re-surgery rates are 25 per cent compared with five per cent for TOPS. Mr Plev and a colleague at the London Spine Clinic have carried out eight TOPS operations, with the oldest patient a man in his 90s. ‘He had suffered for many years and feels like a new man since the surgery,’ says Mr Plev. ‘This shows that age is no restriction, although a significant number of our patients are in their  40s and 50s. One of the world’s biggest challenges is back pain. So if we can bring relief through surgery while keeping the spine fully mobile, then we are getting an excellent result.’ The TOPS implant is available at two NHS hospitals – Chase Farm, in Enfield, North London, and Southampton General. The cost is about £20,000. londonspineclinic.com .","New implant replaces damaged vertebrae without restricting ability to move .

"Sergio Aguero is ready to return to Manchester City's starting XI as they bid to beat Arsenal and close the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea. And the Argentine hitman has revealed the new boots he will wear for what will be his first start since last December. Aguero has scored 19 goals in 24 outings this season but missed the festive period due to a knee injury. Sergio Aguero has revealed the new boots he will wear for his Manchester City return against Arsenal . Aguero will wear his new PUMA evoSPEED 1.3 studs for Man City's Premier League clash with the Gunners . After five weeks on the sidelines, he made a cameo during City's 1-1 draw with Everton at Goodison Park last weekend. The 26-year-old is set to lead the line against Arsene Wenger's Gunners at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon and showed his excitement at the prospect of donning his new PUMA evoSPEED 1.3 studs. Aguero posted a picture of the red boots on his Twitter page. The personalised 'Tricks' boots are inspired by his first club Independiente who wear red and white, where he became the youngest player to make his debut in a first division game in his native Argentina at the age of 15. After five weeks on the sidelines, Sergio Aguero made a cameo during City's 1-1 draw with Everton last week . The boots also carry a picture of his beloved dog and feature his nickname 'Kun' embossed across the outside. His closest family members and friends also appear above the formstripe, followed by 'Los Amo' which translates 'I love you' in Spanish. Indeed, it will be a sentiment echoed by his manager Manuel Pellegrini if the striker can inspire champions City to another title in May.","Sergio Aguero set to return to Man City XI for Sunday's clash with Arsenal .

"A 12-year-old with a lemonade and cookie stand in his residential area of Florida faces complaints from a neighbor who contacted police to report the stand as 'illegal.' 12-year-old T.J. Guerrero is a young entrepreneur who runs a lemonade stand in Dunedin, Florida to add to the income he makes from mowing-lawns so he can pay his cell phone bill and purchase an iPod. Unfortunately T.J's neighbor Doug Wilkey has a problem with T.J.'s small business and has contacted police at least four times in two years to try and have it shut down. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Business man: T.J. not only has a lemonade stand he also mows lawns and hopes to get a job bagging groceries at Publix when he turns 14 . Trying to make a profit: T.J. uses his lemonade money to pay his own cell phone bill . The Tampa Bay Times reports that Wilkey says that the stand is 'illegal' and causes local problems like traffic, noise, and illegal parking. 'Please help me regain my quiet home and neighborhood,' Wilkey, 61, wrote to town officials. 'We're not in the business of trying to regulate kids like that; nor do we want to do any code enforcement like that,' said Dunedin planning and development director Greg Rice. 'We are not out there trying to put lemonade stands out of business.' T.J. lives about four doors down from Wilkey but his lemonade stand is at neighbor Rodney Shrode's house directly next door to the 61-year-old complainer's home. Have you tried the strawberry?: This truck driver loves T.J.'s refreshing lemonade . Hard worker: T.J. works hard to make money for his cell phone bill . Wilkey lamented that T.J's friends are 'loud' and that they 'use profanity.' Wilkey also complained that the $1 lemonade and $.50 could possibly make someone ill. 'The city could possibly face repercussion in the event someone became ill from spoiled/contaminated food or drink sales,' Wilkey said in an email. 'If this were a once a year event by a couple kids to earn a little money for a holiday or something, I would not have a problem with it. I am very worried about the value of my home, which is why I built in a residential area, not a business area,' he also said. Deputy Wayne Gross asked local residents how they felt about T.J.'s lemonade stand and none of them seemed to have a problem with it. A truck driver working on a project nearby told the Tampa Bay Times, 'I tried the strawberry before and it's perfect. That's what it's about. He's willing to work.' T.J. says he isn’t jilted by the conflict and told reporters he can't wait until he's 14 so he can apply for a bagging job at Publix.","12-year-old T.J.

"Newcastle United are almost certain to wait until the summer before appointing a new head coach with Derby County boss Steve McClaren their preferred choice. The Magpies have dismissed reports that they are in talks with former Real Madrid manager Bernd Schuster. Sportsmail spoke to representatives of the former West Germany international on Thursday after it was reported he was set to meet United officials. Newcastle will have to wait until the summer if they want to hire Derby boss Steve McClaren as head coach . Newcastle have been without a manager since Alan Pardew left for Crystal Palace . Newcastle have dismissed reports linking them to former Real Madrid and Malaga manager Bernd Schuster . But the club have rubbished those claims and it appears any attempt at contact was initiated by Schuster's camp. Instead, Newcastle look set to wait until the end of the season before installing Alan Pardew's successor - and McClaren is at the top of their list. He has a good relationship with Newcastle chief scout Graham Carr, who along with managing director Lee Charnley, is responsible for bringing in the new boss. The former England coach has insisted he will not walk out on Derby's promotion push but has not ruled out a move to St James' Park come June. John Carver, meanwhile, is set to stay in caretaker charge for the remainder of the campaign.

Sam, 28, who is undertaking the entire event, has found it a little more challenging. He said: 'I have an incredible amount of respect for everyone involved, it has been absolutely gruelling but there's been a lot of camaraderie and we've had a good laugh. 'On our 449km ride over four days, averaging 105m a day,  from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Troyes, in Central France, I played a little trick on the team. 'About 30m from the end, we were peddling up an enormous hill and I snuck in and merrily raced past them all, much to their horror.

This is fundamental to the spirit of the Virgin Strive Challenge. It's such an amazing feeling when you've pushed yourself and achieved something.' As someone who has achieved an enormous amount in his lifetime, Sir Richard shared his advice on what he believes it takes to succeed. Explanation: Writing on Virgin.com, Holly explained that she wouldn't be taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge because of her pregnancy with twins, which Sir Richard is ecstatic about .

'I believe in getting fit,' he said simply. 'Now, more than ever, it is so important to be physically active and if you can be fit and healthy, you can achieve pretty much anything. 'I get up every morning and go kite surfing or play tennis and it sets me up for the day. People should strive to get involved in physical activities and if your body feels great, your mind follows.' So how will they celebrate at the end? 'By putting my feet up in front of the fire and having a hot chocolate,' said Sam. 'By giving everyone the biggest hug ever,' added Richard. And, of course, they will be celebrating with 32-year-old doctor Holly - who recently announced her pregnancy on her father's company website. 'I am ridiculously excited about the arrival of my twin grandchild,' said Richard proudly. 'I'm encouraging Sam and Isabella to hurry up and have babies now too!'.

"A female Texas state trooper who had been fired for conducting an illegal cavity search caught on dashcam video that went viral nearly two years ago pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of official oppression. Kelly Helleson was sentenced to two years’ probation and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine stemming from a July 13, 2012, traffic stop in Irving involving Angel Dobbs and her niece. Scroll down for videos . Punishment: Kelly Helleson was sentenced to two years' probation and ordered to pay a $2,000 fne for conducting an unwarranted body cavity search in July 2012 . The women sued the Department of Public Safety claiming that State Trooper Helleson inserted her hands inside their vaginas and anuses without changing the latex gloves. The law enforcement agency eventually settled with the plaintiffs for $185,000. In court Friday, Ms Helleson apologized for acting ‘injudiciously’ and causing pain with her actions, but denied touching anyone's private parts, the station NBC5 reported. ‘At no time did I ever stick my finger inside any part of anyone's body - that never happened,’ Helleson stated in court. She also added that Dobbs and her niece smelled of marijuana during the traffic stop, and she was merely doing what she was trained to do as a state trooper. Angel Dobbs also took the stand during sentencing, telling the court that the cavity search has affected every aspect of her life and shaken her trust in police. Invasive: Female trooper Kelley Helleson, left, aggressively searched Ashley Dobbs, 24 . Out: State trooper David Ferrell, pictured, has been suspended after subjecting two women to invasive body cavity searches . Pulled over: The women were initially stopped by Helleson's colleague David Farrell on State Highway 161 near Irving, Texas . The woman recalled that when she first complained about Helleson's conduct to the DPS, she was allegedly threatened with criminal charges. ‘No woman should have their body unnecessarily violated in this type of way. This was a gross invasion of the victim's privacy and violation of the public's trust,’ said Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins. Helleson, a retired U.S. Marine, was fired last January after serving 10 years on the force, CBS DFW reported. On Friday, the judge dismissed the more serious sexual assault charges Helleson had been facing. If she violates the terms of her probation, she will be sent to jail. Also, the former trooper has been barred from working in law enforcement. The case made national headlines and led DPS to prohibit troopers from conducting cavity searches without warrants. Impact statement: Angel Dobbs told the court that the cavity search had shaken her faith in law enforcement . Friday marked the first time that a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper was convicted for conducting an illegal body cavity search. The 'unconstitutional' search of Ms Dobbs and her niece, Ashley, took . place in full view of passing cars on State Highway 161, near . Irving, on the night of July 13, 2012. Ashley and Angel Dobbs claimed Trooper Helleson used the same blue . latex gloves while searching both of them. The women were initially pulled over by Trooper David Farrell after he saw one of them throw a . cigarette butt out the window. Farrell can be heard in the . disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana after supposedly . smelling the drug in the women's vehicle, though he failed . to find any evidence of it in the car. Despite that, he requested the women be searched by his female colleague because they were 'acting weird.' Violating: Helleson, pictured left, also rubbed the women's breasts . Lawsuit: The women are also suing the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety for ignoring prior complaints about searches . Humiliating: Angel Dobbs, 38, pictured right, claims she will never forget the humiliating, invasive experience . 'Unconstitutional': The search is being deemed unconstitutional in the lawsuit . The Dobbs' lawyer, Scott H. Palmer, said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.' He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers. The women said the 'molestation' has scarred them for life. 'I've never been so humiliated or so violated or felt so molested in my entire life,' Angel Dobbs told NBCDFW.com. Her . niece added: 'I don't think anybody needs to have to feel, or go . through what we went through. It crosses my mind every day. It's . humiliating.' The trooper who called Helleson to do the search, David Farrell, was indicted on a theft charge for allegedly lifting a bottle of pills from one of the women's purse, but that count was later dropped.

Ollie Forysth is spoiled for choice after he launched two businesses and bought a share in two vintage vehicles - despite being too young to drive. The teenager from Pury End near Towcester, Northamptonshire, makes £13,000 a year from an internet fashion shop which he opened when he was just 13. Scroll down for video . Driven to success: Ambitious entrepreneur Ollie Forsyth makes £13,000 a year in profit from his two online businesses and part-owns a 1930 Austin Ulster (pictured) - despite being too young to be able to drive it . Businessman: Ollie, who sells fashion accessories online (left), said he was inspired to succeed after being diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four and his idols include the Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson . The young entrepreneur opened another retailer last year which has already made £2,000. Next month his sights will be set on business stardom as he begins a business course backed by Dragon's Den entrepreneur Peter Jones. Ollie said he was inspired to succeed after being diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four and his idols include the Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson. Undeterred by struggles with school work, the youngster turned to business aged just six by making family members and friends cups of tea for 20p each - with an extra 20p fee for reheating. His father Angus, an insurance broker, and mother Melanie, who runs an interior design business, sent him to the specialist Bruern Abbey School for pupils with dyslexia in Bicester, Oxfordshire. Feeling flush: Ollie's shop has made him thousands of pounds selling belts, cufflinks, wallets and necklaces . The teenager was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of four, but he said it helped him. 'I think without being dyslexic, I wouldn’t have started a business,' he said. 'It's a huge driving tool that makes people successful' From there he went to study at the £31,000-a-year Milton Abbey School in Blandford Forum, Dorset, where he picked up Cs, Ds and Fs at GCSE last week. But long before his exams he had begun to show flair as a businessman. The ambitious teenager began selling friendship bracelets to school friends before launching Ollie’s Shop, an online gift shop selling jewellery and accessories, at just 13 years old. The shop has made him thousands of pounds selling belts, cufflinks, wallets and necklaces aimed at teenagers. It turned over £5,000 in its first year with a £2,500 profit. By last year that had risen to a £25,000 turnover and healthy profit of £13,000. Wares: Some of the cufflinks which Ollie sells through his shop - though few teens have an Aston Martin . Generous: The teenager said he makes sure to support several charities through his impressive online sales . But Ollie didn't stop there, launching his second enterprise - online fashion retailer www.charmou.com - four months ago. So far it is thought to have made around £2,000. The teenager supports several charities through his sales, but it is not all work and no play. In his spare time he restores classic cars, and part-owns two with his father Angus - whose insurance work involves classic cars - and a third investor who is also a family member. Ollie said: 'If I can become a millionaire in my 20s and a billionaire before I die, I would be a happy chap' One day he hopes he will be able to drive his 1967 Triumph GT6 Mk1 and his 1930 Austin Ulster. 'I’m not an academic person but my strength lies in being an entrepreneur,' he said. 'I’m glad I started at a young age because my confidence has grown so much and at that age you have nothing to lose, you can just go for it. 'I think without being dyslexic, I wouldn’t have started a business. It’s a huge driving tool that makes people successful. 'I really do like being dyslexic, it makes me so much more driven and I’m determined to succeed in life.' He added: 'Ollie’s Shop started when I noticed a history teacher of mine at school wearing a friendship bracelet. 'I bought some with my pocket money and sold them for £10 each. Before I knew it I’d made £100. Everything went from there really and I launched Ollie’s Shop just a few months later.' Next month Ollie will begin studying at a branch of the Peter Jones Enterprise Academy, a network of business colleges supported by the TV entrepreneur. 'In the future I would like to start my own business magazine,' he added. 'I would also like to move to Dubai for a few years and would love to live in New York.. 'My ethos is, if I can become a millionaire in my 20s and a billionaire before I die, I would be a very happy chap. 'My GCSE grades shows qualifications aren’t everything at the end of the day. I have two businesses and people really do see potential in me and I’m really grateful for that.' Ollie’s mother said her son had always been driven from a very young age.

Stiverne appeared to fall as the bell sounded and was perhaps fortunate not to be given a count . It was the first heavyweight title fight at the MGM Grand since Mike Tyson bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear 18 years ago. Both Tyson and Holyfield were on hand to watch, as was Larry Holmes, who fought often on the big stage as heavyweight champion in the 1970s and 80s. And Wilder became the first American to hold a piece of the heavyweight title since Shannon Briggs reigned briefly in 2007 and 2008. The challenger controlled the opening stages of the first round, boxing on his back foot but using his rod-like jab to good effect. Stiverne was happy to stalk his taller opponent around the ring but was reluctant to let his hands go until the final seconds. One of the biggest questions before the fight was Wilder's ability to take a punch but he was untroubled by a left hook to the head in the second round. The challenger was in control as the clock ticked down before he suddenly unleashed a barrage of shots. The bell sounded as Stiverne slipped to the canvas and although no knockdown was called, the Haitian was rocked. The champion took his time to warm into the third stanza as Wilder kept him at range with his long left hand. Stiverne did land a couple of body shots midway through but was otherwise a virtual bystander as Wilder dropped his hands, smiled and taunted his rival. But the champion looked more comfortable in the fourth round, closing the gap and landing with a solid left hook. He finished strongly to notch his first session of the night. Wilder's ram-rod jab was the cornerstone to his success as he boxed cleverly throughout the 12 rounds . Wilder unloaded with his right hand on several occasions but was unable to stop the stubborn Stiverne .

Wilder was by now in uncharted territory and he sensibly returned to boxing behind his jab. With a minute remaining, however, he unleashed his right hand and wobbled Stiverne but the champion showed his mettle to remain on his feet and the attack fizzled out. And it was Stiverne who enjoyed his best round of the fight as it approached the halfway stage. A left hook to the head stunned Wilder against the ropes but he recovered quickly and flashed another grin. If one thing was beyond doubt, it was Stiverne's ability to absorb a punch. Midway through the seventh round, Wilder landed a stiff left-right combination which sent the champion staggering backwards. But he stayed upright and his chin soaked up another barrage of right hands. Both men took a breather in the eighth stanza with Wilder retreating behind his jab and Stiverne restricted to the odd flurry. Few had expected the fight to go the distance but after nine rounds, Wilder looked to be heading for a points victory. As he took to his stool, Stiverne was told he was 'miles behind' on the scorecards. And the crowd began to jeer as Wilder remained content to keep the champion at range. Both men were visibly tired in the penultimate session with neither able to launch a sustained attack. Wilder's corner implored him to be smart as he sat three minutes away from claiming one of the greatest prizes in sport. And he didn't let them down as he smothered Stiverne and celebrated in typically exuberant style, shouting into the camera as Muhammad Ali once did, perhaps fittingly on The Greatest's 73rd birthday. Stiverne sat slumped in his corner between rounds knowing he had to deliver a knockout to win the fight . Wilder twice rocked Stiverne but discovered the Haitian would not easily be stopped at the MGM Grand . Wilder's right hand had helped him put away his 32 previous opponents but Stiverne was made of stern stuff . Wilder lands a right hand on Stiverne up close as he continually got the better of the exchanges . Wilder was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught, showed he could take a punch . 'I answered a lot of questions tonight,' he said. 'We knew we could go 12 rounds, we knew we could take a punch. All the hard work is done in camp. Did I look like I had fun? I really did. 'There wasn't a better opponent than Bermane Stiverne. I wanted to prove I could do it and I did that. I don't want anyone to doubt me anymore. 'I thought I was going to knock him out in four rounds but when I saw he could take a great punch, I knew I was in for a long fight. 'I want to bring excitement to the heavyweight division. I want to fight four times a year. I'm ready whenever.' Stiverne claimed he was not at his best as he surrendered the title he won against Chris Arreola last year. 'It wasn't my night,' he said. 'I didn't feel 100 per cent. I just couldn't cut the ring off or move my head like I usually do. 'I congratulate him but I've got to go back and learn from my mistakes. 'I was trying to throw combinations of four and five punches but I got through two of them. 'I was flat. This wasn't me at all. I wasn't able to do what I wanted to do.'","Deontay Wilder is the new WBC heavyweight world champion .

"When the Celtic manager might just be the most popular inhabitant of the Ibrox directors’ box, it tells you everything about where Rangers are right now. Even in the annals of the bitter saga surrounding this crisis-riven club, these were extraordinary scenes. Mounted police stood guard in front of the main entrance to the stadium before Friday night’s truncated game against Hearts as tensions crackled amid angry protests. VIDEO: Rangers fans break into Ibrox in protest against the board . Rangers fans stormed an entrance at Ibrox to  voice their feelings against the board on Friday night . Supporters swarmed the entrance after the clash with Hearts was called off due to the weather . Mounted police stood guard in front of the entrance to the stadium before the match against Hearts . One of the supporter's flags read: ‘Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites' Inside, Ronny Deila - here on a spying mission ahead of the League Cup semi-final with assistant John Collins - found himself perched in front of the Easdale brothers, James and Sandy, and finance director Barry Leach. None of the ire vented on Friday night was sent in his direction. When a farcical game on a snow-bound pitch was then abandoned after 25 minutes, it provided the cue for another outpouring of ill-feeling. No sooner had referee Bobby Madden’s whistle stilled than chants of ‘Sack the board’ rang out from all four stands. Hundreds of fans answered the call for a mass protest at 7pm - despite sub-zero temperatures - thronging around the barriers erected in front of Ibrox. It was a response to advance notices of security over the stadium and Murray Park being lodged on behalf of Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct firm. The move is seen as a precursor to the board accepting a £10million loan from Ashley ahead of a rival funding offer from Douglas Park’s consortium known as the Three Bears.

The protest was a response to advance notices of security over Ibrox being lodged on behalf of Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct firm . Rangers fans display a 'Forever Ibrox' banner after continuing their pre-match protests during the game . Chants against Ashley and the Easdales filled the bitterly cold air. Banners tied to the fence across the road spelled out the message further. ‘Ibrox belongs to fans’ and ‘Hands off our club’. Much more colourful language was also being aired. The odd snowball was lobbed over the lines early on before a point was reached when part of the crowd seemed to surge and the police decided a greater presence was required to ensure control. More vans arrived, accompanied by a clutch of officers on horseback, who moved into position in front of the barriers. When the ground emptied ahead of schedule at around 8.10pm, a second protest formed in the same place, fans again voicing their feelings against the board in the strongest possible terms. This time, a group of supporters also flooded into the entrance to Argyle House at the opposite side of the stadium, filmed on a video camera holding a banner reading: ‘Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites'. For a support that doesn’t traditionally indulge in protests, the numbers were significant. As was the widespread chanting inside the ground. It seems the prospect of Ashley gaining security over Ibrox has achieved the near impossible in effectively uniting a fractured Rangers support. Rangers fans protest before Friday's match with Hearts over claims that Ibrox is to be mortgaged off . Rangers fans gesture towards Hearts' supporters as a board explains why the game had to be cancelled . Even the club’s own in-house fan group has called on chief executive Derek Llambias and chairman David Somers to come clean about what is being planned with the Newcastle United owner. The Rangers Fan Board (RFB) is an official supporter liaison group, set up by former chief executive Graham Wallace. The body is closest of all to the hierarchy but has told the board it will never back moves to mortgage off Ibrox. ‘The RFB are today insisting on clarity from Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias and chairman David Somers following revelations that Ibrox and Murray Park could be used as security in return for additional funding,’ read their statement. ‘RFB would like to state that we will never support any moves which could see Ibrox, or the training complex used in this manner. ‘We have already requested information from Mr Llambias as to the board’s intentions in regard to the Mike Ashley loan offer and, so far, the CEO has said:”At this moment in time, there has not been a deal done with anyone with regard to loaning the club funds. We are in talks with a number of parties and, hopefully, an announcement will be made shortly with this effect to the Stock Exchange”. ‘An announcement was subsequently made but it did not come close to clarifying the situation and that is why we are pushing for a meeting with the CEO and chairman.

Kenny Miller (right) tries to avoid a tackle from Hearts' Alim Ozturk early on in the top-of-the-table clash . Hearts  applaud their travelling supporters after having their clash with Rangers called off in the first half . ‘We need a categoric assurance that our stadium, which is hugely symbolic, a monument to what this club means will never be used as security. ‘It is alarming that advance notices of security were lodged with the Register of Scotland on January 13. ‘We must stress again that we would strongly oppose the securitisation of Ibrox. The very notion fills us with dread and since RFB was brought into being to bridge the gap between supporters and the board, we believe it is incumbent upon the directors to meet with us as a matter of urgency.’ The strength of those words was telling about the current mood. Furthermore, Rangers First — a fan-ownership group — have made contact with the club’s nominated advisor WH Ireland to express their concerns about Ashley’s powerplay — which prevents anyone else taking security on either asset for 35 days. ‘The Rangers First board have written to RIFC’s NOMAD to express some of the concerns that have been voiced to us by members over the last 24 hours,’ they said. Police and stewards hold people back as Hearts and Rangers fans attempt to confront each other inside Ibrox . ‘We expressed our deep concern about a notice of intention to grant security being lodged over Ibrox. ‘Granting such a notice, at a time when shareholders have been assured that RIFC are currently considering various proposals, seems to provide the party in whose favour the notice has been granted with an unfair advantage whilst, at the same time, prejudicing the ability to advance discussions with other potential providers of funding. ‘We advised that we couldn’t see how that was in the best interests of shareholders and requested an urgent explanation. ‘We indicated that we had been inundated with requests from members to take every possible step to prevent security being granted over Ibrox. ‘We would call on every shareholder to contact RIFC’s NOMAD in similar terms to ensure the NOMAD is aware of the weight of shareholder opinion on this issue.’","Rangers' match with Hearts was called off due to adverse weather .

"Ryan Mason has committed his future to Tottenham, penning a new five-and-a-half-year deal at White Hart Lane. A product of the Spurs academy, the 23-year-old midfielder made his debut for the club in November 2008 as a late substitute at NEC Nijmegen in the UEFA Cup. Mason spent time on loan at five other clubs before belatedly making his first league appearance for Spurs nigh on six years after his debut, but is now a key player for Mauricio Pochettino.

"Novak Djokovic wasted no time in booking his place in the last 32 of the Australian Open as the world No 1 dropped just five games against Andrey Kuznetsov. Djokovic was imperious as he beat world No 88 Kuznetsov 6-0, 6-1, 6-4 in just one hour and 24 minutes to seal a third-round clash with Fernando Verdasco or Go Soeda. The four-time Melbourne champion has lost just two sets in his first and second round matches here since 2007 and feels that a combination of factors make this tournament the best of the four majors for him. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Novak Djokovic's win over Kuznetsov . Novak Djokovic needed less than 90 minutes to beat Andrey Kuznetsov and reach the third round . Djokovic's coach Boris Becker shows his appreciation of his charge's performance in Melbourne . Djokovic signs the customary autographs after his straightforward victory on Thursday . The Serb said: 'Generally this is my most successful grand slam and the tournament where over the years I've performed my best tennis. I think there is not one reason, [more] a few reasons together. 'Probably the fact that I enjoy the conditions of play. Even though the last two years the courts have played faster, significantly faster than they were before, still I do enjoy being here in Australia. Some nice, positive, easy-going, sport-oriented energy going around. People appreciate the sport and make you feel good. 'Of course, it's the beginning of the year. It's the first big tournament. Everybody comes fresh and motivated. I guess in this kind of package it's a combination of things that make me feel comfortable on the court here.' Immediately from the off, Djokovic did not look as if he would drop a set on Thursday as he raced to a one-set lead without losing a game in just 21 minutes, making just two unforced errors. Kuznetsov, 23, finally got on the board in the 10th game of the match but that was the Russian's only success in the second set as Djokovic served up his seventh ace to ease to a two-set lead. Other than a brief rally in the third set, Kuznetsov had no answer to the world No 1's devastating display . Becker (left) poses with Dutch football legend Clarence Seedorf by the courts in Australia . The Rod Laver Arena crowd gave Kuznetsov a cheer as he surprisingly broke for a 2-0 lead in the third set after a Djokovic double fault but it didn't last long as Djokovic immediately broke back and went on to secure progression. Djokovic said: 'The first two sets definitely have been great. Overall I executed the game plan. Everything I intended to do, almost 100 per cent, from every second in my game, serve, baseline play, aggressive shots and aggressive returns. 'He dropped his first-serve percentage a lot in the second set and obviously allowed me to have a lot of looks at the second serves. That, as well, gave me an opportunity to step in and just swing through the ball.' Djokovic, 27, is bidding to become only the second man to win the Australian Open five times, with Aussie Roy Emerson still holding the record after winning the title six times in the 1960s.","Novak Djokovic was in imperious form as he cruised through in Melbourne .

"The 12-year-old girl who was lured into the woods and brutally stabbed 19 times by  classmates hoping to impress the fictional character Slender Man has revealed her identity for the first time. Payton Leutner was completely oblivious to what police describe as a five-month plan concocted by her best friends to murder her when she excitedly arrived for a sleepover in late May. But just hours later she was crawling for her life from the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin, after being stabbed in the chest, abdomen, legs and arms. Revealed: This is 12-year-old Payton Leutner who was stabbed 19 times by her two friends who allegedly wanted to murder her and pretend she had been killed by a fictional 'bogeyman' called Slender Man . Wounds: Faint marks up Payton's left arm betray her horrific ordeal which left her fighting for life in May . Tonight, she appeared in public for the first time on ABC's 20/20 as it is revealed for the first time that the knife missed her major artery by less than a hair's width. And her mother Stacie Leutner - who has also remained anonymous until tonight - reveals Payton had feared the specter known as Slender Man before the attack, and tried to back away as they neared the woods 'sensing something was wrong'. Until now, Payton has not been identified or previously pictured, apart from an image showing her being carried away on a stretcher. Her attackers, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, have since been charged as adults for first-degree intentional homicide but questions remain over whether they will be competent to stand trial. Smiling, playing with a cat, and watching a video of the Katy Perry concert she went to the night before, Payton looks like any other carefree little girl. However, the marks on her arm betray a horrific ordeal that she is still unable to acknowledge even to her parents. Recovering: She has now finally returned to school but at first could not even speak due to her injuries . Ordeal: Prosecutors warn there is a chance Payton will have to give evidence in the trial against her attackers . Smiling: Payton did not talk in the report but was seen shopping and playing with animals as she recovers . Moving forward: Her parents said she was so excited to go back to school to rebuild her life after the trauma . Big step: She is pictured here getting in the car to go back to school for her first day since the attack . Payton did not speak in the report where she is shown shopping, going to an animal shelter, and getting in the car to drive for school for her first day since the attack. But her parents describe the horrific night. 'I walked into the trauma room she was in. She was pale as a ghost,' says her mother Stacie Leutner, recounting the moment she arrived at the hospital. 'She was crying. She couldn't breathe. She saw me. She put her hand out and I rushed over to her and I put my arms around her and I laid next to her.' She went on: 'She saw me and she put her hand out and I hugged her and I told her, 'you're going to be OK, it's going to be fine'. But I could see that she was covered in stab wounds.' Looking over the wounds to her daughter's body, she counted five on her arm and seven on her leg. Devastated: The parents of the 12-year-old girl who was stabbed 19 times and left for dead in a Wisconsin park in May have spoken out on camera for the first time in an interview with ABC, which will air on Friday . Heartbroken: The girl's mother described her shock at seeing her daughter in hospital for the first time . 'I heard one nurse say, 'I count 19',' Stacie said. The surgeon, remembering the most horrific night of his career, said: 'If the knife had gone the width of a human hair further, she would be dead. 'She was less than a millimeter between living and dying'. Payton's injuries left her unable to talk  so she was forced to write notes to her family. The first asked: 'did they find them?' Her parents eventually asked Payton how she found the strength to crawl  out of the forest, and she told them: 'I wanted to live.' 'She's an amazing child,' her mother said, while her father Joe added: 'She's definitely our hero.' The report unveils the 911 call made by a cyclist who found Payton struggling to breathe and covered in blood on a path near the woods in Waukesha. The call-handler is audibly in disbelief. Fighter: The little girl, pictured with ABC News reporter David Muir, will also appear on the show. She spent six weeks in the hospital after she was stabbed multiple times over her arms, legs and abdomen . Survivor: The girl, pictured on a stretcher, managed to crawl out of the woods and alert a passing cyclist . The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. Payton's mother, Stacie Leutner, said her daughter asked about Slender Man before the attack because stories shared by her friend frightened her. Payton insisted her best friend knew Slender Man was real. Leutner was not overly concerned. 'Fantasy when you are 12 years old is still a very active part of your life,' she said. Weier and Geyser told investigators they stabbed the girl to impress Slender Man, a tall, fictional bogeyman popular on the Internet that they insisted was real, according to a criminal complaint. In an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the 'leader' of Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty. She explained Geyser told her they needed to slaughter their friend  to become 'proxies' of Slender Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest. They planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion, they told police. The forest is five miles from Waukesha by car. Geyser was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night. Police tonight revealed the girls had been plotting the attack for five months and initial intended to murder Payton in her sleep at Morgan's house but backed out at the last minute. Payton's mother believes the change of plan saved her life. Arrests: Anissa Weir, left, and Morgan Geyser, right, allegedly stabbed the girl after inviting her over for a sleepover. They had wanted to impress a fictional horror character, Slender Man, with the killing . In court: Weier is pictured in court in June, but doctors have deemed she is not competent to stand trial . Charged: Weier, also charged as an adult, is undergoing competency tests to determine if she can stand trial . They changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down. When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband. They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees. It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times. Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood. 'Obsessed': Slender Man, left, is a popular online character who abducts children. Right, before the stabbing, Geyser's father proudly shared this image that his daughter had drawn of the character on a menu . Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The victim spent six days in the hospital. The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack. Geyser and Weier face up to 60 years in prison if convicted as adults of attempted homicide. They could be incarcerated to age 25 if they are convicted as juveniles under state law. Two doctors concluded that Geyser was mentally incompetent to stand trial and Weier is currently undergoing competency tests, which must be completed by mid-October.

"New Zealand-born Gareth Anscombe has been named in the Wales squad for this season's RBS Six Nations Championship. The Cardiff Blues fly-half, 23, moved to Wales earlier this season and has made just nine appearances for his regional side. Anscombe, whose mother was born in Wales, is among four uncapped players in a 34-man group announced by head coach Warren Gatland. Gareth Anscombe (left), pictured in action for Cardiff Blues, has been called up to the Wales squad . Wales head coach Warren Gatland has named his 34-man squad for the RBS Six Nations . Backs: L Halfpenny (Toulon), L Williams (Scarlets), G North (Northampton), A Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), H Amos (Newport Gwent Dragons), T Morgan (Newport Gwent Dragons), S Williams (Scarlets), J Davies (Clermont Auvergne), J Roberts (Racing Metro), C Allen (Cardiff Blues), G Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), R Priestland (Scarlets), D Biggar (Ospreys), G Davies (Scarlets), R Webb (Ospreys), M Phillips (Racing Metro). Forwards: G Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), P James (Bath), R Evans (Scarlets), A Jarvis (Ospreys), S Lee (Scarlets), S Andrews (Cardiff Blues), R Hibbard (Gloucester), S Baldwin (Ospreys), K Dacey (Cardiff Blues), A-W Jones (Ospreys), J Ball (Scarlets), B Davies (Wasps), L Charteris (Racing Metro), D Lydiate (Ospreys), J King (Ospreys), S Warburton (Cardiff Blues, capt), J Tipuric (Ospreys), T Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Anscombe will be joined by fellow Test rookies in Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan, Scarlets prop Rob Evans and Blues hooker Kristian Dacey. There are no places, though, for 95 times-capped Blues prop Adam Jones or Gloucester fly-half James Hook. Hook's omission is not a surprise - he was left out of Gatland's autumn Test squad earlier this season - yet 33-year-old Adam Jones had been tipped for a recall after Scarlets forward Rhodri Jones suffered a shoulder injury. But Gatland has chosen Samson Lee, Aaron Jarvis and Scott Andrews as his three tighthead props, raising fresh question marks over Jones' international future. Anscombe, meanwhile, offers Gatland options at fly-half and full-back, although it remains to be see whether he features in the match-day 23 for Wales' Six Nations opener against England in Cardiff on February 6. Elsewhere in the squad there is a recall for fit-again Scarlets scrum-half Gareth Davies, who joins fellow number nines Rhys Webb and Mike Phillips, with Morgan featuring among the centres. Morgan, who is among seven players to have signed a national dual contract in Wales, has also been named in the Wales Under-20 squad for their Six Nations campaign, and he will be released from the senior camp to link up with the age group side. Prop Adam Jones has been left out of the Wales squad despite winning 95 caps for his country . Glucester fly-half James Cook (right) has also missed out on a place in Gatland's squad . Gatland said: 'It's great to be able to name such an experienced squad that also boasts some exciting young talent. 'The four uncapped players have all been going well for their respective regions, and it will be good to see them in this environment and we hope they take the opportunity.

"Follow Sportsmail's LIVE coverage of the Copa del Rey as Barcelona and Atletico Madrid kick-off their mouth-watering quarter-final tie at the Nou Camp. Diego Simeone's side travel to Catalunya having knocked out their fierce rivals Real Madrid in the last round, and they will be looking for a positive result in the first leg on the road. Barcelona, meanwhile, will hope to repeat their 3-1 victory over Atletico when the teams met at the Nou Camp in La Liga on January 12. Host commentator . It's advantage Barcelona going in to the return leg and Luis Enrique side deserved their 1-0 victory. The home side were the only team trying to win the match as Atletico defended with 10 men behind the ball for the entire 90 minutes. Simeone almost escaped with the draw and clean sheet he wanted, but Atleti's resistance was finally broken in the closing stages. The tie remains delicately poised but you would fancy Barcelona to score an away goal when the sides meet at the Vicente Calderon. It's all over. Barcelona take a slender lead into the second leg at Vicente Calderon. Godin will miss the second leg through suspension after bringing down Messi on the edge of the area. The Argentine gets the ball up and over the wall, but over the bar too. After holding firm for 85 minutes, can Atletico salvage a precious away goal in stoppage time? They have shown no attacking intent for the whole of this half, remember. Barclona finally make the breakthrough, but needed a bit of luck to breach the Atletico defence. There was contact form Juanfran on Busquets but the Barcelona midfielder went down easily. It was a fantastic save by Oblak but the ball rebounded perfectly to Messi to tuck into the empty net. Somewhere among the commotion of the penalty Atletico midfielder Gabi is shown a yellow card. Messi's penalty is saved by Oblak with a strong hand to his left. But the ball drops perfectly for Messi in the six-yard box and the forward couldn't miss. Barcelona take the lead with just over five minutes to play. Messi fired a free kick straight into the wall. Busquets picked the ball up and goes down under a challenge from Juanfan. Referee gives it. Javier Mascherano is shown a yellow card for dissent after the referee gives Barcelona a free kick for handball. The Barcelona defender was angry with the official for failing to give a similar decision moments earlier. Barcelona turn to midfield maestro Xavi in an attempt to cut through this formidable Ateltico defence. Luis Suarez went to ground under a challenge from Diego Godin as the Barcelona forward tries to latch on to a through pass. The referee waves away the appeals, however. Former Liverpool striker Suarez is incensed with the decision. Andres Iniesta tests the handling of Oblak with a decent strike form the edge of the area. But it was a simple save down to his left for the Atletico keeper. Messi unable to work his magic yet as Barcelona continue to struggle to create anything of note. Not one for the purists, but Atletico should be applauded for the type of defensive performance that has become a hallmark of Simeone's team. The away side are quite brilliantly squeezing the life out of this game as we head into the final 20 minutes. The end of the night for Greizmann as he is taken off and replaced by Raul Garcia with 25 minutes to play. Some neat bulid up play between Neymar and Iniesta ends with later attempting a strike from the edge of the box. But Koke threw his body in the way and the ball deflected kindly into the grateful arms of Oblak. Barcelona continuing to probe, but without much luck. The Atletico defence is continuing to hold firm as they successfully repel wave after wave of Barcelona attack. The game is almost like a training game but the attacking side are failing to break through a sturdy defence. Simeone's side are working tirelessly without the ball and Oblak has remained untroubled since the interval. The pattern of the first half has continued in much the same fashion. Barcelona dominating possession and making all the attacking moves as Atletico soak up the pressure and try to hit the Catalans on the break. Messi looking dangerous every time he gets the ball. The Argentine was just halted by a strong body-check, but the referee plays on. Barcelona have averaged nearly four goals a game at the Nou Camp this season. It looks as though they will have to produce something special to break down the Atletico defence tonight, however. Barcelona get the game back under way. Mario Mandzukic has replace Fernando Torres at half time. The first half ends goalless at the Nou Camp with this Copa del Rey quater-final first leg delicately poised. Barcelona have been frustrated by Atleti, who have defended deep with 10 men behind the ball. But Luis Enrique's side should be ahead. First Messi fired over from 12 yards before Suarez missed a gilt-edged chance from the edge of the six yard box. Atletico have tried to play on the break but have been wasteful in possession, but Simeone will be the happier of the two managers at the break. Atletico continue to be wasteful in possession. Simeone's side have offered next to nothing in terms of an attacking threat. 'Suarez done from behind by Godin. No action from referee. And to cofound his frustration he misses from five yards. ""Suarez! Suarez! Suarez!"" sing the Camp Nou.' The ball fell kindly to Fernando Torres who was one on one with Gerrard Pique. Greizmann joined the former Chelsea striker in the attack but Torres could only find the heel of Pique as he attempted to slide it through. Not sure how much the centre back knew about the interception. Barcelona should be ahead. A delightful first-time volleyed pass from Rakitic found Luis Suarez six yards out. But the striker could only fire a volley over the bar. He really should have scored. Barcelona are being crowded out in the final third as Atletico defend deep with everyone behind the ball. Every time on e of the Barca attackers get near the box he is accompanied by two or three Atleti players. Atletico Madrid have their first shot on goal as the ball drops to Arda Turan after another free kick. The midfielder doesn't catch the strike cleanly as Ter Stegen makes a comfortable save. 'Messi loitering with intent on the right for Barcelona and making a fool of left back Siqueira whenever he comes anywhere near him. Not seen too much of Atletico going forward Torres roundly jeered whenever he touches it - which from rival fans he'll gladly accept.' Barcelona continue to enjoy the lions' share of possession but the home side haven't been able to create a meaningful chance. Atleti have become more of an attacking force in the last five minutes. A couple of corners and free kicks have eased the pressure on their back line. The away side are having difficulty stringing three passes together in the opening 15 minutes. Diego Simeone turns away in disgust as another pass goes astray. Rakitic picked out Messi in the area with a smart cut-back. The Argentine takes one touch before volleying over the bar. It was a difficult chance on his right foot, but Messi should have hit the target. Luis Enrique's side have settled into the game well. Barcelona enjoying most of the possession as you would expect. Messi, Neymar and Iniesta are popping the ball about nicely in the final third as Atletico sit deep. Neymar sent a curling effort towards the far right corner of the Atletico goal but Oblak tipped the ball wide of the post. It was a great effort by the Brazilian but the Atleti keeper was equal to it. The resulting corner is cleared away. Atleti midfielder Koke has the game's first shot but can only lash a volley high and wide after the ball dropped to him on the edge of the area. Tonight's referee Mr Jose Luis Gonzalez Gonzalez will need to be in two places at once after the game two weeks ago produced nine yellows and a penalty. Kick-off just minutes away now. Moya Rumbo, Raúl García, Mandzuki, Jiménez, Ñíguez, Gámez, Giménez de Vargas . Masip, Xavi, Pedro, Rafinha, Bartra, Roberto, Adriano . Kick-off is just over 10 minutes away at the Nou Camp. 'Fernando Torres has eight goals in 12 games against Barça. He loves a goal at the Camp Nou, scored here for Chelsea too. The other former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez tonight faces two Uruguayan team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez.'

Six thousands participants donned 19th century military costumes for the commemoration to a battle that was the turning point in the Napoleonic wars. The battle has been described as the largest seen on European soil before World War I. The original battle involved about 500,000 soldiers and pitted the coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria, Sweden and England against the French army outside of Leipzig in 1813. It ended in a defeat of the French army which sealed the end of Napoleon's hegemony over Europe. About 90,000 people died on the battlefields outside of Leipzig.

The Battle of Nations was the bloodiest of the Napoleonic wars . The Battle of Nations, also known as the Battle of Leipzig, was the turning point in the Napoleonic wars. It was a decisive defeat for Napoleon and he was exiled to Elba within a year. Some 320,000 coalition forces from Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden beat Napoleon's 185,000-strong French army in the conflict between October 16 and 19, 1813. The battle is the largest and bloodiest of the Napoleonic wars. Between 80,000 and 110,000 soldiers were either killed, wounded of missing on both sides. The Allies captured 15,000 Frenchmen, as well as hundreds of cannon. The victory marked the end of the French Empire east of the Rhine. The defeat was also significant for Napoleon himself as it was the first time he had lost. With his army depleted and morale low, coalition forces invaded France in early 1814, within months of the Battle of Nations. Napoleon was forced from the throne of France and was then sent in exile to the island of Elba. One actor, playing a Napoleonic soldier, takes a break before the re-enactment began on Sunday .

"Speaking out: Robert Peston has written a powerful article to admit that pupils 'knew it went on' Robert Peston revealed last night he is haunted by the  sexual abuse that went on at his former school. The BBC’s economics editor believes the ‘hideous predilection’ of at least one teacher was regarded as an ‘eccentricity to be tolerated’ in the liberal 1970s. ‘Goodness knows how many other paedophiles were for years able to get away with it in schools like mine,’ he wrote in a newspaper article. Mr Peston admitted that his ‘fond memories’ of his state school had been replaced by anxieties as a parent about ‘the vulnerability of our children even in institutions that seem caring and healthy’. Having previously seen his school as a ‘haven and refuge from the badness in the world’, Mr Peston was forced to reappraise his feelings after a former pupil wrote to him to reveal he had been sexually abused there. Mr Peston attended Highgate Wood comprehensive in north London in the 1970s. Former assistant headteacher Andrew Adams, now 68, who was a games teacher when Mr Peston was there and even had a wing named after him, was jailed for 12 years in July after admitting multiple serious sexual offences. Mr Peston – a champion of state education – was not aware of the crimes until the victim, a former student in the 1980s, contacted him a few weeks ago. In a powerful article for The Times, he wrote: ‘I was never close to Adams because I was a swot and not a jock, although I remember him as a bit of a bully.’ He continued: ‘When the victim sent me the charge sheet and his witness statement, it became clear that Adams was a paedophile.’ However, Mr Peston revealed in the article he did recall another teacher at the school who asked boys to urinate into a cup in front of him. He wrote: ‘This teacher had a cupboard at the back of his classroom, into which he would invite certain boys to make him his “special orange juice”. They peed into a cup in front of him. ‘Everybody in my year and adjacent years knew it was happening. The more confident, savvier kids, like me, steered clear. But for reasons that I don’t fully understand today, I never told my parents or any teacher about any of this.’ He added: ‘All of this has haunted me in a relatively low level way for a long time.’ Revelations: The former assistant head teacher at Highgate Wood School in Haringey is now serving a 12-year prison sentence for his crimes in the 1970s. At the time, it was regarded as 'eccentricity to be tolerated' He added: ‘What I now think is that the Highgate Wood of the  liberal 1970s regarded the teacher’s hideous predilection for seeing boys p*** as an eccentricity to be tolerated.’ The journalist said he previously asked a former Haringey councillor, now dead, if she was aware of the claims and was told that the teacher was quietly removed from the school after an incident came to the council’s attention. Mr Peston said his fond memories of his former school spurred him to set up a charity, Speakers for Schools, which provides talks for children from inspirational people. He said: ‘This re-examination has not led me to conclude that Highgate Wood was a poor school, but it has made me anxious, as a parent, about the vulnerability of our  children even in institutions that seem caring and healthy.’ Mr Peston added that when he asked whether Haringey Council had any records of the teacher being moved, he was told if he had concerns of further criminality, they should be referred to the police. No one at Haringey Council was available for comment last night.","Robert Peston admits 'fond memories' of school now replaced by anxiety .

"The family of the first ever Arab honoured for saving a Jew from the Nazi Holocaust and helping others with medical treatment have rejected the accolade because of their hatred for Israel. Egyptian doctor Mohamed Helmy was honored posthumously last month by Israel’s Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem for hiding a Jew in Berlin during wartime. The 'Righteous Among the Nations' award is the highest Israel can bestow upon non-Jews in recognition for helping people to survive the genocide - at great personal risk - which claimed six million lives. Brave: Dr Mohamed Helmy secretly hid Anna Boros in his cottage near Berlin to save her from being sent to a death camp like Belzec, in occupied Poland, pictured, guarded by armed Nazis . But the family of the heroic doctor - the first Muslim ever to be recognised for his bravery in such a way - say they want nothing to do with it. 'If any other country offered to honor Helmy, we would have been happy with it,' said Mervat Hassan, the wife of Helmy’s great-nephew.  'But not from Israel. I do, however, respect Judaism as a religion, and I respect Jews. Islam recognizes Judaism as a heavenly religion.' Helmy lived in Berlin and hid several Jews during the Holocaust. Born in 1901 in Khartoum, in what was then Egypt and is now Sudan, to an Egyptian father and a German mother, he went to Berlin in 1922 - 11 years before the Nazis came to power - to study medicine. In 1938 the Nuremberg Laws, intended to remove Jews from all spheres of public life, were enacted against him when he was banned from his medical practice because racial quacks said he was not considered 'Ayran' - the term Nazis used to denote those they considered unworthy of equal status with Germans. Auschwitz: Ms Boros, a Jew, would likely have been sent to Auschwitz in occupied Poland, pictured, if Dr Helmy had not risked his life by hiding her in his Berlin home . Rejected: Despite putting his own life on the line for someone else, Dr Helmy's family have rejected an honour from the Jewish remembrance group Yad Vashem. Pictured, the train tracks at Birkenau, Auschwitz . When the war began the regime started to . systematically deport the capital's Jews to destinations in occupied . Poland for extermination, including Auschwitz and Treblinka. Dr Helmy . hid 21-year-old Anna Boros, a family friend, at a cottage on the . outskirts of the city, and provided her relatives with medical care . against the strict instructions of the Nazi high command. After Boros’s relatives admitted to Gestapo interrogators that he was hiding her he arranged for her to hide at an acquaintance’s house. Anna and four family members eventually escaped to Israel. 'The Gestapo knew that Dr Helmy was our family physician, and they knew that he owned a cottage.  He managed to evade all their interrogations,' Boros, later Mrs Gutman, wrote after the war, according to Yad Vashem’s citation. 'Dr Helmy did everything for me out of the generosity of his heart, and I will be grateful to him for eternity.' Yad Vashem painstakingly tries to recognise the bravery of all non-Jews who risked their own lives to help others. Perhaps the most famous of the Righteous Among the Nations heroes is Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist immortalised in the Spielberg film Schindler's List who saved almost the entire Jewish workforce of his factory in Krakow, Poland, from death in the gas chambers. The late Dr Mohamed Helmy's family refuse to accept the certificate, shown here by Irena Steinfeldt, an official at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial . Dr Helmy's family in Egypt reject the award because it comes from Israel-based Yad Vashem, which remembers those who risked their lives to save Jews. Pictured, photographs of Jewish victims of the Nazis in the Hall of Names of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem . Yad Vashem said it was disappointed at the rejection of the honour stating: 'We regret that political sentiment seems to have overcome the human aspect, and we hope that one day the latter will prevail. 'In a world of total moral collapse, there was a small minority who mustered extraordinary courage to uphold human values. Bystanders were the rule; rescuers were the exception. Helmy was one of them.' Dr Helmy died in 1982. After the war, he stayed in Germany with his fiancée whom he married.  His Egyptian relatives sometimes visited, including a great nephew and his wife who now rejects the award on behalf of surviving relatives.","Dr Mohamed Helmy risked his life by hiding Jewish Anna Boros in WWII .

"On cue: Dancing can help Parkinson's sufferers with balance and movement . Dancing the tango or an Irish jig may improve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. New research shows that after dancing twice a week, patients were able to take up physical activities that they had been unable to perform since developing the disease. Trials are now under way at a number of centres, including the University of Southampton, where the effects of dance on the disease are being investigated. The 127,000 Britons with Parkinson’s disease suffer a progressive loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in levels of a brain chemical called dopamine. Just what triggers this loss is not known, but is probably down to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Dopamine plays a key role in regulating the movement of the body and a drop in levels causes involuntary shaking, muscle stiffness and a slowing down of physical movements. There is currently no cure for Parkinson’s but several  treatments are available to help control symptoms. Turning and walking backwards are among the tasks that sufferers have the most difficulty with. In new research at Washington University School of Medicine, Parkinson’s patients took part in twice-weekly one-hour sessions of tango dancing. Results show that by the end of the year-long study, there were significant improvements in  their balance and mobility compared with patients who did conventional exercises. Another study at the University of California tracked eye movement during dancing exercises. People with Parkinson’s can have difficulty co-ordinating  their eye movements, and researchers believe that the music and movements involved in dancing may help the brain to get around the balance and movement problems. A third piece of research, being led by the University of Limerick, found that patients who practised traditional Irish set dancing – often to referred to as a jig – fell less often and were more mobile after regular set dancing lessons. Benefits may be down to exercise, the strong rhythm of Irish music and the sociability of group dances. Parkinson’s research first turned to set . dancing after Italian doctor Daniele Volpe had a chance encounter in a . Co Clare village. Treadmill turn-off: Researchers found Parkinson's patients were more willing to retain dancing as an exercise compared to traditional gym workouts . While attending a traditional music festival, he saw  a man walk in  with distinct Parkinson’s symptoms and start dancing  in a ‘fluent’ way. Along with Dublin-based researcher  Timothy Lynch, Dr Volpe put  24 patients with Parkinson’s through weekly set dancing classes for six months. When measured against a control group, all of them saw improvement in balance, mobility and quality of life. They found it easier to change direction and to start moving again after they had stopped. In 20 years of sending patients  to the gym, to swimming and to treadmill-based rehabilitation, he said that when it came to dancing, patients were far more willing to continue with the exercise. It is suggested that external  cues such as music bypass the areas of the brain rendered dysfunctional by the disease and activate other areas involved in movement. The movement of the dance partner and the physical contact involved also act as cues.  Co-ordinated steps with partners lead to faster movement, while physical contact improves balance. The tango may be particularly useful because it involves rhythmic rocking, or shifting weight from foot to foot – a strategy commonly used to address muscle ‘freezing’. Alongside the Southampton study, which is also looking at the tango, a second trial is under way at the University of Limerick, where Irish set dancing is being used. Parkinson’s UK is also looking at the benefits of Zumba – the Latin-inspired dance fitness craze.","Parkinson's sees a progressive loss of nerve cells and dopamine .

"The gilded lives of premiership footballers and their families are often a source of fascination: a dizzying whirl of flash  cars, sprawling houses, and lurching from one luxury holiday or swanky nightclub to the next. Yet the material trappings of success mean refreshingly little to  West Bromwich Albion defender Steven Reid. While many in his position may lavish their children with the sort of lifestyle few can imagine, he is simply concerned with helping his son Harry to hold a pen and draw. Devoted dad: West Bromwich Albion defender Steven is a hands-on father to help his son Harry overcome his eye problem . The four-year-old has the sight condition nystagmus, which causes the eyeballs to move uncontrollably – often described as a wobble or flicker. It results in a range of problems with vision, balance and co-ordination, depending on the severity. Those with nystagmus may have trouble negotiating uneven ground or stairs as their depth of perception can be impaired. Children may need extra time for reading and exams to allow their eyes to focus. And if you’re dining with a sufferer, it will probably take them longer to peruse a menu. Steven knows his son will never follow him into elite sports, or even hold a driving licence. Yet he and his wife Kathleen, 31, are absolutely determined that the condition will never stop Harry from being a success. True defender: Footballer Steven, pictured during a match between West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland, has recently become a patron for a nystagmus charity - a condition which affects up to 125,000 Britons . ‘Although Harry’s eyes aren’t the same as other children’s, he doesn’t need to wear glasses and is doing  all the things he should at his age,’ says proud father Steven, who recently became patron of the charity Nystagmus Network. ‘He’s inquisitive and he loves to draw pictures and read books, both of which encourage his eyes to focus. He can hold a pen nicely and writes really well.’ Like all new parents, he and Kathleen were besotted with Harry the moment he was born in April 2009. But one thing concerned them – when Harry tentatively opened his eyes for the first time, his eyeballs wobbled constantly from side to side. ‘The midwife and health visitor told us he was probably just learning to focus and not to worry,’ says Steven, who was playing for Blackburn Rovers at the time. ‘But when Kathleen took him for his three-month check-up, she saw a different health visitor who picked up on it straight away and asked if Harry had nystagmus.’ Steven was in Austria for pre-season . training but flew home immediately to be with Kathleen while Harry had . more tests with an ophthalmologist in Manchester. Like many of us, the couple had never . heard of the condition before then. Yet nystagmus is common  – it is . estimated it affects up to  125,000 Britons. Typically, children are born with the . condition, although adults can also develop it due to injury or . illness. It is incurable, and varies  in how much visual impairment  it . causes, but usually doesn’t get worse after childhood. Sight will be . blurred, with poor distance vision. Historically, those with nystagmus – and, for that matter, most other serious visual impairments – were excluded socially. Statistics provided by the Royal . National Institute for the Blind reveal that in 2004, nine out of ten . employers rated blind and partially sighted people as either ‘difficult’ or ‘impossible’ to employ. Blurred lines: Sufferers of nystagmus often have an impaired depth of perception, needing extra time to read and write to allow their eyes to focus . A study two years later concluded . that nearly half of blind and partially sighted people felt ‘moderately’ or ‘completely’ cut off from people and things around them. Another report in 2012 showed that . two-thirds of working-age people with sight problems experience . ‘restriction in being able to access and fully participate in . employment’. Such statistics make grim reading. But they disguise the fact that a major sea change has taken place  in . recent decades, as Steve McKay, trustee of Nystagmus Network and himself . a sufferer, has found. ‘As a child, I was sent to a special . school for partially sighted kids, which gave out the message that we . wouldn’t be able to achieve the same things in life as those without . sight problems,’ he says. ‘That changed in the 1980s when it was . realised that, with the right practical support, children with . nystagmus could thrive in mainstream schools and should be given the . chance to do so. ‘Now that diagnosis frequently happens in . infancy and parents  are provided with support for  their children, we . see countless sufferers go on to achieve university degrees and . professional careers  in the likes of banking and the  civil service.’ Nystagmus is a complex condition with numerous variants, though essentially there are two types. It can be present from birth or acquired later as a result of a  head injury, stroke or brain tumour. It also commonly occurs in people with albinism. Experts think the involuntary movement of the eyeball occurs because the sensors in the  brain that control eye movements are malfunctioning. Many patients will have impaired vision requiring glasses or contact lenses – although these won’t correct the blurring that nystagmus causes. Those with severe  problems will need to register as partially sighted or blind, and many will never be able to drive . Patients may benefit from medication. The epilepsy drug Gabapentin and the neuroprotective drug memantine can help reduce eye movement, but they don’t work for everyone. Surgery works well and  involves weakening two of the eye muscles by moving them further back on the eye, while shortening the two opposite muscles to strengthen them. A newer operation removes and reattaches extraocular muscles –each eye has six extraocular muscles which work to move the eyes in different directions of gaze. For further information, advice  or support, visit nystagmusnet.org. One of the experts Steven Reid’s son saw recently is Irene Gottlob, Professor of Ophthalmology at Leicester University and a consultant at Leicester Royal Infirmary. She agrees that optimism is key and that it’s highly unlikely Harry’s condition will worsen as he gets older. ‘On the contrary,’ she says. ‘In babies the eyes move wildly at first, but this calms down in the first two years as they learn to control and focus their eyes, just as in Harry’s case. The condition should settle down further between now and his teenage years and is unlikely to deteriorate after that. Children with the condition should be encouraged to live as normal a life as possible. ‘In most patients their nystagmus is “quietest” when they look in a certain direction. This is the position at which it’s easiest for them to see well. If the nystagmus is quietest to the right, the patient will naturally turn their head to the left so they can turn their eyes to the right where their vision is best.’ Steven and Kathleen have worked hard to dramatically improve Harry’s condition. ‘Under the guidance of our consultant, we did daily exercise sessions at home for the first two years of Harry’s life using special light cubes in a darkened room to encourage his eyes to focus and track the light,’ Steven explains. ‘Before that, if we moved a toy in front of him or waved our hands he didn’t respond. But we noticed a big improvement quite quickly.’ Harry has been going to nursery at the school where his big sister Isla, six, is a pupil, and he will start reception class there next month. ‘As a parent, the one word you don’t want to hear is that your child is coping at school,’ Steven continues. ‘Coping isn’t good enough – you want them to thrive. ‘It’s simple things that will make a huge difference to Harry’s confidence and development at school, such as having a coat peg at a height he can focus on, and a seat that affords him a good view of the teacher and the board – all of which we’ve put in place with the school. ‘Our greatest hope is that Harry can achieve his maximum potential in whatever it is that interests him or he is good at, and that he develops into a happy and confident young man. 'My biggest concern is that he doesn’t suffer socially because of his constant eye wobble. Kids can be very cruel if they spot that there’s something different about another child.’ For Harry, it’s now a case of having check-ups every three months and doing the things that most other little boys love to do, such as spending the summer holidays enjoying rough and tumble and a game of football in the garden with his dad.","Footballer Steven Reid's son Harry has sight condition nystagmus .

His overall winning image, Celtic Warrior, shows a soldier from the 1st Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland cleaning his personal weapon after an early morning patrol to an Afghan National Army checkpoint. Speaking of the winning portrait, the photographer told NBC news: 'When we returned to base [after patrol] the guys just clean their . rifles and get their equipment ready in case they need to go straight . out in a hurry.' 'That's the thing with being a photographer: . When all the guys are back on their down time you still have a job to . do; you are photographing that as well.' 'Because we are military photographers we know . what to do when we get shot at and we know what's going to happen next,' he said. 'The only time that we would put the camera . down and pick up the rifle is if there is enemy fire that comes close to . you and hits close to you.'

'Because I used to be a Royal Engineer, I know how hard these guys work during those operations – working dawn-till-dusk, with full body armor and helmets, really, really tough manual labor — so I sympathized with the guys who were up on top of that roof.'

'Everywhere we went there was a story to tell, from the experiences of the private soldiers right to the HQ level of planning and executing the missions.'

'I learnt on operations that you can't photograph a bullet but you can capture the human reactions, to try to tell the whole story in one image. 'In my current job there's just as much pressure to capture that split second moment, whether it's the ceremony of official engagements or capturing the bond between a cavalryman and his horse.' Other winning photos feature boxing matches, horses being exercised and soldiers on duty. The pictures are now on display at the National Army Museum in Chelsea. Broadcaster Dan Snow, who is honorary colonel of the Army's media operations group and opened the display, said: 'These professional and amateur pictures capture elements of Army life that we just don't see otherwise, and it's a reminder that excellence on operations is not only about the frontline, but also about the individual, the bond between soldiers, the training and hard work, and also the lighter side of life.'

"Waded in: Foreign correspondent John Simpson in Tiananmen square in 2012 . As the BBC’s veteran world affairs editor, he has witnessed some of the bloodiest conflicts of recent decades. But when the cameras have stopped rolling, it seems John Simpson is not afraid of dishing out some violence himself. The foreign correspondent claims he once ‘waded in’ during the Tiananmen Square protests in Peking and ‘whacked’ a mob of angry students to stop them killing Chinese soldiers. And while reporting on the invasion of Iraq in 2003, he said he attacked a US marine with his walking stick to prevent him from shooting an innocent civilian. Simpson, 68, said he is ‘not terribly proud’ of his exploits, but insisted journalists have a duty to ‘step in’ to prevent terrible crimes. He said one such event happened while he was reporting from Tiananmen Square in 1989. He saw protesters dragging soldiers from an armoured personnel carrier and beating them savagely. He told the Radio Times: ‘The crowd was a very rough lot, not nice students, and they wanted blood. They smashed the head of one of the soldiers in, and then they started to smash another one in and I thought, ‘I can’t stand by and just let this happen,’ and so I waded in. I used to be a rugby player and a boxer and I’m quite big and so on… and so I whacked them to one side.’ In 2001, Simpson dressed himself as a woman in a burka to smuggle himself into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan before the US invasion, and was mocked for claiming the BBC had ‘liberated’ Kabul as he walked into the city ahead of conquering troops. He later admitted getting ‘a bit carried away’ and said he regretted his choice of words. Near misses: John Simpson reporting on a 'friendly fire' incident in Iraq when American forces jet bombed a convoy . In 2003, the reporter was injured in Northern Iraq when a US warplane bombed a convoy of American and Kurdish forces. His interpreter was killed in the friendly-fire attack and he was left with a damaged ear and shrapnel in his leg. Simpson said he intervened again while entering the Iraqi city of Tikrit – Saddam Hussein’s hometown – with US forces. He said: ‘I had this injury so I had a walking stick. There was a house with a flat roof, just on the other side of the road, and some poor old boy was hanging up a carpet to dry and one of the US marines I was with swung his rifle round and shouted out ‘Sniper! Sniper!’ and I whacked him in the back with my stick. ‘I did enjoy the whacking, yes. They were nervous and were given the impression by their officers that if they did kill somebody and it was done in self-defence, so be it. And that was really why my team and I got bombed and they killed 18 people, including my translators – and how I got my shrapnel.’ He added: ‘I don’t go interfering in things by and large. But I do think if you see somebody doing something really, really awful and you could stop it, you’ve got a duty to step in. I don’t think you can say, “I’m a journalist,” and do nothing.’ Simpson is married to his former producer Dee Kruger, who, at 49, is 19 years younger than him.They have a seven-year-old son, Rafe. Despite his rugged exterior, Simpson said he cries easily. He said: ‘It does tend to happen to you in old age, it’s a condition called…emotional lability. I read about it somewhere. Winston Churchill had it – he used to get it if people talked about honour or glory or generosity. ‘I had it, of course, when my son was born but it isn’t always about wonderful or, indeed, terrible moments. What sets me off is generosity, too, and people’s kindness.’ The reporter added he wishes he could be more like 65-year-old Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow, saying: ‘He’s so thin and cool and iconic.’","Broadcaster has revealed his scrapes in warzones around the world .

"Tennis champ Andy Murray has taken to Twitter to complain about unfair treatment, appearing to accuse the public and media of favouring his rival, Rafael Nadal. Third seed Nadal is being broadly applauded for the strength he showed when he battled through a cramp to claim victory over American Tim Smyczek on Wednesday. Yet sixth seed Andy Murray has sent out a bitter tweet, which is a thinly-veiled swipe at his critics for their supposed double standards. Murray claims that he was ridiculed after the US Open when he triumphed despite suffering a similar injury to Nadal. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray has been dubbed 'Angry Murray' by fans after sending this tweet after Nadal's inspiring Round Three performance at the Australian Open . Rafael Nadal suffered crippling cramps during his play-off against American Tim Smyczek, but has been widely championed for his perseverance. The Spaniard went on to win in a four hour battle . Andy Murray has pointed out that when he suffered muscle cramps in Round One of the 2014 US Open that he was allegedly called 'a drama queen'. He believes there are double standards amongst his critics . 'When I cramped and won in the us open last year I was a ""drama Queen, unfit, needs to see a shrink, faker"" weird... (sic)' tweeted the Scot. Many speculate this tweet was a reference to the support Nadal has received, who won his tense four-hour, five set play-off despite excrutiating cramps, following six months plagued by injuries. Murray is quick to point out that he has also had his share of injuries, particularly in the US Open. Just two sets into the match against Robin Haase in August last year Murray began to complain about crippling muscle pain. However, the World No.6 went on to win the match in four sets. 'It’s not the worst I have ever felt necessarily, but it’s the worst I have ever felt after an hour and a half of a tennis match,' Murray said at the time after his first round victory. Rafael Nadal talks to his doctors in his second round match against Tim Smyczek of USA during day three of the 2015 Australian Open . Andy Murray (left) and Rafael Nadal (right) pictured together at the ATP Tour Rakuten Open Tennis in Japan in October 2011 . Twitter users were quick to criticise Murray for his negativity. 'Angry Murray is at it again. #bitter #alwaysangry,' tweeted 'Wio'. 'your a sook that's underachieved because of a lack of heart .. Nadal is all heart (sic),' tweeted Cameron Byrne. Others argued that Murray's claims about double standards were inaccurate. 'But last year Nadal was booed loudly in the Aus Open final while he was in pain, so it is not just happening to you,' pointed out Peter Wong. However, others supported Murray, claiming he is just 'sticking up for himself' and advising him to ignore his critics. 'Just laugh at the jealous envious miserable gits Andy. But glad you spoke out champ. You're my hero,' tweet Maureen Stewart-Jones. Andy Murray is also through to the third round after overcoming Australian Marinko Matosevic in three sets on Wednesday. Tennis fans have keenly followed Nadal's Australian Open campaign following a turbulent six months, riddled with injuries.

Andy Murray signs autographs as he is greeted by fans on Thursday after sending his tweeting accusing the public and media of being too critical . Andy Murray practising on Thursday in Melbourne after sending the tweet in question . Just two days before the Open began, Rafael Nadal declared that he isn't fit enough to win the tournament and revealed that his confidence has also taken a battering during his hiatus from the sport. 'I would be lying if I say I feel that I am ready to win,' Nadal said in a news conference. Asked what aspect of his game he was happiest with, Nadal replied: 'Nothing.' The former World No.1 was quick to clarify that doubts are a natural part of the game. 'Every time you come back, you have doubts, you have the feeling that you are far from your best,' Nadal said. 'The only thing I can say is I need to play better, yes. But the only way to play better is to win matches.' It has been a turbulent year for the 28-year-old, who was only able to return to training in December. Nadal was forced to withdraw from the US Open in August due to an injured right wrist which ultimately saw him sidelined for 13 weeks. He returned in September for the China Open on September 30, but his hopes of a comeback were quickly shattered when appendicitis ended his 2014 season. However, even after he was diagnosed with appendicitis Nadal refused to call it quits. While suffering with crippling pain the 28-year-old managed to battle through the Shanghai Rolex Masters, depending on antibiotics until he could finally undergo surgery.

"A senior Communist Party official says that 'uncivilised behaviour' by Chinese tourists is harming China's image abroad. Wang Yang, one of the country's four vice-prime ministers, said holidaymakers should be more polite, singling out talking loudly and spitting as poor behaviour by his fellow citizens. It was revealed last month that the Chinese are the world's biggest spending tourists, splashing out $102billion on foreign trips in 2012, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation. A Communist Party official has warned Chinese tourists to behave better when abroad to stop harming China's image (file photo) Chinese tourists make 83million trips abroad last year, compared with only 10million in 2000, becoming the single biggest source of global tourism income. Writing in the official party newspaper .

He said Chinese authorities should 'guide . tourists to conscientiously abide by public order and social ethics, . respect local religious beliefs and customs, mind their speech and . behaviour... and protect the environment'. However, some Chinese tourists say they are treated 'like second-class citizens' when they are abroad. 'Chinese internet forums were flooded with protests earlier this year when news emerged that a hotel in the Maldives had removed kettles from rooms occupied by Chinese tourists,' said the BBC's Beiijing correspondent Celia Hatton.

"Facebook users have been banned from the social network after talking about the traditional English delicacy faggots. One man had his account shut down for 12 hours after writing 'I like faggots', while another was kicked off the site for posting a picture of the dish. The social media giant says that the crackdown on the word was the result of a confusion with a derogatory slang term for gay people. Tasty: But Facebook users have been banned from discussing the English offal dish faggots . Faggots are a dish resembling a large meatball made from offal such as pig hearts and liver, and are particularly popular in the Midlands and Wales after catching on during the Second World War. But their name has long been a source of controversy, particularly in the U.S., where 'faggot' is considered one of the most offensive words imaginable. Robert Wilkes, 54, received a 12-hour ban from Facebook when he posted 'I like faggots' on his account and was accused of 'homophobic language'. He insisted he was only reminiscing about the meals he enjoyed when growing up in the Black Country. 'It may have a different meaning in America but I used it in a food context,' he told The Sun. Eileen Perrins, 68, from Shropshire also . had her account shut down for 12 hours when she put up a picture of the . dish, also known as 'savoury ducks'. Crackdown: The site confused the name of the dish with an offensive slang term for gay people . Margaret Jones was given a temporary ban from the site after commenting on the bans slapped on other people. 'I'm disgusted with Facebook's reaction to the word faggots,' the 68-year-old told the Express & Star. 'It's a delicacy in the Black Country.' A spokesman for Mr Brain's, the leading brand of faggots, urged Facebook to allow its customers to discuss their favourite meals. 'We understand it's disappointing for people to be banned by Facebook, however we also appreciate that Facebook has to act responsibly concerning comments posted on their site,' the company said. 'Hopefully Facebook has now solved the issue so that fans of Mr Brain's Faggots can once again comment freely without being inhibited.' A spokesman for Facebook admitted that one post had been removed in error as a result of a misunderstanding. However, she added that the word was not considered offensive when used in a culinary context. The site has come under fire in recent weeks for its policies on what type of content is allowed to be posted by users. A number of sick videos of executions were being openly shared on the site, even though some photographs of nursing mothers have been banned. Even David Cameron spoke out against Facebook, forcing it to revise its policies.","Robert Wilkes, 54, was banned from the site for writing, 'I like faggots'

Neil was their 31-year-old captain when he replaced Billy Reid following a seven-year reign. Hamilton are set to announce caretaker boss Martin Canning as their new manager on Friday . Canning, 33, has made almost 250 appearances for Accies since joining from Hibernian in 2008. The club have called a media conference for 1.30pm on Friday where they will introduce their new management team. Vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald gave a strong indication of the club's preferred route ahead of their heavy defeat at Firhill on Wednesday night. MacDonald told BBC Scotland: 'We have a clear, clear idea of what we want to do and I'm very happy with the course we are going to go down. 'We are looking for continuity. We don't understand these clubs that have a plan, tear it up, then have another plan. 'We are looking for continuity and people that understand where we are as a club. We are a small club trying to do our best. Defender Canning has been in caretaker charge for three consecutive defeats since Alex Neil left for Norwich . 'The manager has just got to accept that if we sell a good player that's life and the next one comes in. 'At the moment we are top of the under-17s and top of the under-20s so these boys are all desperate for their chance.' Reports suggest Hamilton will bring Guillaume Beuzelin into their coaching team. The Frenchman played alongside Canning at Easter Road and then at Hamilton, where he spent the 2009-10 season. Beuzelin, who is currently assistant manager to Ian Murray at Dumbarton, will be replacing Frankie McAvoy, who is joining Neil at Norwich next week. McAvoy is saying farewell to Accies after a decade when they host Inverness on Saturday in a game billed as a tribute to both him and Neil, with entry prices cut to 10 pence.

"Dead: Brigadier General Hassan Moghaddam was fatally injured in the blast . A senior commander of Iran's missile development programme has been killed in an explosion at a military base - prompting speculation that Mossad was involved. Brigadier General Hassan Moghaddam was fatally injured in the blast, which killed 17 people in total, at a Revolutionary Guard compound 25 miles east of the capital Tehran. Iranian authorities have claimed the explosion was caused by 'an accident' when ammunition was being moved. But Moghaddam's high profile has led to speculation it was an act of sabotage by the Israeli intelligence service - or even its American counterpart the CIA - which is trying to halt Iran's nuclear weapons programme. It comes in the same week the son of a former Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander was found dead in a Dubai hotel room. His father's website has called the death 'suspicious' but police have insisted it was not. Moghaddam was said to be responsible for 'industrial research aimed at ensuring self-sufficiency of the Revolutionary Guards' armaments'. Commentators on Iran believe this is a coded way of saying he was responsible for its missile inventory. Richard Silverstein, who regularly reveals information censored inside Israel, said on his blog that a source confirmed Mossad had worked with exile group the People's Mojaheddin of Iran (MEK) on the blast. He said: 'It is widely known within intelligence circles that the Israelis use the MEK for varied acts of espionage and terror.' It is the latest 'disaster' to hit Iran's nuclear programme in the last two years. In 2010, 18 people were killed after an explosion at a base which housed Shahab-3 long-range missiles. It was also put down to a fire in an ammunition depot. Scroll down for video... Blast: Brigadier General Hassan Moghaddam was fatally injured in the November 12 blast, which killed 17 people in total, at a Revolutionary Guard compound 25 miles east of the capital Tehran . Blast: The aftershock of the explosion was felt for miles around . In the same year, a senior nuclear scientist was killed and another injured when their cars were attacked with 'sticky bombs' by men on motorbikes. And a highly sophisticated computer worm which caused centrifuges used for enriching uranium to spin out of control was also blamed on the Israelis. The explosion comes as the son of a former Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander was found dead in a Dubai hotel room. Ahmad Rezaie reportedly died inside Hotel Gloria (right), a four-star hotel in the coastal United Arab Emirates city, on Sunday. Khalil Ebrahim Al Mansouri, head of the Dubai police's criminal investigations department, said there is no criminal suspicion surrounding the man's death and that Rezaie suffered from epilepsy. But Tabnak, a website owned by the dead man's father, Mohsen Rezaie, claimed Ahmad 'was killed under suspicious circumstances'. The site noted the death was 'concurrent with the martyrdom of Mohsen Rezaie's comrades in arms' on Saturday, referring to the Revolutionary Guard explosion. The semi-official Mehrs News Agency reported that Rezaie died from an electric shock. His father served as head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard. In 2009, he ran - unsuccessfully - as a conservative candidate along with others against incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mossad, which never claims responsibility for attacks, has been suspected of being involved in all of the incidents. But Shahin Gobadi, a spokesman for the MEK, denied 'absolutely' that his group was involved and the explosion could be down to the Revolutionary Guard, which he said has a reputation for 'sloppiness'. Revolutionary Guard spokesman Gen Ramazan Sharif said Saturday's blast also injured a further 16 people, and he denied further claims that the explosion happened as the Guard tried to fit a missile with a nuclear warhead. He said: 'My colleagues at the Guard were transporting ammunition at one of the depots at the site when an explosion occurred as a result of an accident.' The explosion comes a week after the release of an International Atomic Energy Agency report renewed calls inside Israel for a pre-emptive strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. It focused partly on efforts allegedly being made to fit such a warhead on a missile, and claimed Iran has been working to acquire equipment and weapons design information, testing high explosives and detonators and developing compute models of a warhead’s core. It is also in the same week that U.S. President Barack Obama said that economic sanctions against the country, aimed at halting the Iranian nuclear threat, were having 'enormous bite'. Obama, speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, added that he was united with Russian and Chinese leaders in ensuring Iran does not develop an atomic weapon and unleash an arms race across the Middle East. He did not specifically say he would consider military action if Tehran were to persist in arming itself with a nuclear weapon. Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) said he was united with Russia and China in making sure Iran, whose President is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (right) does not achieve nuclear weapons . But he added: 'We are not taking any options off the table. Iran with nuclear weapons would pose a threat not only to the region but also to the United States.' Obama's stand came laced with presidential politics. Republican presidential contenders, including former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, have slammed Obama for not doing more to keep Iran from getting nuclear weaponry. Iran . Responding to those criticisms, Obama said: 'Is this an easy issue? No. Anyone who claims it is is either politicking or doesn’t know what they’re talking about.' In meetings on Saturday with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao, Obama sought to rally support for putting new pressure on Iran’s regime. But there was little public sign either country was ready to drop its opposition to additional sanctions through the United Nations. Obama insisted the countries are working on the next steps. He said: 'All three of us entirely agree on the objective which is making sure that Iran does not weaponise nuclear power and we do not trigger a nuclear arms race in the region. 'That’s in the interest of all of us. We will be consulting with them carefully over the next several weeks to look at what other options we have available to us.' The U.S. has already slapped sanctions on dozens of Iranian government agencies, financial and shipping companies as well as officials over the nuclear program and could target additional institutions like Iran’s Central Bank. The UN has imposed four rounds of sanctions that have caused economic hardship in Iran. Obama added: 'The sanctions have enormous bite and enormous scope.'","Brigadier General Hassan Moghaddam fatally injured in explosion .

"Guardian deputy sports editor Barry Glendenning has been forced to apologise after calling the late Sir Jack Hayward 'a big, massive racist' The deputy sports editor of the Guardian has apologised after branding late philanthropist and ex-football club owner Sir Jack Hayward a 'racist' and comparing him to Hitler. Barry Glendenning was attacked on social media after using an appearance on podcast Football Weekly to criticise Sir Jack, who passed away on January 13. Mr Glendenning described the former chairman of Wolverhampton Wanderers as 'a big, massive racist' before commenting 'but in a kind of endearing way.' He went on to say that Sir Jack had once described himself as a 'xenophobe', adding: 'At least he was open about it, but then so was Adolf Hitler and that doesn’t make him a nice guy does it?' Furious Wolves supporters called on fans to boycott the Guardian in the wake of the remarks, with one user branding them 'out of order' and 'akin to criticising the buffet at the Last Supper'. Mr Glendenning was forced into an apology today, saying he was 'very sorry' he had used the word racist, and refuting allegations that he had compared Sir Jack to the Nazi leader. The controversial comments came less than a week after 91-year-old Sir Jack, who ploughed millions of pounds in Wolverhampton Wanderers FC, died in Florida. Appearing on a light-hearted sports talk show, Mr Glendenning was speaking about Sir Jack when an email from a listener called Greenmile was read out by presenter James Richardson. It said: 'I was a bit disappointed that your tribute to Sir Jack Hayward focused almost exclusively on him giving money to Wolves and kind of glossed over him being an appalling old racist bigot.' In response Glendenning said: 'It’s a fair point, he was a big massive racist, but in a kind of endearing way. 'On his estate in the Bahamas, no-one was allowed to drive a foreign car, only English models. He was quite openly xenophobic and racist, but yet he was also very generous. 'To think someone’s not even cold on the slab, maybe we should’ve touched on it at least. Mr Glendenning made the comments during a podcast on Sir Jack. He was attacked by Wolves supporters, who branded him 'scum' and said the remarks were 'akin to criticising the buffet at the Last Supper' 'As my mam says, ""if you don’t have anything nice to say about a dead person, then just don’t say anything"". At least he was open about his views, but so was Adolf Hitler and that does not make him a nice guy.' But the Guardian website was quickly flooded with comments criticising the remarks. Chris Harper wrote: 'The racism/hitler comments were out of order. Akin to criticising the buffet at the Last Supper.' Sir Jack Hayward was known as a big-hearted philanthropist and staunch patriot. He bought his boyhood football club Wolverhampton Wanderers for £2million in 1990, spent £50million taking them to the premier league, then sold the club for a token £10 in 2007. He also paid the equivalent of £2million in today's money to have the SS Great Britain brought back to this country after the Falklands War and restored. He also gave £1million to help rebuild a Falklands hospital, and another £1million to support widows and orphans. Another project of his was wildlife sanctuary Lundy Island, situated off the North Devon coast, which he bought for £150,000 in 1969 to 'stop it falling into foreign hands.' Instead of keeping it for himself, he turned it over to the National Trust, saving it for generations to come. He was knighted by Margaret Thatcher in 1986, and once hosted the Queen at his home in the Bahamas. While there, he served Her Majesty her favourite Malvern water, because he didn't want her drinking 'any of that foreign Perrier stuff'. He passed away in Florida on January 13. Dan Baillie added: 'Disgraceful stuff from you about £SirJack in your podcast. He gave so much to several causes, and all you do is cry ""racist""' Tom Hever tweeted: 'Just listened to a podcast on your website where Sir Jack Hayward was compared to Adolf Hitler. You horrible bunch of scum bags.' Neil Weav added: 'You should hand in your resignation immediately. Disgusting and disrespectful.' Earlier today Glendenning apologised for his comments, saying he 'used the wrong words'. He said: “I’m very sorry I said racist. He was by all accounts a very nice man. He had some old fashioned views. He was happy to declare himself a xenophobe. “Sir Jack was a great and generous man and a brilliant owner. I’m annoyed some Wolves fans now think that’s not my view. 'I certainly wasn’t comparing him to Hitler. I do not think in any way Sir Jack was like Hitler.' He later posted another apology on twitter, saying: 'I have no problem with him - he was a good and generous man. Just a bit old school in some of his views. 'It was misplaced yes, he had rather eccentric views but was by all accounts a top bloke. Will clarify on Thursday’s podcast.' Former World War II pilot Sir Jack, who became a millionaire after expanding his father’s agriculture business, bought his boyhood club in 1990. He went on to spend £70million of his personal fortune renovating their dilapidated Molineux stadium and propelling the club into the Premier League. He sold the club in 2007 for just £10 and retired to his home in the Bahamas before dying on January 13 following a long battle with ill health.","Sir Jack Hayward, former chairman of Wolves football club, died Jan 13 .

"A former Vanderbilt football player accused of raping an unconscious student has described how his teammates slapped and urinated on the woman while her boyfriend encouraged them to assault her. Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 20, took the stand in Nashville, Tennessee on Tuesday to testify in the rape trials of his former teammates Brandon Vandenburg, 21, and Cory Batey, 20. McKenzie is also accused of raping the woman in the Vanderbilt dorm room in June 2013 but he insists he never touched her. He and another defendant, Brandon Banks, 20, are awaiting trial. On Tuesday, he described in graphic detail how he went to the Gillette dorm with Batey and Banks after a night of heavy drinking at two different parties and came across Vandenburg and the woman. Scroll down for video . On the stand: Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 20, took the stand in Nashville, Tennessee on Tuesday to testify in the rape trials of his former teammates at Vanderbilt. He is also accused of assaulting a woman . Graphic: McKenzie told the court how he watched the men slap the unconscious woman and assault her . The couple had been on a date earlier that evening but she had passed out in the car on the ride back to campus after drinking too much, according to previous testimony. McKenzie said the woman was taken into Vandenburg's dorm room and then he saw Batey starting to sexually assault her as Vandeburg 'coached' them on what to do, according to updates of the testimony shared by Tony Gonzalez of The Tennessean. Vandenburg said he was too 'amped' on cocaine to be able to have sex with her but 'egged on' the others and switched on porn, McKenzie told the court. 'To my knowledge he knew what he was doing,' he said of Vandenburg. The former player recalled how both Batey and Vandenburg slapped her on the behind before Batey urinated on her. 'Cory Batey slapped her behind a few times and made the statement that she might wake up,' McKenzie told the court, The Tennessean reported. 'Vandenburg said she's not gonna wake up, and he went over and slapped her behind.' Prosecutors showed the jury two videos taken of the alleged assault. McKenzie hung his head as they played. He admitted that he had been laughing during the incident. 'At the time, it was' funny, he said. 'When I look back on it, it wasn't funny.' On trial: Brandon Vandenburg, 21, (pictured in court on Friday, left) and Cory Batey, 20, (right) are on trial for allegedly sexually assaulting an unconscious student in a Vanderbilt dorm room in June 2013 . Accused: Vandenburg, left, allegedly encouraged Batey and two others to sexually assault her in his room . Claims: Mack Prioleau, Vandenburg's roommate, was in the room at the time of the incident but tried to block it out and fall asleep, he told the court on Tuesday. He is seen pointing at Vandenburg in court on Tuesday . McKenzie claimed he never touched the woman - although he did take one of the condoms passed around by Vandenburg and admitted to taking a photograph of her. He left the room with Banks, his roommate, and headed to the bathroom, where they flushed the condoms away, he said. 'Banks and I were freaking out,' he told the court. The following day, the group met to get their stories straight, he said. They agreed to hide 'the bad thing' that had happened in the room. During cross-examination, the defense highlighted the number of times McKenzie's statements have changed, including over the use of cocaine and whether Vandenburg touched the student. 'I had pressure from family members not to tell and these guys were my best friends,' he said of Banks and Batey. He had not met Vandenburg before the night of the incident, he said. McKenzie, who has a baby daughter, said that he hopes his testifying leads to a lesser punishment. After McKenzie testified, Vandenburg's roommate took the stand to testify about the incident. He was in the room on his bunk for the duration of the alleged attack. Testimony: McKenzie, pictured left, and Brandon Banks, right, are also accused of rape in the incident . Shock: Detective Chad Gish told the court during the rape trial on Monday how a graphic video taken inside the dorm showed the 21-year-old woman to be unconscious . Mack Prioleau told the court that he awoke to sounds of porn, laughing and the men discussing sex and saw the woman face down in the dorm. He said she didn't make a sound. He didn't leave to get help or check on her wellbeing. 'I was trying to sleep, trying to do whatever I could to block it out of my mind,' he said. 'After it quieted down, I looked down and saw the female on the bed below me.' Eventually, he left the room to stay with a friend and when he returned the next morning, he cleaned up vomit found in the dorm. He only ever told one friend about what he had witnessed. 'At the time I was scared and uncomfortable,' he said. 'I didn't know what to do.' Testimony in the case will continue on Wednesday. The men's testimony on Tuesday came after the jury was shown footage obtained from the dorm room that revealed the group laughing and Banks assaulting the woman with a water bottle. The building's surveillance footage, which was discovered when officials were looking into vandalism, prompted the rape investigation. Crime scene: Prosecutors say Vandenburg brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where the men egged each other on and proceeded to rape the young woman . Defense attorneys last week pointed out that the video portrays a culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex that their clients were caught up in. The alleged victim is also expected to take the stand for the prosecution. Vandenburg and Batey are being tried on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. The two players not on trial but also charged in the case, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey. All have pleaded not guilty.","Jaborian McKenzie, who is accused of raping the student with three others in a dorm room in 2013, testified against two of his teammates on Tuesday .

"Swansea City will dig their heels in to prevent unhappy Bafetimbi Gomis from plunging the club into a major striker crisis this month. Sportsmail has been told by senior sources at the club that despite their anger with the Frenchman’s apparent agitations for a move, they are forced by sheer necessity to keep the 29-year-old, who is Swansea’s only senior striker in the wake of Wilfried Bony’s exit. However, that marriage of convenience does not remove any of the ill-feeling caused on Sunday when Gomis used a television interview in France to indicate promises of playing time had been broken. He also said he planned discussions with his representatives to ‘find the best solution’. VIDEO Scroll down for Bafetimbi Gomis scoring a screamer for France vs Ecuador . After the sale on Wilfried Bony Swansea are expected to hold on to want-away striker Befetimbi Gomis (right) The striker has scored just once in 18 Premier League appearances this season, making only six starts . Senior members of the club’s hierarchy feel they are being ‘held to ransom’ and have been stunned by the timing of the striker’s comments, which came after Bony’s move to Manchester City had cleared the way for a regular starting berth in the side. Gomis’s remarks have been noted by Crystal Palace, who are actively keen, while his camp have also claimed that Arsenal, Newcastle, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke are interested. The Welsh club would have to pay Gomis the rest of his £8m signing-on fee as part of his transfer from Lyon . But Swansea insist there will be no move, and even in the unlikely event that they are able to sign a senior striker before the transfer window closes, there would still be major obstacles to offloading Gomis. Namely, Swansea are obligated to pay him the remainder of his £8m signing-on fee agreed as part of his Bosman transfer from Lyon last summer. The huge sum is to be spread across his four-year, £55,000-a-week contract, with £1m of the signing fee believed to have already been paid. He is due the balance of that fee regardless of whether he leaves now or later, though there would likely be a settlement in the event that an acceptable offer came from a rival club. The Frenchman claims that Swansea broke their promise of an agreed amount of playing time . Gomis, who has scored only once in 18 Premier League appearances, of which only six have been starts, told Canal Plus at the weekend: ‘When Bony was here, it was planned I should play a certain number of games. That wasn't the case. Today, I ask myself many questions. I need time to think. ‘I have been approached by clubs. I don't know what will happen. Me leaving? It is possible.’ Swansea, meanwhile, have agreed a fee worth close to £5m for Tottenham full-back Kyle Naughton.","Bafetimbi Gomis is forcing a move away from Swansea City .

Spousal support: Kennedy's husband Edwin Schlossberg (left) did not move to Japan with his wife, opting to stay in New York and run his business, but he makes frequent trips to the Japanese capitol and the President's visit prompted one . The 10-seat restaurant is run by 89-year-old Jiro Ono, who was featured in the 2011 documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Obama and Abe greeted each other outside the underground restaurant before heading in for the private dinner that typically costs about $300. 'That's some good sushi right there,' President Obama said on his way out. They were accompanied by Kennedy, Schlossberg and White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice. The restaurant earned one of the rare three Michelin star ratings in the world and owner Jiro Ono is widely considered to be the best sushi chef worldwide. The stop in Japan is meant to help strengthen ties between Obama and Abe. An unidentified senior Japanese government official said that they 'have good discussions all the time, whenever they see each other.' 'But the more frequently they see each other, the better.' Making upscale casual: Neither President Obama nor Japanese Prime Minister Shrizo Abe wore ties as they headed into dinner at Sukiyabashi Jiro, the famed restaurant with three Michelin stars . Hefty meal: Mrs Kennedy joined the men for dinner at the 10-seat restaurant where an 89-year-old sushi chef comes up with custom menus and highly-detailed dishes . No time to shop: The President waved to fans and journalists as he headed into the restaurant, located in Tokyo's wealthier shopping district . Into it: President Obama seemed thrilled to be at one of the 10 seats in the famed restaurant . 'That's some good sushi right there,' Obama said after the dinner . President Obama confirmed Wednesday that America's mutual security treaty with Japan applies to the islands at the center of a territorial dispute between China and Japan. 'The policy of the United States is clear,' he said in a written response to questions published in Japan's Yomiuri newspaper before his arrival in Tokyo at the start of a four-country Asia tour. Legend: Jiro Ono, 89, is widely regarded as the world's best sushi chef . 'The Senkaku islands are administered by Japan' and therefore fall under the U.S.-Japan treaty, he wrote. 'And we oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands.' His statement seems aimed at reassuring Japan that the U.S. would come to its defense if China were to seize the islands, known as Diayou in China. Russia's annexation of Crimea has sparked concern about America's political will to protect Asian allies, notably in Japan and the Philippines. A Chinese government spokesman . responded that China has 'indisputable sovereignty' over the islands, . and said 'the so-called Japan-U.S. alliance' should not harm China's . territorial rights. 'We . firmly oppose applying the Japan-U.S. security treaty in the issue of . the Diaoyu islands,' Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said at a . regular briefing. 'The U.S. should respect facts, take a responsible attitude, remain committed to . not taking sides on territory and sovereignty issues, speak and act . cautiously, and earnestly play a constructive role in regional peace and . stability.' Obama told the . Yomiuri the United States is deepening its ties with China, but 'our . engagement with China does not and will not come at the expense of Japan . or any other ally.' He said . the U.S. will continue to take steps to reduce the impact of its . military presence in Okinawa, but added, 'it's important to remember . that the U.S. Marine Corps presence on Okinawa is absolutely critical to . our mutual security. It plays a key role in the defense of Japan.' Pre-emptive protests: Demonstrators gathered outside of the American embassy in Manila ahead of President Obama's one-night visit next week to protest the increased U.S. military presence in the country . Riot police: Police armed with truncheons, shields and a fire hose clashed Wednesday with more than 100 left-wing activists . The President can expect to get a slightly colder reception as his Asia trip continues, as protests have already broken out in Manila ahead of his Monday arrival. Police armed with truncheons, shields . and a fire hose clashed Wednesday with more than 100 left-wing activists . who rallied at the U.S. Embassy in Manila to oppose a visit by . President Barack Obama and an expected security pact that would increase . the American military presence in the Philippines. Riot . policemen blocked the flag-waving activists near the heavily fortified . embassy compound but the protesters slipped past them, sparking a brief . scuffle in view of motorists stuck in traffic. Some of the protesters carried paper U.S. flags with the message: 'Obama, not welcome.' The . police sprayed the protesters with water from a fire truck to push them . away. A police officer was punched in the face in the melee but no . arrests were made. The proposed accord would allow more U.S. troops, aircraft and ships to be temporarily stationed in selected Philippine military camps as a counterweight to China and as a standby disaster-response force . Wavering support: The United States and the Philippines, which are treaty allies, have been scrambling to overcome differences to finalize a new security accord in time for Obama's visit .

"Former Wales international Andy Powell began 2015 in life-changing fashion following the birth of his first child with his wife, Natasha. The birth of son Henry on New Year's Day completed a remarkable 12-month turnaround for the couple, which saw Mrs Powell throw out her husband as well as selling his prized possessions on eBay after accusing him of cheating, gambling and lying. However, the 33-year-old former Wales and British Lions player manage to reconcile with his wife after he promised to change his ways. VIDEO Scroll down to see Andy Powell found guilty of drink driving buggy prank . Former Wales international Andy Powell (right) became a father for the first time on New Year's Day . Powell (left) had his first son with his wife Natasha, less than a year after they broke up and she sold his belongings because she believed he cheated on her . Last year Ms Gascoine left him and then tweeted  all of Powell's sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes. But the couple have managed to make a fresh start and on Thursday the 26-year-old gave birth to their son Henry at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales. Mr Powell, who was dubbed a 'scrumbag' during their public split, on Friday tweeted today that it was the best day of his life. A friend said: 'It has been a hell of a year for Andy and Natasha. But now they have a little one to think about - it is all new for them.' The happy news signifies an incredible turnaround for the couple who looked to be heading for divorce. Natasha Powell had sold her husband's belongings on eBay following suspicions that he had been cheating on her.

Mr Powell has played rugby at the highest level and fans had been able to buy his boots for less than £20 . She also claimed he paid for the wedding with gambling gains and got drunk before their big day and was nearly arrested. She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him. At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. 'Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.' But the pair then reunited in May when Natasha discovered she was pregnant and friends have said they are happy. Office worker Natasha, who had previously suffered two miscarriages, decided to give Andy one last chance for them to be a family. A friend said the couple are back on track after 'a hell of a year' and we delighted at the birth of their son . She said: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time. 'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track. 'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.'

"Swansea City expect to complete the signing of Tottenham full back Kyle Naughton on Thursday. The 26-year-old is having a medical in south Wales on Wednesday, with talks over his personal terms ongoing. The transfer fee for the right back will be marginally under £5million - approximately the same amount they have been quoted by Spurs for midfielder Tom Carroll, who is on loan at the Liberty Stadium. Tottenham Hotspur's Kyle Naughton looks set for a move to fellow Premier League side Swansea . Naughton has played in only five games for Mauricio Pochettino this season and has been told he can leave. But his ability to play on either side of defence appeals to Garry Monk, who is keen to strengthen at both left and right back. Swansea’s existing left back Neil Taylor has struggled to fill the void left by Ben Davies’ summer departure for Tottenham and is a target for Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, long-serving right back Angel Rangel is 32 and there were doubts last months over his ability to play three games in a week. Norwich left-back Martin Olsson is on Monk’s wishlist, though it is understood that his potential arrival would not have any bearing on whether they sign Naughton.

"Stuart Ankers admitted theft after stealing more than 50,000 Panini World Cup stickers . A driver stole more than 50,000 Panini World Cup football stickers from a warehouse, a court heard. Stuart Ankers could have filled nearly 80 albums with the snatched collectibles, if he did not get any duplicates. The 37-year-old helped himself to the haul of stickers from the Smiths News warehouse in Bredbury in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The former solder had a job collecting and distributing magazines to shops around the region, but instead he began stealing the Panini boxes, each worth £600. Stockport Magistrates Court was told he plundered the boxes over a five to six week period. Ankers, of Oldham, was caught when warehouse bosses  became suspicious and installed CCTV. He was captured on camera scrambling up the shelves to help himself to the stickers. The thefts happened around May 2014, just before the World Cup in Brazil. Prosecutor Mark Angus said: 'He disputed the theft at first but when he was told there was CCTV he admitted the theft to his managers. 'A male in Oldham asked him if he could get World Cup stickers. He says he was paid by box he supplied.' Two mathematicians in Switzerland had previously worked out the World Cup sticker album would cost, on average, £450 to complete. With 640 stickers in the Panini World Cup sticker album and 50p for a pack of six it should cost just £63.99 to complete the collection. Stuart Ankers could have filled nearly 80 Panini albums, pictured left, with the snatched collectibles. In total he made off with 50,000 stickers, like those pictured right . Mathematicians in Switzerland had previously worked out the World Cup sticker album would cost, on average, £450 to complete . However, allowing for duplicates it is estimated that 899 packs are actually needed at a cost of a whopping £449.50. Ankers pleaded guilty to theft from an employer at a previous hearing. However, he told magistrates' the value of his thefts was between £5,000 to £6,000. The Crown Prosecution Service had originally placed the value at £12,000 before accepting Ankers's claim that he'd pilfered stickers worth only half the value. The driver, who had no previous convictions for dishonesty, had been warned that he could face a custodial sentence. He told the court: 'I was just stupid at the time, I apologise profusely.' Ankers was ordered to fork out £1,500 compensation, 150 hours of unpaid work, a three-month curfew and £85 costs. He has been sacked after his theft was uncovered but the court heard how he had since secured a fresh job with a haulage firm. Football stickers are popular around the globe . Collectible football cards and stickers have been swapped by young football fans since the late 1880s when they were frequently found inside cigarette packets. Italian company Panini started selling packets of football stickers in the 1960s and in 1970 produced its first World Cup album to tie in with that year's tournament in Mexico - selling the stickers outside of Italy for the first time. Football stickers took off in the UK in 1978, when the World Cup was being held in Argentina. A 1980s market research survey revealed that more than 90 percent of boys aged between nine and 11 had bought at least one packet of football stickers. And by the 1990s collecting stickers was a full blown phenomenon, with girls and boys alike eagerly trading 'shinys' as they tried to complete the set. In 1994 multiple re-prints were needed for sticker company Merlin's first official Premier League collection, such was the demand. In 2013, 29-year-old Portsmouth . fan and comedy writer Adam Carroll-Smith made headlines when he tracked . down the six players whose faces were missing from his 1996 Merlin . Premier League Album. It . took him six months to trace Keith Curle, Stuart Ripley, Scott Minto, . Gary Penrice, Philippe Albert and Lars Bohinen, visit them and take . their pictures to fill in the gaps in his album, documenting his efforts . in his book Six Stickers: A Journey To Complete An Old Sticker Album. Every year Panini prints more than a billion stickers, and as well as football stickers also print ranges featuring cartoon characters such as Peppa Pig and bands including One Direction. In the 2013/14 season Topps, which has owned the rights to Merlin since 1995, celebrated the 20th anniversary of the official Premier League Sticker collection. Topps also produces Match Attax, a trading card game which also features Premier League stars.","Stuart Ankers stole more than 50,000 Panini World Cup football stickers .

Sarah Millman, 27, was preparing to cook a spaghetti bolognese for her family when she found a maggot in her tin of tomatoes . The mother-of-two said she normally doesn't check the tin contents before making bolognese but she did on this occasion. Mrs Millman, from Hambledon near Waterlooville, Hampshire, said: 'We were at home and I was opening the tin of tomatoes to make a spaghetti bolognese for my family. 'Usually I would just tip in the contents and not even look but fortunately I did this time - and then I saw something in the tin. 'I wondered what it was and looked a bit closer and realised what it was. It was absolutely disgusting. 'The tomatoes would have been fresh when they went in the can but it made me think the food must be dirty. 'My eight year old daughter Bobbie was absolutely mortified. She was really funny about what she was eating afterwards. Disgusted: Sarah Millman with her family (from left) Eadie, Pete and Bobbie . 'At first I didn't know if I was overreacting or not but everyone I've spoken to about it has been horrified. I'll be double checking all my tins and cans from now on.' Now Mrs Millman, a hairdresser, has been left disappointed by Tesco's response after she complained about her discovery. She called the supermarket chain and took the larva to Tesco in Havant, Hampshire, where she bought the offending tin. There, she reluctantly took a £1.50 refund from the customer services and was told someone would be in touch. She said: 'I was not out to make money from this, but an apology would have been nice. I asked if I took the £1.50 would it affect anything I could receive as an apology and they said no. 'I was expecting a call but I got a letter in the post on Thursday saying ‘there appeared to be a maggot' in the can and here is a 10 pounds voucher. 'There was no customer service or customer care in their response. A phone call would have been lovely, just to say sorry. 'I know you have to apologise to someone properly if you treat them like this. It was the sort of letter where all they do is fill in the details that are personal to me. 'When I told family and friends about it they were disgusted.' A spokeswoman for Tesco said: 'We set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell. We have apologised to Miss Millman and given her a gesture of goodwill. 'Once we have conducted a full investigation our customer service team will update her with our findings.'","Sarah Millman, 27, was preparing a meal for her family at home .

"West Bromwich Albion have made an improved bid for Callum McManaman with Tony Pulis determined to land the Wigan winger. An offer understood to be £3.5m was rejected by the Championship strugglers, but Albion have returned with a revised deal of around £4m. Wigan are thought to want as much as £6m for the 23-year-old, but may agree to a smaller fee as manager Malky Mackay is eager to reshape his squad.

"When Kyle Eastmond takes the field at Twickenham on Saturday he will do so conceding almost five stone in weight and eight inches in height to his gargantuan opposite man Sonny Bill Williams. If it were a boxing match, it wouldn’t have got past the weigh in. But they say rugby is a game for all shapes and sizes and, despite an apparently inexorable upward trend favouring brawn over brain, it is testament to the sport that Eastmond will start with at least a fighting chance against one of the most powerful sportsmen on earth. Kyle Eastmond (right) runs the ball during England's training session at Pennyhill Park on Thursday . All Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams (second right) gets stuck in during his side's training session in London . David vs Goliath! How Eastmond measures up against the All Blacks' monster centre Williams . Eastmond (left) has a quiet chat with his fellow centre Brad Baritt ahead of Saturday's game at Twickenham . ‘I've never been big, so I'm used to it,’ said the 5ft7in inside centre  when asked if he was concerned about the size differential between him and his opponent. ‘You just get in there. It's not all about size. You have to understand your opposite number, what he's going to do and be ready for that. ‘I know Sonny Bill has a great off-load and things like that, but you've also got to keep an eye on (Aaron) Cruden and then (Israel) Dagg. Eastmond (left) faces the daunting task of trying to stop the huge, cross-code All Black (right) at Twickenham on Saturday . Williams (right) was in the thick of the action during New Zealand's 74-6 victory over the USA last Saturday . Williams collects an offload from Ryan Crotty to cross for the first of his two tries against the Americans . Eastmond races away from Brodie Retallick during England's 36-13 loss to the All Blacks in June . ‘You have to be excited. I’m excited to play against the best players in the world. That's why I'm here. I don't want to be messing around, I want to play the best in the world. I'm looking forward to it.’ Eastmond’s excitement at the prospect of going toe-to-toe with a man who, aside from a stellar career in both rugby codes, has also gone undefeated in six professional boxing bouts, is especially admirable considering his last international appearance. Substituted after 40 minutes of England’s third Test thumping in Hamilton in June, a fifth Test cap looked a long way off for the 12st8in centre. But his superb Aviva Premiership form for Bath this season has seen him make an irresistible case for a recall alongside Brad Barritt in England’s midfield. A conversation with Stuart Lancaster at the end of the tour, when the former St Helens rugby league star vowed to return a better player, also left a mark on the England coach. ‘There was no big meeting, no massive talk,’ Eastmond, 25, said. ‘It was a little bit of a chat at the airport. The last Test didn't go as well as we’d have liked, for the team and for me as an individual. ‘I'm not stupid enough to think 40 minutes is going to put me back. Every single player has their ups and downs in their career, but it's how you come back. That's what I tried to do when I got back to Bath.’ Lancaster conceded on Thursday that he expected the All Blacks to target the diminutive former rugby league star. But Eastmond appeared utterly unconcerned by the prospect. With superb feet and a willingness to play flat to the gain line, Eastmond has flourished in Bath’s midfield alongside George Ford and Jonathan Joseph. On Saturday, with the Saracens pair of Barritt and Owen Farrell completing England’s midfield, he will be charged with reproducing that form. Eastmond will have to be on his toes at Bath now that superstar Sam Burgess has arrived at the Rec . Soon, he will also need to prove himself against another hulking opponent in new Bath team-mate Sam Burgess, who has known from his league days as a 14-year-old. Eastmond feigned ignorance when asked what he thought about the prospect of the current international rugby league player of the year wanting to take his shirt at club and international level by answering ‘does he?’ with a broad grin. But, following a tough baptism in union which saw him finish last season struggling for first-team action at Bath, Eastmond knows better than most how difficult the cross-code switch can be. ‘The transition isn't easy,’ he said. ‘It takes people different timescales in how they fit in. ‘I can understand the shapes rugby union run now, it looks similar to league, but it's a completely different game. There's a lot to learn before you can really excel. I'm sure Sam will do that.’ VIDEO O2 Inside Line - Season 5, Episode 1 .","England inside centre Kyle Eastmond concedes almost five stone in weight and eight inches in height to opposite number Sonny Bill Williams .

"Juventus have claimed they will not have to pay Chelsea compensation in the Adrian Mutu case after having an appeal upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Governing body FIFA ruled in 2013 that Juventus and Livorno had to contribute some of the £14million owed by Mutu to Chelsea for a breach of contract. The London club released Mutu in 2004 following the Romanian striker's positive drug test and sought compensation, which they were granted by FIFA in 2013. Juventus have claimed they will not have to pay Chelsea compensation in the Adrian Mutu case . Mutu joined Juve after being let go by the Blues, with Livorno also involved in the transfer, and both Italian clubs immediately appealed the FIFA ruling. A statement from Juventus on Wednesday read: 'Juventus Fooball Club announces today that the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne has notified us of the decision made by the arbitrators in the dispute that pitted Chelsea against Juventus regarding the signing of Adrian Mutu. 'The arbitrators have completely dismissed the demands made by Chelsea FC, ordering them (the London club) to play the legal costs of the case. 'This ruling has no effect on the financial balance of Juventus Football Club because the club, fully aware of being in the right, chose not to allow for any risk in funds over the developing litigation.' Chelsea released Mutu in 2004 following the Romanian striker's positive drug test . Mutu signed for Juventus in January 2005, but could not immediately join the Italian giants because they had their full quota of non-EU players. Instead, Serie A club Livorno reached an agreement with Juve to sign the Romanian on a free transfer until Juve could offload one of their non-European players. Mutu never played for Livorno and made his first appearance for Juve in May of 2005 having served a seven-month ban from football. He played at Juve until July 2006 when he was sold to Fiorentina for eight million euros. Mutu, now 36, lost all of his appeals in a legal battle with Chelsea which has lasted more than 10 years. The former Parma star announced his retirement from football earlier this month having played last season with Romanian club Petrolul Ploiesti.","Juventus signed Adrian Mutu after he was released by Chelsea in 2004 .

"Andy Murray emerged as one of the main beneficiaries of an extraordinary day in China that saw five of the top 10 lose and Rafael Nadal discuss having an operation next month. The British No1’s chances of making the field for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals were bolstered by some of his rivals falling at the Shanghai Masters, plus those assured of qualification, such as Nadal. Murray lost only four points on his serve in the opening set as he registered a decent 7-5, 6-2 win over towering Pole Jerzy Janowicz to make the third round. In doing so he pushed himself very close to the frame for the eight-man field who will contest the season-ending championships at the O2 Arena. He is due to meet Spain’s David Ferrer on Thursday morning and victory would put him within a sliver — a mere five ranking points — of the eighth qualifying place currently occupied by Canada’s Milos Raonic. Andy Murray beat Jerzy Janowicz in the second round of the Shanghai Masters on Thursday . Rafael Nadal lost to Feliciano Lopez and has a nagging problem with his appendix that may require surgery . Heather Watson is out of the Japan Open after suffering a second-round exit against Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva. The sixth seed lost 6-4, 7-5. The British No 1 was looking to regain the title she won in 2012 but teenager Putintseva, the world No 122, proved too strong. Watson had lost in the first round of her previous four tournaments before beating Serb Jovana Jaksic earlier this week. It is still conceivable that the year’s ninth-ranked player could make it to London as there has to be a doubt over Nadal, who has a nagging problem with his appendix that he believes will require surgery. The Spaniard lost 6-3, 7-6 to compatriot Feliciano Lopez and then declared that he hoped to complete the season before having any operation, even though it could compromise his preparation for January’s Australian Open. ‘My thought is to continue and play Basle, Paris and London,’ said Nadal. ‘It’s true that I haven’t had the best of luck since Wimbledon. Murray will face David Ferrer on Thursday, and a win will take him within five ranking points of eighth . Canadian Milos Raonic currently holds the eighth qualifying position that Murray is attempting to take . 'I was having a very good year and after that I was unlucky with my wrist and what is going on now.' Nadal also found himself replaced as world No 2 by Roger Federer after the great Swiss saved five match points to avoid the pile-up of the seeds. He looked down and out against Argentina’s Leonardo Mayer before coming through 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 — winning the decisive tiebreaker 9-7. It is not unusual to have strange results at this time of the season, which comes after the US Open but before the climax at the last Masters event in Paris followed by the O2. Some players are carrying injuries, some very motivated, others demotivated and others just plain tired out by this stage of a long year. But losing five of the top 10 in one day is excessive even by October’s standards. Aside from Nadal there were defeats for Stan Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori and Grigor Dimitrov, while Raonic retired injured. The latter two, ranked eight and 10, are particularly relevant to Murray in the scramble for places in London, making Thursday's match against Ferrer, currently ranked one place below him at 10, especially important.","Andy Murray beat Jerzy Janowicz 7-5, 6-2 at the Shanghai Masters .

"Manchester City must overcome the perils of sub-zero temperatures, echoing stands, a dodgy pitch and in-form opponents if they are to kick-start their Champions League campaign in Moscow on Tuesday. Manuel Pellegrini's team have taken just one point from their two Group E fixtures so far, losing to Bayern Munich in Germany and then being held by Roma at the Etihad Stadium. They desperately need a repeat of last season's win over CSKA in Moscow to boost their chances of advancing from a difficult group, but conditions will be tricky. The Manchester City players on their way to Moscow for Tuesday's Champions League tie with CSKA . City captain Vincent Kompany relaxes as the Premier League champions fly out to Russia for the match . Moscow has seen its first heavy snow of the winter ahead of the game, with freezing temperatures expected, and striker Edin Dzeko posted this picture from his hotel room . Man City fans plan to rent out a flat overlooking the stadium to get round ban . Indeed, the potential for a damaging defeat was considered so high that City took the unusual step of flying in two days before the match in order to properly acclimatise. The first heavy snowfall seen in the Russian capital this winter arrived on Sunday night, leaving the ground blanketed in the white stuff - to the excitement of Edin Dzeko, who posted a picture on social media. The forecast leading up to kick-off is for more snow and also sleet, while temperatures for the match are set to be below freezing. It will certainly come as a shock to the City players, who have been used to the relatively warm weather of an Indian summer in England. Then there will be the unusual silent atmosphere of the Arena Khimki to contend with. UEFA have banned the sale of tickets and ordered the match to be played behind closed doors as punishment for the racist behaviour of CSKA fans. It’s cold and it’s wet here in Moscow. One of the first heavy snowfalls of the winter took place overnight and there's a few inches lying on the ground outside my hotel at the moment.

Sergio Aguero's four goals against Tottenham on Saturday ensures City enter the fixture in good form . Man City have taken just one point from their opening two fixtures in Champions League Group E . The CSKA support have a pretty long charge sheet. They were handed a three-match stadium ban for the racist behaviour of their fans, with an appeal set to be heard by UEFA on October 27. They were sanctioned following violence during their 5-1 defeat by Roma on matchday one, when CSKA fans lit flares and threw them at home supporters, with racist banners also unfurled. This was their third charge of racism in less than a year. During City's visit last season, Yaya Toure was subjected to racial abuse at the Khimki Arena. This led to a partial stadium closure but when they displayed 'a range of racist and far-right symbols' in the match with Viktoria Plzen last December, UEFA handed down a full stadium closure for their matchday two encounter with Bayern Munich this season.

Bayern boss Pep Guardiola admitted he felt uncomfortable with the eerily quiet atmosphere, saying: 'Football is about the supporters. I hope we don't have to play behind closed doors again.' Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge agreed: 'It was a strange game. There was no atmosphere or emotions.' Pellegrini has already said there will be no advantage for City in playing the must-win match in an empty ground. He said: 'I don't think we must try to win with outside benefit of our team. We must try to win because we are better than CSKA playing away or at home. 'If not, if we need those kind of things to win the game, then I don't think we are a big team.

Bayern's Thomas Muller tries to create a scoring opportunity against the backdrop of an empty stand . Only VIP guests and the press were present as Bayern ran out 1-0 winners on matchday two . There have also been concerns about the pitch at the Khimki Arena. Last season, Pellegrini described as 'unbelievable' the decision to play the CSKA-City match on a surface that had been condemned as unplayable. The pitch collapsed under heavy rainfall and City struggled on the uneven surface, although they ultimately won 2-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero. It led to CSKA's final group match, against Plzen, being moved to St Petersburg while repairs were made. Both teams enter the game lying second in their respective leagues. In-form CSKA have won their last six league matches and put six past Kuban Krasnodar on Saturday.

City's substitutes used blankets to try and keep warm during their visit to Moscow last season . Sergio Aguero scored twice as City ran out 2-1 winners at the Arena Khimki . CSKA striker Ahmed Musa believes City are 'weak' opponents and that his team could win . He said: 'As you can see, they are very weak this year. We are going to use that advantage against them. 'In a couple of games they haven't been that good. They are very weak in the defence, so we are going to do our best to work against that. 'I think we are going to have a great opportunity because of the quality of the players we have. I think Tuesday is going to be a very good game for us.

"A Bulgarian man who was won the National Lottery - twice - has an illegal cabin in the back garden of his home that he rents out for as much as £10,000 a year, it has been reported. George Traykov, 46, a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team, beat odds of one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize in March to add to the £1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in September 2011. Now a home he owns in Harrow, north-west London, has been investigated by council staff after the cabin - which has a kitchen, toilet and bedroom - was discovered. Investigation: The cabin in the garden of Mr Traykov's north-west London home . George Traykov, who beat odds of 1 in 438 million to secure a rare second National Lottery win . The scourge of these often rickety, cramped and unhygienic buildings looks set to grow as the country struggles to accommodate the huge numbers of immigrants arriving here – both legally and illegally. It was detected after officials used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures. 'The beds-in-sheds phenomenon means there . is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - . in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are . four times as many as we first suspected,' said Susan Hall, the . Conservative leader of Harrow council. 'The pressures of migration in London, fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from eastern Europe, are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just haven't had to contend with before. 'What was once thought, even just 18 months ago, to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs.' She added: 'These are people who use council services - like bin collection - but for whom we receive no extra funding. It was detected after officials used an aircraft equipped with a thermal camera to fly over the borough to pinpoint the illegal structures . 'In many cases the people in beds in sheds are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation. But we get complaints from their neighbours that we cannot ignore, and it is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords.' Earlier this year, Ealing Council estimated that the inhabitants of beds in sheds has pushed the area’s population up by 60,000 to nearly 400,000. Mr Traykov, who is believed to be travelling through Europe, was contacted by the Sunday Telegraph but was not available to comment. Speaking at the time of his win, the property developer, who has lived in the UK for 20 years,  said: 'I've always worked very hard and never spent more than I have so money has never been a major problem for me.' The house itself has been divided into four separate rooms, one of which is rented by Polish special educational needs teacher Agnieszka Klojzy, who lives in it with her two children, aged five and two. She said: 'George is a good landlord. He looks after us quite well. It was scary [when the council came]. I felt like a criminal.' Property developer: George Traykov, 46, is a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team . A neighbour, who did not wish to be identified, said a lot of people go to and from the property and claimed a fence was installed to hide the structure in the garden. Harrow council served Mr Traykov with two planning enforcement notices. In a statement, the council said: 'There is a national yardstick for what constitutes a licensable HMO [House in Multiple Occupation]. In Harrow, the rule is that a building has to be at least two storeys and have four unrelated people living there. 'Courtenay Avenue was clearly licensable and was not. The outbuilding constituted a breach of planning because it had no planning consent to be constructed, especially as it was equipped for stand-alone living - i.e. kitchen, lavatory, bedroom etc. 'In November Harrow Council served a . planning enforcement notice with two elements. 'One required the beds in . sheds outbuilding to be demolished while the other part required the . main building to be returned to a family dwelling. 'The notice should . have taken effect from December 12th with a six-month deadline, but has . been frozen because the landlord has appealed.'","George Traykov won the lottery twice - getting a total of £1,160,873 .

"Jordan Henderson is adamant he can handle the pressure of being Liverpool’s second-in-command thanks to the baptism of fire he received on Merseyside. The England midfielder has made giant strides since he turned down a move to Fulham in August 2012 and was rewarded by Brendan Rodgers last Friday, when he was appointed vice-captain in the wake of Daniel Agger’s departure. Henderson will one day be expected to take over Steven Gerrard’s mantle and ahead of Saturday’s trip to West Ham, the 24-year-old says he could not wish for a better man to be educated by and hailed the skipper’s influence. Jordan Henderson is confident he can handle the pressure of being Liverpool's  vice captain . The midfielder says he has learnt a huge amount from the club's legendary skipper Steven Gerrard . ‘I have learned from players all around me but he has been a massive influence on my career,’ said Henderson. ‘I try and learn everything that I can from him because he has not only been the best leader for Liverpool and England, he’s probably been the best leader in football in general. ‘I’ve got no better man to learn from. Stevie just said congratulations to me. He told me that I had worked hard and deserved it, it meant a lot coming from him. I think it shows how much I have progressed.’ Henderson joined Liverpool in 2011 from Sunderland but started slowly and nearly left Anfield soon after . The 24-year-old has come on leaps and bounds and is now a regular starter for Roy Hodgson's England team . Rodgers, meanwhile, has no concerns about Adam Lallana’s form since he returned to the starting line-up and believes the £23million midfielder will show why Liverpool made such a big investment in him this summer when he is fully fit. Lallana missed six weeks after damaging medial ligaments during a training session in Boston in July but Rodgers said: ‘It was always going to be difficult however way you look at it, coming into a new club. ‘For the likes of Adam, he missed pre-season. ‘Even without that there is going to be a six-month settling in period. But he’ s settled very well and loves the club. Once he gets his match fitness he’ll be very good.’ Adam Lallana has made an indifferent start to his Reds career after joining from Southampton for £23million .

"CLICK HERE to see Harry Redknapp's team from the Seventies. Where are Gazza's friends now he needs help? I drove Kenny Dalglish to West Ham training . For 50 years, Harry Redknapp has been one of football’s most colourful and outspoken characters. Now he’s written a book every fan will want to read. In Redknapp’s new book 'A Man Walks On To a Pitch' - serialised exclusively by Sportsmail this week - the QPR manager picks his team of the Eighties. Sportsmail can exclusively reveal Harry Redknapp's greatest team from the eighties . ALAN HANSEN: LATTER DAY BOBBY MOORE . Never rushed, always cool, laid back. In the 1978–79 season, Liverpool conceded just 16 goals in 42 matches and kept 28 clean sheets. Hansen reminded me of Bobby Moore. I never saw Bob throw himself into a diving header or make a lunging tackle because he’d seen the danger ages earlier and was in the right place. Hansen was the same. Alan Hansen was an integral part of the Liverpool team which enjoyed so much success during the eighties . Hansen, pictured with (left to right) Ronnie Rosenthal, Ian Rush, Ronnie Whelan and John Barnes, celebrates winning the First Division title in 1990 . Hansen's defensive play, seemingly always in the right place, reminded Redknapp of Bobby Moore . PAUL McGRATH: LIVED LIFE TO THE FULL! Ron Atkinson rated him as better than John Terry and Tony Adams — put together. He was a great player, but we probably never saw how good he could have been because of the way he lived his life. What a player he was, but what a player he could have been. He was a big lad; strong, quick, powerful. Paul McGrath made over 150 appearances for Manchester United during the eighties and was described by Redknapp as 'strong, quick and powerful' Former Man United boss Ron Atkinson rated McGrath better than John Terry and Tony Adams - put together . Giggs would have solved England's problems... he was born to play left wing . Wenger heralded a change in English football... he introduced Prozone and scouting reports . Ravel Morrison has the class of Bale but his attitude is holding back his talent . Vieira and Keane are warriors... they were even prepared to do battle while working on TV! Why Redknapp fears that the English manager is in danger of becoming extinct . Vieira nearly crossed North London to join Spurs... and  Suarez was close to signing too . Pies in the canteen and throwing teacups at players... the Premier League killed all that! Sportsmail's Head of Sport Lee Clayton interviews Redknapp about his new book . GLENN HODDLE: THE GREAT VISIONARY . Such a beautiful footballer. He reminded me a bit of Johnny Haynes. Glenn would hit a pass and everybody would be thinking, ‘How did he see that, how did he know that player was there?’ Glenn had been out of League football for eight years before I took him to QPR - how had we lost a football mind like that? Glenn Hoddle was a 'beautiful footballer' and had the ability to pick out passes nobody else could foresee . Hoddle had been out of League football for eight years before joining Redknapp at QPR as a coach . The front cover of Redknapp's new book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, which is released on Thursday .

"Jamie Murray did his hopes of a Davis Cup recall no harm as the British doubles expert and John Peers won their first-round match at the Australian Open on Wednesday. In a tight men's doubles opener at Melbourne Park, 16th seeds Murray and Peers eventually came through 6-1, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 against the Argentinian pair of Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco. Great Britain Davis Cup captain Leon Smith recently admitted that Murray is in pole position to potentially partner younger brother Andy in the doubles against USA in the World Group first-round tie in Glasgow in March. Jamie Murray  and John Peers celebrate winning their first round doubles match against Maximo Gonzalez and Juan Monaco . And Murray, who has not played Davis Cup for three and a half years, admits that he would love the chance to take on Bob and Mike Bryan on home soil in Scotland. The 28-year-old said: 'I've certainly had a good start to the year and we've been playing some good tennis. I'm sure I have a decent chance of getting picked and if that happens, brilliant. 'It will be a great tie to play the States in Scotland and great to play with Andy in the doubles against the Bryans. That's a pretty cool thing to experience. I would definitely love to play. But I can't say its in the back of my mind when I'm out there competing. Judy Murray applauds as she watches son Jamie and doubles partner Peers win their first round match . 'If I get picked for the team, great. But I can't really be thinking about that when I am going on the court here to play. You have just got to focus on the task in hand.' The British/Australian combination of Murray and Peers had the majority of the support out on Court 10 as they raced to the opening set in just 20 minutes, with Murray's net coverage proving impressive. However, after breaks were exchanged in the early stages of the second set, Murray and Peers missed a number of chances and Gonzalez and Monaco levelled the match by claiming the tiebreak. Murray plays a return shot during his doubles victory over Gonzalez and Monaco . The third set remained close until the death when Murray and Peers stepped it up at 5-4 and broke serve to clinch the win in one hour and 54 minutes. Murray said: 'I think really we should have won the second set. I think we had more than enough chances to do it. Once it got into the tiebreak I think we both got a bit edgy and all of a sudden we were in a third set. 'Last year we lost a lot of matches where we went off and didn't really see it over the finish line. I think for me personally I had that in the back of the mind. Just happy that we got through in the end.' Murray and Peers talk tactics  in their first round doubles victory . British doubles No 2 Dominic Inglot also made a successful start to his Melbourne campaign with Romanian Florin Mergea, the 14th seeds defeating Australians Matthew Ebden and Matt Reid 6-2, 6-2. There was disappointment, though, for Wimbledon 2012 doubles champion Jonathan Marray who lost his first-round match.

"VENUS STANDS TALL AS RIVALS TUMBLE . It has been a first round of unusual carnage among the women’s seeds but standing above it all is the remarkable Venus Williams, now 34. More than 20 years after first appearing on tour, and after several years of health issues, she has quietly made it into the world’s top 20 and shows no sign of wanting to stop.

"For Jason Denayer, this is no time to think about the future. Not when the present delivers so many challenges. Ronny Deila has made clear his wish for the 19-year-old Belgian to spend a second season on loan from Manchester City. Any such plans are, however, being parked by Denayer while he concentrates on a packed schedule confronting Celtic as they pursue success on four fronts. Saturday’s victory was the centre-half’s first competitive appearance in almost two months following a foot injury. Jason Denayer made his Celtic return after two months out with a foot injury . He played an important role in a solid, efficient display, which was gilded by two fine goals that pushed the champions to within two points of leaders Aberdeen with two games in hand. Deila’s men now face two more Premiership games this week before a seismic League Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden. A Scottish Cup tie against Dundee and Europa League encounters with Inter Milan then swiftly follow. Meeting those demands is the focus for Denayer, who has also had to contend with personal sadness following the tragic loss of his childhood friend Junior Malanda. The Wolfsburg player — a team-mate in the Belgian Under-21 side — was killed in a car crash nine days ago. ‘I need to wait until the end of the season and see what happens,’ said Denayer, when asked about the possibility of another year at Celtic. ‘There are a lot of things in my head at the moment and I just need to concentrate on playing games.’ Denayer (left) pictured in action against Eden Hazard (second right) while training with Belgium . The feedback from City about his loan has been positive, albeit with recognition of the gulf between their respective environments. ‘The club has said I am doing well here but the objective in the Premier League in England for City is different and is at a much higher level,’ he added. ‘So I need to do more again but we will see at the end of the season what happens.’ When Denayer first joined Celtic back in August, no one would have expected Deila’s team to be anywhere but the top of the table come mid-January. The defender jokes that a genuine contest with Aberdeen extending into late April would be ‘too long’, but for now it is viewed as a positive. Denayer hopes the increased pressure they currently face in the Premiership could also bring the welcome spin-off of ensuring minds stay sharp in the other competitions. ‘Is there a hunger in the team? Yes, because we need to win all our games,’ he insisted. ‘We need to be focused in every game, we have to play every game at the maximum level. There is an excitement. We are not leading by many points as is normal. We are now second and it’s really competitive. It is good for the league. Denayer, a defender, has impressed during his loan spell at Celtic from Manchester City . ‘We now have to play every game at the maximum level but, if we were leading by a number of points, we would not have to. ‘It was nice to play a game. I feel good and felt no pain. The injury has gone and I can now do everything 100 per cent.’ Denayer came close to netting an own goal as a header from Accies’ interim player-manager Martin Canning caused a moment of first-half chaos. He was spared by the reactions of Craig Gordon, who then produced an outstanding block on the follow-up to deny Mikael Antoine-Curier. There had been a stodginess about much of Celtic’s early play — following last week’s training camp in Gran Canaria — but their breakthough goal after 33 minutes was a thing of wonder. Leigh Griffiths edged the ball on to Kris Commons, who had the presence of mind to lay a first-time pass in front of the overlapping Adam Matthews. The right-back caught it perfectly, sending an unstoppable, swerving shot beyond Michael McGovern from 20 yards. Celtic manager Ronny Deila wants to extend Denayer's loan deal into a second year at Celtic . Hamilton would have felt well in the game at half-time but conceded within five minutes of the restart. Again, Matthews was involved, delivering a deep cross from the right that found its way to fellow full-back Emilio Izaguirre at the far post. He picked out Liam Henderson and the 18-year-old midfielder wheeled to make a sweet connection with a left-foot snapshot that zipped inside McGovern’s right-hand post. Dougie Imrie twice spotted a way back into the match for Accies, but was denied by another smart stop from Gordon before misdirecting a free header off target. From here on in, most of the attention was focused on Commons. The match had been billed in some quarters as his last for Celtic amid persistent interest from Bolton Wanderers, with his name chanted by the visiting support before he made way for Stefan Scepovic with 10 minutes remaining. The full-time whistle then delivered a scene that seemed to confirm what was happening. Commons threw his boots into the Celtic fans in what, for all the world, looked like a fond farewell gift. Adam Mathews (left) is congratulated by Scott Brown (right) after putting Celtic ahead against Hamilton . Deila denied that was the case and insisted the 31-year-old — stuck in a contract impasse — would have to source a new pair as he was going nowhere for the rest of the season. That, however, seems unlikely to be the final word on this particular saga with a fortnight still to run in the current transfer window. On and off the field, the coming weeks will go a long way to shaping Celtic’s season.","Jason Denayer impressing at Celtic where he is on loan from Manchester City .

"Tony Romo engineered a stirring second-half comeback to lead the Dallas Cowboys to a nail-biting 24-20 NFC wildcard win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday and a meeting with the Green Bay Packers. With a post-season record of 1-3 and haunted by a reputation as a big-game flop, Romo withstood a ferocious Lions defence, tossing a pair of touchdown passes to Terrance Williams, including an eight-yard strike with 2:32 to remaining to give Dallas their first play-off win since the 2009 season. After an 11-5 regular season it was more post-season disappointment for the Lions, who have not won a play-off game since January 1992, losing seven wildcard contests.

Romo, sacked six times by Detroit's top-ranked defence, would not be kept down, completing 19 of 31 passes for 293 yards while DeMarco Murray, the NFL's leading rusher, ran for 75 yards and a touchdown. The Lions shocked the home crowd at a packed AT&T Stadium, scoring on their first possession when Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate with a 51-yard touchdown pass, then followed up with a 14-play, 99-yard drive capped by Reggie Bush scampering into the end zone for a 14-0 lead. Kept in check by a swarming Detroit defence, the Cowboys finally got the big play lift they needed when Romo hooked up with Williams with a 76-yard touchdown strike with less than two minutes remaining in the half but the Lions would answer back with 39-yard Matt Prater field goal to take a 17-7 advantage into the intermission.

Having dodged a bullet, the Lions answered immediately with a 37-yard Prater field goal but the Cowboys would not throw in the towel. Trailing 20-7 Dallas turned to their top guns and another big play, Romo finding Dez Bryant for a 43-yard gain and Murray bulling over from the one. After a 51-yard Bailey field goal the momentum was squarely in the Cowboys' corner when Dallas linebacker Anthony Hitchens was called for pass interference only to have the penalty waved off and end a Lions drive. That was followed by a Detroit 10-yard punt with Romo taking over and engineering the game-winning drive.

"French coach Loic Courteau will not be re-uniting with former pupil Amelie Mauresmo on Andy Murray's coaching team. Courteau, who spent six years coaching Mauresmo, said in December he had spoken to his compatriot about taking up a role in Murray's camp following the departure of assistant coach Dani Vallverdu. However, the 51-year-old is set to continue working with France's Julien Benneteau, who lost in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday. French coach Loic Courteau has ruled out joining Amelie Mauresmo on Andy Murray's team . Speaking to reporters after his four-set defeat to Benjamin Becker in Melbourne, Benneteau said Courteau would not be linking up with Murray.

"Scotland coach Vern Cotter has handed four Edinburgh players their first call-ups after naming his squad for next month's RBS Six Nations opener with France. Scrum-half Sam Hidalgo-Clyne and forwards Ben Toolis, Hugh Blake and Hamish Watson are all included after impressing for Alan Solomons Gunners. Grieg Laidlaw, meanwhile, will continue to skipper the Dark Blues in Grant Gilchrist's absence. Ben Toolis, in action for Edinburgh, has earned his first call-up for the Scotland national side . Scotland manager Vern Cotter named his Six Nations 32-man squad with four uncapped Edinburgh players . Hidalgo-Clyne has featured in all of Edinburgh's Pro12 and European matches so far this season, having impressed with his kicking abilities. Lock Toolis has caught the eye for Edinburgh, eighth in the Pro12 table, and will deputise in place of the injured Grant Gilchrist. New Zealand-born Hugh Blake qualifies for Scotland through his grandparents and comes into the squad for the first time since arriving from Super Rugby outfit Highlanders back in December. Watson completes the quartet having been previously invited to train with the international side in the Autumn but a broken jaw prevented him picking up his first cap. Forwards: Hugh Blake (Edinburgh Rugby), Fraser Brown (Glasgow Warriors), Blair Cowan, Geoff Cross (both London Irish), David Denton, Alasdair Dickinson (Edinburgh Rugby), Jonny Gray (Glasgow Warriors), Richie Gray (Castres), Ross Ford (Edinburgh Rugby), Jim Hamilton (Saracens), Rob Harley, Euan Murray, Gordon Reid (all Glasgow Warriors), Alasdair Strokosch (Perpignan), Ben Toolis, Hamish Watson (both Edinburgh Rugby), Jon Welsh (Glasgow Warriors).

"England's hopes of unleashing Manu Tuilagi in the Six Nations appear to be slim after the Leicester centre revealed that he is unlikely to be fit before the end of next month. Initial medical reports suggested the 23-year-old would be back in action by Christmas after suffering a groin injury in October, but his recovery has been hit by several setbacks and he could now miss the Tests against Wales, Italy and Ireland. Stuart Lancaster was short of options without Tuilagi’s physicality during the autumn internationals, and the England coach will once again turn to his midfield reserves when he names his squad on Wednesday for the next campaign, which kicks off in Cardiff on February 6. Leicester Tigers centre Manu Tuilagi has been struggling with a groin injury since October . Tuilagi could miss the games against Wales, Italy and Ireland after several injury setbacks in recent months . ‘It’s slow but it’s getting there,’ said Tuilagi. ‘The end of February would be all right — that would be ideal but I have to get this right. It’s not like a sprained ankle you can strap it up and get on with it. I have to make sure that if I need to take another week or two then I take it. ‘When it first happened the doctor said it would be six to eight weeks. I was pretty happy then. When I realised it was going to be longer it was hard to stay focused mentally because it’s my second time out for a long time, after a pectoral injury. It’s part of the game, you have to ride it out and come back.’ Tuilagi suffered a heavy strain to his adductor, which tore away from his pubis bone during the Champions Cup tie against Ulster. Surgery is not seen as an effective means to fix the problem, so prolotherapy treatment has been used to aid the recovery. ‘It’s a sugar injection that goes straight into the bone and it basically holds it together like chewing gum sticking together,’ said Tuilagi. Tuilagi has not featured for England since the three-Test summer tour of New Zealand in 2014 . ‘Those injections worked really well. When I did it I could hardly walk and could feel the pubis going up and down but now it works really well. With the pubis, not many people have operations there as it’s quite hard to get fixed.’ While England are still scratching heads over their best combinations for the World Cup, Wales have a far more settled feel about their squad. Warren Gatland will name his Six Nations party this morning and the Kiwi is expected to call upon his countryman, Gareth Anscombe, who won the Junior World Cup with New Zealand. The No 10 joined the Blues from Waikato Chiefs in November and is eligible for selection through his Cardiff-born mother. Anscombe will compete with Ospreys fly-half Dan Biggar for the starting jersey, but hopes of a call-up for Leicester’s Owen Williams were looking slim when the selection committee convened yesterday afternoon. Former Waikato Chiefs fly half Gareth Anscombe (above) is set to be named in the Wales Six Nations squad . Sportsmail understands that, despite his decision to turn down a return to Wales, Williams was in the running last week, before he was dropped ahead of a potential showdown with Rhys Priestland in Leicester’s Champions Cup tie against the Scarlets on Friday.

"Scotland and Glasgow fly-half Duncan Weir will miss the RBS Six Nations championship and be sidelined for up to four months after undergoing surgery on his right bicep. Weir suffered an injury to his arm during the league clash with Edinburgh on December 27 and a scan showed the 23-year-old would require surgery to fix the problem. A statement on Glasgow's official website said: 'Following an injury sustained in the game against Edinburgh Rugby at Scotstoun on Saturday 27 December and a subsequent MRI scan at BMI Ross Hall Hospital, it was advised that Duncan Weir required surgery to repair his right biceps. Duncan Weir kicked a dramatic last-ditch drop goal to secure a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome last season . 'Duncan has successfully undergone surgery and will be out of action for up to four months.' Weir was Scotland's starting fly-half in the 2014 Six Nations championship and kicked a dramatic last-ditch drop goal to secure a 21-20 win over Italy in Rome. The Glasgow stand-off also played in the Scotland side that defeated Argentina 21-19 in Cordoba last June, kicking 11 points in the victory, before being on the losing side to South Africa.

"Australian trainer Peter Moody says he is devastated he faces a three-year ban following a positive drug test on one of his horses. Moody, responsible for guiding the brilliant Black Caviar to 25 straight wins, was told that Lidari, second at the Spring Carnival at Flemington last October, had tested positive for elevated cobalt levels. The four-times champion trainer, who recently reached 100 winners for the 12th season running, has vowed to clear his name, insisting: ‘I have no knowledge or understanding as to how this could occur and will work with the Racing Victoria Integrity Services Department to bring this matter to a conclusion as soon as possible. Peter Moody's Lidari has failed a drugs test after testing positive for elevated cobalt levels . ‘I am devastated to be informed by Racing Victoria that one of my runners has tested positive for a banned substance.’ Victoria stewards have been robust in their bid to stamp out cobalt chloride, a performance-enhancing substance which can produce a similar effect to banned blood booster EPO. ‘We have had the drug’s presence (in Lidari) confirmed by labs in Western Australia and Hong Kong,’ said chief steward Terry Bailey. Australian trainer Moody had previously led Black Caviar (right) to 25 consecutive wins . There has been been plenty of friction between Racing Victoria and Moody, with the latter claiming last April that he was being persecuted by the state ruling body. ‘I feel they are looking at me as a cheat; that really riles me,’ blasted Moody, who reacted angrily to Racing Victoria’s request to have keys for each trainer’s stables in their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Chepstow is waterlogged and Friday’s meeting is subject to an 8am inspection on Wednesday.","Peter Moody 'devastated' after Lidari tests positive for elevated cobalt levels .

"Mitchell Starc claimed career-best figures of six for 43 as Australia defeated India by four wickets to make it two wins from two in the Carlton Tri-Series - but it was far closer than it should have been. Chasing 268 for victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia were cruising at 216 for two in the 40th over with Aaron Finch and Steve Smith well set at the crease. However, the hosts then lost four wickets for 32 runs, including those of Finch for 96 and Smith for 47, as India fought back to set up a tense finish that left Australia still needing 15 runs off the final two overs. Australia's Mitchell Starc appeals successfully for LBW to dismiss India's Akshar Patel (left) Rohit Sharma hits Mitchell Starc for four runs during the Carlton Mid Tri-Series . Australia's David Warner exchanges verbals with Indian batsmen Sharma and Suresh Raina . Warner and Sharma had to be separated by the umpires after their heated debate . Brad Haddin and James Faulkner ensured Australia were not left with egg on their faces, though, as 16 runs were scored off the penultimate over from Bhuvneshwar Kumar to end the contest with six balls to spare. With Starc shining with the ball and Australia suffering a collapse with the bat before easing over the line, the match was almost identical to Friday's Tri-Series opener between the home side and England, which George Bailey's men won by three wickets. However, while World Cup favourites Australia still clearly have areas they can improve on, they have plenty of positives to reflect on as well. High amongst them is the form of left-armer Starc, who followed up his four for 42 against England with an even more devastating display on Sunday as India were limited to 267 for eight after winning the toss. James Faulkner celebrates taking the wicket of Virat Kohli after George Bailey catches him for nine runs . Rohit Sharma scored his sixth ODI ton against Australia . Sharma celebrates after making his century . Among Starc's victims were opener Rohit Sharma, who struck a superb 138, and Suresh Raina, who was the only other Indian batsman to pass 20 as he made 51. Sharma hit nine fours and four sixes in his 139-ball knock - his sixth ODI ton - and shared in a 126-run stand with Raina, but India struggled to build on that solid platform as they were pegged back in the final overs. India will feel they should have been closer to the 300-mark, and might have wondered if that even that score would have been enough as Finch, Smith, Shane Watson (41) and David Warner (24) powered Australia past 200. And in the end Australia did make their target with a bit of room to spare, but it was still far less comfortable than they would have liked. Faulkner makes the boundary with his hit .

"David Warner appeared to mouth 'speak English' to Rohit Sharma during Australia's one-day international against India - and was fined 50 per cent of his match fee. CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY . Joe Root knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of a punch from David Warner but is confident that a repeat would never happen on a cricket field. The latest unsavoury incident involving Australia’s wild child has heightened fears that someone soon will break cricket’s last great taboo and spark a punch-up during a high profile game, possibly even during the forthcoming World Cup. If it does happen then there is a fair chance it will involve Warner, who found himself accused by some of racism when he clashed with Rohit Sharma during Australia’s tri-series victory over India and implored him to ‘speak English.’ David Warner and Rohit Sharma exchange words during Australia's clash with India in Melbourne . Sharma and Warner were separated by the umpires after tempers flared between the pair on the crease . Warner was unhappy after India took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off Sharma's pads . It was Root who was thumped by Warner in the incident at the Walkabout Bar in Birmingham that unsettled Australia’s Ashes preparations in 2013 and revealed the Yorkshireman to be something more than a fresh-faced newcomer. Almost two years on Root is still baby-faced with a smile that suggests butter would not melt in his mouth but opponents know him to be much more street-wise than he looks and Sri Lanka in particular hit him hard verbally last summer. ‘I can’t see it to be honest,’ said Root when asked whether we will soon see cricket’s first real bout of fisticuffs. ‘Someone will have to be in a really bad place to do that. There have been a few things that have happened over the last few months that haven’t been good for the game but I can’t see it leading to a punch-up. It’s not ice hockey.’ Maybe so but while Warner in particular is around there is always a chance something worse than the ugly scenes which marred Sunday’s match in Melbourne, which led to Warner being pulled away from Sharma, could happen. Jonathan Agnew, the BBC cricket correspondent, tried to make the point in a piece in the Radio Times that an opportunity is in danger of being wasted if players do not clean up their act in the wake of the tragic death of Phillip Hughes. England's Joe Root (left) was thumped by Warner in the incident at the Walkabout Bar in Birmingham . England batsman Root is still baby-faced but was on the receiving end of a punch from Australia's Warner . Root feels cricket's last taboo will remain intact because it 'is not ice hockey' where punch-ups are regular . Agnew’s comments went down badly here because, understandably, emotions on the subject of Hughes are still very raw but the point he was making is valid, particularly as Warner in particular has been quick to forget his own pledge to think twice before indulging in confrontations on the field. Martin Crowe, the former New Zealand captain, accused Warner of being a thug and insisted that cricket needs to do more to stop the trouble-makers. ‘There is a growing concern that Warner’s thuggish behaviour has gone too far,’ wrote Crowe in an eloquent piece for ESPN Cricinfo. ’Soon one day it will lead to an incident that will sully the game for good. ‘Soon enough someone is going to get king-hit on a cricket field. And if it is him who gets hammered it will be overdue – if wrong. Fining these serial offenders is not going to work. You have to take them out of the game for extended periods. Two yellow cards should result in a red card, which would ban any player for six months.’ The idea of red and yellow cards in cricket has long been a proposal of Sportsmail’s David Lloyd but his pleadings to the International Cricket Council have so far fallen on deaf ears. Root thinks the suggestion has its merits. ‘Why not? Said Root at the suggestion of football-type cards. ‘It seems there’s a lot of people who are not happy with the way players are conducting themselves on the field so if that will sort it out then why not.’ Warner of Australia kisses the ground after scoring 63 runs in memory of late cricketer Phillip Hughes . But he feels the bulk of players are fully aware of their responsibilities. ‘When you’re out there your job is to score runs or take wickets and if your focus is elsewhere then you’re not doing your best for the team. You just instinctively know where the line is. It’s about showing respect for each other.’ Warner, who has been fined 50 per cent of his match fee, attempted to defend himself over an incident which was sparked when Australia, wrongly, felt India had run for an overthrow despite the ball deflecting off Sharma. ‘In cricket etiquette when you throw a ball to the keeper and it hits a player you don’t run,’ said Warner. ‘When I went over to him he said something in their language and I said ‘speak English’ because if you’re going to say something for me to understand I cannot speak Hindi. ‘So I did the polite thing and asked him to speak English and I thought that was okay. I got slapped on the wrist and I shouldn’t have engaged him. He told me what he had said in English and I can’t repeat it but I was in the wrong.’ AB de Villiers showed what England are going to have to live up to if they are going to win the World Cup . De Villiers reached his hundred off 31 balls, which was the fastest in a one-day international . More positive news came from South Africa where AB de Villiers showed what England, and others, are going to have to live up to if they are going to win the World Cup with a remarkable display of hitting against West Indies. De Villiers reached his hundred off 31 balls, the fastest in a one-day international, and went on to 149 off 44 balls. It is an extraordinary display that frankly it is near impossible to imagine an England player emulating. Root insists that what this young England side, who face India here at the Gabba on Tuesday in what is already a must-win game, are aiming for. ‘He is a bit of a freak, he’s a very good player, but as a side that’s what we’re aiming to do, to get those big scores, said Root. ‘Okay, it would be a serious effort to get anywhere near that but as a side that’s our aim moving forward. 'I think we’re not far away from doing that now. We’ve put in a lot of individual performances and it’s just about putting that complete display together.’ Ice hockey has become renowned for its punch-ups, including this during a women's Winter Olympics game . Root insists cricket will not see a punch-up because 'it is not ice hockey', where it has become infamous .","David Warner appeared to mouth 'speak English' to India's Rohit Sharma .

"Great Britain hurdler Rhys Williams can return to competition with immediate effect after having his ban for a positive drugs test reduced to four months by UK Anti-Doping, his representatives have confirmed. The Wales 400-metre hurdler tested positive in July last year for a prohibited substance contained in a contaminated supplement and was subsequently issued with a ban, the length of which was not made public. Rhys Williams competing in the Men's 400m heats of the 2013 IAAF World Athletic Championships in 2013 . However, his legal team have successfully argued that although the positive test came before the introduction of the new World Anti-Doping Code on January 1 this year, Williams should be able to take advantage of new powers of discretion given to tribunals in cases where there is no significant fault or negligence on the part of the athlete. Colin Gibson, a partner at Charles Russell Speechlys LLP who represented Williams, said in a statement: 'The decision handed down by the tribunal is significant in that it is an early application of the 2015 WADC sanctions to a case under the previous rules, and because it is likely to be a benchmark for future contaminated supplement cases. 'In applying the sanctions under the 2015 Code the tribunal elected to suspend Rhys Williams for only four months which means that Rhys is able to return to competition with immediate effect.' Williams can now return to action after having his ban reduced to four months . The Sunday Times reported that another Wales and Great Britain athlete, 800m runner Gareth Warburton, has also had his ban reduced to six months having failed a test in June. Warburton's case also involved the same contaminated supplement, an energy drink which was found to contain anabolic steroid metabolites. 'The hardest six months of my life, being stopped doing the thing I love,' Warburton told the Sunday Times of his ban. 'But the rules are in place to catch people who are cheating.'","Hurdler has had his drug ban reduced to four months and can now return .

"Defeat has seldom tasted so sweet. The king might not necessarily still be the king but he is definitely back and ready to fight to reclaim his crown. That was the reaction from the Sprinter Sacre team as the horse still rated the best steeplechaser in Britain finished three-lengths second to Dodging Bullets in the Grade One Clarence House Chase at Ascot. Jockey Barry Geraghty and trainer Nicky Henderson could be accused of peering through rose-tinted spectacles but, equally, they also had a heap of reasons to view the run with a healthy dose of optimism. This was, after all, Sprinter Sacre’s first run for 386 days and his first voyage into competitive action since being pulled up at Kempton 13 months ago with a heart problem that threatened to end the career of the seven-time grade one winning chaser. Dodging Bullets (left) beats Sprinter Sacre in The Sodexo Clarence House Steeple Chase at Ascot . Sprinter Sacre struggles to close the gap on Dodging Bullets as Noel Fehily pulls clear on the winner . There were also concerns that the frightening experience may have left a mental scare on 2013 Queen Mother Champion Chase winner, whose jumping got noticeably more exuberant as the race progressed. It was hardly surprising a noticeable nervous hush shrouded the parade ring before the two-mile contest which was replaced after it by a rush of relief, most notably from the trainer and not diluted by the subsequent news that the nine-year-old had suffered a ‘low level’ bleed from the nose after veterinary examination. Henderson, who had agonised all week about running Sprinter Sacre on ground he feared would be worse than the eventual Soft going, said: ’We are not trying to sweep that under the carpet but do not think (the bleed) is significant. Nicky Henderson, trainer of Sprinter Sacre, said his horse ' travelled well but got a little bit tired' at Ascot . ‘He proved it is still there. I have seen lots of positive. He just got a bit tired. ‘You would not send your player out and play 90 minutes first time out. You would probably take him off after 60. ‘This morning I would have taken that (result) and, turning for home, I thought I was going to take a bit better . ‘It was still a great performance because it has been hard work. In October and November, we weren’t exactly blooming but things are coming together at the right time. We are on the right road and I am fairly optimistic about that.’ Dodging Bullets leads from the front early on with Sprinter Sacre and Barry Geraghty giving chase . Hopes of an immediate return to winning ways have been elevated when Sprinter Sacre loomed up seeming to be travelling best on the home turn. But eventual fourth Somersby and AP McCoy had set out make this two-mile contest as big a test of stamina as possible and it worked. Geraghty had Sprinter Sacre in front before the second last fence but Paul Nicholls-trained, Noel Fehily-ridden Tingle Creek Chase winner Dodging Bullet had overtaken him strides after it and Geraghty was never going to ask his mount too serious a question in the in finals hard yards. Geraghty said: ‘All of a sudden I felt him tread water a bit. But he is bound to get tired, he has been off a year and we went a really good gallop. Geraghty admits he was beaten fair and square but is confident today's run will help Sprinter Sacre improve . ‘We were beaten fair and square on the day but you’d imagine with a run under his belt he will improve. Bar winning, I could not be any happier.’ Sponsors Betway now make Sprinter Sacre 3-1 joint favourite with 2014 winner Sire De Grugy for this season’s renewal at the Cheltenham Festival in March. The latter must himself prove he has recovered from an injury in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on February 7.

"Caretaker Newcastle United boss John Carver will not rush Siem de Jong as he attempts to revive the club's season. The Magpies have had to do without the 25-year-old Holland international's invention for the last four-and-a-half months after he tore a thigh muscle just three games into his career on Tyneside following a £6million summer move from Ajax. However, while he could desperately do with the services of a man who former boss Alan Pardew believed would link midfield with attack this season, Carver will resist the temptation to throw him straight back into the mix. Siem de Jong is back in training for Newcastle United following a four-and-a-half month absence . The 25-year-old Holland midfielder tore has thigh muscle just three games into his Magpies career . He said: 'Having him, Mehdi Abeid and Sammy Ameobi fit again just adds to the group. 'He seems a huge character, he's a good talker who pops in every morning for a chat. He's one of the big characters in the dressing room. 'But we need him fully fit. I think he's got to have two, maybe three Under 21 games and then maybe 45 minutes, 70 and then a full game. He's still a little bit off at the moment.' De Jong was fit enough to join the rest of his team-mates on this week's warm weather training camp in Dubai, where he will be able to go through his paces away from the wind, rain and show which has hit Tyneside in recent days. Newcastle caretaker boss John Carver insists De Jong will not be rushed back into first-team action . De Jong (left) trains alongside Mike Williamson during a session at Newcastle's training ground last week . The party jetted out on Sunday, a day after a 2-1 home defeat by Southampton, their seventh in nine games in all competitions, saw them slip out of the top half of the Barclays Premier League table. Newcastle have won none of the four games they have played since Pardew's departure for Crystal Palace and have collected just one of the league nine points they have contested during that period. However, 25-year-old Holland full-back Daryl Janmaat is refusing to write off the season. Janmaat is confident the impending return from injury of the likes of compatriot De Jong, Rolando Aarons and Gabriel Obertan can help to rekindle the campaign. Rolando Aarons (left), pictured scoring against Manchester City, is also back in training for Newcastle . Mehdi Abeid (centre), pictured during training last week, returned to the Magpies bench on Saturday . He said: 'We have to try to reach as high as possible. For certain, we are looking to finish in the top half of the table. That's our main aim now. 'We have Siem to come back and other good players. It's nice to know. They can make us stronger.' De Jong could prove a key figure as Newcastle attempt to increase their goal-threat with youngster Ayoze Perez currently carrying a heavy burden as a lone striker with Papiss Cisse away with Senegal and Emmanuel Riviere yet to open his league account. Newcastle do not play again until January 31, when they visit struggling Hull, and Carver for one is hoping the ongoing search for a head coach will have yielded positives results by then having thrown his own hat into the ring. But just as he is remaining patient with De Jong, so too is managing director Lee Charnley as he attempts to get the right man for the job.

Redknapp has come under huge pressure after failing to win his previous six matches and reports last week suggested he could be sacked if they lost to Manchester United. QPR were beaten 2-0 on Saturday, leaving the club 19th in the table with a tough run of fixtures ahead of them. Harry Redknapp (right) watches on as Queens Park Rangers lost 2-0 to Manchester United at Loftus Road . Tony Fernandes has backed Redknapp despite speculation in recent weeks that he would be sacked . But they are still only one point behind Burnley and Sunderland outside the relegation zone and Fernandes said: 'There’ve been a lot of rumours about Harry’s position being under threat, so I thought it was time to end all the speculation, so everyone can focus on the challenge ahead. 'I firmly believe Harry is the best man to get us out of the position we currently find ourselves in. 'He has great experience and having spoken to him at length over the last week or so, he is determined to turn this around and help us maintain our Premier League status. 'This is Harry’s squad of players, so he is the man to move us forward.' 'The performance against Manchester United showed the players are behind him and that they have the stomach for the fight. 'We know we need to improve our away form and Harry, his coaching staff and the squad will be doing all they can to turn around our fortunes on our travels.' Fernandez has urged the QPR players and fans to back their manager until the end of the season . Robert Green looks dejected in goal as QPR were beaten 2-0 by Manchester United on Saturday . QPR's board will continue to back Redknapp in the transfer market as he looks to bring in more players before the end of the January transfer window he believes can keep the club up. Fernandes has called on the club's supporters to remain in support of their manager. They have lost all 11 of their games on the road this campaign and face a difficult match away to Stoke next. That will be followed by a home game against high-flying Southampton and then long journeys to Sunderland and Hull. Fernandes added: 'The fans have been brilliant all season and all I ask is that they continue to back Harry and the team. 'It’s very tight in the table and we will do our best to strengthen where we can to give us the best possible chance.'","QPR are currently languishing in 19th in the Premier League .

"Ronny Deila warned Celtic’s SPFL Premiership rivals his side will now take some stopping. The champions returned to the top of the Premiership following a 4-0 rout of shot-shy Motherwell. A point clear of Aberdeen with a game in hand, Deila believes his team have responded to the Dons’ challenge by stepping up a gear. And he reckons a domestic clean sweep is now a realistic goal ahead of next week’s League Cup semi-final clash with Rangers. Ronny Deila warned Celtic’s SPFL Premiership rivals his side will now take some stopping . Virgil van Dijk scores the opening goal of the game in the clash between Celtic and Motherwell . Speaking after goals from Virgil van Dijk, Leigh Griffiths and a double from fit-again Mikael Lustig blew Motherwell away, Deila said: ‘Celtic can win every game when they play in Scotland. Every game. We are favourites whoever we meet, wherever we meet them, that’s how it’s going to be.’ Of the view his side have found a new gear since a winter break in Gran Canaria, the Norwegian is gunning for a treble. ‘It’s the second part of the season. If you are Celtic player you see the games ahead and what we can achieve and of course you step up a bit. The Dutchman celebrates his goal with left back Emilio Izaguirre on Wednesday evening . Scottish striker Leigh Griffiths then doubles the hosts' lead with another header . ‘We can win everything and that’s a good feeling and very, very exciting. We are very determined and looking forward to every game now. On Saturday it’s Ross County.’ Key men Anthony Stokes, James Forrest and Lustig came back from injury, with the Swedish defender claiming two late goals and almost marking his return with a hat-trick. ‘Mikael has good experience now of coming back from injury. I’m very impressed at how quickly he has adapted and come back,’ said Deila. ‘He is an important player for the team. ‘We haven’t pushed him - he needs to be 100 per cent before he plays. We want to have him over a long period of time because we know how good he is. We still have to be careful and not play him for 90 minutes yet. Griffiths celebrates doubling his side's lead by leaping through the air . Lustig then added a third goal to seal the win with 15 minutes remaining . ‘I’m very happy for him and hopefully we can get more consistency of selection with him and other players who have been injured. ‘We want to be No 1 and now everything is in our hands. If we win the rest of the games we are champions and that’s the best position we can have. We just have to keep performing like today and winning games then we will see at the end of the season whether it’s a race or not. ‘I feel more comfortable now before games, more safe, and trust the team more than I did before. We are more together and understand what we expect of each other. The training is also good quality now so if we keep what we’ve got it’s going to be hard to beat us.’ Mikael Lustig scores his second, and Celtic's fourth, goal of the evening with a diving header . The two managers watch on from the sidelines during the Scottish Premiership clash . Motherwell rarely threatened, with the loss of skipper Keith Lasley with a broken toe a further blow as boss Ian Baraclough seeks to avoid a slide into the bottom two after a fourth straight defeat. ‘It was always going to be difficult coming here,’ he said. ‘They were full of confidence and quality players. ‘We helped our own downfall because we gave away the ball too cheaply. You talk about winning your one v one battles but we lost cheap goals. ‘We put in a lot of hard work in the opening exchanges but that was undone. You’ve got to start picking up points . ‘You’d like to think there will be scope to strengthen. We’re in a scrap and we’ll need that kind of player because we’re in that group of three.’","Celtic beat Motherwell 4-0 on Wednesday evening .

"Newcastle United have hit back at Gary Lineker’s accusation they are delaying their appointment of a new head coach in order to avoid signing any new players in January.

Are we delaying to get through the January window? Absolutely not. ‘In all honesty, the January window is not one we ever envisaged being particularly active in. That’s partly because of the amount of business we did in the summer but also because January is a difficult market to operate in.’ Charnley, meanwhile, has given the clearest indication yet that United will not appoint a new boss until the end of the season.

I know that won’t be an entirely popular point of view but for me that is the most sensible thing to do.

"Music from Rocky films was played at Goodison Park on Monday night but, by the end of a dispiriting draw with West Brom, the soundtrack to Beverley Hills Cop would have been more appropriate. One win in 13 games, out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle for the first time in their distinguished history and with problems mounting, The Heat Is On Roberto Martinez and it is not showing any signs of being turned down. Kevin Mirallas' controversial failure from the penalty spot was the headline-grabbing moment of the stalemate against West Brom and, perhaps, it was a symbol of where Everton currently stand. Sportsmail looks at some of the issues. SPOT OF BOTHER . This is not the first time there has been dissent over an Everton player taking a penalty at Goodison Park. In May 1994, when the club's top-flight status was in grave danger, Neville Southall marched from his goal with the intention of taking responsibility against Wimbledon. Graham Stuart, however, was adamant he would take it and did, beating Hans Segers. The significance of the West Brom penalty could not be equated – Southall, for one, doesn't think Mirallas did anything wrong – but it is still a serious issue. Everton attacking midfielder Graham Stuart takes a penalty against Wimbledon and scores at Goodison Park . Stuart was adamant he would take the penalty for Everton and did, beating goalkeeper Hans Segers . Neville Southall marched from his goal with the intention of taking the penalty against Wimbledon . Last season Everton's players were a tight unit. They maintain that is still the case but you now see bickering and individuals putting themselves first, which is what Mirallas did. If he was thinking of the team, he would have listened to Romelu Lukaku and Steven Naismith telling him to 'give it to Bainesy'. Conspiracy theorists will think Mirallas acted with the aim of getting himself a move – he is on the radar of Tottenham, Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund – but that is risible. He does not have a Machiavelli character and no self-respecting professional would do that. You cannot help but wonder, though, whether Mirallas is unsettled and a parting of the ways may be inevitable in the summer. He has 18 months left on his contract but, having been on Merseyside for three years, would it really surprise if this Belgian moved elsewhere? Kevin Mirallas and Leighton Baines debate over who should take the penalty at Goodison on Monday night . Baines appeared to back away and let Mirallas take the kick as he patted the Belgian forward on the head . Mirallas was substituted at half-time by Everton manager Roberto Martinez after missing the penalty . WHERE IS THE MARTINEZ MAGIC? Back in April, when Arsenal had been flattened by one of the best Everton performances of the modern era, Martinez's stock could not have higher. Everton fans adored him and his name was being touted with a number of different positions. The situation is very different today. It would be wrong to suggest Martinez is fighting to save his job but the pressure is growing on him to arrest this worrying slide. He has to find answers and placate a section of the fan base who harbour deep concerns. There was a 'moment' against West Brom that underlined all is not well. When he substituted Everton's best performer Muhamed Besic, in the second half, there was uproar and booing. Martinez claimed Besic was injured but he didn't look to be struggling when sprinting off. Martinez had the Midas touch in his first season for making substitutions that changed games but this year it has been lost and some of his critics will need to be convinced he is not a one-season wonder. The Everton team he is managing now looks slow and laboured, not fast and vibrant. Martinez's men  looked a different side to the one that beat Arsenal last season in April . It would be wrong to suggest Martinez is fighting to save his job but the pressure is growing on the manager . NOT BANKING ON BARKLEY . Martinez's enthusiasm for Ross Barkley has been boundless since he arrived at Goodison. He has compared him to Germany legend Michael Ballack and claimed that not even a Gareth Bale-sized fee would convince Everton to sell. That enthusiasm, however, has created expectation. Barkley was thrilling last year but this season he has looked lost, never playing in the central position that suits him so well; he is going through the kind of dip all young players experience but, from some fans, there is no forgiveness. He was pilloried at times for losing possession and as the game was meandering to its conclusion, the howls of frustration that Barkley was not going to win it became louder. He looks like a player that would benefit from some time on the sidelines. Martinez, though, is not concerned. 'Ross has got the top personality,' said Martinez. 'You get a player who loses the ball a couple of times and they hide. That's when you've got a real issue. With Ross Barkley, last season he was just a young man enjoying his football, now he's Ross Barkley and the opposition pay him extra attention.' Ross Barkley was thrilling last season for Everton but has struggled to live up to the hype this year . Barkley has found himself going through a dip in form for Everton this season at Goodison Park . A GROWING SENSE OF UNEASE . Martinez should not be in charge of a group of players that are peering anxiously over their shoulders but they are running the risk of being sucked into the skirmishes at the bottom. They have their lowest points total after 22 games since 2000-01 and the fixture list is threatening. After they return from a warm-weather training break, they face Crystal Palace (away), Liverpool (home), Chelsea (away), Leicester (home) and Arsenal (away), plus a Europa League assignment against Young Boys Berne. They need the hamstrung James McCarthy back for that sequence. 'The break will do us good,' said England defender John Stones. 'We will regroup and see where we are after that. We are not looking at the table. We are just focusing on how we can improve.' How quickly Martinez finds the answers will determine how long the heat stays on him. Martinez has an anxious-looking squad but John Stones (left) feels their warm-weather break will do good .","Everton drew 0-0 with West Brom at Goodison Park on Monday night .

"Dave King has declared he sees no impediments to him returning to take a hands-on role at Rangers. The South Africa-based businessman has requisitioned the Ibrox board for an EGM at which he, Paul Murray and John Gilligan hope to replace chairman David Somers, James Easdale and Mike Ashley placemen Derek Llambias and Barry Leach. The current incumbents are resisting the request though, and have asked the regulator of the Alternative Investment Market to rule King unsuitable for directorship on account of his 41 contraventions of South African Income Tax Law. Dave King (above) sees no impediment to him being able to return to a hands-on role at Rangers . Rangers Chairman David Somers (left) with Derek Llambias (right) King previously agreed to pay the South African Revenue Services (SARS) £40m as part of a settlement and was fined £186,000 rather than face 84 years in prison. As well as satisfying the Stock Exchange of his suitability to take up a directorial role, King, who served on the oldco Rangers board, must also pass the SFA’s fit and proper person criteria which takes a dim view of criminal convictions and association with insolvency over the past five years. Recent reports in his adopted country pertaining to the discovery of unlawful activity within SARS had raised questions over the validity of the investigation that led to what King this week described as a ‘favourable tax settlement’. But, citing the fact he is already executive chairman of a public company, King on Wednesday waived his right to see that matter reopened by launching a staunch defence of his credentials. Mike Ashley (left) appointed his associate Derek Llambias (right) as Rangers Chief Executive in December . A statement on his behalf read: ‘There has been media coverage in the UK following a report in the South African Sunday Times that dealt with the suspension of senior managers of the South African Revenue Services (SARS) for allegedly operating a rogue intelligence unit that spied on senior politicians and businessmen. I am named in the report as one of the business people who was spied on. ‘It was suggested in the Sunday Times report that this unlawful activity by SARS could put many of the recently concluded tax settlements at risk - mine included. This is an obvious conclusion for the journalist to reach. If SARS obtained information unlawfully and such information was used to coerce settlement with me (or any other taxpayer) then I could apply to have my settlement set aside. According to my advice that is the correct legal position. ‘For the avoidance of doubt I wish to make my position clear. I will not be making an application to have my settlement reviewed and/or set aside for two reasons: . Off-field politics have prompted numerous protests from Rangers fans this season . '1. My settlement resulted from prolonged and robust litigation that was fully in the public arena. There was no information produced or used by SARS that was unlawfully gained and, in my opinion, the individuals I dealt with at SARS acted in good faith - both during and after my settlement negotiations. I consequently have no legal basis to argue for the review and setting aside of my settlement. '2. Even if my legal team could make out a case for review I would not pursue it. I am happy with the settlement and the opportunity this created for me to lead a normal business and personal life. My business interests have performed very strongly post-settlement with the SA government by far my largest customer. I am also able to enjoy my role as Executive Chairman of a public company without the integrity issues that previously dogged me. 'Importantly, I also now have sufficient time and resources to invest in getting Rangers back on track.’ The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems .","Dave King does not see any reason for him not to return to Rangers .

"Fan ownership group Rangers First have set their sights on snapping up 10 per cent of the Ibrox club following a sharp spike in membership. Former director Paul Murray and ex-Rangers striker Nacho Novo became the latest high-profile figures to throw their weight behind fan share purchase schemes on Tuesday. Rangers First believe they now have enough fans investing cash to buy 100,000 shares in the club a month. The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems . ‘We are up to nearly 4,400 members,’ director Ricki Neill told Sportsmail. ‘The momentum is definitely growing rapidly. Even amongst former players we are gaining some backing. ‘We don’t want to own Ibrox. What we seek is representation for supporters on the board. ‘Our long-term goal is to get to 10 per cent of the shares in Rangers and then we can actually have a say in what happens. ‘We can run matters past our members and see how they wish to vote on it. That’s our main goal. ‘We don’t want to fall out with the board - we want to be represented on the board.’ Murray, part of the Dave King group seeking to oust the current board at a forthcoming EGM, is one of the new Rangers First members. The former Ibrox director has also taken a life membership of Rangers Supporters Trust, a different body with broadly similar goals. Former Rangers striker Nacho Novo has thrown his weight behind Ranger First's 10 per cent bid . And has urged Rangers fans to take destiny into their own hands by throwing their financial muscle behind one of two fan ownership schemes. Murray, who together with Dave King and John Gilligan, is seeking a place on the Ibrox board at a forthcoming Extraordinary General Meeting, said: ‘I have today taken out life membership of both the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First. Whilst I would like to make special mention of the RST, who have supported our cause tirelessly over the last few years, I wish to make it known that I fully support these two groups in their desire to help safeguard the future of our club. ‘Along with many of the people who have been working behind the scenes to ensure Rangers can again function fully, both on and off the pitch, I believe the supporters should be able to participate significantly in the club’s rehabilitation. ‘Dave King, John Gilligan and I are committed to introducing meaningful fan ownership and representation at the club and that is one of the reasons I have pledged my support to both groups. Novo, pictured celebrating scoring for Rangers in March 2010, has backed the share-buying scheme . ‘RST and Rangers First have bought not insignificant amounts of shares and must be recognised by those of us who are striving to remove the current Directors and begin the process of repairing the considerable damage caused by a constantly changing Boardroom. ‘The Club and not the needs of individuals must be put back to the top of the priority list and the supporters can help us achieve that goal. Rangers First and RST will always have the best interests of their club at heart and they deserve as much support as we can give. ‘I would urge as many of this club’s fans to sign up to either one or both if possible. The fans can play a hugely significant part in forcing change through votes. ‘They are the most loyal supporters any club could wish for but have been disregarded by a succession of directors in recent years and I for one recognise their contribution in the struggle to end the disgrace and level of mismanagement within Ibrox. Former Rangers director Paul Murray is another person to have put his support behind the scheme . ‘There is now a demand for a General Meeting and our fans can make a difference in that process, which hopefully will bring about the changes necessary. We have seen what happens when Directors with no feel, no understanding and no real concern for Rangers are in control.’ Between them Rangers First and RST may yet hold around two per cent of Rangers around the time of the EGM. The numbers are tight, but with the King group scrambling for 51 per cent their shares may yet have an influence on the balance of power. ‘At the Hearts game on Friday night you could sense a different atmosphere,’ Neill added. ‘Even within Ibrox people are asking now what they can actually do, asking how supporter representation might work.’ Novo is the latest former player to sign up and the Spaniard said: ‘This is not a football club anymore. It’s just about business and money and things like that. Rangers football board chairman Sandy Easdale has bought more than a million extra shares . ‘For me, it’s like Real Madrid and Barcelona. This club has that history. It should be run by the fans - end of. There is so much great history at this club and the fans deserve more.’ Seeking to capitalise on a radio advertising campaign and a publicity blitz, Neill claims widespread disgust over the tumult at the club is uniting a previously divided support. And Murray insisted the wider fan-base must be prepared to stand strong in the face of a war of words that’s only going to intensify. ‘In the lead up to the General Meeting the usual suspects will attempt to undermine our cause because they realise their days could be numbered,’ he said. ‘The truth is that for the first time in years there is a group of people capable of rebuilding and repairing our club and malicious speculation will not deflect us. ‘Rangers have to re-engage with Scottish football and take our place again at the top table. ‘We need to be financially stable again and accept our responsibilities to the game in general. Change will come and we can all emerge from a black period in this fantastic club’s history.’","Rangers fans are attempting to buy a 10 per cent stake in the club .

"Jack Butland is determined to prove his worth at Stoke after returning from a fourth loan spell away from the club. Many had expected Asmir Begovic to depart the Potteries after the highly rated England Under-21s captain arrived from Birmingham in a £3.5million deal. Two years on, though, the Bosnia-Herzegovina international remains at the Britannia Stadium, severely restricting Butland's match time at City. Jack Butland had a successful spell at Derby County and now wants to become first choice at Stoke City . Asmir Begovic has kept fellow goalkeeper Butland out of the starting line-up at Stoke since 2012 . Butland has been forced to leave Stoke four times on loan to get first team experience . The 21-year-old has spent time on loan during that period with Birmingham, Barnsley, Leeds and, most recently, Derby, but is now back at Stoke and eager now to usurp Begovic. 'I want to play games,' Butland said. 'Obviously I had a really good spell at Derby, but I've come back now. 'I am really going to try and put pressure on at Stoke and get into the side and get as many games as I can between now and the end of the season, ready for the tournament.' The competition Butland is referring to is the European Under-21 Championship in the Czech Republic. It is a tournament England approach full of confidence after a qualifying campaign so impressive that manager Gareth Southgate was handed an extended contract until 2017 on Wednesday. Butland's first team appearances since joining Stoke have been limited . 'It is a massive boost for all of us,' Butland said of the news. 'He has been great for us and we've got a really good set-up and a really good squad going. 'There's a really positive feel about it and it has been a big credit to Gareth, what he has done and who he has brought in, in terms of Steve Holland and other staff. 'It is brilliant, what he has done. The lads are all really enjoying it and really looking forward to the tournament in the summer and hopefully making things pay off.' If any extra motivation was required, Butland needs only look back to the debacle of 2013, when the Young Lions fell at the first hurdle and returned home from Israel without a point to their name. Butland spoke of his delight that England Under-21 manager Gareth Southgate signed a contract extension . 'We've got a really, really good squad, all pulling in the right direction and all get on extremely well,' he said - something backed up by the fact he was speaking at the NBA in London, where he was with international team-mate Nathan Redmond. 'That's massively important, so we're really excited, we've got some big games coming up in March. 'We're looking to prove ourselves and test ourselves again, leading into the tournament in the summer and hopefully put Israel a long way in the past.'","Jack Butland has found first team chances limited at Stoke City .

"By DAMIAN SPELLMAN, PRESS ASSOCIATION . All 92 Barclays Premier League and Sky Bet Football League clubs have been contacted by campaigners in a bid to tackle sexist abuse in the game. Women in Football, backed by the Football Association, has written to every club with recommendations to highlight a series of issues which occur particularly on matchdays. The organisation conducted a survey earlier this year which found that 66 per cent of women employed in football had witnessed sexism in the workplace. A spokesperson for the WiF Board said: 'Women in Football believe that every female employee in the football industry has the right to go about their working lives without being targeted for discriminatory abuse or sexual harassment. Women in Football have issued guidelines to all Premier and Football League clubs about sexism in the game . 'WiF hope that by working with football authorities and clubs, we can bring about a greater understanding of the barriers that women in the industry routinely face. 'We urge all those involved to take these first steps towards acknowledging the experiences of their female employees, and adopting proactive measures to tackle the issue of sexism in the game.' The advice to clubs includes briefing stewards and security staff on match days as to what to look out for and how to deal with it; highlighting the importance of reporting sexist abuse and discrimination; publicising the reporting mechanisms by which complaints can be made; and featuring interviews or profiles of inspirational female employees in matchday programmes to demonstrating a club's commitment to equal opportunities for women. WiF has been logging incidents this season and has recorded complaints of crowd abuse aimed at female employees, including medical staff, match officials and media representatives, at all levels of the game. An FA spokesperson said: 'The FA takes all forms of discrimination seriously and tackling sexism is integral to our work. We encourage reporting of sexism wherever possible either directly via the FA, via the Kick It Out app or other avenues, such as Women in Football. 'We're currently in the vanguard of some exciting work around gender equality, raising the profile of women in key roles across the game and championing women's leadership roles. 'Working collaboratively with the football bodies and organisations like Women in Football, the Muslim Women's Sports Foundation and Kick It Out, will ensure this work has substance and impact.'","Women in Football issued recommendations to highlight issues relating to sexism that take place in the game, particularly on match days .

"Team Sky are expected to unveil a string of ambitious new targets when they outline another five-year plan at the British squad's Majorca training camp on Sunday. Team principal Sir Dave Brailsford raised eyebrows in 2009 when he announced his aim for a British Tour de France winner within five years but victories for Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and Chris Froome 12 months later ensured his optimism was more than justified.

It will be no easy task for the 29-year-old, who was initially reluctant to commit to the race given a route which does not seem to favour him compared to reigning champion Vincenzo Nibali and six-time Grand Tour winner Alberto Contador. It may also mean a different approach for the team too. Sir Bradley Wiggins will bring an end to a five-and-a-half-year affiliation with Team Sky in April . Brailsford insisted last summer he would not ""throw the baby out with the bathwater"" but last year's Tour was the first time Sky had come away without a stage win since their debut in 2010, and a wider process of reinvigoration may be required. Aside from the Grand Tours, a victory in one of the major Spring Classics continues to elude Brailsford's men and the main target will be Paris-Roubaix, which gets under way on April 12. Welsh rider Geraint Thomas, who impressed at the Tour de France, came seventh last time out but the heaviest burden of expectation will sit on the shoulders of Wiggins. The four-time Olympic champion finally confirmed the launch of 'Team Wiggins' on Thursday and Paris-Roubaix will likely be the 34-year-old's last competitive road race for Sky before he returns to the track and diverts his focus entirely towards Rio 2016. Ben Swift and Peter Kennaugh will be hoping to benefit from the team's latest innovations in 2015 . Wiggins' final contract with Sky expires in April, bringing an end to a five-and-a-half-year affiliation that Brailsford described as ""one of the greatest stories in British sport over the last 10 years"". Brailsford will also have to answer questions on doping after another eventful 12 months off the bike. The team terminated Jonathan Tiernan-Locke's contract in July after discrepancies were found in his biological passport and they fielded criticism too regarding Froome's use of TUEs (therapeutic user exemption certificate) for asthma medication at the Tour de Romandie. Sky's zero-tolerance approach to doping effectively rules out the recruitment of a number of more experienced riders and coaches but, despite boasting a vast budget, Brailsford has always maintained a preference for younger talent. Thomas, Ben Swift, Andy Fenn, Luke Rowe and Peter Kennaugh will be among those hoping to benefit from the team's latest innovations in 2015.

"Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford wants his riders to cement their place as 'indisputably the best cycling team in the world' by 2020. When Team Sky launched in 2009, Brailsford vowed to produce a British Tour de France winner and he succeeded, as Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome triumphed in 2012 and 2013. Brailsford is now looking to the next five years and, despite the team notching 165 victories overall since its foundation, he is adamant things can get even better.

The 21-year-old joined the Blues outfit as an eight-year-old but failed to impress despite making his first-team debut at 17.

"Krystian Bielik completed his transfer to Arsenal on Wednesday, as Arsene Wenger sealed the signature of the highly-rated Polish starlet. The 17-year-old has been told he will go straight into Wenger's first-team squad. Here, Sportsmail gives the lowdown on the young midfielder... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Is Krystian Bielik Arsenal's answer to Patrick Vieira? Krystian Bielik poses in his new team colours after completing a transfer from Legia Warsaw to Arsenal . Quelle surprise, Arsenal sign another ‘wonderkid’. Yes, despite the obvious need to strengthen his senior squad,  Wenger has forked out a seven-figure sum to land Polish teenager Krystian Bielik. Wenger has bought Bielik for a reported £2.5million. Shouldn’t he have spent on an established player? Possibly but the Gunners were not the only club chasing Bielik. Hamburg, in Germany, had also registered an interest in the 17-year-old and would have completed a move this month if Arsenal hadn’t swooped. He made his debut for Legia Warsaw when he was only 16. He played six times for the club, including once in the Europa League, before putting pen to paper on a deal to take him to London. Bielik plays on his phone at the airport on his journey to Belgium for a Europa League match with  Lokeren . OK, so what are his attributes? At 6ft 2in, Bielik seems physically equipped for the Premier League. Wenger has described him as an energetic central midfielder and his manager at Legia, former Manchester United player Henning Berg, believes Bielik has a maturity in his play that is beyond his years. 'He has good techniques, is able to keep the ball,' Berg is quoted as saying in legia.sport. 'For his age he has a very developed ability to make appropriate decisions. Personality sets him on the field. 'At the first training was a kid who wanted to kick the ball. In his debut,  he played as if it was just another game. He does not crack. We had to teach him  tactically, but  individual skill was already at a high level.' Legia Warsaw manager Henning Berg was impressed by Bielik during his time in Poland . The new Patrick Vieira? It’s too early to make such grand claims but those who have watched Bielik report many similarities. Bielik thrives as a holding midfielder but his versatility means he also provides an option in central defence. Berg's claims of Bielik's clever decision making in that area of the field would certainly align him with the likes of the former Arsenal captain, whose commanding presence on the pitch has never been replaced by Wenger. If he can nurture Bielik's potential, then perhaps he may have found a successor. Many similarities have been made between Bielik and former Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira .","Krystian Bielik secured his move to Arsenal on Wednesday .

"Newcastle United defender Daryl Janmaat is refusing to write off the club's season. The Magpies slipped into the bottom half of the Barclays Premier League table as a result of Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Southampton, their seventh in nine games in all competitions. The club's ongoing search for a head coach following Alan Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace earlier this month has created further uncertainty. Newcastle right-back Daryl Janmaat insists that The Magpies can still finish the season strongly . Janmaat jostles with Southampton's Eljero Elia during the Premier League game on January 17 . However, 25-year-old Janmaat, who along with his team-mates is currently on a warm weather training camp in Dubai, is confident the impending return from injury of the likes of Siem de Jong, Rolando Aarons and Gabriel Obertan can help to rekindle the campaign. The Holland international said: 'We have to try to reach as high as possible. For certain, we are looking to finish in the top half of the table. That's our main aim now. 'We have Siem to come back and other good players. It's nice to know. They can make us stronger.' Newcastle playmaker Siem De Jong, who signed from Ajax in the summer, is close to a return from injury . Rolando Aarons scores the opening goal for Newcastle in their 2-0 League Cup victory over Manchester City . Newcastle are yet to hire a new head coach following Alan Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace . De Jong, the man Pardew hoped would provide the link between midfield and attack, has managed only three starts for the club since his £6 million summer switch from Ajax. The 25-year-old has spent the last four and a half months fighting his way back from a torn thigh muscle and while he still has some way to go, he travelled to Dubai with the rest of the squad after resuming full training last week. De Jong could prove a key figure as Newcastle attempt to increase their goal-threat with youngster Ayoze Perez currently carrying a heavy burden as a lone striker with Papiss Cisse away with Senegal and Emmanuel Riviere yet to open his league account. Youngster Ayoze Perez has had to shoulder a lot of the goalscoring responsibility for Newcastle this season .

"Carlos Tevez has revealed he has no intention of extending his contract with Juventus after 2016. The Argentina striker has been linked with a return to Boca Juniors when his present deal at the Italian champions expires, though Juve would like to keep him until 2018. But it seems the former West Ham, Manchester United and Manchester City striker feels he will be ready for a new challenge. Carlos Tevez has revealed he has no intention of extending his contract with Juventus beyond 2016 . Tevez celebrates his goal in the Italian Super Cup final with Napoli in Qatar just before Christmas . 'I said I wanted to fulfil my contract and that's my idea, I'm not thinking of signing an extension because that's not how I feel at the moment,' Tevez told reporters in Buenos Aires on Wednesday before returning to Turin from the year-end holidays.

"As one Lambert shuffled out of Villa Park fretting privately about what the future holds, another Lambert bounded out with a renewed sense of purpose. If things have been increasingly bleak for Aston Villa manager Paul, the season has hardly gone to plan for Liverpool striker Rickie either. His starts have been rare, goals scarce and speculation increased that he might move on in this window. West Brom and Crystal Palace are keen but he is not interested. Lambert’s dream came true when he moved to Anfield from Southampton last June and he won’t give up on it just because the transition has been bumpy. Rickie Lambert (right) scored Liverpool's second goal in the 2-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday . Lambert was visibly overjoyed at scoring his second Premier League goal for Liverpool . Why should he? The 32-year-old substitute may have been on the pitch for only 20 minutes here but he made a difference, sweeping in the goal that guaranteed a win. Such was his joy, he almost jumped into the Witton Lane Stand to celebrate with Liverpool’s fans. ‘That’s the best way to affect a game,’ said Lambert. ‘In the past I maybe would have passed instead of taking it on myself. It was nice to secure the game after Simon Mignolet had saved us. He was brilliant. ‘I love those celebrations, I love watching them on TV. To do it myself with the Liverpool fans is something I’ll always remember. The best moment I’ve felt since I’ve been here. Brilliant. ‘I’ve no intention of leaving Liverpool while they want me. If they don’t want me I’ll go but I’m here to help in whatever way I can.’ His manager believes he is doing that. Brendan Rodgers pumped the air with his fist as Lambert’s drive sneaked past Brad Guzan. ‘I was delighted for him,’ said Rodgers. ‘He is making the contribution I wanted. There is a spotlight on him because of the unavailability of other players but he was brought in to make an effect. He’ll always score goals.’ Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) was delighted with Lambert's role in the victory . There will be no dwelling on this win, not with Chelsea in town on Tuesday for the first part of their Capital One Cup semi-final. Few will give Liverpool hope of victory over two legs. ‘I went to the Champions League semi-final against Chelsea in 2005,’ Lambert said. ‘It was the best atmosphere I’ve ever experienced. Can we do the same? It would be brilliant. We’re getting better, we’ve got players coming back and we’re still in all the cups. ‘Chelsea will probably be favourites but we’ve got the winning mentality back. I can’t talk all day about iconic games from the past. We want to have our own.’","Rickie Lambert got his second Premier League goal in Liverpool's win over Aston Villa .

"CLICK HERE to visit Sportsmail's Match Zone service for stats, goals and more! The boos around Villa Park at the end were an evocative echo of the despair. Aston Villa have played eight hours and 42 minutes of Barclays Premier League football and failed to score. It's hard not to sympathise with their supporters. Football without goals ultimately becomes meaningless. And though the attempt by some fans to demonstrate their discontent by boycotting the first eight minutes of the game had fallen flat, a more spontaneous protest – that of missing the last eight minutes of the match when the game was up - was much better supported, a steady stream of fans heading for the exits. Those that stayed chanted: 'We want Lerner out' in reference to the owner, Randy. But he has put the club up for sale and there is no queue forming along the Trinity Road to buy so Villa must continue as they are, seemingly always fighting relegation.

'It's been like that for three years, four years, five years, the same,' said Paul Lambert of another season immersed in the mire of relegation worries. 'There's no rest bite whatsoever. You meet it head on. You keep going. Come the end of the season you make sure you're out if it.' That said, Lambert objected when it was suggested that might be the best Villa can expect. 'Absolutely no way,' he said. 'A club of this size should not be in the position it is. It's got to get up there. Certainly nobody likes it at the club. I don't like it, the chairman doesn't like it, the chief executive doesn't like it, the players don't like it, the fans don't like it.' Putting it right is a harder task. Amidst the depression though, there was a team rediscovering itself. Not Villa of course; it's hard to fathom what they stand for at present. Liverpool though are quietly rebuilding a little of swagger of last season. They are of course a long way from those heights at present. Perhaps the return of Daniel Sturridge will nudge them a little further in that direction. But at times they give glimpses of the free-spirited side that captivated the nation last season. It's now eight games undefeated since they lost to Manchester United, the game in which Brendan Rodger's completely changed to a back three. 'We re-gained our identity in how the team has played for two years,' said Rodgers. 'It was fair to say that the opening four months or so of the season we were just nowhere near what we had been so we needed to find a solution to that. Even though we lost the Man United game I saw enough in the dynamic of the team to know that could be a way forward for us.'

Philippe Coutinho   90         11.1       6.9 . Lazar Markovic       90         10.8       6.7 . So much so, that Liverpool have begun to eye the top four again. 'If we can get through to the end of January and be somewhere near then, as we showed last year, we can put a run together which can see us in there. It's still the objective. It's a real young exciting team and you see that in some of the football we played today.' You could. It was there in Alberto Moreno's marauding runs, Philippe Coutinho's sublime passing and Jordan Henderson's determined leadership. Perhaps more importantly it was there in the performances of Mamado Sakho and Emre Can and the much-maligned Simon Mignolet, 'outstanding' according to Rogders and indeed responsible for crucial saves when Liverpool looked to be squandering chances. Get the defence right and Liverpool could be dangerous. For their opening goal on 24 minutes had the panache associated with Liverpool of late. Lazar Markovic exchanged passes with Sterling after a throw-in and fed Jordan Henderson. A neat touch and a lovely cross followed before Fabio Borini literally launched himself, body and legs flying through the air, to divert it in. It should have been 2-0 on 38 minutes when Lucas Leiva header put Sterling through on goal. With just Brad Guzan to beat and with a firm striker needed, he opted for an elaborate chip, only to see the ball land tamely into Guzan's hands. There were some positives for Villa, even amidst the gloom. The performance was some way better than the defeat at Leicester last weekend. There was the arrival of Carles Gil on the hour ' as good a debut as I've seen' according to Lambert - who, along with Andi Weimann, injected purpose into Villa's offesnive play.

Sterling is seen to by the Liverpool physio after the incident with Sanchez at Villa Park on Saturday . Sterling feels the pain from a knock during the Premier League match for Liverpool against Aston Villa . At least the team aspired to a goal. Benteke came closest in that second half period, feeding off a headed Baker flick-on to unleash a ferocious shot which Mignolet blocked well. The Liverpool keeper was then straight up to punch away a Weimann shot. Encouraged and emboldened, the Holte End roared its support and Baker went close on 67 minutes, heading over from a corner. 'I thought we were excellent in the second half, we were relentless and the goalkeeper has had a half,' said Lambert. 'The goals will come.' Yet,ultimately it would not prove enough. There is still not enough attacking intent from Villa in long enough periods and Liverpool simply kept prodding and eventually they did get the goal they had long threatened. It came when Sterling played in substitute Lambert, who controlled the ball and draggedit back it one delightful movement which landed Aly Cissokho on his backside. Lambert then matched the build-up with a high-quality finish, striking the ball into the far corner beyond Guzan. The clock showed 80 minutes and at the stage the Holte End did begin to empty.

Warren said: ‘It’s been a busy Christmas period, but I’m delighted to secure world title fights for Chris and Paul early in the new year which is fantastic news for them. Despite losing, Eubank Jnr gets a shot at interim WBA world middleweight champion Dmitry Chudinov . If Eubank Jnr beats Chudinov, he'll likely push for a unification fight against Saunders, should he beat newly-crowned WBO champion Andy Lee in an expected spring encounter . 'For Chris, it was a close fight against Billy and the loss to a big rival would have been hard to take, but he now has a great opportunity to go straight back into the ring and claim a world championship belt and prove that he’s learnt from the loss and show that he’s the real thing. ‘I believe that Paul is a super talent and I’m especially pleased to deliver him a second and history making world title opportunity against Tete which should have happened in October. ‘He gets the chance now and I’m sure he’ll grab the opportunity with both hands. It’s a great start to the year and there is more big news to come shortly for Liam Smith and Derry Mathews on the Liverpool show.’","Chris Eubank Jnr lost a split points decision to Billy Joe Saunders .
