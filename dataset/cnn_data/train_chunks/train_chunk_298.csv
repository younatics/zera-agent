"(CNN) -- ""What?! You do theater, you've been a television anchor, you dance like you're possessed at nightclubs, you emcee events, you interview celebrities, and you call yourself an introvert? Get out!"" Nobody believes me when I say I'm shy. Sure, I thought I'd conquered it. I'd forced myself to get out of my shell, and speak to people -- I'd even chosen a career in journalism that involved interacting with strangers. But nine years into that career, I found myself willing to brave helmet hair and the blistering summer heat of Madras (officially called Chennai now) to ride a scooter to a meeting, just so I wouldn't have to ask our tenant to move the car that was blocking mine. And then it hit me -- you can get over shyness but the crippling tightness that paralyzes introverts is not conquerable. I'm not sure how to explain the ""tightness."" Perhaps it's unwillingness, not so much as inability, to communicate. It's almost a mood, but with physical manifestations that clever folks may term ""psychosomatic."" One shrinks from contact. It's not the inability to interact, just a preference not to. As I analyzed this particular incident, I could recall several others. There are times I pretend I haven't seen someone I know, so I can avoid talking to him or her. These are not people I dislike; I'm even fond of many of the people I've evaded. I don't know why it happens. When I give myself a pep talk and push myself to go say hi, I can feel my heart beat faster, my nerves on edge, my throat dry up. Yes, it's pretty much how you might feel before asking someone out; only, in this case, it was before asking someone to move a car. So, we all have our complexes. I got over ""fat-girl"" by losing weight and ""unpretty-girl"" by getting my face on TV, but how does one get rid of ""shy-girl""? Especially when the only people who understand are the ones who suffer from it, and are hence unlikely to bump into you? My teachers in school were baffled when I clammed up at extempore and elocution contests and was squeamish about debates. People assume good writers are good speakers. They assume stage fright is the fear of appearing on stage and hearing the sound of one's own voice. But here's the thing: stage fright isn't so much the fear of the limelight as the consciousness of the presence of other people. Introverts are not always the kids with thick glasses, ugly braces and narrow shoulders, who spend all their time in the library or science lab. They could be popular in school, take part in extracurricular activities and have perfectly normal relationships (just as long as they don't have to do the asking out!). But, there are things they feel they simply can't do, things that seem to induce a stifling sense of lethargy in them. I suppose I had forced myself out of this lethargy every now and again, but I hadn't thought about how I got here, or how I learned to deal with the onset of introvert tendencies, until the incident with the car. My ""therapy"" may have begun with theater. I loved the idea of bringing characters alive, and I knew how each line should be spoken. But I was terribly inhibited during play readings and hated ""trust"" exercises. I can't say I'm particularly fond of them now, either. It wasn't the corniness of it all, it was the constant contact, the idea of giving away personal thought and space. Why did people have to know me when I was playing somebody else? The problem was solved when I had one of those epiphanies that appear so ""duh!"" in retrospect: that ""somebody else"" I conjured up in acting class was simply living her life, not acting it. I only had to be her. The corollary was that I could have a persona, one that would allow me to say out loud the wisecracks in my head, one that could hug people, one that could snuff out the sudden bouts of shyness that hampered my self-assurance. All it took was stepping out of myself. Gradually, the two may have gotten integrated, because the persona was not different from me; the persona just did what I wanted to do. And breaking out of my introverted inclinations to do those things gave me the confidence to do more of them. My second big step was moving abroad, and that leads me to wonder whether introverted behavior is cultural. Oh, we Indians make a garrulous nation, but we rarely communicate. Our natural instinct is to walk past strangers and look away quickly if our eyes happen to meet. We don't make conversation with people who have a functional role, such as billing our purchases or filling our fuel tanks. They give us numbers, we hand them cash. On my second day in London, a cheerful cashier at Sainsbury's spoke to me about his girlfriend's parents, my course of study at the university, why Chelsea FC stinks and how my appearance was too indeterminate to reveal my ethnicity. Strangers smiled and nodded in greeting. It seemed rather bizarre at first not to avert my eyes and pretend it hadn't happened when I reached for the same can as someone else. But I grew comfortable with it over time. My big moment was sharing a laugh with a woman on the South Bank, as her toddler screamed when one of the statue people moved. ""Trauma when he's under 5. His brain's warped now, you know,"" I grinned, and she sighed, ""Yeah, I know!"" I moved on to a smile-and-wave mute-and-mutual flirtation with a tall fellow-jogger on Harrow Hill, which lasted several months -- till I spotted him in a blazer and realized he was a schoolboy. When I moved back to India, the list of ""things I'd rather not approach people about"" was far shorter. But this isn't a finite list. You never know when the need will arise to pull your socks up and take a deep breath before asking someone if he can, say, move a car. The good news, though, is you can learn to deal with those few moments well enough to make people roll their eyes when you say you're an introvert.","Nandini Krishnan says she's an introvert though she does not fit the profile of one .

"(CNN) -- Next Monday, Google is officially shutting down its popular RSS feed reader, Google Reader. The service's demise after nearly eight years has come as a shock to many who depend on it to collect news into one place from all the websites they love. Its end has created something of a gold rush among startups and other tech companies vying to take the tool's place. Instead of just finding the closest thing to Reader, maybe it's time to change how you consume all that news. Looking at every single article for a source can be time-consuming, especially if you follow a huge number of sites, and a lot has changed since 2005. But before trying anything, take a minute to download all your information from Google Reader now. Google Takeout bundles up your feeds, folders, followers and other data into a zip file that you can use later with other services. (Many of the tools we mention will import data automatically from Google if you sign up before Reader closes.) Feedly adds Web version in new bid for Reader users . The replacements . Change isn't for everyone, and for people who rely on a comprehensive approach to seeing the day's news, finding the next best Reader imitator might be the best interim approach. There is already an overwhelming number of replacements that deliver straight RSS feeds. The best bets are Feedly, The Old Reader, NewsBlur, Aol Reader and NetVibes. Some new tools were rushed on to beat the July 1 demise of Google Reader and are bound to undergo more changes and improvements -- some are still being created such as Betaworks' Digg Reader. However, the weak links could also end up abandoned in time, and you'll have to search for a home for your carefully organized RSS feeds again. Think about what's most important to you. Are you primarily checking from a mobile device or from a regular Web browser, and do you need something that will sync across devices (some are only available as apps, others in browsers)? Is sharing stories important, or is reading the news a solitary activity? How important are images, cost, search features or the absence of ads? Social suggestions . Twitter is a killer news source. Major news surfaces naturally on the social network; a chorus of links or commentary about important stories will likely make its way into anyone's feed, whether they're following news junkies or just friends. The Discover tab shows popular links from your feed as well, but it's more effective to edit down whom you follow carefully or create custom lists for your various interests. You can follow your favorite news organizations or drill down by finding their Twitter accounts for specific sections or topics. If you like specific writers, follow them for their work as well as context on regular news or links to other writers they enjoy. Hashtags can be great for following news about a specific event or topic. Facebook is a different creature when it comes to news. It is decent for finding recommended links, but the posts and banter are more personal, happy and less about the outside world. People sometimes avoid posting links or talking about major news stories that might lead to uncomfortable clashes with friends and family. (Clashes and the resulting conversations are among the best parts of Twitter and flesh out the big news stories.) Fight of the aggregator . The RSS fire hose of news can be overwhelming for many people. A handful of clever tools do more than just show you feeds. They use your interests and some algorithms to figure out what types of articles and topics you will be most interested in and then serve up content that fits with your patterns. Articles are typically grouped by sections, such as sports or the stock market. The tools are big on sharing and use images heavily for a more magazine-like reading experience. Flipboard, Prismatic, Pulse and Zite (which is owned by CNN) are all popular options. Come back for the longer reads . RSS readers are great because you can scan headlines and the first few sentences of articles and get the gist without having to read them, only going further if it's a topic about which you want to know more. The meatier content (feature stories, long and winding narratives, the New Yorker) deserves more than a glance, but deep reads are different from the quick scan. Save the things you want to dig into later, even offline, with tools such as Instapaper, Pocket or Readability. Apple's Safari browser also offers a Read Later button. The direct route . Typing a news site's URL directly into a browser seems so passÃ©. But when you just need a quick hit, going straight to a trusted local, national or international news organization might satisfy. Many organizations have their own stand-alone mobile apps on Android, iOS and Windows Phone devices. One advantage of these apps is that you can set up push notifications so you know as soon as something important happens. There is also Google News, which looks at all the news sources and arranges the breaking stories by popularity, highlighting the in-depth, opinion and featured stories on the topic. A neat visual take on Google News is Newsmap.jp, which Marcos Weskamp created before moving to Flipboard to work as a designer. No news is good news . The true minimalists can avoid the noise by checking one or two outlets once a day, trusting that the major stories will be featured prominently. News.me sucks in your Twitter and Facebook feeds and turns them into digestible daily e-mails that summarize the most talked about stories of the day. If you really want to check out, read the Harper's Weekly Review post, which is also available as a newsletter. Every Tuesday, it quickly and amusingly runs down the major stories that happened in the past seven days, with links in case you are intrigued and want to find out more. Mix and match . There is no one-fits-all solution for how to consume news, and many people hack together their own custom systems from various sources. For example, some go directly to their bookmarked must-read sites in the morning, keep up on current news with Twitter during the day and soak in longer articles on commutes with tools such as Instapaper. Some multitaskers keep TV or radio news humming in the background while they go about their daily activities. Google Reader was a great tool that will be missed, but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps, sites and tools for reading news online. Share your news-reading habits and suggestions in the comments.","The Google Reader is closing next week, and it's time to find a replacement RSS tool .

"Washington (CNN) -- An independent review of the September 11 attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi released Tuesday cited ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the State Department. The attacks killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The failures resulted in a security plan ""that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,"" the 39-page, unclassified version of the report concluded. Read the independent panel's full report . Veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, both members of the review board, are scheduled to brief members of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations committees in private on Wednesday. The board cited a lack of resources as at least partly to blame. ""The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs,"" it said. The board found that Washington tended ""to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades ... while generally failing to meet Benghazi's repeated requests"" to beef up personnel. The board completed its investigation this week and sent a copy Monday to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its 24 recommendations. They include strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas. Benghazi siege: The ambassador's last minutes . The report said ""there was no protest prior to the attacks,"" which it described as ""unanticipated in their scale and intensity."" It also cited the Bureau of Diplomatic Security staff as ""inadequate"" in Benghazi on the day of the attack and in the months and weeks leading up to it, ""despite repeated requests from Special Mission Benghazi and Embassy Tripoli for additional staffing."" The report said there had been a ""lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership at the senior levels"" in Washington, Tripoli and Benghazi. ""Security in Benghazi was not recognized and implemented as a 'shared responsibility' by the bureaus in Washington charged with supporting the post, resulting in stove-piped discussions and decisions on policy and security,"" it said. ""That said, Embassy Tripoli did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with Washington for increased security for Special Mission Benghazi."" The report said the short-term nature of the mission's staff, many of whom were inexperienced U.S. personnel, ""resulted in diminished institutional knowledge, continuity and mission capacity."" The mission was also ""severely under-resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment,"" it said. It singled out for criticism the dependence on ""poorly skilled"" members of the Libyan February 17 Martyrs' Brigade and unarmed local guards who were supposed to provide security. It noted that, at the time of Stevens' visit, militia members ""had stopped accompanying Special Mission vehicle movements in protest over salary and working hours."" Benghazi problems suggest long list of changes for security of diplomats . Though it said there had been no specific, credible threats on the day of the attack, the significance of the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 had led Stevens to decide to hold meetings on the compound on September 11 of this year. But security systems and the Libyan response ""fell short"" when the compound came was penetrated ""by dozens of armed attackers."" The report offers a detailed description of what happened that night. It said Libyan mission guards were not present, local militia fled their posts and ""there simply was not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference."" The board said it could not determine how a gate at the compound was breached, ""but the speed with which attackers entered raised the possibility"" that the guards had left it open. Eric Boswell, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, and Charlene Lamb, deputy assistant secretary of state for international programs, oversaw decisions on security at the diplomatic outpost. Lamb testified before Congress about the security precautions. Documents show Lamb denied repeated requests for additional security in Libya. Despite all the criticism, the board found no U.S. government employee had engaged in misconduct or ignored responsibilities and did not recommend any individual be disciplined. Clinton, who is recovering from a stomach virus and concussion, ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack. Such reports are mandated by Congress when Americans working on behalf of the U.S. government are killed overseas. State Department: Clinton not dodging Benghazi hearings . A notice sent to State Department employees said the implementation team had met Tuesday and would continue to do so regularly to carry out the board's recommendations. The politics surrounding the events that led to the report have claimed one political casualty, with Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, last week pulling her name from consideration to succeed Clinton. Some Republican senators had said they would put a hold on her nomination if President Barack Obama had submitted it, based on comments Rice made in the days after the attack. In place of Clinton, Deputy Secretaries of State William Burns and Thomas Nides will testify before the House and Senate committees Thursday. Read more: Benghazi attack back in the spotlight .

"(CNN) -- The only thing that dawned when the official ""Batman vs. Superman"" title was announced on Wednesday was how much the Internet hated it. For months, fans have referred to the upcoming ""Man of Steel"" sequel as just ""Batman vs. Superman,"" a placeholder that also recognizes the fact that both superheroes are appearing on the big screen together for the first time. But on Wednesday, the actual title was unveiled to be ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" along with the announcement that production on the project is now underway in metro Detroit. Immediately, the Twitterati fired back. ""BATMAN v SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE. Coming in September, to Lifetime Networks,"" chided Patton Oswalt. ""OK, I just clicked on 'Dawn of Justice' in a panic, thinking it was yet another Far Right Group,"" said @Scriblit. ""Dawn Of Justice sounds like Steven Seagal's comeback movie,"" quipped @DoctorFluxx. ""Dawn of Justice? So THAT'S why Batman looks so sad,"" said @ElliottcMorgan, referencing the recently released first look at Ben Affleck's Batman. (Who, yes, does look pretty down.) Another user thought ""it makes it sound like a direct-to-DVD movie you'd find in a bargain bin,"" as The Hollywood Reporter's Borys Kit tried to remind the displeased masses, ""it's always darkest before dawn (of justice)."" ""Does anyone out there like the title?"" Kit asked. ""Anyone?"" Well at least one person does -- if he could only figure out why the studio insisted on taking the ""s"" out of ""vs."" ""The 'Dawn of Justice' thing is cool but having it be Batman 'V' Superman is annoying my OCD,"" tweeted Chris Stuckmann. ""When I see the new title, I read it as 'Batman 5 Superman'. Help me!"" Others are more concerned that the movie's going to have some sort of secret, litigious spin. ""Oh my god. What if 'Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice' is A LAW MOVIE? And 'Batman v. Superman' is the lawsuit?"" asked @Hello_Tailor. If it is, the Warner Bros. press release Wednesday didn't give any indication of that. Along with the new title and new logo, the statement confirmed that Chris Terrio (""Argo"") is writing the script, which we already knew would be directed by ""Man of Steel"" helmer Zack Snyder. In addition to Affleck, Henry Cavill returns as Superman, and Gal Gadot is going to play Wonder Woman. Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams and Diane Lane are all reprising their ""Man of Steel"" roles, and they'll be joined by Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Jeremy Irons as Alfred and Holly Hunter in an unspecified, newly created role. Once ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" finishes filming -- production will also take place in Illinois, Africa and the South Pacific -- the movie will arrive in theaters on May 6, 2016.","The official title for the ""Man of Steel"" sequel has been announced .

"(CNN) -- For the first time in decades, voters in Georgia are going to the polls Tuesday without the chance of having Justice Department observers inside their polling places. CNN has learned that's because Justice Department lawyers in recent months have determined they no longer have legal authority to unilaterally assign poll observers after the Supreme Court ruling invalidating key sections of the Voting Rights Act. The department has suspended posting observers inside polling stations except for in nine jurisdictions in seven states covered by separate court orders, government officials tell CNN. The internal legal finding hadn't been made public before. Observers had the authority to be inside polling places, and the department may still send monitors who keep an eye outside polling precincts. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department's civil rights division declined to comment. The department has been sending election day poll observers and monitors to some Georgia counties since at least 1966, a year after the landmark civil rights law authorized it. The observers were there to document any interference or intimidation against voters, usually racial minorities in areas with a history of discrimination. At last count, the Justice Department said it sent personnel to observe and monitor elections in 153 counties and parishes in 11 states. Proponents of the poll watching say it helps prevent irregularities and has been useful to ensure federal voting rights are protected for minorities. The department didn't send anyone to monitor last month's Mississippi primary, which has been much disputed by losing tea party-aligned candidate Chris McDaniel. Incumbent victor Sen. Thad Cochran drew black Democratic Party voters to help defeat McDaniel in the GOP primary. McDaniel has alleged voting irregularities, but Mississippi judges have rebuffed his claims. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, under which the Justice Department compelled oversight of voting law changes in a patchwork of jurisdictions in states around the country. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has criticized the ruling and has urged Congress to pass new legislation to restore the Justice Department's oversight powers.","Justice Department lawyers say they have no legal authority to unilaterally assign poll observers .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson's ""live"" performance at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards brought a mixed reaction Sunday night. ""Uncomfortable, odd and eerily interesting,"" is how public relations agent Simone Smalls summed it up in a tweet. ""Not quite sure what to feel. #MissingMJ"" Uncomfortable because Jackson died nearly five years ago while preparing for a comeback tour. His remains are resting in a crypt in a Forest Lawn mausoleum. But technology tricked viewers -- and the celebrity audience in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas -- into suspending disbelief for a few minutes to watch the pop icon onstage dancing and singing his ""new"" song ""Slave to the Rhythm."" Ludacris, the rapper-actor who hosted the show, actually introduced it as ""Live from the MGM Grand, Michael Jackson."" ""He's baaaccck!"" Mark Cuban, the owner of an NBA team and TV channel, tweeted about Jackson's ""hologram."" Cuban added an Instagram video. The dance moves were not really Michael Jackson's but apparently those of a stand-in performer who recreated his steps for a computer that then laid on an image intended to replicate Jackson. But where was the swagger -- like Charlie Chaplin -- that characterized Jackson's cool walk? ""I wish it would have actually looked like him,"" one fan said. It was eerily interesting because the illusion was effective if you didn't watch too closely or weren't obsessively familiar with Jackson's dancing, walking and appearance. ""I enjoyed it. Could have had better face but overall it was great. Will have it on repeat,"" a diehard Jackson fan tweeted. #kendallyouhadonejob . Imagine Ed Sullivan confusing the Beatles with the Beach Boys when he introduced the British group's first live U.S. television performance 50 years ago. That's the modern equivalent of what Kendall Jenner did at the Billboard Awards. The reality TV personality, model and Kardashian half-sister caught herself halfway through introducing the Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer as One Direction. ""Now, we welcome One... Guys, I'm the worst reader!"" Jenner said as she dived below the camera shot. She quickly tossed to a video of the group -- which included a short clip comparing their arrival in the United States to the Beatles' 1964 invasion. Jenner never fully recovered. The television audience only heard her say ""of Summer"" when she resumed the intro after the video. Twitter had a blast with the 18-year-old's flub. Two hashtags soon trended: #kendallyouhadonejob and #KendalljennerItsFIVE . But many -- including Jenner herself -- agreed on one thing. Kendall Jenner looked great on the red carpet. Lorde's message . Lorde wants you to know she's no longer the young 15-year-old who recorded ""Royals,"" a song that spent much of last summer at the top of the charts and was honored Sunday as the ""top rock song."" ""What I wanted to say was that I am 17 and a half now,"" Lorde said as she accepted Billboard's top new artist award. When laughter erupted with that remark, she stopped to say ""that wasn't a joke."" Lorde's said she's had ""the opportunity to grow and learn as a new artist"" in the last year ""in the spotlight."" She later performed ""Tennis Court,"" another song from her younger years. The irony not lost on the Billboard audience is that many people are surprised to learn that the mature talking-acting-looking New Zealander is actually a teenager. #Lordeis17 became a trending topic on Twitter worldwide.

"(CNN) -- As the Olympic flame burned above Sochi on Tuesday evening, a scene of mayhem and death exploded a few hundred miles away in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, where blazes roared and violent clashes erupted along protesters' barricades. At least 100 people were killed just on Thursday and hundreds more hospitalized in confrontations pitting government forces against demonstrators opposed to a regime that has strong support from President Vladimir Putin's Russia. It was the deadliest day in the three months since the showdown started. Between the two spectacles, you can bet Putin's attention focused more sharply on the crisis in Ukraine, which is officially an independent country since 1991 but in reality remains a state over which Moscow exercises enormous influence, infuriating much of Ukraine's population. At the heart of the battle lies a fundamental question: Is Ukraine a free nation or is it a piece of Moscow -- a piece on Putin's chessboard? The more immediate question is how far the Moscow-backed regime will go to put down opposition protests. As it happens, both Sochi and Ukraine play a large role in Putin's strategy. To Putin, staging a successful Olympics is a way to consolidate power, to build up his image for domestic and international audiences, and to show a resurgent, self-assured and powerful Russia under his rule. What happens in Ukraine is part of the same larger objective, but it is far more important. Ukraine has experienced much bloodshed throughout its history, with foreign powers inflicting unspeakable devastation. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, it has struggled to get back on its feet, with little success. A decade ago, pro-Western demonstrators managed to depose a Moscow-allied president, Viktor Yanukovich, and replace him with a new leader who wanted closer ties to the West. That uprising, known as the Orange Revolution, was part of a wave of ""color revolutions"" along Russia's borders, and it inspired protests in Russia, which Putin swiftly put down. The most recent crisis burst on the scene in November when Yanukovich (once again in power after his 1995 defeat) decided not to sign a trade deal with the European Union, an agreement that would have increased links with the West and was fiercely opposed by Moscow. Russia wants the former Soviet republics to join a Moscow-centered customs union. The decision to turn away from Europe enraged the opposition, bringing hundreds of thousands of people to the streets of Kiev and other Ukrainian cities. Protesters were incensed by what they saw, quite correctly, as acquiescence to Russian bullying. In August, when Ukrainian officials were negotiating the EU's Eastern Partnership agreement, Moscow made it clear it would not tolerate a turn to the West. Russia, Ukraine's principal trading partner, suddenly imposed crippling sanctions against Ukrainian imports. Putin's top economic adviser explained it as ""preventive measures"" in case Ukraine decided to ""take the suicidal step"" of signing an agreement with the EU. Moscow has used similar bullying tactics with other former USSR members. Armenia had spent years working on a deal to join the EU Eastern Partnership. Then abruptly in September, while pressure was coming down on Ukraine, the Armenian president met with Putin in Moscow and announced the end of the talks with Europe, triggering protests in the Armenian capital. For Ukrainians, the EU deal symbolized a new future, the chance of economic and political modernization and rule of law. Europe required reforms as part of the deal. The Russian customs union cements the status quo. Putin offered Yanukovich $15 billion in loans to help the country through its economic crisis. He also persuaded him to take a much harder line against protesters. The Ukrainian president had repeatedly pledged not to use force against protesters. According to The New York Times, he changed his mind after meeting with Putin in Sochi. Ukrainians have long been divided between easterners, who favor close ties with Russia, and westerners, who feel more European. But persistent economic stagnation and the ability to travel abroad and compare conditions have brought new impetus to calls for reform. The Ukrainian economy is mired in deep corruption, with Russia-style oligarchs making enormous fortunes in shady deals -- such as those allegedly made ahead of the Sochi Olympics -- while the economy fails to offer better prospects. Transparency International ranks Ukraine as one of the world's most corrupt countries. Next door in Poland, for example, which is now part of the EU, per capita income has grown steadily, now topping $18,000, up about 50% in the last decade. Ukraine, meanwhile, has per capita gross domestic product of $6,300, even lower than it was five years ago. Perhaps nothing rankles Ukrainians more than Putin's attitude toward their country. In 2008, when then-President Viktor Yushchenko tried to join NATO, Putin warned the West to keep its hands off Ukraine, calling it ""Little Russia,"" a term dating back to the days when Imperial Russia's czars ruled parts of Ukraine. A Russian newspaper reported that Putin told then-U.S. President George W. Bush that ""Ukraine is not even a state."" What started as protests over a trade deal has moved far beyond. Demonstrators demand constitutional reform. Demonstrations aim at ending the authoritarianism of the Yanukovich regime, empowering parliament and laying the groundwork for political and economic progress. Unfortunately, the protests have attracted a segment of thuggish extreme right-wing groups. Estimates vary on their size and strength within the opposition. But their presence has given the regime and its Russian backers an excuse to label the protesters as fascists and neo-Nazis. In predictable fashion, Russia has also blamed the United States for the turmoil, accusing Washington of trying to impose the ""Western vector"" of development and of telling ""a sovereign state what they should do next."" The United States is, in fact, expressing support for the protesters, but it is proposing a power-sharing government until the next elections. If anything, Washington and the EU have failed to offer as much backing as they should. Their disagreements have been aired publicly in embarrassing leaked recordings -- although they are not verified. Their reluctance to challenge Putin's geopolitical claim to controlling Ukraine is a source of profound frustration for Ukrainians who say they are being sacrificed to appease Putin. Opposition leaders have met with Western officials to request more support. What is most striking about the protests has been their perseverance through the brutal Ukrainian winter. Three months into the crisis, with the intensity of the violence and the bloodshed increasing, Putin has reason to worry about how this will end. Just as he wants the Sochi Olympics to show what his Russia is capable of accomplishing, he knows the Russian people are keeping an eye on what exactly Ukrainian protesters can achieve. The raging flames of Kiev now matter more than the carefully tended fire in Sochi. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: New Russia on display in Sochi, but the old one is showing its face in Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- The second day of Royal Ascot delivered a shock in the day's feature race, the Prince of Wales Stakes. Some of those in the crowd at the Berkshire course had come to see the Queen, arriving, as she does every day of the Royal Meeting, by horse-drawn carriage from Windsor Castle. Others had come to see the horse regarded by many as the queen of the turf: reigning Prix de l'Arc Triomphe champion Treve. The French filly would be the first Arc winner to run at the Royal Meeting since 1989 winner Carroll House finished last in the following year's Hardwicke Stakes. Racing in the colors of Sheikh Joaan's Al Shaqab operation and ridden by Frankie Dettori, who got off to a flying start on the first day of the meeting, if she had looked carefully, Treve would have been greeted by a friendly face on her first trip outside France. Located in the grounds of Ascot racecourse, nestled among the champagne bars, is a statue of her sire Motivator, formally owned by the Queen herself. It was in the face of these omens and no small measure of hype that the racehorse of the year for 2013 (an honor she shared with Black Caviar) took her place in the high-class field of eight. The 8/13 hot favorite was aiming to become just the seventh filly to win this race. And indeed, a filly did add her name to the record books. It just wasn't Treve. Racing in the colors of music impresario Andrew Lloyd-Webber, it was The Fugue, whose career has been characterized by stunning highs as well as heart-breaking lows, who decided to re-write the script. The Fugue traveled brilliantly under regular jockey William Buick, streaking clear in the home straight to land the race in a course record time. In second was Magician under Joseph O'Brien, with Treve crossing the line in third. The top three were all inside the old course record. ""She's an absolute star,"" Buick told reporters after the race. ""She proved today what she can do against top class horses."" Her owner described it as the biggest win of his racing career. But there was concern in the Treve camp that the sparkle she showed when capturing the Arc by five lengths was mysteriously absent. ""She didn't feel like Treve,"" conceded Dettori. ""Her action on the way to the start was short and choppy and I knew in the back of my mind that I was in trouble."" Her trainer, Criquette Head-Maarek, concurred: ""Her action was not right. Maybe we'll find something wrong. Let's take her home to Chantilly tomorrow and see how she is -- and don't forget the winner today is a good filly, too."" The Queen herself enjoyed a day of mixed fortunes. In the opening race, her horse Musical Comedy could only finish 18th after taking a keen hold early on. The race was won by Mustajeeb for trainer Dermot Weld. In the Royal Hunt Cup, the day's major handicap, a fast finishing Sea Shanty managed a creditable 4th behind Field of Dream. Her filly Estimate -- heroine of last year's Royal Ascot -- will attempt to defend her Gold Cup title on Thursday.","William Buick rides The Fugue to victory in the Prince of Wales Stakes at Royal Ascot .

"(CNN) -- It is a football fairytale even Hollywood scriptwriters might view as stretching the bounds of credibility. But in a dilapidated stadium in the north east of Bulgaria, one club's European Champions League dream came true on Wednesday night. Ludogorets Razgrad, who had never before qualified for the group stages of the continent's most lucrative competition, took down 1986 winners Steaua Bucharest in scarcely believable fashion. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg in Romania, Ludogorets snatched a dramatic last minute equalizer to take the knockout tie into extra time. But then disaster struck. With a penalty shootout looming, its goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off for a second yellow card. Romanian-born defender Cosmin Moti then donned the gloves, and safely guided his side through to the shootout. Then the fireworks really began. Not only did Moti score Ludogorets' opening kick, he then saved two Steaua penalties to seal an incredible victory. ""This is incredible, a dream. Nobody could write such a story. I have no words to describe the feeling,"" Moti, who used to play for Steaua's rivals Dinamo Bucharest, told UEFA's official website. ""It was the first time in my career I have played as a keeper. Sometimes in training I pretend to be a goalie, but it is the first time I've done it with gloves on. I relied on my instincts -- there is no other way in such a situation. ""I was just taking last-second decisions on where to jump. Thank God, I saved two and we are there. This is it. This is the Champions League. Incredible."" Moti's heroics were made all the more remarkable given he performed them in front of legendary Steaua goalkeeper Helmut Ducadam, the club's honorary president. Ducadam made four successive saves in Steaua's 1986 penalty shootout with Barcelona in the European Cup final, delivering the trophy for his side. ""Ducadam is the probably the greatest Romanian goalkeeper,"" Moti said. ""I grew up with the stories about that final. He is a legend."" After the match, Ludogorets coach Georgi Dermendviev revealed Moti often has a go in goal during training. ""Sometimes during training sessions we practice penalties and he has a habit of going in goal for fun,"" he said. ""I asked him whether he wanted to take the gloves it and he agreed. ""I told him not to jump prematurely and wait. He has a good instinct and reaction. But after all this is incredible. He has never even trained with gloves."" Now it seems Ludogorets' regular goalkeeper Stoyanov faces a fight to regain his place as No. 1 at the club. ""Yes, it seems we have too many goalkeepers in the team,"" he joked. ""I was not afraid when I saw him putting on the gloves. There is no guarantee I would have done better. ""I have no words to describe this game. I had to make the foul, the Steaua player was too quick. But this is our dream, this is the result of sweat and hard work."" Ludogorets now takes its place in the draw on Thursday alongside European powerhouses Real Madrid -- the defending champions -- Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus.","Bulgarian club Ludogorets Razgrad qualify for Champions League group stages .

"(CNN) -- The locals of Hailey, Idaho, filled Sherry Horton's wine bar and uncorked champagne Saturday in celebration of hometown hero Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan after nearly five years in enemy captivity. ""It's very exciting,"" said Horton, a friend and former roommate of Bergdahl. ""We're all still kind of walking around on clouds. We're all just waiting to get eyes on him. That's going to be a topper."" Bergdahl's parents, Jani and Bob, have been crusading online and in Washington, D.C., for years to ensure their 28-year-old son was never forgotten and assert he was an America POW held by the Taliban, though the military categorized him as a missing soldier captured. Whatever the term, Bergdahl is no longer being held. ""His mother was crying when she answered the phone -- and just very excited,"" Horton told CNN. Bergdahl's parents appeared with President Barack Obama at the White House on Saturday evening to discuss the release. ""I just want to say thank you everyone who has supported Bowe. He's had a wonderful team everywhere. We will continue to stay strong for Bowe while he recovers,"" Jani Bergdahl told reporters at the Rose Garden. Bob Bergdahl extended thanks ""around the world"" and noted how the president called them about the news. He said his son is now having trouble speaking English. The father also spoke in one of the languages spoken in Afghanistan. ""The complicated nature of this recovery will really never be comprehended,"" said Bob Bergdahl, who has grown a long beard. ""We just can't communicate the words this morning when we heard from the President,"" he added. ""So we look forward to continue the recovery of our son, which is going to be a considerable task for our family and we hope that the media will understand that that will keep us very preoccupied in the coming days and weeks as he gets back home to the United States."" After the couple's brief remarks, they thanked Obama, and Jani Bergdahl and Obama exchanged a hug and a kiss. ""Wonderful. Good day,"" Obama told her. ""Yes, it's a good day,"" she told the president. Earlier in the day, the parents released a short statement. ""Today, we are ecstatic!"" the couple said. ""We were so joyful and relieved when President Obama called us today to give us the news that Bowe is finally coming home! We cannot wait to wrap our arms around our only son,"" the parents said. A website that has been crusading for Bergdahl's returned posted a note of success: ""He's free, he's safe. He will be home soon!"" The Rocky Mountain town of Hailey is just minutes from the renowned tourist destination of Sun Valley, famed for its skiing. Residents didn't have to worry Saturday about adorning Hailey with yellow ribbons because local scouts just put up fresh ones the past week, Horton said. The hometown crowd was laboring Saturday, however, to erect signs welcoming Bergdahl home, Horton said. ""Everybody is celebrating."" The end of Bergdahl's half decade of captivity resonated beyond the valley town. ""We join all of Idaho and America in expressing our joy and welcoming this wonderful news,"" Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter said in a statement. ""Today, Idaho gives thanks. Soon we all will celebrate Bowe's freedom and homecoming."" U.S. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the top Senate Democrat, described the moment as ""a great day for the United States"" and Bergdahl's safe return marks the ""nation's commitment to leave no service member behind."" ""I commend the diplomats, service members, and others who worked tirelessly to bring Sergeant Bergdahl home, and I commend President Obama for taking decisive action to achieve the agreement leading to his release when the opportunity arose,"" Reid said. Secretary of State John Kerry said the ""cost of years of captivity to Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl and his family is immeasurable."" Not everyone was thoroughly jubilant. U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he was pleased about Bergdahl's release but he was ""extremely troubled"" by how the United States negotiated with the Taliban to release Bergdahl in exchange for five detainees at Guantanamo Bay. ""This fundamental shift in US policy signals to terrorists around the world a greater incentive to take U.S. hostages,"" said Rogers, R-Michigan. ""Further, I have little confidence in the security assurances regarding the movement and activities of the now released Taliban leaders and I have even less confidence in this Administration's willingness to ensure they are enforced. I believe this decision will threaten the lives of American soldiers for years to come."" U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, termed the release ""fantastic,"" but indicated concerns remain about negotiating with the Taliban. ""There are still questions around the entire operation, knowing what it took to make this happen, but at least for today we can be happy that Bowe is back in U.S. hands,"" Hunter said. A senior administration official said Bergdahl's release wasn't a concession and was in line with Obama's goal of closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who's chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, supported Obama's decision, ""particularly in light of Sgt. Bergdahl's declining health,"" she said. ""It demonstrates that America leaves no soldier behind,"" she said. CNN's Erin McPike, Dana Bash, Barbara Starr, Ray Sanchez and Jason Morris contributed to this report.","NEW: Army Sgt.

"(CNN) -- Score one for Obamacare supporters in court on Tuesday. A three-judge appeals panel in Washington unanimously rejected a novel challenge to how the Affordable Care Act took shape in Congress. The court found lawmakers did not violate the Constitution when laying out the so-called individual mandate, which requires most Americans buy health insurance or pay a penalty. An Iowa small business owner and a conservative legal group said the measure was unlawful, arguing it was intended to raise revenue and improperly originated in the Senate. Under the Constitution's Origination Clause, revenue-raising legislation must begin in the House. Opinion: Gutting Obamacare is playing with lives . But the court concluded the challenge did not pass muster -- that the politically-charged law approved with only Democratic support in 2010 was not designed mainly to raise money for the government, but to ensure more Americans got health coverage. ""Today's decision is disappointing, because it relied on a new and unprecedented distinction to exempt the Obamacare tax from the Constitution's rules for enacting taxes,"" said Timothy Sandefur, principal attorney at the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation. ""We think that's wrong, and that's what we'll be taking to the Supreme Court if necessary,"" Sandefur said. The challenge was raised by Matt Sissel, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, artist, gallery owner and part time National Guard member. He opposes being forced to purchase health insurance under the government mandate. His lawyers argued Senate Democratic leaders pushed a ""shell game"" -- taking an unrelated bill that had passed in the GOP-controlled House, removing every word, and replacing it with key parts of the Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate. Study: Obamacare gave 10 million Americans health insurance . A divided Supreme Court, in a blockbuster decision, ruled in 2012 that the law's individual mandate was constitutional, labeling it a tax. Last week, the D.C. circuit dealt Obamacare supporters an appeals court setback when it limited subsidies and tax breaks available for millions of people who signed up for coverage through a federally-run insurance marketplace. A separate appeals panel in Richmond concluded the exact opposite on the same day -- saying the subsidies were lawful. That conflict likely will land that issue before the Supreme Court in coming months. Conversely, the Sissel challenge now faces a potentially uphill battle for Supreme Court consideration following the appeals decision. Appeals courts differ on Obamacare; Supreme Court case likely .

"(CNN) -- A razor blade sitting in a blood-splattered bathroom sink. A bacteria-infested toilet seat that wouldn't be welcome in a gas station. Open lesions and gray, jagged teeth peeking out from behind chapped lips. These are images that have become hard to ignore in some parts of the United States. But that's exactly what the creative team behind The Meth Project's public service announcements intended. Their graphic, hard-hitting campaign is meant to educate people about the dangers of using methamphetamine, an addictive drug that can severely alter a person's brain activity. The fuzzy bear who politely asked us not to start forest fires has been replaced by the bruised and battered teenager prostituting herself for a hit of meth. But Lenora Patterson says that shouldn't really be startling to anyone. ""The campaigns needed to change because the kids changed,"" said Patterson, an assistant principal at Riverwood International Charter School in Georgia, which is the most recent state to air The Meth Project ads. ""They need that shock value,"" she said. ""Kids these days are different from kids back then. They're exposed to things earlier and so the content has to be more raw. But it has the same effect of deterring students or children as it did back then."" Paid-media campaigns such as The Meth Project pay for air time, allowing the ads to be more graphic than donated media, said Peggy Conlon, the president and CEO of Ad Council. It produces PSAs that are created pro bono by volunteer advertising agencies. However, she said, some media outlets will turn down an ad if it's causing viewers to change the channel, despite losing money. ""You run the danger, with really graphic depictions, of turning people off,"" Conlon said. ""There needs to be a delicate balance."" The Meth Project ads portray young adults' transformations from first-time users to blown-out addicts, thriving on gore and shock-value. But they're trying to educate about the dangers of trying meth ""just this once,"" which is what Nitsa Zuppas said they set out to do. Zuppas is executive director of the Siebel Foundation, the organization that founded The Meth Project. She said the goal was to produce PSAs that mirrored the content their target audience -- teens and young adults -- is used to. ""They're used to consuming very loud and hard-hitting media,"" she said. ""Sadly (meth) happens to be a drug with really scary consequences. We wanted to show (those consequences)."" Despite the graphic nature of the PSAs, they have appeared in prime-time slots in the eight states with which The Meth Project works. Montana was the first state to air the ads in 2005. And though the commercials may not sit well with every viewer, they have certainly generated buzz, much like the gruesome PSA for texting and driving that aired in the United Kingdom in 2009, Conlon said. The ad features a car carrying teenage girls. The driver, who was attempting to send a text message from behind the wheel, crashes and the scene that follows is graphic. While graphic PSAs seem to strike a chord with viewers, Ad Council's Conlon said the subject matter and the target audience both dictate the tone the ad will take. For example, Ad Council's ""buzzed driving"" campaign infuses gore with humor to get through to teens and young adults. They did so by explaining that driving buzzed is just as dangerous as driving drunk. Then there's health care company GlaxoSmithKline's recent cervical cancer PSA that debuted during the Oscars in March. The ad pulls viewers in with the promise of a new perfume before flipping the switch. ""Maybe it's unfair to get your attention this way, but nothing's fair about cervical cancer,"" a voice-over says. Are viewers so desensitized that they need fake fragrances and graphic images to get their attention? MTV doesn't think so. The network uses humor in their newest campaign Get Yourself Tested, or GYT, meant to get teens and young adults talking about sexually transmitted disease prevention. ""STDs are heavily stigmatized,"" said Jason Rzepka, vice president of MTV's public affairs department. ""They're something people don't want to talk about ... We've seen from past efforts in sexual health that the humorous approach helps to break the barriers and make it something a little more acceptable."" In contrast to The Meth Project's approach, Rzepka said it was important to him that the PSAs not scare the audience, but empower them. ""The humorous approach acts as an ice breaker to make it easier to talk about the subject,"" he said, adding that humor is not always an appropriate medium to discuss difficult topics.","Paid-media campaigns are able to be more graphic than donated media .
""You run the danger, with (graphic PSAs), of turning people off,"" Conlon said .
Though every viewer won't agree with gory PSAs, the ads have generated buzz ."
"(CNN) -- Longtime NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson has been released by the Miami Dolphins after his arrest over the weekend. Johnson is accused of head-butting his newlywed wife, authorities said. The Dolphins announced Sunday on their website that they had terminated the contract of Johnson, who played a preseason game on Friday but had not participated in a regular season game with the team. No reason was given for his release. Johnson and Evelyn Lozada, a cast member on the VH1 reality TV show ""Basketball Wives,"" married on July 4 and their time together is set to be subject of an upcoming show on the same network. According to the arrest report from the Davie Police Department released Sunday, the football player's wife returned to the couple's home in that southern Florida city from grocery shopping shortly after 7 p.m. Saturday and noticed a receipt with a charge for a box of condoms. The couple then began talking about the sales receipt and their marriage, according to the arrest report. ""As they were talking, Johnson became upset and without (his wife's) permission, grabbed her and butted her on the forehead, causing a laceration,"" the police report said, giving the alleged victim's account. After trying to calm down a screaming Johnson, his wife said she ran ""to a neighbor's house to get away from"" him. A Davie police officer soon responded to the area and found Johnson's wife with an approximately 3-inch cut on the center of her forehead. Officer Christopher Epps then went to the couple's home, where he found the football player, the arrest report said. Johnson confirmed there had been an argument over the sales receipt, saying his wife had been yelling and that ""she then head butted Johnson"" to cause the cut to her forehead. Johnson did not have ""visible marks or bruises,"" the arrest report said. His wife indicated she wanted to press charges, signing an affidavit of complaint indicating as much, according to police. She was transported to Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, Florida, to be treated for her injuries. Johnson appeared Sunday before a county judge on a domestic violence charge and his bond was set at $2,500, the Davie Police Department said in a press release. He posted bond and was released from the Broward County Jail later in the day, his lawyer Adam Swickle said. The football player was known as Chad Ochocinco -- a Spanish take on his jersey number, 85 -- before his marriage last month. Ochocinco becomes Johnson again . The prolific tweeter, with four posts on Saturday alone though none about the incident, is known as much for his vibrant personality as his play on the field. He starred in VH1's ""The Ultimate Catch,"" a 2010 reality dating show in which he considered potential female mates in a tournament-style format. A new reality show about his and Lozada's courtship and marriage, ""Ev and Ocho,"" is set to premiere September 3 on the same network, according to its official website. Johnson spent his first 10 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, earning six Pro Bowl selections. The southern Florida native spent last season with the New England Patriots, then signed in the off-season with the Dolphins. Before the team announced Johnson's release, Miami head coach Joe Philbin said in a Sunday press conference that he planned to ""speak with Chad directly"" about the situation. ""I have not spoken with Chad Johnson yet, however, I do plan to meet with him in the relatively near future,"" said Philbin, who also joined the Dolphins in the off-season, according to video posted on the team's website. ""Today, I've been focused on the football team, the 89 other players that are here today."" CNN's Douglas Hyde and Maria P. White contributed to this report.","NEW: The Dolphins say they've terminated the contract of Chad Johnson .

"(CNN) -- ""Fields of Gold,"" yes. Oceans of money, no. Sting told the UK publication The Mail on Sunday that he won't be leaving his more than $300 million fortune to his six children. ""I told them there won't be much money left because we are spending it! We have a lot of commitments. What comes in we spend, and there isn't much left,"" he said. ""I certainly don't want to leave them trust funds that are albatrosses round their necks."" Not that they've needed the money. They all have a good work ethic, he added. ""They have this work ethic that makes them want to succeed on their own merit.

The former Police frontman, now 62, was born Gordon Sumner and grew up working-class in Wallsend, near Newcastle in northeast Britain. He told The Mail on Sunday that he couldn't wait to leave his hometown. ""It was a pretty violent wrench. I didn't feel I belonged there and the family was pretty dysfunctional in many ways. My parents were not happy together,"" he said. ""They loved their kids but it was a toxic environment. I needed to escape and I am glad I did.""

""The irony is that I'm going back to Wallsend, from where I had done everything in my power to escape,"" he said. The show, which is currently running in Chicago, is expected to premiere on Broadway in the fall. Sting said he doesn't feel guilty about his wealth -- ""I use my houses and love having them. I am grateful I have made money"" -- but he still tries to keep his feet on the ground. ""I demand a citizen's life -- I really do. Walking the street; going to a bar on my own,"" he said. ""I want to be able to pick up my bags from the (airport luggage) carousel and walk to the car. There are times when I don't want or need attention.""","Sting won't be leaving fortune to children .

"(CNN) -- Republicans raised the question in their convention of whether the country is better off than it was when President Barack Obama was elected, and it doesn't seem that Democrats have a convincing argument going into their convention this week. Both Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan had a variation on the theme in their acceptance speeches last week in Tampa, Florida. Romney: ""This president cannot tell us that you're better off today than when he took office."" Ryan: ""Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?"" One prominent Democrat said the answer to the question was ""no."" ""But that's not the question of this election,"" Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley said on CBS on Sunday. ""The question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits, the series of desert wars -- charged for the first time to credit cards, the national credit cards."" Republicans pounced on O'Malley's admission, with Ryan issuing a statement saying it was proof that Obama's policies aren't working. Two of Obama's senior advisers wouldn't give a yes or no answer when asked on Sunday. While Obama senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told Fox News, ""We're in a better position than we were four years ago,"" he didn't directly answer the question if voters thought they were better off. ""I think the average American recognizes that it took years to create the crisis that erupted in 2008 and peaked in January of 2009,"" Axelrod said. ""And it's going to take some time to work through it."" White House senior adviser David Plouffe had a similar answer on ABC, saying, ""I think everyone understands we were this close to a Great Depression. Because of the leadership of this president, we staved that off. We're beginning to recover."" Obama was riding toward the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on a speaking tour of Virginia, Iowa and Colorado college campuses hoping to energize young voters, a segment of the electorate critical to his hopes. Younger voters went overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008 and he still holds a lead in the age group in polls, but less decisively than four years ago. Even if they don't vote Romney, the Obama campaign's concern is that that segment and the others that helped elect him don't turn out at the rates they did four years ago. Senior campaign adviser Robert Gibbs told CNN's Candy Crowley on ""State of the Union"" that no one in Obama's campaign ""is sitting up here saying this is 2008."" But Gibbs didn't think there was a case of buyer's remorse going into Election Day. ""I don't think that there is voter disappointment,"" Gibbs said. ""The voters understand that we have been through a traumatic economic experience in the country, unlike anything that we have ever seen."" And Gibbs said the GOP wasn't offering an alternative, only rehashed ideas. ""In Tampa, we saw nothing but insults and old slogans and tired old ideas,"" Gibbs said. ""In Charlotte, the president is going to focus on a plan to provide the middle class in this country necessary and needed security by investing in research and innovation."" Obama's campaign has used that theme consistently since Republicans wrapped up their convention last week. The president told an audience in Iowa on Saturday that the GOP message was something that might as well have been viewed on a black and white television. ""It was a rerun. We'd seen it before,"" Obama said. Obama also challenged Romney over his qualifications to be the country's commander in chief, pointing out at that same rally in Iowa that Romney had failed to mention Afghanistan in his acceptance speech. ""Gov. Romney had nothing to say about Afghanistan last week,"" Obama said at a campaign rally in Iowa on Saturday. ""Didn't mention it. Didn't offer a plan in terms of how he might end the war or, if he's not going to end it, he's got to let people know."" Romney campaign senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said his candidate had addressed the war in an address to the American Legion the day before his acceptance speech. ""President Obama has allowed our leadership to diminish,"" Romney said in that speech. ""In dealings with other nations, he has given trust where it is not earned, insult where it is not deserved, and apology where it is not due."" The acceptance speech had a different purpose, Fehrnstrom said, to ""introduce himself to millions of voters who were seeing him for the first time."" ""We thought that speech was a home run,"" he added.","Obama advisers won't answer yes or no on whether voters are better off than in 2008 .

"(CNN)  -- At the middle of his first presidential term, Barack Obama faces major electoral challenges, some of which have come to involve questions of religious identity and power. A few have revived suspicion about Obama's religious identity, especially after he said he supported New York's decision to permit the construction of an Islamic cultural center near the site of ground zero. At the same time, some prominent black figures have accused Obama of ignoring African-American concerns and tens of millions of ""churched"" black voters. On the one hand, Obama faces religious xenophobia; on the other, he faces the mobilization of critical voices among a religious population that Democrats have long taken for granted. With fierce midterm election battles at hand and his prospects for a second term as president uncertain, we might expect Obama to revisit the strategy of a president who faced similar religious challenges more than 70 years ago: Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the lead-up to Roosevelt's own re-election in 1936, some religious sectors charged his New Deal and the repeal of Prohibition constituted an attack on traditional Christian values. Meanwhile, he could hardly take for granted the black vote. The Democratic Party was understood as the party of the openly violent Jim Crow South, where millions of African Americans remained disenfranchised. But by the middle of his first term, Roosevelt and the Democratic National Committee knew they would need to reach out to Northern black voters, who were growing in numbers yet had been only partly swayed by the limited availability of New Deal emergency relief. Criticism from black churches was on the rise, just as it seems to be now. In 1934, right at the midpoint of the first Roosevelt administration, the major black denominations formed the Fraternal Council of Negro Churches, specifically to push a social justice agenda and protest, if need be, at the national level. Black religious publications reported racial discrimination in Roosevelt's New Deal and were incredulous about his refusal to promote an anti-lynching bill. Roosevelt, in his electoral strategy, reached out extensively to African-American local and national religious leaders, including those of the Fraternal Council of Negro Churches, through the Good Neighbor League of the National Democratic Party. The league recruited sympathetic clergy to lead political discussion clubs in black congregations and planned major events in churches in 25 Northern cities. These events highlighted the New Deal's tangible benefits to black people, portrayed the New Deal and Roosevelt himself as rooted in ""social gospel"" values of equality and justice and elevated certain Fraternal Council leaders to positions of unprecedented visibility. Not only did black people shift decisively to the Democratic Party in the election of 1936, but the social gospel movement that Roosevelt championed gained enough prominence in black religion that it became a keystone of the civil rights movement. Meanwhile, the Fraternal Council of Negro Churches, which had always promoted a black social gospel, gained its political foothold during the Roosevelt years and provided the institutional template for national church-based protest groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Council. President George W. Bush's Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives may be understood as an adaptation of Roosevelt's black religious strategy, although Bush was not promoting the social gospel. From its inception, Bush's Faith Initiative elevated individualistic, moral reform strategies over strategies emphasizing public responsibility for poverty and structural solutions to inequality. As Bush stated at the Faith Office's inaugural event, ""We will help all in their work to change hearts ..."" Obama has rebranded and reformed Faith Office as an interfaith think tank, designed to generate new ideas and discover best practices, but it is uncertain how the new Faith Office will mediate electoral challenges. President Obama did, however, meet with 20 black church leaders in March 2010 to solicit opinions and prayers. Just a month earlier, the heads of seven major black denominations launched the Conference of National Black Churches, the lineage of which goes back to the Fraternal Council. While upholding the value of individual responsibility and transformation, this ecumenical body also advocates for social and economic justice and is concerned with the structural aspects of black poverty, crises in education, health and housing, staggering incarceration rates and more. The Conference of Black National Churches has already reached out to Obama and denounced religious xenophobia by supporting his remarks on the proposed Islamic center near ground zero. Obama, like Roosevelt, could turn to the nationally organized black churches to shore up electoral turnout while neutralizing fears about his own religious intentions.

"(CNN) -- Arriving in New York City at the age of 19 to study music, Hafez Nazeri knew he wanted to do big things. Now, little more than a decade later, the young Iranian classical composer is riding high with a chart-topping album featuring 38 Grammy Award-winning musicians. ""I left Iran with the hope of maybe one day creating music that can connect with the entire world, music that can show another dimension of my culture, and my history,"" Nazeri says. ""I came to New York with the hopes of integrating two cultures, and creating a new product that is no longer Eastern or Western."" It appears he is well on his way to accomplishing that goal. Nazeri's debut album, ""Untold: The Rumi Symphony Project,"" hit number one twice on Billboard's Classical chart-- a first for an Iranian musician. ""To be number one, this means the world is now listening,"" Nazeri says. ""It is an amazing honor for me, but I feel like it's not about me alone. The success is for Iran, not for me."" Growing up in Iran, Nazeri says he was fortunate enough to be part of a family with strong musical roots. ""I had the opportunity to grow up in a house which was sort of the center for all the great musicians, poets and philosophers, and musical instruments were my toys,"" he says. Nazeri's father Shahram Nazeri, who also performs on the album with his son, is one of Iran's most beloved and famous classical singers, and Nazeri says, one of his greatest teachers. ""My father, the tone of his voice, the style of his singing is unique. He broke a lot of Persian classical singing rules and he created his own style by incorporating Rumi's poetry in Persian classical music for the first time 40 years ago."" Rumi, is Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi, the 13th century Sufi mystic, poet and philosopher, whose works have been translated into many of the world's languages and whose influence has transcended ethnic and geographical boundaries. Much of Rumi's poetry focuses on love -- more specifically love for the Divine. And for Nazeri, like his father before him, that love finds a perfect home in musical expression. ""I think music is the sound of God, the sound of the universe for me. Music also has the power to go inside the heart. If you really hear music,"" says Nazeri. ""No matter what it is, if it touches you, you will love it, no matter what background you are from, or what religion you practice."" ""One of my ultimate goals,"" he says, "" is to make sure that one day Rumi is as popular as Shakespeare."" And his album is merely the beginning, Nazeri says. Following in his father's footsteps, he brings not only the essence of Persian culture -- but also Rumi's message to an even wider audience than ever before. ""I want to create a revolution with music,"" the young musician says, ""with love rather than hate, or chaos and bloodshed."" ""There is another more powerful force in this universe,"" he continues, ""and that force is love, and it's music. And I would love for that message to be the sound of us in this modern time.""","Iranian musician Hafez Nazeri creates music that crosses cultures .

"(CNN) -- When the sky falls, you'd think people would run for cover. Not tonight. If the clouds cooperate, skies all over North America will light up between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. ET Saturday in a rare sight that's excited everyone from space geeks to insomniacs to regular folks. ""I AM SO PUMPED FOR THE METEOR SHOWER TONIGHT OMG,"" tweeted one woman. Actually, these meteors aren't necessarily falling on the Earth. Rather, it's the Earth that's moving through the debris of Comet 209/P Linear. Whatever the reason, experts say this one-night-only phenomenon known as the May Camelopardalids could produce a huge light show -- or be a dud. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory noted that some forecasters are predicting about 100 meteors per hour, while others have much higher expectations, predicting more than 1,000 meteors per hour. It's not like there's a lot of history to say which way things will go. ""We have no idea what the comet was doing in the 1800s,"" said Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. ""The parent comet doesn't appear to be very active now, so there could be a great show or there could be little activity."" Awe-inspiring photos: 'Blood moon' mesmerizes sky gazers . Still, the mere prospect of a big light show is enough to get people up in the middle of the night -- if they go to sleep at all -- to take it all in. CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris noted that this is the first time in a generation that Earthlings can see a new meteor shower. This cosmic event has been years in the making: NASA announced in 2012 that Earth would encounter debris from this comet -- which also rotates around the sun -- crossing our orbit this weekend. The meteors should radiate from a point in Camelopardalis, a faint constellation near the North Star that's also known as ""the giraffe,"" Cooke said. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory recommends that those who want to see the show find a spot away from city lights, give themselves time to adjust to looking at the night sky and use their own eyes (no binoculars necessary) to enjoy the view. The best place to watch the shower will be east of the Mississippi River or in California. The worst may be parts of the Plains and Northeast, where rain and cloud cover is possible. If you're in Europe, Africa, Asia or South America, don't even bother to look. Several people tweeted about what they'll be wishing on, while others wished for someone with whom they could enjoy the occasion. ""Meteor shower tonight!!!!!"" read one post. ""Everyone turn off lights, go outside, put down blankets, cuddle up and enjoy!!!! But not everyone is comfortable with the spectacle, it seems. ""Everyone wants me to watch the meteor shower,"" tweeted one woman, ""but I think he deserves his privacy."" Astronaut tells kid, 'You'd love it up here' CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.","May Camelopardalids could light up skies over North America early Saturday .

"(CNN) -- If it looks like lots of Facebook pages are shedding fans, it's because they are. But, then again, they aren't. Facebook has begun a purge of fake accounts and ""Likes"" as part of a set of site improvements announced last month. The result has been lower numbers on fan pages, including some of the site's most popular ones, but no actual loss of real followers. On August 31, Facebook announced plans for improvements to its ""site integrity systems."" That, according to a blog post, included increased automated efforts to sniff out and delete fake accounts or Likes that had been illicitly sold or gained by otherwise shady means. ""A Like that doesn't come from someone truly interested in connecting with a Page benefits no one ...,"" the post read. ""When a Page and fan connect on Facebook, we want to ensure that connection involves a real person interested in hearing from a specific Page and engaging with that brand's content."" On Thursday morning, Zynga's Texas HoldEm Poker page had lost almost 200,000 Likes since Tuesday, according to Facebook analytics site PageData. Pop star Lady Gaga lost about 66,000 during that same two-day span, and ""The Simpsons"" dropped about 21,000. Facebook confirmed to CNN that the slipping Likes numbers are part of the site upgrade. The company said pages that have been abiding by its rules should expect no more than a 1% dip in Likes. Even Zynga's big drop represented only roughly .3% of the more than 65 million people who like that poker page. Facebook's purge targets inauthentic Likes created a number of ways. Some are caused by malware. Others happen when a user is deceived into ""liking"" something they may have not intended to like. In its post, Facebook said it has never allowed Likes to be sold, but that it has caught third-party vendors trying to use malware and other forms of deception to do just that. Similar problems have plagued Twitter, where automated systems have tried to inflate users' follower counts. ""While we have always had dedicated protections against each of these threats on Facebook, these improved systems have been specifically configured to identify and take action against suspicious Likes,"" Facebook said.","Facebook pages losing ""Likes"" as site cracks down on fakes .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool striker Luis Suarez ""needs education"" after continuing to protest his innocence despite being punished for racial abuse, according to a former English player. Suarez was banned for eight games and fined $63,000 on Tuesday, pending an appeal, for comments made to Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a match in October. His club issued a lengthy statement on his behalf after the ruling, as did his teammates before Wednesday's match against Wigan, and his lawyer held a press conference in Uruguay. Manager Kenny Dalglish backed the 24-year-old on Twitter, and also wore a t-shirt depicting the Uruguay international as he continued the defense in his pre-game interview. ""Clubs will defend their players, they are their assets -- they will defend their players to the hilt,"" said Paul Mortimer, a former England under-21 international who played for Charlton and Aston Villa but now works with the Show Racism The Red Card campaign. Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it . ""The most important thing now, after the punishment, is education. He has highlighted when talking about the cultural differences that he needs some education, he needs to be able to understand that when you come to another country you have to respect the laws and the rules. ""When I go abroad and my children come with me, you educate them on what is the norm in that environment. It's folly to say that he didn't know that -- he's an international footballer, he played at the World Cup in South Africa. You can't tell me that he didn't understand what was required in this country."" Suarez reportedly called Senegal-born France international Evra ""negrito"" -- a Spanish term meaning ""black"" which can be endearing when used with friends, but otherwise is considered offensive. British journalist Matthew Syed said Suarez, who played for Dutch club Ajax from 2007 to the start of this year, had no excuse for pleading ignorance about the potential offense such a word could have in the UK. ""I find this defense breathtakingly implausible from Suarez. He's lived in Europe for four years -- the idea that he didn't know that this particular terminology would be deeply offensive to someone like Patrice Evra is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion,"" Syed told CNN. ""I don't think it's an adequate defense anywhere in a multicultural society, in a cosmopolitan environment like football, to say that 'This sort of racist terminology is okay where I come from, so you have to put up with it.' ""You have to obey the law and conventions of the place you are living in."" England soccer captain Terry charged with racism . FIFA president Sepp Blatter caused anger when he told CNN last month that there is no problem with on-pitch racism in football, but Mortimer insists that is not the case. ""I think there is an issue, this proves there is an issue,"" the 43-year-old told CNN. ""There are more players that have suffered from racist abuse but never really spoken out about it. ""I myself suffered from it when I was playing. But you find it's difficult to speak out about it, because the highlight is then put on the victim. ""One question I was always asked was, 'Are you really sure?' Am I really sure that someone is racially abusing me? I think I am. What is black and white becomes gray, because you get questioned. ""Throughout this situation the most important thing is, 'What was said? Was it said?' If it was then it is something we have to deal with -- investigate, and punish if punishment is necessary."" Liverpool's Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks . Syed, a former table tennis international who now writes for The Times, said racism in English football is not as much of a problem as it once was. ""In the 1970s and '80s, football was a place where far-right political groups would stalk the terraces for people to sign up for their hateful ideology,"" he said. ""Black players were booed, monkey chants were issued towards them, banana skins were thrown on the pitch. It's a lot better now than it was then, no question about that. ""I'm rather encouraged by the fact that a lot of top players have come out and instead of condoning and being apologetic for what (Chelsea captain) John Terry and Suarez are alleged to have said, they've come out with quite a zero-tolerance approach."" England skipper Terry is facing criminal charges over alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, with a possible maximum fine of Â£2,500. He could face further action from the English Football Association depending on the outcome of his February 1 court case. Suarez's punishment, the first of its kind in England, paled in comparison to several previous high-profile FA disciplinary rulings. Former England captain Rio Ferdinand was banned eight months in 2004 for missing a drugs test, Eric Cantona was sidelined for the same period in 1995 for karate kicking a fan, and in 1998 Paolo Di Canio was suspended 11 matches for pushing a referee. ""There's not much of a precedent, it's a bit like plucking a number out of the air,"" Syed said. ""But even if this isn't as severe as those cases, it is nevertheless a significant deterrent. Liverpool are going to miss Suarez, no doubt about that. ""It's also a partisan case. It's not just the clubs that are divided on this moral issue -- Chelsea backing Terry, and Liverpool with Suarez-- it's also the fans of both clubs. There is an issue for football, the partisanship trumps the bigger moral questions that are the most important ones.""","Liverpool officials and players rally around Luis Suarez after his punishment for racist abuse .

"(CNN) -- Former Dutch football star Edgar Davids has called on authorities to take a stronger stance against racism. Davids, who has been embroiled in a racism row with his country's soccer icon Johan Cruyff, told CNN that the problem is not being addressed despite all the recent publicity surrounding controversial remarks made by FIFA president Sepp Blatter. World football's leader was forced to backtrack after saying in an interview with CNN that there was no racism on the pitch and that any problems could be resolved with a handshake after the match. The Suriname-born Davids, who won 74 caps for the Netherlands, is unhappy with remarks the 64-year-old Cruyff made to him during a supervisory board meeting at Dutch club Ajax. Blatter: Racism row is closed . ""There's a line, and if you have a racist comment somebody has to act upon it. The person who did it has to be punished and later be educated off the pitch,"" the 38-year-old said on World Sport on Thursday. ""What Blatter said was inexcusable, but he apologized. Something like that also happened in Holland when Johan Cruyff made a racist comment. He did it but he didn't apologize. ""The Dutch press let it slide a little bit, and that is what you have to condemn. When someone makes a racist remark that doesn't make him a racist, but you have to say, 'This the line, you've crossed it and you have to apologize' -- not only to the person who has been hurt but also the people who live with that racial abuse almost all their lives. I think that's unacceptable if you don't."" How should football tackle racism? Football's authorities have yet to dish out major penalties for racist offenses, with Bulgaria's Football Association escaping with a â‚¬40,000 ($53,000) fine after the country's fans racially abused England players in September. And Blatter's comments have not had the impact worldwide they had in Britain, where the media quickly jumped onto the 75-year-old's remarks. ""You have to condemn those things, you have to act hard and really address the problem. I think that's lacking a bit,"" said 1995 Champions League winner Davids, who played for AC Milan, Inter Milan, Barcelona, Ajax and Tottenham during his illustrious career.","Edgar Davids says the problem of racism in football is not being addressed .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Council voted on Wednesday night to approve an anti-tobacco law that will raise the tobacco-purchasing age from 18 to 21. In addition to the ""Tobacco 21"" bill, which includes electronic cigarettes, the council also approved a second bill, ""Sensible Tobacco Enforcement."" It will prohibit discounts on tobacco products and increase enforcement on vendors who attempt to evade taxes. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has 30 days to sign the bills into law. Given his previous support, that is likely to happen soon. ""By increasing the smoking age to 21, we will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking,"" Bloomberg said in a statement on Wednesday. Have you quit smoking? Share your story . ""Tobacco 21"" will take effect 180 days after it is enacted, according to the council's news release. New York City has now become the largest city to have an age limit as high as 21. Needham, Massachusetts, raised the sale age to 21 in 2005, according to the New York City Department of Health. Neighboring states and counties have raised the tobacco sale age to 19, including New Jersey in 2005, the Department of Health said. Raising the sales age ""will protect teens and may prevent many people from ever starting to smoke,"" Health Commissioner Thomas A. Farley, said in a statement after the vote. While many lawmakers appeared to be applauding the bills, some younger New Yorkers were not so pleased. ""You're an adult; you should be able to buy a pack of cigarettes,"" one New Yorker told CNN affiliate NY1. ""I mean, you can think for yourself."" ""I think it's ridiculous,"" another New Yorker said, ""Let us be, let us live."" This is another step in Bloomberg's mission for healthier NYC lifestyles. In September 2012, the Board of Health voted to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, a measure Bloomberg spearheaded. The ban was later repealed by a New York State Supreme Court judge.","Mayor Michael Bloomberg is expected to sign two measures restricting tobacco .

"(CNN) -- Mobile users who have gotten used to chatting with their friends via Facebook will soon have to make sure they've downloaded the social-media giant's app designed specifically for that. Facebook has begun notifying mobile users that they'll no longer be able to text via its core app. Instead, they'll need to download Messenger, the dedicated texting app Facebook rolled out in 2011. The company started notifying some users last week. The update will roll out first to Android and iOS users in a handful of European countries, according to a Facebook spokeswoman. ""Messenger is a much faster and better experience and we've found that people get replies 20% faster on Messenger than on Facebook,"" the spokeswoman said in an e-mail. ""Taking messages out of the Facebook app also lets us focus on making Messenger even better for everyone rather than working on two separate Facebook messaging experiences."" In November, after Facebook launched Messenger 3.0, the company discontinued messaging in the core Facebook app for people who already had Messenger. The good news for people still using just the Facebook app is that they'll be able to message friends in much the same way they do now. Once both apps are installed, tapping the ""message"" icon on the Facebook app will simply send the user to Messenger. They'll be able to return via a ""return to Facebook"" icon. Facebook and mobile messaging have been linked in many folks' minds since last month, when the company shelled out a staggering $19 billion for WhatsApp, a texting app far more popular overseas than it is in the United States. Despite speculation, Facebook said at the time that it has no plans to merge WhatsApp, which lets users send unlimited messages for no more than 99 cents a year, with Messenger. Both are part of a maturing set of apps that are marginalizing cellular plans that charge for texting. Unlimited texting is already standard with many mobile plans in the U.S., but not so much in places like India, Africa and South America, where WhatsApp is most popular.","Messenger, Facebook's texting app, will soon be required for sending messages .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea on Monday proposed that ""all hostile military activities"" with South Korea ""come to a complete halt"" this week, but it attached a number of conditions that Seoul is likely to reject. The North's highest military body, the National Defense Commission, issued a statement calling for South Korea to halt intrusions at sea and firing drills near islands close to the two countries' disputed maritime border. The commission also said it wanted South Korea to stop ""attracting"" U.S. military hardware, including strategic bombers and a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, into the region. And it asked that South Korea cancel its planned joint military drills with the United States in August. Seoul and Washington have dismissed previous demands from North Korea for joint U.S.-South Korean drills to be called off. North Korea said that ending the hostilities, starting Friday, would help improve the atmosphere between the two sides ahead of ""exchanges and contacts that are scheduled to actively happen between North and South."" The South Korean Defense Ministry declined to comment on the North Korean statement Monday. Tensions have flared periodically between the two Koreas in recent months, notably along their maritime boundary, known as the Northern Limit Line. In late March, the two sides both fired hundreds of shells across their western sea border. Last month, the South Korean Navy fired warning shots after three North Korean patrol boats crossed the line. And a few days later, North Korea fired at least two shells near a South Korean patrol boat in the Yellow Sea. North Korea has also carried out a series of missile and rocket launches into the sea, drawing criticism from South Korea, the United States and the United Nations. North and South Korea remain technically at war after the Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, in 1953. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul; Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong .","NEW: The South Korean Defense Ministry declines to comment on the proposal .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg plans to undergo a ""precautionary"" course of chemotherapy following her surgery last month for pancreatic cancer, the Supreme Court announced Tuesday. President Obama greets Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on her arrival for his February 24 address to Congress. The treatments will begin later this month at the National Institutes of Health outside Washington, the court said. In a statement, the justice said the treatment is ""not expected to affect my schedule at the court. Thereafter, it is anticipated that I will require only routine examinations to assure my continuing health."" Ginsburg, who turned 76 on Sunday, has consistently signaled her health outlook is positive. She termed the February 5 removal of her cancer ""successful,"" and was back on the bench 18 days later when the high court resumed oral arguments. Ginsburg's post-op recovery has gone well, and doctors and the family are cautiously optimistic, court sources said. The disease was caught early and had not spread beyond her pancreas, doctors have said. ""Cancer patients with no evidence of disease after surgery but who have a statistical chance that there is microscopic spread often get chemotherapy to kill off that disease,"" explained Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Getting back into her regular routine was important to the justice, and it would help her cope with future medical treatment, sources close to her said. She successfully fought colorectal cancer a decade ago. Almost 35,000 Americans are estimated to have died from pancreatic cancer in 2008, making it the fourth leading cause of cancer death overall, according to the American Cancer Society. For all ages combined, the one-year survival rate is 24 percent; the five-year survival rate is 5 percent. The low survival rate is a result of the disease commonly going undetected until it has reached an advanced stage. Ginsburg -- the only woman on the Supreme Court -- entered a New York hospital after a CT scan in January ""revealed a small tumor, approximately one centimeter across, in the center of the pancreas,"" a previous news release said. She has kept a busy schedule, on and off the bench. Since her diagnosis, she has released three opinions, attended President Obama's February 24 address to Congress, gone to an opera production in the company of Justice David Souter, and traveled for several speeches. She told an audience last week in Boston, Massachusetts, that she had no plans to retire, but on the subject of court retirements she hinted cryptically, ""We haven't had any of those for some time, but surely we will soon."" Ginsburg, Souter and Justice John Paul Stevens frequently have been mentioned as likely to step down in the next few years. Ginsburg also said her former colleague, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- herself a cancer survivor -- had offered her some good advice. ""She said when you're up to chemotherapy, you do it on Friday, Friday afternoon. You'll get over it over the weekend, and you'll be able to come to the court on Monday,"" said Ginsburg, who noted O'Connor returned to work nine days after her breast cancer diagnosis. ""So I've been following her advice meticulously."" Ginsburg has been on the Supreme Court since 1993.","Supreme Court justice, 76, will receive chemotherapy treatments .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City have lodged an official complaint with European football's governing body after striker Mario Balotelli claimed he was racially abused during Thursday's match away to Porto. City came from behind to win the first-leg Europa League tie 2-1 in Portugal, but the English Premier League leaders approached UEFA after the match when Italy international Balotelli complained of being subjected to racist chants from fans. UEFA confirmed to CNN Friday that City's complaint had been received, but said a decision on whether to launch an investigation would not be made until the match delegate's report had been received. Despite reports that Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure, playing his first match since Sunday's African Cup of Nations final loss to Zambia, was also subject to abuse, a City spokesman said the club only knew of Balotelli's complaint. Did Liverpool's U.S. owners act too late? ""I didn't hear this because I was concentrating on the game. I don't know if (it happened) to Mario and Yaya,"" City manager Roberto Mancini was reported to have said by the Press Association. Mancini, who also coached Balotelli when they were both at Inter Milan, praised the 21-year-old for maintaining his focus during the game. Balotelli has had a checkered disciplinary record since arriving in England in 2010 and has just returned from a four-match ban for stamping on Tottenham Hotspur's Scott Parker during a league match in January. ""I think Mario did very well, he played very well,"" Mancini said. ""He was calm and it is important he continues like this. ""I think this provocation can happen every game. For this reason I spoke with Mario before the game. I said, 'Mario think and play, think what you should do during the game.'"" Manchester clubs enjoy wins in Europa League . Balotelli, an Italian of Ghanaian descent, has been on the receiving end of racist taunts in the past when representing his country. He was repeatedly jeered when he made his second appearance for his Italy in a friendly match against Romania in November 2010. Toure said after the Porto match that one of the reasons why he enjoys playing in England is the lack of racial abuse from fans. ""That's why we all like the Premier League, because it never happens there,"" Toure told Sky Sports. ""Maybe in foreign countries they don't expect black players. ""I think in future it will be okay, they will change their minds and the game will become more open. Football is football and the fans come to enjoy the game, and we don't want things like this to happen."" Despite Toure's claims, the English game has been hit by several recent race-related incidents. A police investigation was launched last month when a Liverpool fan was alleged to have racially abused third division Oldham's Tom Adeyemi during an FA Cup tie. Liverpool striker Luis Suarez has also recently returned from an eight-match ban for directing a racial slur at Manchester United's Patrice Evra. In July, England captain John Terry will face trial for alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Manchester City's Micah Richards and Newcastle's Sammy Ameobi have received racist abuse on microblogging website Twitter, as have former Everton striker Louis Saha and Scotland-based players Maurice Edu and Kyle Bartley, both of Rangers, and Inverness' Gregory Tade.","Manchester City report alleged racial abuse from Porto fans to UEFA .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- July 1, 2014, the 17th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, is set to be a hot, possibly stormy day. But the suffocating weather won't stop pro-democracy Hong Kongers -- possibly hundreds of thousands of them -- from filling the streets, beginning at 3 p.m today. Activists are openly challenging China's vision for the city's political future, and they believe the public is on their side. In a recent unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activist group Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), 787,767 Hong Kongers voted in support of free elections for the city's next leader. READ MORE: Hong Kong's 'referendum' -- What you should know . The almost-800,000 figure represents about 22% of registered voters in Hong Kong, out of a total of 3.5 million registered voters, according to government figures. Before the vote began ten days ago, organizers were hoping around 100,000 people would participate. Benny Tai, a co-organiser of OCLP, said Hong Kongers were ""using this opportunity to at least show Beijing how determined we are for universal suffrage."" Hong Kong's former second-highest-ranked official, Anson Chan, echoed the sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday. ""Whatever Beijing says in public now I think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 people."" But the Chinese government's reaction was decidedly more frosty, with the government declaring the poll ""illegal"" and its results ""invalid"" even before the ballots were counted. Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong's Secretary for Justice, has previously said there is no legal basis for the vote. Yuen, as well a number of other, pro-establishment voices, declined to speak to CNN. A recent Chinese state media editorial said the poll was a ""farce."" Searches for the referendum have also been heavily censored on the Chinese internet. Showdown over democracy . The city's pro-democracy camp wants fully democratic elections for the city's next leader, while China insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees. Specifically, Beijing says it will only allow candidates who ""love China."" The Occupy Central referendum outlined three plans to reform the upcoming election. All three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly, regardless of whether the candidates have Beijing's blessing. 42% of participants picked a proposal by the Alliance for True Democracy, which said candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive should be nominated by the public, and conditions such as requiring candidates to ""love China"" should not be allowed. Another question asked if Hong Kong's legislature should veto any nomination process that did not meet ""international standards."" This was overwhelmingly approved in the referendum. The high numbers are a sign that Hong Kongers are not about to back down, said Tai. ""We have an offer and we have a baseline, and this is the thing we will give to the (Hong Kong government),"" he told CNN. ""I think a responsible government must respond to that. I cannot see any reason for refusing to meet with us."" But if negotiations fail, and no progress is made through legal means, then the group is prepared to disrupt the city to make their statement heard. As a final strategy, Tai says his group may marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown Hong Kong as a way to pressure Beijing into allowing Hong Kong to exercise ""genuine universal suffrage."" ""We will only resort to the civil disobedience action as our last resort,"" said Tai. ""Only after exhausting all the legal means and still fail to achieve our goals will we resort to civil disobedience."" Grassroots support . The city is politicized like at no other time in its recent past. While the July 1st anniversary of the handover has always brought demonstrators out onto Hong Kong's hot, crowded streets, often numbering over 100,000, this year protests are expected to be super-sized. Many Hong Kongers are enraged after the recent publication of a white paper by the Chinese government which declares Beijing's ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over Hong Kong. READ MORE: Alarm in Hong Kong at Chinese white paper affirming Beijing control . Chan said the white paper violates the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in Hong Kong's constitutional Basic Law, which lets the city maintain high autonomy despite being a part of China. The white paper ""makes it quite clear that whatever autonomy we enjoy is for the central government to give and to take away at its pleasure,"" she said. ""I think this has caused real concern."" The inflammatory document came days after 100,000 people showed up to an annual candlelit vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. ""(The white paper) has spectacularly backfired, it's made people even more angry,"" Chan said. What's next? The situation in Hong Kong is volatile. Some activists fear a crackdown on freedoms by the Chinese central government, and others look nervously to the possibility of unrest at tomorrow's mass protest. Michael DeGolyer, Director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, an independent organization that monitors governance in the territory, said the future is incredibly difficult to assess because no one is totally sure what China's officials are thinking. ""We're in a situation where we have a new regime in power and much more volatile circumstances, and we have groups that are much more separatist, challenging the legitimacy of the central government altogether,"" he said. ""In these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to tell what the central government intends and what they're thinking and how they'll react."" But despite the uncertainty, Hong Kong's democracy supporters remain hopeful. ""I do not think Beijing has made up its mind on universal suffrage, so let's see what happens in the months ahead,"" said Chan. ""The government stance has a little bit softened in the last few days. There's a chance there,"" said Tai. ""After (the July 1 protest), we may be able to see whether there's any change in the stance of the Chinese government.""","Unofficial referendum on Hong Kong's political future draws almost 800,000 votes .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, killing an American. In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene. In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said. A U.S. State Department officer was killed in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement late Tuesday. ""We are heartbroken by this terrible loss,"" Clinton said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack."" Clinton said that she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities ""in the strongest terms"" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was ""working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide."" Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack, saying it ""led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals."" Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating. It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night. ""One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?"" she asked. In Egypt, police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" an emblem often used by Islamic radicals. A volley of warning shots were fired, as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots. Are you there? Share your images and videos. Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie. In a series of disjointed scenes, the film depicts Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer. The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him. Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised $5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported. Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive. ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,"" Clinton said. ""The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation."" But she stressed that ""there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind."" Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which ""may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior."" ""It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another,"" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. ""Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon."" Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans. An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in. ""This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,"" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. ""But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control."" The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy. ""There are police forces at the demonstrations,"" El Naggary said. ""They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave."" Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel. Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri -- added, ""We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement."" ""We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans,"" he said. ""I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?"" He added that ""the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable."" The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday. It also said in a statement that it ""condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions."" ""Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy,"" the statement said. ""We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others."" The embassy statement set off a political spat back in the United States after the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the White House. ""It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,"" Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday. He said he was ""outraged"" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt. The Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's comments. ""We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack,"" Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman said in an email. Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011. Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes. ""These protests are a bad image for Egypt,"" said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. ""Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems."" ""All I want for Egypt is security and stability,"" he said. ""And as you can see this isn't it."" The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead. Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker to portray Islam as a violent religion. Geert Wilders' film ""Fitna,"" which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

"WASHINGTON -- You can blame it on out-of-towners. In January, passengers of US Airways Flight 1549 had to be rescued out of the Hudson River after a bird strike. Smithsonian Institution scientists say it was migratory Canada geese -- and not resident Canada geese -- that caused US Airways Flight 1549 to ditch in New York's Hudson River on January 15. More specifically, it was at least two female and one male geese flying at approximately 2,900 feet that got sucked into the two engines of the Airbus A320, disabling both engines and causing one of the more spectacular water landings in aviation history. All 155 people safely evacuated the jet. Officials knew almost from the start that Canada geese were responsible for the incident, both because of Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's radio report and because few other types of birds flock at that altitude in the mid-Atlantic. But on Monday, the eve of a three-day National Transportation Safety Board hearing into the crash, the Smithsonian announced that sophisticated scientific techniques allowed them to conclude that the Flight 1549 birds were Canada geese from Labrador, Canada, and were significantly different from geese in New York City. Museum scientists said molecular study of feathers found in the engines leads them to believe the birds had probably nested in Labrador in the summer of 2008 and migrated to the New York region for the winter. On the day of the crash, Smithsonian wildlife biologist Peter Marra said, the ground was covered with snow, and the flock was probably on a short flight south looking for clear ground or water on which to forage for food. Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are ""essentially flying cows,"" Marra said, given their unrelenting quest for food. The migratory birds are among the largest species of bird in North America, with an estimated weight of about 8 pounds each. The determination that the birds were the 8-pound variety and not the 4-pound Brant geese is likely to comfort jet engine designers, since the engines are designed to survive strikes from 4-pound birds. But the finding also is likely to raise questions about whether engine requirements should be more robust to survive strikes from 8-pound birds. Bird strikes remain one of the most intractable problems facing aviation. There were more than 7,400 bird strikes in the United States in 2007, including 110 that caused substantial damage to aircraft. But the Federal Aviation Administration estimates that only 20 percent of strikes are reported. Airports attempt to manage local populations of birds by harassing them, typically by creating loud noises that scare the birds away, or by killing birds. But migratory birds require other approaches, such as monitoring their movements and improved radar. Smithsonian scientists say it is important to study bird migration patterns to prevent future collisions. Carla Dove of the Smithsonian's Feather Identification Lab says the Smithsonian has been conducting bird strike identifications for the FAA and the military for more than 50 years. Shortly after the US Airways Flight 1549 incident, the museum got its first feather from a U.S. Department of Agriculture biologist working with the NTSB. In all, the museum got several batches of remains, some from an engine that remained under water three days, and the rest from an engine on the Hudson River bottom for nine days. At the Smithsonian's Conservation Institute labs in Suitland, Maryland, scientists examined isotopes in the feathers. The stable-hydrogen isotope values in feathers can serve as geographic markers since they reflect the types of vegetation in the bird's diet at the time it grew new feathers, Marra said. The feather samples were compared to a reference library of 620,000 specimen at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois, the Smithsonian said. The finding, published today in ""Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment,"" concluded the geese were from the Labrador area. ""Although these geese were [migratory], we do not believe that these individuals were actually migrating north to return to breeding areas. Instead, we hypothesize that these birds were undertaking a short-distance movement on their wintering grounds in response to freezing temperatures and snow cover, in an effort to find open water and food, a behavior commonly found in species of birds wintering at temperate latitudes,"" the report says. At the time of the US Airways bird strike, the flock was in the upper limits of their flying abilities, the Smithsonian said. About ""3,000 feet is pretty much their limit,"" Dove said. The highest known bird strike came when a jet in Africa hit a vulture at 37,000 feet, she said. Marra and Dove said ""billions"" of birds threaten aviation. Consequently, more research needs to be done on radar capable of detecting birds, more information is needed on migratory patterns and scientists need to integrate weather patterns into models that can predict bird movements, they said.","Feather samples lead Smithsonian Institution to migratory Canadian geese .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The chipped walls of Guo Jigang's tiny home are bandaged together with clear packing tape. Guo, together with his wife and son, live in a narrow, 53-square foot room furnished with a bed, faded chair and table. They share a bathroom with 20 to 30 neighbors in their building in suburban Beijing -- a little piece of home for China's army of migrant workers. Despite their modest living conditions, Guo insists his family's standard of living is improving. ""I feel we are already getting better and better,"" he said. Like 200 million Chinese migrants, Guo, 30 and his wife, Ge Yaru, 26, are part of the ""nongmingong"" -- which means peasant class, a term used to describe those who've left the countryside. They are also known as ""liudong renkou"" which means floating population. In the last decades, as waves of migrant workers have found jobs in the cities, hundreds of millions in China have been lifted out of poverty, according to official estimates. But beyond China's successful facade, migrant workers face difficulties accessing public services due to a household registration system called ""hukou,"" which divides the population into rural and urban residents. When a migrant worker like Guo leaves his village, he also leaves his social benefits behind. Without an urban hukou permit, a migrant is often denied access to the subsidized health, housing and education that city dwellers enjoy. The workers find odd jobs in factories, construction sites, public infrastructure projects, restaurants and households but cannot enjoy the same privileges as urbanites. ""Their plight has been described as them being like illegal immigrants in their own country,"" according to the Global Times, a Chinese state-controlled newspaper. Some scholars have likened China's hukou system to South Africa's now-defunct apartheid, a system of segregation that severely restricted the rights of the country's black population, with whites enjoying preferential treatment. This legalized form of discrimination relegated the nation's black workers to migrant labor with little rights. China's migrant workers never integrate into the city to enjoy the same rights and opportunities as urbanites, said David Bandurski, an author of an upcoming book about migrant workers. ""The discrimination is very real in China,"" he added. China's urban explosion: A 21st century challenge . Under the hukou system, migrant workers can secure temporary residence certificates but getting them is a lengthy process. In some cases, their employers are obligated to pay exorbitant fees to the city government for such certificates. Guo, who has a tanned, leathery face, spends 10 hours a day painting outside, dangling from high buildings where he's exposed to the sun, heat and wind. When asked about his dreams for his family's future, they say they want to open a store someday and be able to send their son, who is now two, to middle school. ""I'll still be a migrant worker,"" he said. ""During our lifetime, I guess we won't have any high hopes,"" said Guo. ""Really any hopes are for the children."" His son shyly hides behind his parents. Squirming on a bed that he shares with both parents, the toddler peeks over his mother's shoulders. Guo's wife, Ge, is pregnant with their second child. They plan to pay a fine -- about $1,500 -- for violating the country's One Child Policy. Ge plans to give birth in her village in Hefei province. Their reasoning for having a second child pertains to their migrant worker status. ""If something went wrong, and you lost your only child, then you would grow old alone,"" Guo said. ""You'd at least want two, no? One is just not enough. Especially for us, villagers. The city and the village -- it is not the same. ""When people get old in the city they can just be sent to the old people's home, where as if we grow old, we can only rely on our children,"" his wife added. ""We don't have any pension. We don't have any hope or anything. All of that we put it on the shoulders of our children. So if there aren't enough kids, and something goes wrong, we are also done for."" They acknowledge that raising a second child adds financial pressures; but in a way, a second child provides a security net in a society where migrant workers do not have one. While people in the cities have pensions, Ge said their village has nothing. Chinese media, including state-run news agencies, have reported on the difficulties faced by migrant workers. For example, the children of migrant workers cannot go to the same school as the city kids. They've been called ""liu dong er tong,"" which means floating children, because of the question of where they can go to school and how they'll be able to afford it. Migrant children have to pay for private schooling, said the author Bandurski, who taught at one for migrant children. In China, calling it ""private school"" is also misleading, he said. ""They're not getting the same quality of education. It's not even close to their counterparts, 'city kids' although they are city kids,"" he said. Without education and opportunities, many children of migrants end up doing the same work as their parents. This continuous cycle has spanned almost four generations, Bandurski said. ""I think in the last 15 to 20 years, it's not a socially mobile society,"" he said. And there are signs of unrest. Thousands of workers rioted in Guangdong province early this year after reports that police officers had beaten a migrant teenager in June, according to both Chinese and Western media reports. Tensions also spilled over into violence in the city of Xintang last year when migrant workers clashed with locals after reports that officials had beaten a pregnant migrant worker and her husband. Some families pin their hopes on their kids to break the cycle by gaining admission into a university. The chances of that, Bandurski said, are ""very very slim."" Guo insists that he wants his son to go to school. ""We villagers don't have many ambitious hopes about our kids, as long as he goes to school and studies hard. Otherwise, we don't have any plans for our kids... I just hope he doesn't do what we are doing.""","Migrant family's hope is that their child doesn't also have to be migrant worker .

"(CNN) -- Eleven members of Greenpeace pleaded not guilty to federal charges after they were arrested for hanging a banner on South Dakota's Mount Rushmore Wednesday to protest global warming as the G-8 summit in Italy begins. Greenpeace says it does not think its 2,275-square-foot sign will damage Mount Rushmore's structure. ""America honors leaders not politicians: stop global warming,"" reads the 2,275-square-foot sign. Twelve protesters were arrested, but one was released after questioning. The others appeared before a federal magistrate Wednesday afternoon and received citations for illegal climbing and trespassing, according to federal prosecutors. Each person faces a maximum of six months in prison and possibly up to a $5,000 fine. The charged protesters came from eight states, including California and New York. The banner was up for an hour before it was seized. The National Park Service is holding it as evidence, authorities said.  Watch tourists react to the protest » . Some of the demonstrators breached a controlled area and got to the top of the monument, Mount Rushmore spokeswoman Patty Rooney told CNN. Greenpeace, a nonprofit organization that supports environmental causes, said the sign is part of a global day of action to urge world leaders at the G-8 summit to make global warming a priority and to take the actions necessary to stop climate change. ""We are at a key moment in history when we must challenge our president to take real leadership,"" said Carroll Muffet, deputy campaign director for Greenpeace. ""The steps taken so far have been frankly inadequate. If President Obama wants to take his place among the great leaders of history, he must take aggressive measures to combat climate change and prioritize a strong deal in Copenhagen,"" Muffet said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- It's played from the sun-soaked sands of the Pacific Islands to the mud-sodden playing-fields of England's most exclusive private schools. The game's professional competitions attract a colorful core of hard-drinking supporters with a penchant for fancy dress (think cowboy hats, togas and men dressed as nuns). And come 2016, this unique combination of sport and frock-wearing spectacle will be gracing Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Games. Welcome to the wonderful world of rugby sevens, a combination of fast and furious on-field play augmented by no little fun in the stands in a nine-leg circuit which reaches its party peak in Hong Kong. Although it may lack some of the more brutal hits perpetrated in its 15-a-side cousin rugby union, sevens is quick, intense and just as technically demanding. The boisterous atmosphere that surrounds the sport, meanwhile, encourages fans of all ages to get involved and participate. ""It's as much about the party as it is about the matches themselves,"" former Australia rugby union international Joe Roff told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. ""Everyone gets into the spirit of it, everyone has a great time but also, it's a community and it's just a great feel. ""I must admit I have been in the South Stand in Hong Kong incognito, in fancy dress. We went toga one year and cowboys one year as well. If you like rugby, these are the things you have to tick off in life."" A rugby throwback . For old hats like Roff, modern sevens is as close as it gets to the free-spirited days of rugby as an amateur sport. Despite being hugely popular in the likes of the UK, France, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa for more than a century, rugby only went professional in the mid-1990s. In the days before the pro era, teams would regularly tour and play against each other before drinking the bar dry together afterwards. While there may be more of an athletic focus on conditioning, diet and preparation these days, the globetrotting nature of the leading sevens competitions means teams travel together and regularly meet in far-flung regions of the world. Dubai, Las Vegas, Tokyo and Hong Kong are all destinations on the IRB Sevens World Series, a traveling road show that exhibits the game to crowds in regions far outside of rugby's traditional heartlands. ""It's a little bit of a throwback to rugby when I played,"" Australian sevens coach Mick O'Connor told CNN. ""You travel and stay in the same hotel as your opposition, you respect them off the field, but the games are quite ferocious on the field. I like that aspect of it."" See also: South African rugby captain on Mandela . For England legends Jason Robinson and Will Greenwood -- both Rugby World Cup winners in 2003 -- this competitive edge allied with the unmistakeable camaraderie makes sevens a great introduction for those who may be new to the wider sport. ""The more people come to this, the more people are exposed to rugby, the bigger it gets,"" explained Robinson. ""It's a broken down version of the 15s game, it's very easy for spectators."" Greenwood, meanwhile, lauds the high skill levels and increasing intensity of a game which he believes has become just as tough as other rugby codes. ""It's short, it's sharp, it's intense, it's pact, there's space, there's tries but increasingly so, there's more physicality,"" he enthused. ""Perhaps in the old days people looked down their nose in terms of sevens being a game of touch and pass -- now it's just utterly ferocious."" Aiming for gold . While in the past, some of rugby's leading young players would use sevens as a finishing school before making the step up to the 15-a-side game, today it's more common for aspiring players to stay in the sevens for longer. Increased popularity has enabled the IRB to offer more lucrative and longer contracts to the sport's biggest stars. The prospect of Olympic participation, meanwhile, means sevens is now at the forefront of many a rugby player's mind. See also: Is Richie McCaw the world's toughest sportsman? ""What we're finding now with the Olympics coming up, some of these players that left sevens to go to fifteens want to come back into sevens to try and go for a gold medal in Rio in 2016,"" International Rugby Board CEO Brett Gosper told CNN. ""Some of the 15 stars will come back and play (sevens) but it is a specialist sport and they do have their own stars and great players, whether they be from the top sides of New Zealand across the women's games,"" he added. ""I'm sure during the Olympics, some stars will be born."" For Greenwood, however, the magic of seven-a-side rugby is about more than just the prospect of Olympic glory. This is the case for both players and fans, he believes, and is evidenced at events the world over. ""It's just a fantastic way to spend a weekend,"" he enthused. ""You've got Kiwis sat next to Welshmen sat next to Irishmen sat next to Aussies, they're all enjoying each other's company. ""Of course they're passionate about their country winning, but at the end of the game they all get up and have a dance together, go for a hotdog and have a great time.

"(CNN) -- Twelve cannons were fired in Liege, Belgium, on Monday to conclude a ceremony marking the outbreak of World War I 100 years ago. Britain declared war on Germany after it invaded neutral Belgium on August 4, 1914. The declaration escalated a conflict -- sparked by the assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary -- into a global war. About 16 million people were killed before the war ended four years later. Belgium was a key WWI battleground. Dignitaries including King Philippe of Belgium, the French and German Presidents and Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, addressed those gathered in remembrance Monday. Prince William said the people of Belgium had been among the war's first victims, and their ""resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great."" Belgium's sacrifice and contribution had been pivotal to eventual victory, the prince said. ""Belgium's resistance in 1914 allowed the Allies to regroup and draw up the battle lines which became the infamous trenches. These trenches have left an indelible scar on your land; they speak of the horrors of war but also of your forebears' courage,"" he said. Prince William said recent events in Ukraine showed that ""instability continues to stalk our continent."" But he said the fact that war was now ""unthinkable"" between the former World War I enemies represented at the ceremony ""bears testimony to the power of reconciliation."" ""We were enemies more than once in the last century, and today we are friends and allies. We salute those who died to give us our freedom. We will remember them."" The king of Belgium laid a wreath to commemorate the dead before a bugler sounded ""The Last Post."" A young girl representing future remembrance then released a white balloon as a sign of peace and reconciliation before the cannon shots rang out. Britain is also holding events across the United Kingdom and in the Belgian city of Mons, where the first British soldier died during the conflict. British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement, ""A hundred years ago today Britain entered the First World War and we are marking that centenary to honor those who served, to remember those who died, and to ensure that the lessons learnt live with us forever.""","Ceremony in Belgian city of Liege marks anniversary of outbreak of World War I .

"(CNN) -- A 911 call released Wednesday recounts the moments after soccer referee John Bieniewicz was fatally punched in the head by a player during an adult-league soccer match in Michigan. ""The referee is knocked out,"" a female caller frantically told a 911 operator on Sunday. ""He's not waking up."" Bieniewicz, 44, an avid soccer fan and referee who sometimes officiated up to three games a weekend, died Tuesday. In a state where football and basketball reign, Bieniewicz's passion was soccer, a childhood friend recalled. ""He loved the game of soccer. He loved refereeing; it was like free time to him,"" Greg Acho, the friend, told CNN. ""He died doing what he loved."" The woman who called police also described the alleged suspect fleeing the scene as the victim was unconscious on the field. ""It looks like a ... oh God, they're peeling out,"" she told the operator. ""It's a Jeep. It's a black Jeep Wrangler. They're peeling out of the parking lot right now."" The suspect left the scene, she said. An ambulance was needed. The operator asked what did they hit him with. ""His fist, yeah, in the middle of the game,"" the woman said . The woman said the referee was not breathing. Others on the field attempted CPR. Bieniewicz was pronounced dead at Detroit Receiving Hospital after what police said was an unprovoked attack. A supervisor at Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor said he was in critical condition when he arrived the hospital, police said. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's office will determine the cause of death, police said. Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, has been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. He was being held on $500,000 bail, police said. He pleaded not guilty. A hearing was set for July 10. Bieniewicz is survived by his wife and two sons, 13 and 9. His friends have established a GoFundMe.com account for his family that had raised nearly $60,000 by Wednesday afternoon. Acho said donations will be used to cover medical expenses, funeral costs and to start a college fund for his children. Bieniewicz was an organ donor, Acho said. ""John Bieniewicz was a man who lived life to the fullest,"" friends wrote on a website dedicated to his memory. ""He had a passion for his family, a passion for the kids at Mott Children's Hospital, and a passion for soccer."" Saad's defense lawyer, Brian Berry, expressed his condolences to the family of the referee but told CNN Tuesday that all the facts in the case had not come out and that ""witness accounts may have been miscategorized."" The website dedicated to the victim added, ""The boys will miss his fatherly guidance and support but they will also miss his financial support, and we are here to help that in a small way. If you were touched by John, or merely share his love of soccer, we ask that in his name you donate to his children's futures."" Last year, a 17-year-old soccer player in Utah pleaded guilty to homicide by assault in the death of referee Ricardo Portillo. A judge ordered the teenager, who was not named publicly, to keep a picture of Portillo in his cell for the remainder of his time in juvenile jail. The judge recommended a sentence of three years, said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. The teen also was ordered to write weekly letters to Portillo's family, telling them what steps he is taking to return to normal life.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday called for an end to violence in Syria, as well as a renewed peace effort in the Middle East, in his annual Easter Mass message from the Vatican as Christians worldwide marked the holiday. ""May the risen Christ grant hope to the Middle East and enable all the ethnic, cultural and religious groups in that region to work together to advance the common good and respect for human rights,"" the pope said in his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""To the City and to the World"") message in St. Peter's Square. ""Particularly in Syria, may there be an end to bloodshed and an immediate commitment to the path of respect, dialogue and reconciliation, as called for by the international community, he said. ""May the many refugees from that country who are in need of humanitarian assistance find the acceptance and solidarity capable of relieving their dreadful sufferings."" The Iraqi people, he said, should be encouraged to ""spare no effort in pursuing the path of stability and development. In the Holy Land, may Israelis and Palestinians courageously take up anew the peace process."" And the pope asked that ""the risen Jesus comfort the suffering populations of the Horn of Africa and favor their reconciliation,"" including Sudan and South Sudan, ""and grant their inhabitants the power of forgiveness. In Mali, now experiencing delicate political developments, may the glorious Christ grant peace and stability. To Nigeria, which in recent times has experienced savage terrorist attacks, may the joy of Easter grant the strength needed to take up anew the building of a society which is peaceful and respectful of the religious freedom of all its citizens."" Christians have previously been the targets of violence in Nigeria, most notably on Christmas Day, when a string of bombs struck churches in several cities. A bombing Sunday in the northern city of Kaduna killed 25 people and wounded another 13, emergency management agency spokesman Abubakar Zakari said. While the blast was near a Christian church where services were taking place, the target was not immediately clear. Thankfully, thousands of Easter services -- from the annual sunrise service at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington, D.C., to throngs of worshipers attending Mass in the Philippines -- were far more peaceful, a time for both reflection and celebration. In Georgetown, Texas, that included cheers for Tim Tebow, who has become known as much for his religious devotion as for his exploits on the football field. The quarterback took the stage alongside Celebration Church senior pastor Joe Champion to talk about how his faith brings him peace, joy, stability and a sense of purpose even at times of what might seem like intense turmoil and scrutiny. Tebow has been on a roller coaster in the last year with his play and public displays of faith, and more recently with his trade from the Denver Broncos to the New York Jets. ""Whatever happens in life -- good or bad, whether you're the hero or the goat, whether you like it or not -- you know that someone has a plan for your life, and it's a special plan,"" Tebow told the congregation, about his belief that his future is in God's hands. ""When you trust that and you have hope in that, then you have peace in all decisions and everything you do. And it brings a lot of joy to your life."" For Christians in countries thrown into tumult by the Arab Spring revolutions, some say Easter celebrations could prove dangerous. In the past, Syrian Christians ""have had great outpouring of piety in the public squares on Easter,"" said Nina Shea, director of the Center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute in Washington. ""This time, I suspect it is going to be vastly different. They are fearful."" Though the geopolitical makeup of each Arab Spring country is different, Shea and other religious freedom scholars say that a pious holiday like Easter presents an opportunity for anti-Christian groups to seek out worshippers. Religious holidays have long been a venue for terrorist attacks against all religious groups in the Middle East and North Africa. These holidays provide not only a meaningful day to make a statement but also see large concentrations of worshippers in one area. ""Christ is hope and comfort in a particular way for those Christian communities suffering most for their faith on account of discrimination and persecution,"" the pope said Sunday. ""And he is present as a force of hope through his church, which is close to all human situations of suffering and injustice."" Last Easter, Benedict called for peace amid ongoing conflicts in Africa and the Middle East and mentioned the plight of those in Japan recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- It's a staggering figure, two weeks after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot out of the sky. As many as 80 bodies could still be lying in the fields of eastern Ukraine where the passenger jet crashed, Australia's foreign minister told CNN on Thursday. ""But we won't know until our investigative teams are on the site and combing the crash site for remains,"" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. ""And that's the grisly and sobering task that they must undertake from now on."" And getting to the crash site isn't as simple as it sounds. Investigation at the site as been delayed for days by dangerous fighting in the area. Monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe reached the crash site on Thursday, accompanied by two Dutch and two Australian experts. The monitors used a new route to access the site. Many coffins holding remains -- collected in the first week after the disaster -- already have been flown to the Netherlands, where the flight originated July 17. But monitors who've gained sporadic access to the site have said bodies and victims' belongings still lie scattered across huge debris fields. Experts marked locations where they spotted human remains on Thursday, OSCE spokesman Michael Bociurkiw said. They hope to continue investigating Friday, he said, and may use cadaver dogs and aerial surveillance to search the scene. ""This all goes back to time is of the essence,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""Everyone realizes that time is no longer on our side, that this investigation has to kick-start into high gear right away."" The team at the site observed a moment's silence to mark two weeks to the day since the plane -- en route from Amsterdam to Malaysia -- plummeted to Earth near the Russian border in rural eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people aboard. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have alleged that a Russian-made missile system downed the plane from rebel-held territory; Russia and the rebel fighters deny involvement. The team's arrival came as Ukraine's military announced a one-day cease-fire Thursday to allow international experts full access. A statement issued by the Ukrainian Counter-Terrorist Operation's press center said the military would not take offensive action but will ""respond to direct attacks."" The statement also accused the rebels of continued violence, including firing Grad rocket systems Thursday morning. ""This demonstrates their attitude towards Ukraine and the international community,"" it said. 'Bittersweet' progress . Bociurkiw said the team of eight OSCE personnel and four ""very senior experts"" had reached the site after six hours of travel -- a journey three times longer than usual. The trip, which involved crossing and recrossing Ukrainian and rebel front lines, was possible only after high-level political agreements were negotiated with both sides, he said. ""Although we are very, very relieved to be back at the site, it is bittersweet in the sense that we do realize that it's two weeks almost to the hour since that plane went down,"" he said. The four experts are combing the debris field for a rapid assessment, Bociurkiw said. If the truce holds, more international experts will be brought in Friday from where they are waiting, about two hours to the west. The temperature is nearing 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and the scene is difficult to describe, he said. ""We've been here multiple times, and yet it hasn't gotten any easier. There are still human remains in front of me, we can tell by the smell, and there's so many areas that haven't been properly gone over, scoured."" Among those areas is a chicken farm not currently in operation where a fair amount of debris has been spotted. Human remains may be there, too. Although the observers saw evidence of tampering with the wreckage in the first few days, there are no obvious signs of change over the past week from what he's seen, Bociurkiw said. What we found at MH17 crash site . 'Long walk towards justice' Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak met in the Netherlands to discuss the international response to the crash. Rutte said the Netherlands and Malaysia share three priorities in dealing with the crash: the repatriation of the victims and their personal belongings, ""obtaining clarity"" on the cause of the accident and making sure the perpetrators are brought to justice. He said that repatriation of the victims was the highest priority. Najib also called for a cessation of hostilities by both sides around the crash site and ""full and unfettered"" access to the area. With such access, authorities will be able ""to find out what happened to MH17"" and will be able ""to achieve justice for the victims and their families,"" he said. ""We ask that all sides respect the lives lost, and the integrity of the site, so that the investigation may proceed. The long walk towards justice begins with this step."" Netherlands, whose citizens made up about two-thirds of those killed in the crash, is leading the international investigation. Rutte said 68 police officers from Malaysia had arrived in Kiev, Ukraine, and would try to reach the crash site area. In addition, 24 Malaysian experts are aiding in efforts to identify victims' remains in the Netherlands, he said. After their statements, Najib signed a book of condolences for the Dutch victims. Malaysia suffered the loss of 43 nationals in the crash, including 15 crew and two infants. Lawmakers vote . The Ukrainian Parliament ratified agreements with the Netherlands and Australia on Thursday that will allow both countries to send teams -- including police, civilian and armed personnel -- to eastern Ukraine to carry out the investigation. Other countries that had citizens on board MH17, such as Malaysia, can also send teams, but there can be no more than 700 armed personnel in total, the agreements stipulate. Only 250 of those who are armed can come from Australia. According to the Cabinet Office, the missions are free to travel within Ukraine to relevant locations and ""have a right to search and gather the remnants as well as investigate the catastrophe."" Australia, which lost 38 citizens and permanent residents, has sent nearly 200 police officers to Europe to help with investigation and recovery efforts. A Russian delegation, comprising three experts, is also in Ukraine and hopes to access the MH17 crash site on Thursday alongside international investigators, according to a spokesman for the Russian Civil Aviation Authority, Sergey Izvolsky. They will also provide material requested by the investigators, including radar data from the Russian Defense Ministry showing a Ukrainian fighter jet flying close to MH17, according to Izvolsky. The United States and others say Russia has provided arms to rebels in eastern Ukraine, including heavy weapons such as a missile system like the one the United States says was used to down the Malaysian airliner.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Police are on an ""intense"" and ""extremely focused"" nationwide manhunt for the occupants of a black Range Rover at the center of a shooting on the Las Vegas Strip that claimed three lives. The incident involved a Maserati that was shot at and subsequently crashed into a taxi, which caught fire. The driver of the Maserati, whom family identified as Kenneth Cherry Jr., died at a hospital. The taxi driver and a passenger also died. The shots were fired from the Range Rover, which Las Vegas police spokesman Bill Cassell said could be anywhere. Police have received multiple reports of vehicles that match the description, but ""at this point, we have no information that the vehicle in the crime has been located,"" he said Friday. Cassell declined to say whether there was one suspect or several, citing the ongoing investigation. Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, was driving his Maserati on Thursday when someone in the Range Rover fired several shots at his car as it headed north on Las Vegas Boulevard. The Maserati continued into the intersection of the boulevard and Flamingo Road and collided with a taxi, which caught fire, killing cab driver Michael Boldon, 62, CNN affiliate KVVU said. ""It is gut-wrenching,"" Boldon's younger brother, Tehran Boldon, tearfully told KVVU. ""My life mission will be to see them punished and brought to justice for the senseless thing they did."" In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire -- not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father. ""He saw the accident and he tried to warn his dad to say avoid Flamingo (Road)"" because he knew his father was nearby at the Rio casino, Tehran Boldon said. ""He called and he didn't get a response. So his father was the fatality in that accident that he was being warned to avoid. ""We lost a real patriarch and brother,"" said Tehran Boldon. The son, 36, works the same shift as his father did. The father's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment, Tehran Boldon said. He is also trying to provide the coroner's office with his brother's dental records, he said. A passenger in the taxi also died. A passenger in the Maserati and three others were injured in the pileup, Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said. The Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner was conducting an autopsy of Cherry, 27, a representative said Friday. The office wasn't releasing further information Friday about Boldon or his passenger. The fire closed a block and a half of the Strip near some of its biggest draws: Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Police collected surveillance video from the casinos. The shooting took place two blocks from where rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in 1996. Cherry prominently features his Maserati in a music video on YouTube. ""Out of everyone I know in the rapping industry, there is no way I would have ever, ever expected to find that he was shot on the Las Vegas Strip in such an aggressive manner,"" said Vicki Greco, Cherry's attorney. ""He didn't have a (criminal) record or a history. He was just a good kid trying to make it and be a good father."" Cherry had two children, she said. See an iReporter's video of the fire . ""First time in Vegas, and then, like, the whole thing, what you know from movies only -- I was shocked,"" said Christine Gerstenberger, who was visiting from Germany. Thursday's incident started about 4:20 a.m. with a dispute in the valet lot of the Aria hotel, about a block away, Gillespie said. Investigators haven't confirmed the cause of the altercation, but he said it spilled onto the street. The Maserati's passenger and other witnesses are helping detectives piece together what happened, he said. The ""top priority"" for police is to find those who were inside the Range Rover, which sped away from the intersection. John Lamb, who was inside Caesars Palace, told CNN affiliate KLAS that he heard the commotion and saw the taxi on fire from a window. ""There was a loud bang, and I heard two other booms. I looked out my window at Caesars Palace ... and could see the fireball,"" he told KLAS. Man kills 3, himself in Southern California shooting .

"(CNN) -- Jonathan Walton was walking through Bishop Eddie Long's church one day when he saw something that disturbed him. He stared at a 30-foot banner draped behind the pulpit of New Birth Missionary Baptist. Church. It displayed a profile of a grinning Long with the caption: ""What is God up to?"" ""Everywhere you went in that church, his name and face was there,"" says Walton, an assistant professor of religion at Harvard Divinity School in Massachusetts. ""His image has replaced the cross."" Long's image is now under assault. Four young men have filed civil lawsuits accusing him of abusing his spiritual authority to coerce them into sexual relationships, allegations he has denied in a statement issued by his attorney. While most people focus on the men's allegations, few have paid attention to how Long acquired and maintains his authority at New Birth, which has an estimated 25,000 members. Long and New Birth are virtually synonymous. The 57-year-old pastor has built a devoted following at his church in Lithonia, Georgia, by preaching the prosperity gospel, making savvy business decisions and through public displays of generosity. But Long has also talked about ridding his congregation of its deacon board during his early years, and by consistently telling his congregation that he speaks for God. Long's controversial megachurch 'mentor' Long's leadership style at New Birth follows a similar pattern at many megachurches (congregations of 2,000 and above). Pastors can acquire so much unchecked power that members are afraid to challenge them, says Scott Thumma, co-author of ""Beyond Megachurch Myths: What We Can Learn from America's Largest Churches."" If members of such a megachurch dare to bring any accusations against a minister, they are often greeted with hostility by the congregation, says Thumma, a religion professor at the Hartford Institute for Religion Research in Connecticut. ""If somebody comes and brings an accusation against the pastor, people ask, 'Who are we going to trust? The person I don't know or the person I've been giving 10 percent of my income to for the last eight years?' "" Thumma wrote his dissertation on an Atlanta megachurch near New Birth that collapsed after its pastor was caught in a sex scandal that involved his brother's wife and many other women. That pastor, Earl Paulk, was a ""quasi-mentor"" to Long, Thumma says. They appeared in public together. Read more stories about faith on CNN'S Belief Blog . Sarah Posner, author of ""God's Profits: Faith, Fraud and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters,"" says Long considered Paulk his ""spiritual mentor."" Thumma says the problems at Paulk's church festered for years because Paulk convinced his congregation that questioning him would be seen as an act of rebellion. Paulk's church, Chapel Hill Harvester Church, once had at least 15,000 members who worshipped in a soaring cathedral. The church was forced to sell the cathedral after its pastor's scandal became public. Paulk died in 2009. ""That church was a sick place and even I didn't know it until after two years of studying it,"" Thumma says. 'He is finished' Some church scholars wonder if New Birth will suffer the same fate. On Sunday, New Birth appeared to throw its support behind Long. New Birth members leapt to their feet to cheer Long as he vowed to fight the allegations. Long took to the stage with his wife, Vanessa, and compared himself to David fighting Goliath. ""I've got five rocks, and I haven't thrown one yet,"" Long said. Long during his church appearance did not address the specific allegations contained in the four lawsuits filed against him. Long, in a statement read on a syndicated radio show Thursday, denied the allegations. ""Let me be clear: The charges against me and New Birth are false,"" the statement said. ""I have devoted my life to helping others and these false allegations hurt me deeply, but my faith is strong and the truth will emerge."" Shayne Lee, a sociology professor at Tulane University in Louisiana, says Long had to unequivocally deny the allegations from the pulpit to maintain New Birth's support. ""His ministry is over,"" says Lee, author of ""Holy Mavericks: Evangelical Innovators and the Spiritual Marketplace,"" which looks at the appeal of celebrity preachers. Lee has written extensively about how big business has shaped megachurch pastors. ""What I saw was more lamb than lion,"" Lee says. ""I didn't see the truculent, masculine preacher. There should have been some pent up sense of outrage."" Long's demise will take place over time, but it is inevitable, Lee says. Read details about the suits . ""I have seen many pastors survive scandals where it was a woman,"" he says. ""But it's unprecedented for a leading black evangelical of his reputation to survive the taint of same-sex charges."" How Long took charge at New Birth . Long's ascension at New Birth didn't seem likely at first. When he started as a pastor, he was so nervous before preaching that he often threw up. He started with 300 members. When Long arrived at New Birth, he had to consult with a deacon and trustee board. Long wrote in his book, ""Taking Over,"" that New Birth's deacon board was ""gripping the purse strings"" of the church, and ""telling the man of God when to jump and how high."" After the church grew, Long told the congregation that he received a revelation from God that New Birth's governing structure was ""ungodly,"" he recounted in ""Taking Over."" Long said the board relinquished its authority over him with his congregation's approval. ""That was the day I became pastor,"" Long wrote in ""Taking Over."" ""Up until that time, I was the hired preacher."" As time went on, Long also embraced a more charismatic approach to ministry (charismatics encourage Christians to develop ""gifts of the Holy Spirit,"" such as speaking in tongues). The minister's job wasn't just to preach, Long once said in a profile in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""A pastor is called to minister to God,"" he said. ""Then God ministers back to him the word, and he comes before the people to tell them what God said."" It is not unusual for pastors to portray themselves as vessels of God's revelations. Long also, in time, became something else to some of his parishioners: ""God's anointed,"" says Lee, the Tulane University professor. When outsiders would question Long's leadership, New Birth members would often cite Psalms 105, verse 15: ""Touch not my anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm.'' Lee says some charismatic leaders invoke Psalms 105 to discourage criticism. ""It's a great scripture to try to keep people from questioning their leader and keep them in line,"" Lee says. ""But there's another scripture in Matthew 7: 'By their fruits ye shall know them.' '' Walton, the Harvard professor who saw the giant banner of Long behind the pulpit, says Long's stature at New Birth as God's anointed inspires fierce devotion. ""People come to believe that to turn on him is to not be committed to God,"" Walton says. Walton asks Long: Did you or didn't you? Marketing a megachurch . There are business reasons, though, for some megachurch pastors to consolidate authority in a church, says Thumma, the megachurch scholar. ""It's much easier to market a personality than it is to market a church,"" says Thumma. Many megachurches are financially dependent on the appeal of a solitary pastor, Thumma says. The pastor's sermons, television broadcasts, books and tapes -- all bring in the crowds. As the pastor grows in popularity, though, he loses accountability, Thumma says. He or she becomes a celebrity. ""What ends up happening is the authority structure goes from having a church with a board of elders who consult and fight over power with the senior pastors to one where the pastor has selected people on the board who are more or less yes people,"" Thumma says. Retaining the loyalty of a congregation, though, is another challenge for a megachurch pastor like Long, says the Rev. Gerald Durley, senior pastor of Providence Missionary Church in Atlanta. He says Long can retain New Birth's support if he appears transparent before his congregation in the days ahead. ""What people want to see is a certain sense of humility, a certain 'I'm back under the will of God and he has appointed me to lead if you trust me.' At that point, he can pick and go on and do what God has called him to do."" But if Long doesn't seem sincere, he will suffer, Durley says. ""If he's perceived as manipulative,"" Durley says, ""he's finished.""","Bishop Eddie Long ascension at New Birth raises questions about megachurch culture .

"(CNN) -- The curtain drops to reveal women hanging by their hair. Leotards are in perfect place -- toes pointed, smiles on. The music kicks in on cue, and then suddenly -- horrifyingly -- what's known as the ""human chandelier"" plummets to the ground. ""I screamed. I'm like, that's not right,"" Chelie Barrie, a spectator, told CNN affiliate WPRI. ""You know, sometimes you're surprised and it's part of the show, but this clearly wasn't."" Nine performers were injured Sunday in Providence, Rhode Island, said Steve Payne, spokesman for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Eight performers fell when the hair-hang apparatus -- which holds performers by their hair -- failed, Payne said. Another performer was injured on the ground, he added. Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare said the performers fell from between 25 to 35 feet. Many of those injured suffered broken bones, and no spectators were hurt, Pare said. The performers were among 11 people hospitalized with injuries related to the accident, Rhode Island Hospital spokeswoman Jill Flaxington told CNN. One of those people was listed in critical condition, Flaxington said. It was not immediately clear who the other victims were. Multiple emergency units responded to the accident at the Dunkin' Donuts Center. Witnesses told WPRI that they saw acrobats up on a type of aerial scaffolding doing the ""human chandelier"" when a cable snapped. People started screaming and ""going crazy,"" Sean Bergeron, a 23-year-old Marine at the circus with his girlfriend, told CNN. A disaster distress hotline, 800-985-5990, has been set up, and Providence Public Safety is encouraging those in the crowd of 3,900 who are troubled after witnessing the incident to call for free counseling from trained counselors. Payne told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield the apparatus had been used for multiple performances each week since Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey launched its ""Legends"" show in February. ""Each and every time that we come to a new venue, all of the equipment that is used by this performer -- this group of performers as well as other performers -- is carefully inspected. We take the health and safety of our performers and our guests very seriously, and our company has a safety department that spends countless hours making sure that all of our equipment is indeed safe and effective for continued use,"" the spokesman said. The Medeiros Hair-Hang Act is touted on the Ringling Bros. website as a ""one-of-a-kind act ... the brainchild of husband-and-wife team Andre and Viktoria Medeiros, (who) have devised and improved the mechanisms and methods making possible the myriad of maneuvers this troupe will perform for audiences."" ""It is Andre's attention to every detail, even welding the three different rigs that the girls hang from, that keeps his troupe safe and sound each and every time the act is presented,"" the website says. Rhode Island Hospital has confirmed that each of the eight women named by Ringling Bros. as part of the act are in the hospital: Viktoriya Medeiros, Widny Neves, Samantha Pitard, Viktorila Liakhova, Dayana Costa, Julissa Segrera, Stefany Neves and Svitlana Balanicheva. Providence Public Safety released a statement Sunday night saying the city, the Rhode Island State Fire Marshal and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration are working together on the investigation. Payne had earlier said the circus also was involved in the investigation. The circus had all necessary permits and was ""solely responsible for the setup and rigging of the show,"" according to the Public Safety statement. ""We will do whatever it takes to come to the bottom of this, make sure that when the show goes back -- starts to perform again -- it's safe,"" said Lawrence Lepore, general manager of the Dunkin' Donuts Center. ""Legends"" began a short Providence residency on Thursday, Lepore said. The final five performances there were slated for 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. Sunday and 10:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Monday. The early show ended with the accident, and the Dunkin' Donuts Center tweeted around 3 p.m. that the two later Sunday shows had been canceled, with refunds available where patrons bought tickets or automatically via Ticketmaster. In June, a performer from Cirque du Soleil's ""Ka"" died in an accident at the MGM Grand Resort in Las Vegas. Sarah Guillot-Guyard, 31, a Paris-born acrobat and aerialist, ""was being hoisted up the side of the stage and then just plummeted down,"" witness Dan Mosqueda told the Las Vegas Sun newspaper. In October, the Nevada OSHA cited the circus and the casino for violations. Nevada OSHA fined Cirque du Soleil more than $25,000 and the MGM Grand $7,000, but both the circus and the casino appealed the findings. Cirque du Soleil settled with Nevada OHSA in February, winnowing six citations down to one, according to the Las Vegas Sun. Cirque du Soleil performer injured in Vegas show .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama announced what he called a ""landmark"" trade agreement with South Korea on Saturday that he said will increase U.S. exports by $11 billion and support 70,000 American jobs. The agreement would eliminate tariffs on over 95% of industrial and consumer goods within five years. ""It's a win-win for both countries,"" Obama said. ""It will contribute significantly to my goal of doubling U.S. exports over the next five years,"" he said. ""In fact, it's estimated that today's deal alone will increase American economic output by more than our last nine free trade agreements combined."" Obama made the announcement just after the Senate rejected Obama's proposal to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts to everyone but the wealthiest Americans. Obama said he was disappointed by the tax vote but looked forward to Congress ratifying the trade pact ""because if there's one thing Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on, it should be creating jobs and opportunity for our people."" The trade agreement would strengthen economic ties between Washington and Seoul at a time when the longtime U.S. ally faces an increasingly hostile northern neighbor . The first version of the agreement was negotiated in 2007 by the Bush administration, but foundered in Congress. The new accord comes just weeks after negotiators failed to reach a deal at the G-20 summit, forcing Obama to walk away from the conference without an agreement. A long-running dispute over U.S. access to Korea's auto and beef markets was largely responsible for the failure of the earlier agreement. But those issues have since been resolved. The new agreement calls for South Korea to reduce its tariff on U.S. auto imports from 8% to 4%, and fully eliminate it in five years. Meanwhile, the 2.5% U.S. tariff on auto imports will remain in place until the fifth year, instead of being immediately eliminated as specified in the 2007 agreement. ""In particular, manufacturers of American cars and trucks will have much more access to the Korean market, will encourage the development of electric cars and green technology in the United States and will continue to ensure a level playing field for American automakers here at home,"" Obama said. The deal sparked an almost immediate response from Public Citizen, a liberal group that characterized it as a ""Bush NAFTA-style trade deal."" ""Choosing to advance Bush's NAFTA-style Korea free trade agreement rather than the new trade policy President Obama promised during his campaign will mean more American job loss,"" Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch said in a statement. But a number of business leaders praised the deal. ""The resulting agreement provides greater clarity and transparency by affirmatively addressing the issues surrounding non-tariff and tariff barriers,"" Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally said as part of a statement released by the White House. CNNMoney's Charles Riley contributed to this report.","He calls the agreement a 'win-win' situation .

"Washington (CNN) -- Mexican drug cartels have used cash and sexual favors as tools to corrupt U.S. border and customs agents, an inspector general investigation has found. In exchange, agents allow contraband or unauthorized immigrants through inspection lanes, protect or escort traffickers or leak sensitive information, said Charles Edwards, acting inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security. Testifying before a Senate subcommittee, Edwards cited the Zetas drug cartel as one of the leaders ""involved increasingly in systematic corruption."" He did not elaborate on how non-cash methods of corruption, like sexual favors, have been used to corrupt agents. Since October 2004, 127 Customs and Border Protection employees have been arrested or indicted for acts of corruption, said agency Commissioner Alan Bersin, speaking at the same hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and Intergovernmental Affairs. Mexican President Felipe Calderon's offensive against the drug cartels, combined with a surge in the hiring of border agents in recent years, have multiplied the risks of corruption, Bersin said. Today, the Border Patrol counts more than 20,700 agents, more than double its size in 2004. Bersin implied that the rapid hiring spree may have come at the cost of hiring less qualified agents. ""The accelerated hiring pace under which we operated between 2006 and 2008 -- and, frankly, mistakes from which we are learning -- exposed critical organizational and individual vulnerabilities within CBP,"" he said. To face this challenge, the commissioner touted the passage of the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010, which requires that by 2013, all the agency's law enforcement applicants must receive a polygraph test before being hired. It also calls for periodic reinvestigations into the background of its agents. ""I cannot overemphasize that the overwhelming majority of CBP officers and agents demonstrate the highest levels of integrity every day,"" Bersin said. Edwards noted that the department inspector general's Office of Investigations has added 10 positions to address corruption complaints among Customs and Border Protection agents. He added, however, that that represented a 6% increase in the size of his staff, compared with a 34% increase in the size of the agency as a whole. Since 2004, his office has seen a 38% increase in the number of complaints against Customs and Border Protection employees, he said. The inspector general's office initiated a record 870 investigations in fiscal year 2010, he said. ""However,"" he added, ""our investigations are complicated by the brutality the cartels use to control their organizations and coerce witnesses, and the sophistication and advanced technologies available to organizations with unlimited money.""","127 U.S. border or customs employees have been arrested since 2004, an official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate voted Monday to begin debate on an anti-discrimination bill to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees from workplace discrimination. That means a Senate vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, also known as ENDA, could occur this week. It's the first time since 1996 the Senate will vote on the measure. This version, however, is more encompassing. It includes workplace protections for not only sexual orientation but also for gender identity. The Senate passed the procedural vote and overcame the 60-vote threshold necessary. Seven Republicans joined all Democrats and two Democratic-leaning Independents for 61 votes. After the procedural vote Monday, the White House released a statement saying that Obama looks forward to the Senate's consideration of EDNA. ""He thanks the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle who have stood up for America's core values of fairness and equality,"" it read. But the bill's passage in the House is far less certain. The measure would provide the same protections for LGBT workers as are already guaranteed on the basis of race, gender and religion. It would no longer be lawful for employers to discriminate based on a person's ""actual or perceived"" sexual orientation. Republican support . The measure is coming up for a vote because of a recent wave of momentum in support. After the bill gained the support of all 53 Democrats, two independents and two Republican co-sponsors: Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine. ENDA: How we got here . Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, announced his support Monday morning. His decision lead supporters within the Senate to believe that they have the votes to pass the bill. The outcome of the vote received the support of more Republicans than anticipated. Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted for the measure at the committee level, voted in favor of the key procedural measure. In the end, so did Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio. Collins said Monday that she hopes to get enough votes to spur the House to act. ""I think that it was Republican votes that made the difference tonight. And that that is a strong signal,"" the senator said. ""I also think that attitudes are changing very rapidly on gay rights issues, and we're seeing every passing day more and more people have embraced equality,"" she said. Republican opposition . ""If more members of Congress step up, we can put an end to this form of discrimination once and for all,"" Obama wrote. The Republican-led House might be a major obstacle to ENDA's success; House Speaker John Boehner has already announced his opposition. ""The speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small-business jobs,"" spokesman Michael Steel said. And Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, the second ranking House Republican, refused to commit to bringing up the legislation. He said that he and fellow Republican leaders ""will review it"" if the Senate passes it. House Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelos said the measure would still pass the House despite Boehner's opposition because most Democrats would support it. ""All we need is maybe 20 Republicans and we can pass the bill,"" she said on MSNBC Sunday. Chad Griffin, president of the LGBT activist group Human Rights Campaign, had harsh words for Boehner. ""The speaker, of all people, should certainly know what it's like to go to work every day afraid of being fired. Instead of letting the far right trample him again, it's time for Speaker Boehner to stand with the majority of everyday Republican voters and support ENDA,"" Griffin said. The conservative political organization Heritage Action put out a notice to all Republican lawmakers recommending a no vote. Its scorecards are threatening assessments of lawmakers who fear a primary challenger or are in need of the outside group's influx of campaign cash. Heritage Action says the bill ""raises serious religious liberty concerns"" and would ""potentially discourage job creation."" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins also slammed ENDA. ""Can you imagine walking into your child's classroom and meeting a teacher dressed in drag? Neither can most Americans. But unfortunately, that's just one of the many consequences of adopting a law as dangerous as this one,"" he wrote in a blog post Friday. ""Preschools, day care centers, summer camps, religious chains like Hobby Lobby or Chick-fil-A -- they'll all be subject to the law, regardless of their personal beliefs and workplace standards,"" Perkins said. An exemption for religious organizations is included in the bill, but some want the religious protection extended to secular businesses, which ENDA proponents say would gut the entire bill. Employers with fewer than 15 employees would also be exempted from the law. Last-minute lobbying . Leading up to the vote, proponents are championing the bill and pressured opponents or those on the fence to come out in support. President Barack Obama wrote a rare op-ed in the Huffington Post in which he called job-site LGBT discrimination ""offensive"" and ""wrong."" ""And it needs to stop, because in the United States of America, who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense,"" the President wrote. The newest member of the Senate, New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, who was sworn in last week after a special election, has passionately defended ENDA on one of his oft-used methods of communication. Opinion: No one should be fired for being gay . He said on Twitter he will support ENDA, ""Absolutely, unequivocally, proudly with gusto & enthusiasm. I hope to make it my first 'co-sponsor.'"" Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, the country's first openly gay U.S. senator, similarly spoke in support of the legislation. ""It's about freedom, the freedom to realize our founding belief that all Americans are created equal under the law. It's about fairness, about whether lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans deserve to be treated just like their family members, their friends, their neighbors and fellow workers,"" she said Monday before the vote. ""It's about opportunity, about whether every American gets to dream the same dreams, chase the same ambitions and have the same shot at success,"" Baldwin said. Heads of major businesses have come out in support of the law, including Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, who wrote an op-ed Monday in the Wall Street Journal. ""So long as the law remains silent on the workplace rights of gay and lesbian Americans, we as a nation are effectively consenting to discrimination against them,"" he wrote. ""We urge senators to support the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, and we challenge the House of Representatives to bring it to the floor for a vote."" Twenty-one states currently have laws on the books protecting lesbian and gay workers from discrimination and 17 states protect transgender workers, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The federal statute would create protections in all states and the District of Columbia. Opinion: ENDA threatens free markets .

"(CNN) -- Texas conservative Pete Sessions has dropped out of the running to replace Rep. Eric Cantor as the No. 2 Republican in the House leadership. ""After thoughtful consideration and discussion with my colleagues, I have made the decision to not continue my run for House majority leader,"" Sessions said in a statement. ""Today, it became obvious to me that the measures necessary to run a successful campaign would have created unnecessary and painful division within our party,"" he continued. Sessions, in appealing directly to the conservative base of the GOP, argued initially that he should succeed Cantor on the leadership roster because he is a red-state Republican who can bring that sensibility to the party hierarchy. Cantor lost his primary on Tuesday in Virginia in stunning fashion, and will leave the leadership post at the end of July. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California is considered the frontrunner to succeed him in a vote next Thursday. Cantor endorsed McCarthy.

"(CNNGo) -- Buckingham Palace may be agonizingly tight-lipped about the juicy details of William and Kate's honeymoon, except that they're somewhere in the Seychelles. But not everyone's quite so discreet. Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, 16 of which offers hotels and resorts for tourists. With a population of around 87,000 people, Seychelles has the smallest population of any African state. The nation is famed for its natural beauty and eco-tourism. Seychelles' Aldabra Atoll, which is home to the world's largest population of giant tortoises, and Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve, which has remained unchanged since prehistoric times, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Here are five places, in descending order of honeymoon-likeliness, that have been touted as potential royal rendezvous. 1. North Island . Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 8/10 . Following Seychelles Tourism Minister Alain St. Ange's admission that the couple is spending their honeymoon on the tropical island, German real estate magnate Farhad Vladi told German newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt that he rented North Island to the couple. The royal newlyweds would no doubt be attracted to North Island for its privacy and green credentials. North Island, one of the Inner Islands of the Seychelles archipelago, is occupied by 11 villas made by Balinese and Tanzanian craftsmen. Each of them is equipped with plunge pools, gazebos and private butlers, but the most profligate of them all is the 8,000-square-foot Villa 11, which is almost twice is large as the island's other villas, and comes with circular-flow swimming pool and a private cinema. Given Wills' love of the wild, he will also love the resort's conservation policies. Before the island was sold to the Maier family during the 1970s, the island was colonized by pests and alien plant species left over from its days as a coconut plantation. Indigenous trees and birds have been re-introduced these days. Cost: An average honeymoon for two costs £3,220 ($5,280), whereas renting all the island's villas costs a staggering £43,000 ($69,700) -- a price tag that doesn't seem to faze Brangelina, Posh and Becks, JK Rowling and Liz Hurley, all of whom reportedly holidayed there. www.north-island.com . 2. Desroches Island Resort . Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 6/10 . Some tabloids like Usmagazine.com are speculating that the royal honeymoon will include a ""nostalgic excursion to Desroches Island."" In August 2007, following a temporary break-up, the couple spent a week in Desroches Island Resort, which is only accessible by plane from the main island of Mahe. The experience was romantic enough for them to decide to soldier on with their relationship. The resort certainly seemed to impress William. He allegedly told islanders that it was the best vacation he has ever had. Desroches Island Resort consists of 20 suites and 28 villas, scattered over the island's 14 kilometers of un-spoilt beaches. The island has enough facilities to satisfy all hot-blooded young couples, such as diving hotspots, bike trails, fly fishing, tennis courts, sea kayaks and surfing. And they'd be sharing it all with onlookers they probably don't mind -- the 150 green turtles that call the island home. Cost: Rates of a beach suite per night starts at €1,100 ($1,580) per person for one night during high season. www.desroches-island.com . 3. Fregate Island Private . Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 4/10 . Before word got out that the couple had chosen North Island, most thought they had gone for Fregate Island Private. With only 17 villas, Fregate is almost as exclusive as North Island. Non-residents are banned from visiting the island. The island is fringed by seven beaches, one of which is a hawksbill turtle nesting ground. Their spa, perched on top of a cliff, uses oils and pastes made from island-grown ingredients. The island's vigorous conservation programs should impress the eco-minded prince. Almost 80 percent of Fregate Island's surface area has been restored to its original flora and fauna. The island also claims to have rejuvenated the populations of Seychelles Magpie Robins, Seychelles Whiteye, Aldabra Giant Tortoises, Seychelles Terrapins on the island. Conservation efforts continue today. Cost: Rates for a one bedroom villa starts at €2,950 ($4,230) per person per night during high season. www.fregate.com . 4. MAIA Seychelles . Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 2/10 . Since MAIA Seychelles opened in 2006, it's been subjected to a lot of press -- perhaps too much press for the low-key-loving newlyweds. The resort continues to feature on hot travel lists in publications around the globe, the latest being the Conde Nast Traveller Gold List 2011. Here's why: it's regarded by some as the first top-notch resort to appear on the main island of Mahé, its native Seychellois cooks meals with the wow factor (bat curry, anyone?), and its La Prairie spa is regarded by Tatler as ""the most spoiling set-up in Seychelles."" Its 4.8-hectare garden was named the best in Africa in 2008. The only reason the resort is not flooded with rubbernecks is because it only has 30 villas, dispersed over a 12-hectare hill top. Each member of staff is trained in yoga and meditation to deal with hissy fits from diva customers. That said, given Mahé houses 90 percent of the country's population, the resort is probably not secluded enough for the royal couple. Rates: Villa rentals start at €1,590 ($2,280). www.maia.com.sc . 5. Cousine Island . Likelihood of a Will and Kate honeymoon: 1/10 . Cousine Island probably has the last word in exclusivity in Seychelles. The tiny island, situated 1,600 kilometers from Kenya, only has four villas. It's only accessible by helicopter, and hotel management encourages guests to rent out the whole 25-hectare island. Guests are encouraged to volunteer in the resort's conservation projects, from tree-planting to monitoring endangered sea turtles. Endemic plants take up 95 percent of the island's vegetation. With carbon footprint kept to such a minimum, it's little wonder that the resort frequently wins green tourism awards. It also has the standard facilities that its competitors offer, including a spa, deep sea fishing and a myriad of water sports. But it's not quite as opulent as some of the other resorts available to the couple, so we have this one down as an 'if all others fail' entry. Cost: Individual Villa rental costs €1,200 ($1,720) per night, and the entire island can be rented out for €4,500. www.cousineisland.com . © 2011 Cable News Network Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The creator of the ""Walking Dead"" television series accuses AMC of cheating him out of millions of dollars in profits from the zombie hit. AMC, which produces the series, allegedly charged its own cable network an ""artificially low"" license fee to carry the show, according to a lawsuit filed by Frank Darabont Tuesday. ""The sole goal of this sham transaction is to enhance the profits of the parent company by minimizing the revenues that go into the 'pool' of funds for the show's profit participants,"" the complaint said. Frank Darabont worked for years to develop the television series from Robert Kirkman's comic book series, the lawsuit said. It became a ""monumental hit"" for AMC when it debuted in 2010, it said. ""Despite four seasons of unprecedented programming success and profitability for defendants, Darabont has not received and may never receive one dollar in profits for developing the series,"" the suit said. Darabont, who wrote, directed and produced the first season, was fired by AMC during the second season. The lawsuit contends he was replaced as the showrunner so that AMC could avoid negotiating a new deal with him. AMC and its lawyers did not immediately respond to the court filing. Darabont's complaint points to the difference between the fee AMC charges its own company for each ""Walking Dead"" episode compared to the license fee paid to a third party for the AMC series ""Mad Men"" as evidence of the company's ""improper and abusive practice of 'self-dealing.'"" The ""Mad Men"" production company gets $3 million per episode from AMC, while the fee is just $1.45 million per ""Walking Dead"" episode. The drama about a 1960s New York ad agency draws just 25% of the audience that the series about the survivors of a zombie apocalypse gets, the lawsuit said. Darabont and CAA -- the Hollywood talent agency that helped him pitch the show to AMC -- have been deprived of ""tens of millions of dollars of profits from the series,"" the suit said. The contract provides that they get a total of 20% of the ""Modified Adjusted Gross Receipts,"" which is a pool of all the money brought in by the production with the production costs subtracted. ""License fees can be manipulated, however, when the entity producing the show and the entity broadcasting it are controlled by the same parent company, or where the network owns and/or controls the production company,"" the complaint said. After two years, the accounting claimed a $55 million deficit in the pool, the lawsuit said. AMC paid itself nearly $49 million in license fees, but production costs totaled $104.5 million, the suit said. The deficit grows with each season, it said. CNN first learned of the story from Twitter. CNN's Henry Hanks contributed to this report.","""Walking Dead"" creator hasn't gotten ""one dollar in profits,"" his lawsuit says .

"London, England (CNN) -- On Sunday Pope Benedict XVI will conduct an open-air beatification Mass for the English cardinal John Henry Newman. The Mass at Birmingham's Cofton Park is the centerpiece of his UK visit, yet the majority of British people know little about the cardinal or the significant role he played in the spread of Catholicism. Who is Cardinal Newman and why is he being beatified? Born John Henry Newman in 1801, he was an English priest who converted to Catholicism and was eventually made a cardinal by Rome. He headed a movement of theologians to bring the Anglican Church back to its papal roots and was a famous author in Victorian Britain. Pope Benedict XVI is thought to be a long-time fan of his writings. This is not the reason for his beatification, however. The Vatican's decision follows a long investigation into a supposed miracle that a deacon in Boston claimed to have experienced after offering a prayer to Newman. Why is Pope Benedict such a fan? Cardinal Newman is seen by Catholics as a great spiritual thinker and reformer. He led a movement of Anglicans, known as the Oxford Movement, whose aim was to return the Church of England to its Catholic roots. He converted at the age of 44, and was made a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. His most well-known work, the Apologia, was a memoir of his spiritual journey and is considered by critics as one of the great autobiographies of its time. His writings won him popularity and critical success -- the Irish writer James Joyce called him ""the greatest of English prose writers."" Benedict meanwhile delivered a paper on Newman 25 years ago comparing him with Socrates and Thomas More, an English statesman who was executed by Henry VIII for refusing to recognize the king's legitimacy as the head of the church. What does it mean if someone is beatified? A person is beatified -- or made blessed -- only after it has been proved that a miracle can be attributed to them following a petition by someone in need. What happened in the case of Cardinal Newman? The petition came from a deacon in Boston who believes that the dead priest cured him from crippling back pain. Doctors told Jack Sullivan in 2000 he would have to quit his religious studies to undergo surgery. He was watching a television show about Cardinal Newman and at the end there was an appeal asking anyone who had prayed to the cardinal and experienced a miracle to get in touch. Sullivan offered a prayer asking Newman to help him walk again so that he could return to his studies. The next day he says the pain had gone. After investigating the deacon's petition over several years, the Vatican decided it was valid. How does the Vatican judge who should be a saint? A person who is beatified is given the title ""Blessed."" It is one of the steps in the canonization process by which someone is eventually recognized as a saint. In order for this to happen, a second miracle must be recorded and verified. There is also a long investigation headed by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Throughout, a Vatican official called the ""general promoter of the faith,"" or devil's advocate, raises objections and doubts which must be resolved by the other priests. As part of the canonization, the Church sometimes even digs up the remains of the candidate. For example, the body of Pope John XXIII, who died in 1963, was exhumed when he was beatified. According to the Vatican, the body was found to be unusually well preserved.","The Pope is in Britain for the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman .

"(CNN) -- Angela Stokes had never been overweight as a child. Angela Stokes, 30, lost 160 pounds in two years after she adopted a raw-vegan diet. She now weighs 138 pounds. But she steadily started gaining weight as a teenager because of an under-active thyroid gland. By the time she graduated from college her weight had ballooned and she wore a U.K. dress size 26-28. ""I was 300 pounds, very unwell, very miserable,"" recalls Stokes. ""I ate junk food all the time. I was very closed down emotionally. I had no interest in dieting; I just wanted to eat all the time ... that was like my comfort in life."" At the time, she says she was so ""emotionally shut down"" she refused to talk to anyone about what was happening. The weight was also taking a physical toll on her health and she frequently battled infections and illness. Stokes says living her everyday life became a challenge. ""My mobility was quite restricted ... I was unwilling to participate in things from cutting my toenails to going on a walk with my friends,"" remembered Stokes. ""I tried to give this impression that I felt fine about everything, but inside I was in a lot of pain a lot of the time."" Two summers after she reached her heaviest weight, Stokes was working at a greenhouse in Iceland, when a friend lent her a copy of a book about the health benefits of eating raw foods. Stokes, who had never been interested in diets, says she was completely ""absorbed"" by the approach. She started eating raw the very next day.  ""Everything in my life completely shifted. It was like a light bulb moment to be like ... 'this is what I was waiting for to reclaim my health,' "" said Stokes.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta report on Angela Stokes' raw diet » . She went cold turkey or ""cold cucumber,"" as Stokes often jokes. She stopped eating meat, animal products and processed foods and instead switched to a diet that consisted of uncooked and unprocessed vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. ""To me, the thing with raw food is that it just makes sense. It's simple and natural, eating food straight from the earth. There's no rocket science, no mystery,"" said Stokes. ""Once you understand the simple principle that no other animal in the wild eats cooked or processed foods. That's it."" The raw food diet completely transformed her life, she says. Within the first month of going raw, she had her first boyfriend in more than five years. In just two years, she had lost 160 pounds and has experienced dramatic improvements emotionally, physically and socially and is ""happier than I've ever been."" Andrea Giancoli, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, says everyone could stand to eat more fruits and vegetables. ""We all need to be moving towards a more plant-based diet,"" Giancoli said. ""There are more pitfalls to a typical American diet with all of the processed foods and focus on meat than there are to a plant-based diet."" Is it healthier to eat uncooked vegetables? Not necessarily. ""The raw diet, specifically, the philosophy behind it is scientifically incorrect,"" Giancoli said. ""Raw foodists believe that cooking food destroys enzymes that are essential for the body. While that's true, so does the gastric acid or juice in your stomach. ""So those enzymes are broken down anyway in your gastro-intestinal tract."" Giancoli believes there's a nutritional downside to a vegetarian diet. People who eat no animal foods run the risk of nutritional deficiencies such as a lack of vitamin B-12, iron and zinc and the powerful Omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, she said. Giancoli recommends people meet with a dietitian to develop a balanced eating plan before they embark on a raw food diet. Stokes, who now weighs 138 pounds, has kept the weight off for four years and authored several books on ""raw foodism"" lifestyle. What tips does she have for people considering a raw vegan lifestyle? First, start slowly. ""I recommend people start out being at least 50 percent raw and go from there,"" advises Stokes. ""Maybe it ends up at some point you are completely raw, maybe not. As long as the majority of the stuff or at least 50 percent is fresh raw food ... then you're tipping the balance in your favor."" Stokes also advises people to start eating things they like such as peaches, plums or spinach and then slowly incorporate more fresh raw foods. She admits the lifestyle can be socially challenging and she encourages people to connect with other ""raw foodists."" ""It's great to get support. If you look on the Internet and around you, you may find pot lucks,"" said Stokes. ""Read books to inspire you to keep going on this journey.""

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- If the first episode of ""Currency Wars"" focused on pressure the U.S., Europe and emerging economies heaped on China for artificially keeping the value of its yuan low, the sequel could be called: ""Currency Wars: The Fed Strikes Back."" At least that is how it's playing abroad. At the G-20 summit in Seoul, Korea, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meet in Yokohama, Japan, U.S. President Barack Obama finds himself on the defensive after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision last week to pump $600 billion into the economy. That was brought into sharp focus Thursday when South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, host of the G-20 summit, was asked at a press conference about the impact of the Fed's decision. ""I think that kind of question should be asked to me when President Obama is not standing right next to me,"" he joked. The Fed move was the latest volley in the topsy-turvy trade among global currencies. The euro started the year at $1.44, did a mid-year swan dive to $1.19, and is now back to $1.38. The Australian dollar hit parity with the U.S. dollar last week for the first time since Sydney floated the currency in 1983. Japan's economy was among those hardest hit by the financial crisis, yet the yen is trading at 15-year record highs. World Bank President Robert Zoellick jumped into the fray on Monday, suggesting in a Financial Times commentary a limited return to the gold standard to provide stability to the markets. By Wednesday, he had backpedaled on that statement. So what's going on? Analysts say there is a sea change happening in the balance of world wealth in the wake of the financial crisis, churning large waves that are being felt in the currency markets. Interactive: The new global economy . ""To me the big subject that is just starting to be talked about now (is) ... how does the whole global currency system work?"" said Garry Evans, global head of equity strategy for HSBC. ""The idea of floating currencies and free capital flows and no gold standard, that's a fairly recent development that only came in 1971 with (the) Richard Nixon doctrine,"" Evans said. ""That's not how the world was run in most of the last 200 years, and that whole area is going to get re-thought."" Here are the key factors at play this week in the current currency conflict. QE2 = Printing greenbacks . They don't call it 'quantitative' easing for nothing. The Fed announcement last week to increase the quantity of dollars sloshing through the global economy by $600 billion was the second round of quantitative easing since the financial crisis, (nicknamed 'QE2'). The policy aims to lower interest rates and encourage consumer spending, by pumping more cash into the economy, which the Fed hopes will boost American consumption and generate more jobs. The by-product of that move: As more dollars hit the market, the value of the dollar decreases. Hence the outcry from countries that side with the U.S. against Chinese monetary policy, because the Fed's move can be seen as a way to artificially lower the value of the dollar. ""Whether that was the intent, the Fed certainly knew that would be the outcome,"" said Avinash Persaud, chairman of Intelligence Capital and an advisor to several G-20 government boards. More dollars + emerging economies = bad? QE2 also means emerging economies are bracing for an influx of dollars, and taking measures to guard against it. Why is the money headed to emerging markets, and why are developing nations worried about it? The money will inevitably flow into emerging economies like Brazil and India because they have the largest growth rate, therefore the largest possible return on investment. World underdogs take the lead . ""If it was 1997, they would say,`Great!'"" to the large influx of dollars, said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Belgium. In 1997, developing economies in Asia were being battered by the Asian Financial Crisis. ""But right now they have enough capital, have enough employment. Moreover, when the capital arrives, the exchange rate (of the local currency) will strengthen,"" Gros said. ""One thing (emerging economies) have learned from the Chinese: Sustainable, high growth rates requires you to export a lot."" If the local currency goes up against the U.S. dollar, the export industry will be hurt. That's why countries from India to Brazil have implemented new controls to slow the influx of cash expected from QE2. The blank check of the U.S. The U.S. economy has an incredible fringe benefit it alone enjoys: The U.S. dollar is the reserve currency of choice among foreign nations. China alone sits on $2.7 trillion in its foreign currency reserves. ""It's like writing a check that nobody cashes,"" Persaud said. ""Other countries say, `I like this check, I'm keeping it, one day I may need to cash it',"" Persaud said. ""But your bank account remains the same, so what do you do? You keep on writing checks."" Being the reserve foreign currency of the world allows the U.S. to borrow money at very low interest. This also presents a problem for the U.S. -- it makes erasing its trade imbalance impossible, analysts say. ""I'm slightly oversimplifying it, but by definition, the U.S. has to export more than it imports,"" said Evans of HSBC. ""Something like 70 percent of global reserves are in U.S. dollars. That means all those countries need to export more than they import to the U.S., because they need to put all those dollars in their reserves."" China's force field . There has been a lot of pressure placed on China regarding its peg to the U.S. dollar --- meaning it only allows the currency to appreciate in small doses relative to the dollar. Critics argue that places an unfair advantage that keeps the price of Chinese products artificially low. China quit allowing its currency to appreciate after the financial crisis in 2008, but it began to move again in June --- although only rising about 2 percent. Critics argue it should be 30 percent higher or more. What is currency manipulation, anyhow? But another factor has shielded the Chinese monetary system. Whereas U.S. dollars are stacked as reserves in nations around the world, the Chinese yuan is not allowed to leave China through use of capital controls. ""If you're not a Chinese resident, you're not allowed to buy yuan, yuan bonds or have a Chinese bank account,"" Gros said. ""It's the only major economy with capital controls."" That allows China to have tight control on the value of its currency. What's next? The U.S. came to Seoul with the hopes of setting hard targets for trade deficits and trade surpluses that would, in turn, limit when nations can allow their currency to appreciate or depreciate. So far, that looks unlikely. The strongest opposition against setting targets has come not from China, but the Europeans, especially Germany, said Domenico Lombardi, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Fiddling around with exchange rates is papering over the real problems,"" said Persaud, who used to be a currency trader. For China, the larger issue is switching over from an export-led economy to a domestically driven one. For the U.S., it's jumpstarting growth and scaling back its growing national debt. The direction of these two macroeconomic trends, analysts say, will determine the future skirmishes or peace on the currency battlefield. ""In the long run, China needs to have an open financial system,"" Lombardi said. ""My fear is that the 21st century will be for America what the 20th century was like for England, when the pound was the world's largest reserve currency,"" Persaud said. ""Losing it is hell, because all those checks you've written? People start cashing them.""","A sea change in global wealth is churning waves in currency markets .

As a global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar also perpetuates trade imbalances .

"(EW.com) -- Next week's episode of Parks and Recreation is going to have a VIP: the VP. Joe Biden — yes, the very guy who was re-elected Vice President of the United States — will guest-star in the Nov. 15 installment of Parks and Recreation, EW has learned. His cameo occurs at the beginning of the episode, in which former Congressional campaign manager Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) takes fiancée/City Councilwoman Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), to the White House to meet America's No. 2, who has long been her No. 1 crush. (As Leslie once noted, her ideal man has ""the brains of George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden."") Parks scored camera time with Biden in July when the show traveled to Washington, D.C. to film its season 5 premiere, which featured appearances by Senators Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, and John McCain. How big of a casting coup was Biden for NBC's small-town government comedy? ""Given that Eleanor Roosevelt and Bella Abzug are no longer with us, this is probably no. 1,"" quips executive producer Michael Schur. ""[Leslie] has a lot of female heroes that cross party lines. She has a lot of social figures that she considers heroes, but the funniest hero is Joe Biden. There's an episode last season where she says, 'Joe Biden is on my celebrity sex list — well, he is my celebrity sex list'... It was amazing to have her meet Olympia Snowe and Barbara Boxer because that meant something to her politically. But this transcends that. She's meeting the man that she's in love with on some deep level. It was a bigger deal to us in some ways that she meet Joe Biden than it was that she meet Barack Obama."" (Obama, by the way, has revealed that he watches Parks with his family, by the way. ""It's a very amazing and weird thing to find out that the President watches your show,"" marvels Schur.) Once the producers committed to shooting an episode in D.C., the process of landing Biden was ""so much less difficult than we ever possibly imagined,"" says Schur, noting: ""His staff really loves the show, and he apparently had watched the show with his family and his family liked it... The hardest part was keeping it secret for so long because there's all these FEC rules and equal-time rules. We couldn't air it before the election because it was the equivalent of a campaign contribution to advertise for one candidate."" The Biden-Knope summit, a surprise ""engagement present"" from Ben, lasts less than a minute and was written in a manner that would work regardless of the election's outcome. ""We did not in any way want the moment to be a political issue — we treated it in the writing and the execution like our main character was meeting her hero,"" says Schur. (He notes that the writers did pen an addendum to the scene in the event of an Obama-Biden loss or a ""weird Florida disaster tie."") The meeting takes place in the Vice President's Ceremonial Office in the White House-adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with Biden flanked by his real-life staff. ""They have a conversation where she does what you would imagine Leslie Knope would do when meeting Joe Biden, which is she loses control of herself a little bit,"" hints Schur. ""She gets really giggly and goofy around him."" When the Parks crew set up in his office to shoot the scene, Biden happened to be tied up in a meeting with... President Barack Obama. Then ""Obama got on Marine One and flew away, and Biden walked across the executive building and we shot the scene,"" says Schur. ""It was really cool: You go this way and get on a helicopter that will take you to some incredibly important thing, and you come this way and shoot a scene with Amy Poehler."" The Veep handled his scene like a pro, even ad-libbing a response to a crazy Leslie retort that wound up in the final cut of the episode. ""He was very nice and charming,"" reports Schur. ""He was clearly a big fan of Amy. It was the day the Emmy nominations came out and when he walked through the door he congratulated her on her Emmy nomination... He said some very nice things about the show and talked about how the pro-public service message was meaningful."" While Schur & co. were thrilled to venture onto hallowed Washington ground, they aren't plotting the next great political cameo right now: ""Since the beginning of the show, Joe Biden has been the No. 1 guy, so in terms of her achievements or personal milestones we'll have to go in a different direction,"" he says. ""She'll have to get her thrills elsewhere."" See original story at EW.com. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly . © 2011 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc.

"New York (CNN) -- The imam at the center of an ugly controversy over an Islamic center near New York's ground zero broke his silence Tuesday, just hours after a broad coalition of Christian, Jewish and Islamic leaders denounced what they described as a rising tide of anti-Muslim bigotry across the United States. ""I have been struck by how the controversy has riveted the attention of Americans, as well as nearly everyone I met in my travels,"" said Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf in an editorial published online by The New York Times Tuesday night. Read New York Times editorial . ""We have all been awed by how inflamed and emotional the issue of the proposed community center has become,"" wrote Rauf, who has just returned from a State Department-sponsored Middle East trip to promote U.S.-Muslim relations. ""The level of attention reflects the degree to which people care about the very American values under debate: recognition of the rights of others, tolerance and freedom of worship."" The imam was clear about his intentions. ""We are proceeding with the community center, Cordoba House. More important, we are doing so with the support of the downtown community, government at all levels and leaders from across the religious spectrum, who will be our partners. I am convinced that it is the right thing to do for many reasons,"" he wrote. Opponents of the plan to build the center say it is too close to the site of the terror attacks and is an affront to the memory of those who died in the al Qaeda strike. Backers cite, among other things, First Amendment rights and the need to express religious tolerance. Rauf described the center to be built two blocks from the former site of the World Trade Center towers -- destroyed by terrorist-hijacked commercial jets on September 11, 2001 -- as a ""shared space for community activities, like a swimming pool, classrooms and a play space for children."" ""There will be separate prayer spaces for Muslims, Christians, Jews and men and women of other faiths,"" he wrote. ""The center will also include a multifaith memorial dedicated to victims of the Sept. 11 attacks."" ""I am very sensitive to the feelings of the families of victims of 9/11, as are my fellow leaders of many faiths. We will accordingly seek the support of those families, and the support of our vibrant neighborhood, as we consider the ultimate plans for the community center. Our objective has always been to make this a center for unification and healing."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spoke on Tuesday about the plan and criticized politicians he claims are using the issue for political gain ahead of midterm elections in November. ""This is a political thing that all came up in two months -- and it's going to go away on November 4th,"" he said. Various faith leaders in recent weeks have expressed concerns about hate crimes against American Muslims in the run-up to this weekend's anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which coincide with the holiday of Eid-al-Fitr, marking the conclusion of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Worry over what some observers have termed ""Islamophobia"" has also been heightened by a Gainesville, Florida, church's plan to burn copies of the Quran on Saturday, the ninth anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington. Earlier Tuesday, a broad coalition of faith leaders gathered in Washington, where they met with Attorney General Eric Holder to discuss their concerns. ""To quote the attorney general, he called the Gainesville planned burning of Qurans 'idiotic and dangerous,'"" said Farhana Khera, president of Muslim Advocates, soon after meeting with Holder. ""While it may not be a violation of the law -- it may be an act of free speech -- it certainly violates our sense of decency,"" she added about the Florida event. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton echoed those thoughts later when she spoke at a dinner celebration of Iftar, the breaking the daily fast during Ramadan. ""I am heartened by the clear, unequivocal condemnation of this disrespectful, disgraceful act that has come from American religious leaders of all faiths ... as well as secular U.S. leaders and opinion makers,"" she said. Separately, founders of the newly formed Interfaith Coalition on Mosques addressed the issue of religious freedom during a news conference at Washington's National Press Club. ""Freedom of religion is a hallmark of this country,"" said Ingrid Mattson, head of the Islamic Society of North America. It is time to decide ""whether we are going to live up to our values."" The coalition released a statement decrying a ""disturbing rise in discrimination against Muslims"" and declaring that the current ""level of hostility, fear mongering and hate speech is unacceptable and un-American."" ""We believe the best way to uphold America's democratic values is to ensure that Muslims can exercise the same religious freedom enjoyed by everyone in America,"" the statement read. Last week, the Council on American-Islamic Relations launched a series of commercials designed to fight what it called growing Islamophobia. One in the series features a Muslim firefighter who was among the first responders on 9/11. Opponents of the New York Islamic center are ""trying to tell the world and tell Americans that Muslims do not belong here. That Muslims are the others, when we are in fact, all Americans,"" said Nahad Awad, executive director of the council. ""They're trying to portray Muslims as foreigners. This is a dangerous repeat of history. If it's allowed, it's going to hurt all of us,"" he said. In a statement on its website, the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, said it plans to mark the anniversary of the 2001 attacks by burning Qurans this weekend ""to warn about the teaching and ideology of Islam, which we do hate as it is hateful."" The pastor of the small church, Terry Jones, has written a book titled ""Islam is of the Devil,"" and the church sells coffee mugs and shirts featuring the phrase. The U.S. commander in Afghanistan on Monday criticized the church's plan, warning the demonstration ""could cause significant problems"" for American troops overseas. ""It could endanger troops and it could endanger the overall effort in Afghanistan,"" Gen. David Petraeus said. Jones told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Tuesday that he is ""taking the general's words"" seriously. We are ""weighing the situation"" and are ""praying about it,"" he said. But it is ""very important that America wakes up,"" he argued. Radical Islam ""must be shown a certain amount of force (and) determination."" The planned event has drawn criticism from Muslims in the United States and overseas, with thousands of Indonesians gathering outside the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Sunday to protest the planned Quran burning. ""Those mainly conservative Christians who respond to their Muslim brothers and sisters -- their fellow Americans -- with anti-Muslim bigotry or hatred, they are openly rejecting... the First Amendment principles of religious liberty which we as evangelical Christians benefit daily,"" said Rev. Richard Cizik, of the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good, at the National Press Club. ""And to those who would exercise derision ... bigotry (and) open rejection of our fellow Americans for their religious faith -- I say shame on you.""","NEW: Hillary Clinton calls Quran-burning event 'disrespectful' and 'disgraceful'

"(CNN) -- Life is good for Elizabeth Smart a decade after surviving a hellish kidnapping, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Smart got married last year and her book ""My Story"" is expected to be a best-seller. ""It couldn't get better than that, right? I've got great dogs. I've got a great family. I mean, I couldn't be happier,"" Smart said in the second installment of her interview, which aired Tuesday on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" The first installment shown Monday detailed the night of June 5, 2002, when Brian David Mitchell dragged her from her family's Salt Lake City home with a knife to her throat, threatening to kill her and her family if she made a noise. Smart, now 25, is a long way from the scared 14-year-old who spent nine months as a captive of a homeless street preacher, who raped her daily, and his wife, Wanda Barzee, who treated her like a slave. ""That happened to me, but I'm so much more than that girl that was kidnapped,"" Smart told Cooper. When Smart testified at Mitchell's federal trial three years ago, it was to help prosecutors convict her kidnapper. But her book is intended to raise awareness of sexual abuse and to help other victims, she said. Elizabeth's story: Nine months of what ifs and near misses . Paralyzed by fear . She had chances to be rescued, but the fear that Mitchell might carry out his threats to kill her and her family paralyzed her, she said. One missed opportunity came when someone told police they saw the missing girl at a Salt Lake City library. When homicide detective Jon Richey approached to investigate, Smart was sitting next to Barzee. ""As soon as the policeman flashed his badge, because he was just dressed as a civilian, she immediately clamped her hand down onto my leg, and in my 14-year-old mind, I just knew that if I did anything or said anything that I would be killed and then they'd go after my family,"" Smart said. ""So, I sat there just praying and hoping and just desperate that he'd recognize me, that somehow he'd save me."" Mitchell refused to let the detective see under the veil that shielded Smart's face, saying it violated their religious beliefs for anyone but the young woman's husband to see her face. ""When he turned around and walked away, being 100% convinced that it wasn't me, I mean, it felt like I was being kidnapped all over again,"" Smart said. ""I mean, it felt like I was being stolen from my family again and being ripped away from my life and my happiness."" Manipulating her kidnappers . Mitchell and Barzee took Smart to San Diego soon after that encounter, but they were also talking about heading to New York or Boston, she said. ""We have to get back to Salt Lake,"" she told Cooper she was thinking. ""There's no way anyone was going to find me if I don't. But there's every reason for them not to want to go back to Salt Lake, every reason in the world for that to be the last place for them to ever go."" She used her own psychological trick to persuade Mitchell, who was so good at manipulating others, to return to Salt Lake City, she said. ""I remember turning around and facing my captors and just telling them, 'I just have this feeling and I know that God would never speak to me, but I know he'll speak to you because you're his servant. You're practically his best friend. Could you please ask him if we're supposed to go back to Salt Lake, because this feeling, it just won't leave me and, this is just crazy coming from me, but if you ask him I know he'll tell you.' And so he did end up asking. And that was how it was decided we'd go back to Salt Lake."" Her rescue . Soon after their return -- on March 12, 2003 -- police officers confronted them outside a Walmart store in Sandy, Utah. ""I remembered all these cars pulled up and then the policemen jumped out of their cars and they came over and surrounded us and started asking questions,"" Smart said. ""And my two captors, they kept giving the answers and the officers started to ask me questions."" She had been prepared by Mitchell with a back story in such cases, she said. ""I started giving those answers, because they were standing right next to me. I was scared. I was petrified."" But her courage grew when the police separated her from Mitchell and Barzee. ""At first, I was still really scared,"" she said. ""I kept giving the answers that I had been told to give, and then finally one of the officers said, 'Well, if you're Elizabeth Smart, your family misses you so much and they love you so much and they have never given up hope on you the entire nine months you're gone. Don't you want to go back home to your family?' And it was just at that point that I felt like, well, no matter what the consequences are, I don't care, I want to go home."" ""So what did you say?"" Cooper asked. ""I told them that I was Elizabeth Smart,"" she said. ""What was that feeling like to say your name? You probably hadn't said your name for a long time,"" Cooper said. ""It was scary because I didn't know if they thought I had done something wrong or if they had thought I had run away,"" she said. ""I didn't know what they were thinking."" One lesson to be learned from her story is that public speculation -- the armchair quarterbacking by people who do not know the facts -- can be hurtful to a victim. ""To have so many people speculate on what happened and what I must be going through, and just so many lies being told,"" she said. ""It was hard. I didn't like it. I don't think anybody likes having people guess at what they're going through. Privacy is so sacred and any time a victim is returned, a survivor is found and rescued, privacy is one of the greatest gifts we can give them because if they decide to share, that's up to them and they will come forward.""

"(CNN) -- Embattled San Diego Mayor Bob Filner and his representatives were in a closed door mediation with representatives from the city on Monday, while volunteers hoping to oust the mayor continued to collect signatures for a possible recall. The session, which began at 10 a.m. PT (1 p.m. ET) was still in progress Monday afternoon, said a source with direct knowledge of the meeting, which included San Diego City Council President Todd Gloria. The source declined to say what exactly was under discussion. The mediation is the first known meeting of its kind between Filner and the city. The session took place the same day Filner supporters held a ""We Will Not Be Silent"" rally outside City Hall. One day earlier, protesters who want the mayor to step down marched on the same spot. ""There is no excuse for abuse, and there is no excuse for you to stay in power,"" attorney Gloria Allred told the crowd. She attended Sunday's rally along with some of the women accusing Filner, including one of her clients, 67-year-old Peggy Shannon. So far, 16 women have come forward to say that Filner acted inappropriately, with accusations ranging from one woman's claim that the mayor gave her ""tush a pat,"" to another's assertion that he ""put in me what I guess now is the famous headlock."" Filner's office has not responded to multiple CNN requests for comment. Last month, he acknowledged he ""failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me"" and that he was ""embarrassed"" by his actions. But he also said he will be vindicated by ""a full presentation of the facts"" and that he would not step down. The outrage is overwhelming. Roughly 81 percent of city residents want him to resign, according to a poll conducted by CNN affiliate KGTV. Another affilaite, KFMB, reported local radio hosts hired skywriters to spell out ""Surrender Bob"" over areas of the city last week. Armed with clipboards and pens, volunteers hit the streets of San Diego over the weekend to begin collecting signatures for a recall effort. They need more than 101,000 signatures by September 26. ""We're going to be everywhere. We're going to be at sporting events. We're going to be at street fairs, arts shows -- you name it, we will be out there,"" Dave McCulloch, an organizer, told KFMB on Sunday. Anti-Filner protesters speak . Filner, 70, was elected mayor in 2012 after 20 years in Congress. His accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director, who called him unfit for office. Shannon was the latest person to accuse Filner. ""Every day that I went to work, I had butterflies in my stomach because I did not know what was going to happen the next time the mayor came by my desk,"" she told reporters last week. ""I have three sons, four grandsons and two great grandsons. As our mayor, you should be -- but are not -- a role model for any of them,"" Shannon said. Filner has rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators. His supporters, which include some labor unions and Latinos, claim Filner is being denied due process, and the recall effort is orchestrated by those who oppose his political agenda. The mayor entered a two-week intensive behavior therapy program July 29, but his attorney, James Payne, said he was able to complete the voluntary program August 10. He was expected to continue with outpatient treatment, Payne said. ""Mayor Filner is taking personal time this week and is unavailable for comment, and we do not have information as to when he will be available for comment,"" said last week's statement from Payne's office, adding that it was not able to comment on the recall effort or other allegations leveled against the mayor. Filner is expected to return to work this week, but Payne did not immediately return a CNN e-mail asking exactly when he would be back in the office. The city attorney's office has said it could seek as a ""last resort"" a restraining order -- saying Filner creates a hostile environment for women -- to prevent him from returning to work, the Los Angeles Times reported. The city attorney's office did not return calls seeking comment. Though the city chief of staff changed the locks on Filner's office, it was to preserve evidence rather than to keep him out, the city attorney's office has said. CNN's Kyung Lah, Matt Smith and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","City Council president, Mayor Bob Filner, others in mediation meeting, source says .

"(CNN) -- Naledi means ""star"" in Tswana, one of the languages spoken in Botswana. So when Kemi Kalikawe gave her lifestyle store that name, she decided to add a sparkle to her business. ""My brand is Africa revamped,"" she says. ""Africa getting a modern twist and just bringing the West and Africa together and marrying them into something beautiful."" Kalikawe grew up in Botswana, as the name of her store suggests, but her business is in the thumping heart of Tanzania's biggest city, Dar es Salaam. Funky fabrics . Shoppers who visit her store find jewelry, sandals and vibrantly-colored outfits on the shelves. Some of Kalikawe's garments even use indigenous Tanzanian fabrics like the Khanga and Kitenge. ""I make dresses, I cater mostly for women,"" Kalikawe explains, ""and I do jewelry and also sandals, which have all got an influence of African fabrics."" Whilst taking a tour of the store, Kalikawe points out one her favorite dresses, ""I love it because it defies what Tanzanians think of the Tanzanian Kitenge, which is funky, it's stylish, and it can be worn anywhere."" With such a variety of designs, fabrics and patterns on display it's clear that Kalikawe's work is her passion. ""Sometimes I see a fabric and it just speaks to me,"" she says. ""So I take that and start thinking of what I can do to bring out its beauty."" Career change . As a child, Kalikawe dreamed of working in the design industry, but she ended up studying marketing in England. She soon realized she wasn't cut out for the advertising world and moved to Kenya to study interior design. ""The school that I was going to also had fashion design. I ended up wanting to find ways of promoting fashion designers and so I put on a show for them,"" she explains. ""When I came back to Tanzania, I worked with the British Council... and my job was to find underground fashion talent and put them on the stage. That's how I ended up making my own dresses... and the people that would come to the show loved my clothes."" That background is reflected in her store, where she promotes other entrepreneurs alongside her own creations. ""I choose to include other designers because there isn't particularly a space where designers can showcase their work,"" Kalikawe says. ""It's expensive to open your own store. So this was something that gave me that chance to promote other designers plus sell my own things,"" she adds. Like Kalikawe, many women in Africa are capitalizing on their entrepreneurial skills. In fact, the continent leads the world in the number of women starting businesses, with almost equal levels of male and female entrepreneurs. Overall, Africa has a higher proportion of female entrepreneurs compared to other regions, with Nigeria and Zambia (both 40.7%) topping the charts. The stats reveal that countries like the United States (10.4%), the UK (5.5%), and France (3.1%) have a less equal business landscape. Overcoming obstacles . Over its six year lifespan, Nalendi Lifestyle has established a reputation and a steady stream of clients. But it wasn't always so easy for Kalikawe. ""I had to find a place that was close to my customers, so I shopped around for different places where I could share with somebody who had an existing space and they were not using it. I had to do a lot of convincing when I finally got the space that I am in now,"" she remembers. But getting a physical presence wasn't the only obstacle Kalikawe had to overcome. She says that creating advertising and getting people to know that her shop was there took time. ""It's lucky that I am right by the road, so that way when people pass by I put mannequins outside with my dresses."" While she has faced difficulties, Kalikawe has no regrets; ""I totally love what I do,"" she says. ""From a kid, I've always known I was going to work in the industry; in design industry somehow. I am so fortunate that I am actually doing what I love to do."" Read this: Shunning medicine for jewelry . Read this: Luxury shoes put sparkle in your ste .

"(CNN) -- Giants players Jacquian Williams and Devin Thomas made sportsmanship a prime topic for discussion when they said after their NFC championship win against the 49ers that they targeted punt returner Kyle Williams, who has suffered four concussions. Jacquian Williams said of Kyle Williams during a locker room interview: ""We knew he had four concussions, so that was our biggest thing, to take him out of the game."" Thomas told the Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey, that Kyle Williams was a target because ""he's had a lot of concussions. We were just like, 'We gotta put a hit on that guy.' ... "" The significance of these comments is compounded by the fact that concussions, and the health and safety issues related to them, have become a main concern of the National Football League and its players. Former players are suing the NFL over concussion issues and will appear in court this week. Major rule changes and an elaborate fine system have been implemented to protect players. Former players suffer psychologically and neurologically, and we now know it's because of concussions and subconcussive blows to the head. Boast of targeting punt returner raises questions about concussions . Unfortunately, the words of these two young men aren't the first examples of dishonorable behavior and the ignoble mentality that exist in sports, nor will they be the last. It's time, however, for everyone to realize how dysfunctional and unnecessary this type of behavior is. I know all too well that there are some contemptible and devious minds who intend to ""take players out."" In my nine-year NFL career, knees were cut, elbows were thrown, helmets were used as missiles, ankles were twisted, and I was even bitten! All of these acts were instigated by an insatiable desire to taste victory, even if it meant disabling the opposition to do so. During the weekly scouting report, there was always a special presentation about which players on the opposing team had injuries. The message was obvious. We knew exactly who was hurting and where. If an ankle was injured, we knew which one. If it was a rib, we knew which side of the body it was on. ""Take him out of the game."" That was the MO. Sad, I know, but in the sports world, c'est la vie. Some say football is a violent game and all the rule changes to protect players are making the game soft. They say go play a different sport if you can't take the big hits. I say to all the uneducated players, wannabe players, couch potatoes and pundits in suits chirping from cozy air-conditioned rooms, many of whom have never played the game: This doesn't affect you. Your long-term health isn't at risk, nor will your kids risk losing you prematurely to a death caused by a psychological and neurological disorder acquired from repetitive head trauma. Do you want to hear something that is really scary? According to the NFL Players Association, the average life expectancy of an NFL player is 58 years. That is considerably lower then the 76-year life expectancy of the average American. Knowing this, should we not attempt to play the game fairly and with respect for our fellow man? Four-time Pro Bowl safety Dave Duerson committed suicide last February. He killed himself with a gunshot to the chest instead of the head, presumably so that his brain could be examined by Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. The New York Times reported that Duerson also sent text messages to family members asking ""that his brain be examined for chronic traumatic encephalopathy,"" a condition linked to more than a dozen deceased NFL players. Researchers said his brain had developed the same trauma-induced disease recently found in other deceased players. The number of retired NFL players found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy is growing. Duerson, who complained to his family of his deteriorating mental state during his final months, is the first to act upon his suspicion of having the disease. So, was it wrong for the Giants players to target a man's head when they knew he had already suffered four documented concussions? I'd say yes. Those who display this type of behavior and intent must be reprimanded and punished. Players in the NFL are now fined for helmet-to-helmet contact, so it makes sense that targeting someone who has suffered four concussions and having the intent to ""take him out of the game"" would be fineable, also. In sports, or business, people always look for a competitive edge. Whether that edge is physical, mental or psychological, the great ones always seek it. It's what separates the mighty from the mundane. It's why some people get up early to put in work while others continue to sleep. It's why some people stay in the gym, at the office, or study for an exam while everyone else goes home. There is such a thing, however, as taking it too far. When getting the upper hand causes another person bodily harm, it has gone too far. Not only are you threatening someone's livelihood, you're threatening their long-term health, their life. Even though the rules may not be written yet, they should be understood. I hope that Jacquian Williams and Devin Thomas were just carried away by the moment. My hope is that they now realize that the extent and potential outcomes of their intentions are frightening. They have tremendous talent and opportunity, and there is no reason for them to harm others on their journey to success. I wish them nothing but the best. Those two men, and all of us, are more powerful than we know. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Coy Wire.","NFL veteran says Giants players wrong if they targeted a 49er who has had concussions .
Coy Wire: I know from my playing days that opponents often target an injured player .

"(CNN) -- A fresh round of clues arrived this week from two Republican lawmakers who are regularly asked about their desire to pursue their party's nomination in 2016. While each cited different reasons, both Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas say they're now more interested in running. Rubio says the current Senate gridlock is limiting his ability to advocate for the kind of policies he sees as critical for moving America forward and that the White House might be a better place for that. ""I'll have to make a decision in 2016 either way, because I'm up for re-election in the Senate. And for me it's not going to be about the position, it's going to be about where can I best advocate for a 21st century reform agenda that allows us to usher in another American century,"" Rubio told CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""The decision I have to make is can I best do that as a senator, or can I best do that as running and hopefully winning a presidency,"" he said. ""And that's a question I'll have more clarity on after this mid-term, because I can promise you this: the one place where I will not be able to do that from is a Senate that is still run by [Majority Leader] Harry Reid that allows no votes on anything of substance or importance."" Cruz, however, says that in addition to midterm election outcomes, events outside of Washington are playing into his decision. In an interview with ABC News, Cruz again denounced President Barack Obama's foreign policy and said he thinks voters want the United States to play a more prominent role in world affairs. ""The American people in 2014 and also November 2016 are going to be looking for leaders who want to work to restore America's leadership in the world,"" Cruz said. One factor Cruz said is impacting his decision to seek higher office: the debate in the Republican Party on how deeply the United States should be enmeshed in global crises. ""It increases my interest in doing everything I can to change the direction we're on,"" Cruz said. On some issues, Paul and Christie sound a lot alike . CNN's Leigh Ann Caldwell contributed to this report.","Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz both say they're now more interested in running for President .

"(CNN) -- American football -- particularly at the NFL level -- requires stamina, which is usually in short supply when you're hungry. Husain Abdullah, a safety for the Kansas City Chiefs, doesn't let an empty stomach ruin his game. A devout Muslim, he observes Ramadan, which means adhering to a month without food or water during daylight hours. Far from hurting his performance, Abdullah says the act of fasting actually enhances his game. ""When you're on that spiritual level, it actually kind of transforms you into being better, and playing better,"" he says. ""I've had some of my best performances while fasting."" It's not the first time religion has played a role in his professional decisions. When he graduated from Washington State University, he landed his dream gig: backup for the Minnesota Vikings. Three years later, he quit the team travel to go on the hajj -- the pilgrimage to Mecca that all Muslims are expected to make during their lifetimes. ""This is what I needed to see in terms of advancing my level of faith in Islam,"" he says. ""Everybody's coming to Mecca to do the same thing. Everybody's asking for forgiveness. Everybody's asking for guidance."" When he's on the field, Abdullah says he can feel a higher power guiding him. ""When we make a play, we're not going to say I did that. We're going to thank God,"" he says. Though his faith is more of a personal journey, there are some who take offense. ""People say it shouldn't be on the field,"" he admits. ""But you can't get away from it. If someone believes in God, you can't get away from it.""","American football star Husain Abdullah says his Muslim faith is important to him .

"London, England (CNN) -- Last week, Global Connections asked you to find links between Panama and the United Arab Emirates. Once again you responded in your hundreds. Here are some of the connections you made. ""Amar"" and ""Kurt"" wrote in to say both countries are large financial centers, while Angelo Pereira from Costa Rica got in touch via iReport to say that both countries have free trade economic areas. CNN's Becky Anderson explored these business connections with Panama's vice minister of foreign trade, Jose Domingo Arias and Oussama El Omari from the UAE's Free Trade Zone Authority. Becky also spoke with Tom Hall, Lonely Planet's travel editor this week to find out what connections he could find between the two. He plumped for a bird connection as both countries feature one on their national flags - the UAE has a falcon. Panama, a harpy eagle. ""Walter Hilliger,"" ""Eapen Mathew"" contacted CNN via the blog and Imad Wake from Lebanon sent in an iReport to say that both countries are transport hubs. Panama's famous canal links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the UAE is home to the Jebel Ali port -- the biggest in the Middle East and the largest man-made harbor in the world. Dubai is well known for its audacious building program, building a new skyline almost from scratch. But Global Connections viewer Fahima Karmostaji, who lives in Dubai, says that Panama also has many construction projects underway. Two buildings in particular share an uncanny resemblance as Panamanian viewer, Asia Sher pointed out. Panama City's Trump Ocean Club, which is currently being built, has a similar sail shape to Dubai's Burj Al Arab tower. It was a link that students at the Balboa Academy in Panama City also made in their video of connections which they posted on YouTube. We also spoke to the young Arab fashion designer Khalid AlQasimi, whose designs draw from his upbringing in the Middle East. As well as being a trade hub, we also learned from Javier Mateo-Vega at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute that Panama is a ""hub of biodiversity."" Keep those comments coming in and make sure you join in with our next connections challenge. This week we're looking for links between Germany and India.

"(CNN) -- Once again, a big thank you to everyone who took the time to share their links between India and Germany. We had hundreds of responses and are highlighting some of the best here. We started the week by speaking to Craig Glenday , editor-in-chief of the Guinness Book of World Records. He told CNN's Becky Anderson that the two countries have a rivalry of sorts when it comes to world records. It seems that every time a German sets a record, an Indian will smash it. For instance, the largest pen ever made, a record held by a German, was beaten within a year by an Indian. ""Himanshu"" pointed out a linguistic connection between the two. German and Sanskrit have several similarities, and the grammar of both languages is amazingly similar. ""Sudheer"" noted that many German tourists travel to India to learn more about practicing the ancient holistic medicine known as Ayurveda. We also heard some personal stories. Two families -- one in Germany, the other in India -- got in touch with us to explain their connection via student exchange. A woman in the United States whose family emigrated from India wrote in to say that she married a man whose family emigrated to the United States from Germany. Now she can't live without sauerkraut and he loves the Indian dish sambhar, she said. Kurt Hammel pointed out another food-related link. Many German foods are flavored with spices that originally came from India. What good would bratwurst be without mace and nutmeg? What would strudel be without sugar and cinnamon? he noted. There were also connections made in entertainment. We weren't too surprised to hear that many Germans are fans of Bollywood. Daniel Santos, a Brazilian living in Germany, said many German students love Indian movies and that there are many Bollywood dance schools there. Sumanth Venkatesh from Bangalore found an automotive connection between the two countries. Volkswagen, which means the ""People's Car,"" was originally made so ordinary Germans could afford cars. Sumanth said that's the same thing India's Tata Motors is trying to do. We also spoke to award-winning author Anita Desai. Born to a Bengali father and German mother, Desai is a connection of sorts herself. She told us that even though she lives in the United States now, she carries India with her wherever she goes. We love your comments so please keep sending them. Remember, you can make links through geography, music, business, food -- the list goes on and on. Whatever the connection, we want to hear it.

"(CNN) -- For our seventh set of countries, we asked you to connect Australia and Angola. Both countries start with the letter, ""A,"" but beyond that, their links aren't that apparent. Even Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales  was initially stumped. He told CNN's Max Foster that it was difficult to connect the two because they're located in such different places and have such different cultures and economies. But Wales was able to come up with some connections. He noted that China is having a big impact on both countries. China, which we featured on Global Connections last week, is buying a lot of oil from Angola and recently signed a big deal for natural gas with Australia. Blog commenter ""Yu-Chuan Gan"" also made the resource connection, pointing out that both Angola and Australia are rich in raw materials and mineral resources. Map: See the countries that have been connected so far . Fellow commenter ""Roman"" noted that both countries have been ruled by Europeans in the past. Angola was a Portuguese colony while the British settled Australia. ""Roman"" also added that the two countries have similar populations. We also heard from ""John Miller,"" who linked the two countries via sport. Both countries have a great traditional sporting rivalry with South Africa. We've been enjoying the personal stories you've been sharing. This week we heard from ""D Brian Long,"" who grew up in Angola but went to school in Zambia, where he was taught by an Australian. As a result, he said he returned to Angola with a thick, Australian accent! We also spoke to Australian singer and songwriter Delta Goodrem . She told us that she can spot an Aussie a mile away, and that the country is free spirited and encourages an open mindset. Australia and Angola both have great natural beauty, a connection many of you made. ""Daniel"" wrote on the blog that animals are symbols for both countries. Australia's well known for its kangaroos and koalas, while Angola's national icon is the giant sable antelope. We also looked a little closer at Australian wildlife, focusing on the debate about what to do about the country's wild camel problem. Please keep submitting your comments and ideas.

"(CNN) -- It's the annual festival of beer known the world over, and this year, Germany's Oktoberfest turns 200. People are filling the beer tents and filling their beer mugs on Munich's Theresienwiese, where the festival began two centuries ago as a celebration of the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen, for whom the street is now named. The royal couple invited the citizens of Munich to attend the festivities, and the party was repeated annually after that. Today, Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world, with six million visitors, according to Susanne Muhlbauer, press officer for Munich Tourist Office.  She told CNN: ""Part of the fun nowadays is that you actually do dress up in traditional costume. ""When I was a teenager you just wore jeans. It's only over the last 20 years that young people won't go to the festival without wearing traditional lederhosen."" And it's not just the Germans who are dressing up. According to Muhlbauer, over 9,000 people from clubs or ""trachtenvereins"" across Europe are taking part in this year's festival. She explained: ""It's not just a Bavarian celebration; people come from all over the Alpine region, including guests from Italy, Austria, Poland and Switzerland. ""They all come together to show their traditional costumes, which vary from the length of the lederhosen to the type of feathers in their hat."" But of course beer is the most important part of Oktoberfest, and organizers say around six million liters will be consumed this year. Six different types of the ""liquid gold"" are available in the tents. According to Muhlbauer, there is good reason why so much alcohol is consumed. She told CNN: ""What is special about Oktoberfest is that you have to drink beer from a one liter stein. It's a lot of beer and you have to drink it fairly quickly otherwise it goes stale!"" Munich and Bavaria pride themselves on their quality of beer, unashamedly calling it the best in the world. They cite Bavarian Purity Requirements that date to Duke William IV in 1516, which allow only water, hops, and barley to be used in the brewing process. This year's Oktoberfest runs from September 18 to October 4. Beer is sold in the tents from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on weekends. Although Oktoberfest began 200 years ago, this year's festival is only the 177th, since it wasn't held during the two World Wars and during a cholera outbreak, organizers say.

"(CNN) -- The death of a Canadian soldier in battle-scarred Afghanistan on Thursday brings this month's toll of international military fatalities in the war to 47, the highest monthly tally so far, a CNN count of official statistics shows. Lt. Col Thorneloe was  one of 15 British troops killed in action in Afghanistan this month. The Canadian soldier was killed while he was conducting operations in the Panjwayi District in Kandahar province, the Canadian military said. The previous monthly record was 46, a mark reached twice last year, in June and August. The growing death toll, which only accounts for the first half of July, comes amid an uptick in fighting across Afghanistan, where international forces and Afghan troops have been battling the Taliban. The push, called Operation Khanjar, targets militants in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold and poppy-growing region. The forces are trying to gain and hold ground in the perilous region ahead of national elections this August. Some of the deaths resulted from nonhostile incidents such as accidents, but most have occurred during hostilities. According to a CNN count of figures from various governments, the U.S.-led coalition and NATO's International Security Assistance Force, the deaths in July have included 23 Americans, 15 Britons, five Canadians, two Turks, an Italian and a NATO-led soldier whose nationality has not yet been disclosed. The news coincides with another grim milestone for the British military, which has seen the number of troops killed in Afghanistan surpass the death toll in the Iraq War. An especially bloody 10 days in Afghanistan's Helmand province, the staging ground for several major recent offensives, claimed the lives of 15 British soldiers in July, putting the number of the country's dead in Afghanistan at 184, the Defense Ministry said. The British military has lost 179 soldiers in Iraq. The 15 deaths in July also put the British military on track to be the deadliest month yet for British troops supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Britain's deadliest month in Afghanistan so far has been September 2006, when 19 died -- 14 in a single incident, the crash of a Royal Air Force plane near Kandahar. Since the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan in 2001, 652 U.S. troops have died in hostile and nonhostile activities throughout the country.","Soldier's death in Kandahar operations brings monthly international death toll to 47 .

"(CNN) -- What a year Meryl Davis is having. Not only did she win a gold medal with her ice-dancing partner Charlie White during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, but she also nabbed the ""Dancing With the Stars"" mirror ball trophy. Davis and her pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy were declared the champions of Season 18 on Tuesday night. Awaiting the results, the pair appeared to have tears in their eyes as they held each other and swayed back and forth as they awaited host Tom Bergeron's announcement of who had won. The audience exploded as Davis and Chmerkovskiy's names were called. ""It's just plastic, but it means so much,"" Chmerkovskiy said. ""And when it's lasted a decade of running after, it means that much more, and to do it with Meryl is a dream come true. There's a reason why it didn't happen before -- it's because this was meant to happen with this one."" They squared off in the finale against Paralympic snowboarder Amy Purdy and her partner Derek Hough. Former ""Full House"" star Candace Cameron Bure and her pro partner Mark Ballas came in third. Davis and Chmerkovskiy were heralded throughout the season for their performances and chemistry with judge Carrie Ann Inaba telling them after their final dance that ""The best part of the season was you two."" Inaba also suggested that the pair should get married which further stirred buzz that the passion the two displayed on the dance floor has extended to their personal lives. Chmerkovskiy joked about it during the show's finale. ""I want to ravage her and have ice-skating, big, Russian, mean babies,"" he said. ""We're going to call them Boris and Oleg. Their nicknames are going to be Bear. Both. One nickname for both.""","The winning pair were announced Tuesday night .

"Washington (CNN) -- Major decisions abroad for President Obama, a peek inside Pat Roberts' new campaign playbook, and reminders of how important Nevada and Iowa are in national politics -- just some of the topics that emerged from our trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. Plus, a digital extra from Politico's Maggie Haberman shows new signs that Hillary Clinton supporters are ready to get more aggressive. Chamber's next play: Iowa's Senate battle . The Chamber of Commerce continues to be a major player in the 2014 fight for control of the Senate, with its next move to be a multimillion-dollar ad buy for Republican Joni Ernst in Iowa's Senate contest. Ernst is running against U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley. The Iowa play comes on the heels of a Chamber ad buy in New Hampshire featuring a Mitt Romney testimonial for GOP Senate candidate Scott Brown. With 58 days to Election Day, one reason Republicans feel good about their odds of capturing the Senate majority is the fact that Iowa and New Hampshire, two states President Obama won handily twice, remain within reach for the GOP. Inside Pat Roberts' new playbook . Robert Costa of The Washington Post spoke with insiders in the Kansas Republican Party and they say that Roberts is shaking up his entire campaign. ""He brought in Chris LaCivita, who got to Kansas this weekend, a consultant from Virginia, and they got rid of Leroy Towns, Roberts' longtime confidant and campaign manager,"" said Costa. ""And look for them this week to try and define (Greg) Orman, the independent candidate."" Who is behind that effort to define Roberts' opponent? Costa reports that Lee Atwater protege Gary Maloney is coming in to help with opposition research and get Roberts back on track. Nevada gets help from ambitious Democrats . Politico's Manu Raju took us inside Sen. Harry Reid's strategy of turning the national political importance of his state, Nevada, into a boon for local political causes. Hillary Clinton, he reports, is in discussions to raise money soon for the Nevada Democratic Party. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vice President Joe Biden already have attended fund-raisers of late. ""The reason why that's important for Harry Reid is that he needs his candidates in this November's location, local candidates, to win,"" said Raju. ""Because if they do, his chances of survival in 2016 really improve."" The key race in Reid's Election-Day calculations is the lieutenant governor's race. Reid is concerned that Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval may try to grab his Senate seat in 2016. The thinking is that if a Democratic lieutenant governor is elected this year, Sandoval won't want to leave the Governor's Mansion in two years and hand it over to a Democrat. GOP leadership on 'pins and needles' over budget showdown . Will another budget deadline at the end of this month lead to another government shutdown? Molly Ball of The Atlantic reports that no one expects a shutdown, but the GOP leadership is on pins and needles about being able to get the continuing resolution passed. ""They don't have a game plan for how they are going to get House conservatives to fund the government,"" said Ball. ""As we mentioned on immigration, it's riled up the right and emboldened a lot of conservatives to make demands. The Export-Import Bank is also a really tough issue and the leadership has signaled they're going to try to get it reauthorized in the continuing resolution."" So there may be fireworks on Capitol Hill this month -- stay tuned. The 'Putin Problem' isn't going anywhere . Peter Baker of The New York Times shared smart insights suggesting the ""Putin Problem"" is likely to carry over into the next administration -- even if the newly announced ceasefire in Ukraine holds. ""The problem is that that doesn't end the story; it doesn't solve the fundamental issues,"" said Baker. ""That's why what I think we're going to see is what we call 'frozen conflict,' as we see elsewhere around the former Soviet Union, in which it remains a continuing set of tensions and frictions basically for now and the next few years to come."" Clinton gets a little help from her friends . We knew the onetime pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA had morphed into a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. But after a relatively quiet 2014, Politico's Maggie Haberman shared reporting that the group is prepared to get more aggressive, meaning prepared to inject itself into the 2016 Democratic primary competition. ""It was made very clear at a private meeting of people involved with it several weeks ago that they are prepared to spend in the primary to defend her,"" said Haberman. ""That means this is much more like what we saw with Mitt Romney and the super PAC that went after Newt Gingrich in a devastating way in the 2012 election cycle, and less like something that's just on hold to attack the Republican nominee.""","Chamber of Commerce a major player in the 2014 fight for control of the Senate .

Still, it grossed more than $1 billion around the world. A fifth film, at one point titled ""Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" was initially targeted for a 2015 release, with Kon-Tiki directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg taking over for Rob Marshall (who in turn had taken over for Gore Verbinski.) But last summer, shortly after ""The Lone Ranger"" had put a $190 million dent in Disney's bottom line, the project was delayed, due to budgetary concerns and an unfinished script.

"(CNN) -- While the United Arab Emirates draws international visitors to its flashy five-star hotels and massive shopping malls, its neighbor to the east, Oman, has taken a slightly more subtle approach to developing its tourism industry. Oman is hoping that the preservation of its heritage sites and spectacular landscapes -- rather than rapid modernization of both -- will attract visitors seeking a more laid back Arabian experience. The capital, Muscat, may not have many towering glass skyscrapers, but that doesn't mean that visitors to this Gulf nation have to rough it. Oman has a wealth of luxury experiences that provide modern comforts in a unique Middle Eastern setting. 1. The Chedi, Muscat . Muscat's waterfront has a charming promenade next to the city's old Matrouh souq, perfect for a sunset stroll. The bazaar next door is small, but has narrow alleys lined with carpet and spice vendors, and is one of the most authentic in the Middle East. The beachfront Chedi Hotel, just west of the old city, is one of Muscat's best. Built in traditional Omani style and with a bright white facade, its 182 rooms and high ceilings offer an atmosphere of palatial grandeur. The Chedi's narrow infinity pool, which the hotel claims is the longest pool in all of Oman, stretches to the Indian Ocean and is major draw. The Chedi Muscat; North Ghubra 32, Way No. 3215, Street No. 46, Muscat; +968 2452 4400 . 2. Royal Opera House . Abu Dhabi and Doha may be building world-class museums like the Louvre and the Guggenheim, but Muscat is the only city on the Arabian Peninsula with its own opera house. Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, opened the Royal Opera House Muscat in 2011. The main hall seats around 1,000 and regularly stages concerts, ballets and theatrical productions. It has hosted international artists such as Placido Domingo and the London Symphony Orchestra. The beautifully constructed building itself is worth a visit even if you can't catch a show; it blends traditional Omani design with modern acoustic technology and is one of the most recognizable sights in Muscat. Royal Opera House Muscat; Al Kharjiyah St., Muscat; +968 2440 3300 . 3. The Green Mountain . No visit to Oman would be complete without seeing the stunning views from the top of Jabal Akhdar, located at nearly 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) up in the Hajar Mountain range. It's just a short drive from the capital. Jabal Akhdar, whose name means ""green mountain"" in Arabic, is covered with trees and shrubs in an otherwise mostly desert landscape. With its mild temperatures year-round, Jabal Akhdar is the perfect retreat for visitors looking for outdoor adventure or an off-road trek. Tourists can discover Oman's green mountain from the comforts of a newly built five-star hilltop resort. The luxurious Alila Jabal Akhdar opened earlier this year, and offers a pool, spa and 86 rooms with sweeping views of the mountains. Alila Jabal Akhdar; Plot No.4 Al Roose, Jabal Al Akhdar, Nizwa; +968 2534 4200 . 4. Zighy Bay . Located just north of the United Arab Emirates, the small enclave of Musandam is one of the most geographically unique areas in Gulf region. For centuries, only boats could access the traditional Omani fishing villages that dot the coastline of this mountainous peninsula. But a new dirt road built over the jagged cliffs now allows for land access to Zighy Bay, a secluded cove that has a stunning stretch of white-sand beach. Zighy Bay is also home to a Six Senses resort with more than 80 villas, many with their own private pools. The resort offers the region's most unique way to get to a hotel room: parasailing from a rocky overlook 1,000 feet above. Six Senses Zighy Bay; Musandam Peninsula; Dibba Bayeh, Oman; +968 2673 5555 . 5. Sailing explorations . Centuries ago, Omanis dominated the Indian Ocean and earned a reputation as the best seafarers in the world. Omani sailors like the legendary Sinbad used wooden dhows to expand their Gulf sultanate's reach as far south as Zanzibar in East Africa. Today, the government is hoping that its maritime heritage will draw tourists to its own shores. ""Oman's dramatic coastline with its secluded coves, beautifully sandy beaches, enchanting islands and rich marine life is undoubtedly best explored by sea,"" says Oman Sail's Ghada Al-Said. Oman Sail is a government-funded project that teaches Omani children modern sailing techniques. It also offers bespoke charter packages for tourists, from sunset cruises to overnight yacht tours. Oman Sail; 18th November St., The Wave Muscat, Muscat; +968 2418 1400 . 6. Wahiba Sands . Camping under the stars in the desert is a favorite Omani pastime and Wahiba Sands is one of the favorite locations to do it -- a rejuvenating desert retreat far from Muscat, where Bedouin tour guides offer desert safaris and overnight camping treks. The 1,000 Nights Camps may be the most exclusive ""hotel"" in the entire desert. The rooms are large air-conditioned tents that have all the amenities of most five-star hotels: bathrooms, televisions and even a refrigerated mini-bar. 1,000 Nights Camps; Mandinat Al Sultan Qaboos, Oman; +968 9944 8158 . 7. Shuwa . One of the most popular dishes in Oman is called shuwa, succulent lamb served with spice-infused rice. Preparing shuwa typically involves slaughtering a sheep, marinating the meat with coriander, black pepper, cumin and cardamom, and then slow-cooking the morsels in an underground sand oven with charcoal. The whole process can take a full day, which is why shuwa is typically served as a feast only on Omani holidays and special occasions. There are several high-end restaurants in Muscat that serve home-cooked shuwa within minutes of ordering. One of the better ones is called Kargeen, a family-style restaurant with outdoor garden seating low to the ground in typical Omani fashion.

"(CNN) -- Mind over matter? Or nature over nurture? What is it that separates Olympic legends like Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt and U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps from the millions of enthusiastic amateurs around the world? Can training, dedication and the right mindset turn any sporting hopeful into a world-class athlete? Matthew Syed, author of ""Bounce"" and a former Olympic table tennis player, believes that an individual's ability is secondary to the level of coaching they receive and the facilities to which they have access. ""I think the idea of talent is misleading and in many ways overrated,"" Syed told CNN's Aiming for Gold show. ""When I became English No. 1, I thought I must be super talented. But the top players in the country at that time, 80% of them didn't just come from the same town or the same suburb, but from the very same street. Olympic goal: A swimmer's story . ""There hadn't been a genetic mutation -- we happened to have the best coach who gave us access to the only 24-hour club. ""So we practiced before school, after school, at weekends, on holidays. Over many years, we transformed ourselves from perfectly ordinary players into world-class players."" So does practice in itself make the world's top athletes perfect? Not necessarily, according to mental performance coach Andy Barton. ""Practice doesn't make perfect,"" he says. ""You only have to think of your handwriting for instance, how as you get older the more you write the worse you get. ""Only perfect practice will make perfect. To improve you have to be very specific about what you are aiming to do and target it."" It is a view supported by Syed, who suggests that the willingness of top athletes to push themselves further and further in practice pays dividends when it comes to high-pressure competition. ""It's interesting, for example, that world-class ice dancers fall over more often in practice than intermediate ice dancers, which sounds paradoxical,"" he said. ""The reason is they are always pushing themselves, they are attempting jumps that are at the outer limits of their capabilities. It's a branch of science called 'epigenetics' -- the brain is re-wired as we practice."" Once athletes have meticulously honed their skills, they should, in theory, have all the tools at their disposal to achieve success. But in high-pressure situations, even the greatest can crumble. What causes a footballer to crack under the nail-biting strain of a penalty shootout? Or a tennis star to fall apart at match point? ""The problem when you're under pressure is you're so nervous you start thinking consciously about the shot you are playing,"" Syed says. ""You are intruding upon your subconscious competence, and that is what triggers the choking response."" So how can Olympians preparing for London 2012 ensure they are mentally ready to challenge for gold? Barton suggested that imagining the crowning moment is almost as important as physically training for it. ""The thing about when we mentally rehearse something vividly, it actually fires up the same neurology in the brain as if we were really experiencing it. So on a certain level the mind cannot differentiate between a vividly-imagined experience and reality. ""What we need to do is to create our own realities in our heads so you can imagine yourself in that Olympic final, for instance, performing how you want to perform. ""The more you actually do that, the more your body and mind get used to it, so when you come to the real thing, you're more prepared."" So the next time you find yourself daydreaming of sprinting to 100 meters gold, don't dismiss it -- it might just be vital preparation for your future Olympic success.","Experts tell CNN how practice and dedication can future gold medal winners .

"(CNN) -- Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome won the 139th running of the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore on Saturday with a burst at the homestretch -- moving a step closer to the illustrious and elusive Triple Crown. California Chrome was heavily favored in the 10-horse field. With Victor Espinoza riding, the colt held off a hard-charging Ride On Curlin to take the second jewel in the Triple Crown. Social Inclusion finished third. Now, with the Kentucky Derby and Preakness victories, if California Chrome wins the Belmont Stakes next month in New York, he'll be the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to achieve the ultimate feat in thoroughbred racing. A former bus driver in his native Mexico City, Espinoza, 41, has ridden in the Preakness six times, including on War Emblem in 2002. After winning both the Derby and Preakness that year, War Emblem finished eighth in the Belmont Stakes. ""It is an awesome feeling to be able to have a horse like California Chrome,"" Espinoza told NBC Sports after the race. ""It was just a crazy race ... I got more tired mentally than physically riding him. But it worked out well, and he's just an amazing horse."" Art Sherman describes California Chrome in no uncertain terms: ""Pure and simple, he's a rock star."" The 77-year-old trainer says the horse loves posing for pictures, loves the buzz of the track. After the race, Sherman had tears rolling under his dark sunglasses. ""I knew we had to run harder this race,"" he told NBC. ""He's a real racehorse and I'm hoping that the mile and half [in Belmont] is up his alley, too... It's a dream for any trainer to do this."" Of the 38 horses that won both the Derby and Preakness, only 11 went on to victory in the Belmont Stakes, which covers a greater distance than either of the preceding Triple Crown races. The winning colt even has his own official Twitter handle: @calchrome. After the race came this tweet: ""Start spreading the news #Chromies we are going to New York!"" California Chrome was delivered by a mare named Love the Chase that Steve Coburn and co-owner Perry Martin bought for $8,000 with a view to breeding. She was bred to the stallion Lucky Pulpit for a reduced fee of $2,000, the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken. Their offspring had earned Coburn and Perry more than $2.3 million in prize money before the Preakness, also chalking up wins at the Santa Anita Derby, San Felipe Stakes and California Cup Derby. California Chrome is being compared by some to Seabiscuit, the beloved, undersized bay who -- though he never competed in a Triple Crown race -- outran Triple Crown winner War Admiral in a match race at Pimlico in 1938 and became a symbol of hope and determination. ""I do believe he's that, like Seabiscuit,"" Coburn said. ""He became the people's horse in the Depression because he was the little guy kicking the big guy. We're doing that in the same kind of way. No one ever gave it any credence, and we shouldn't be where we are now."" California Chrome will try to win that final jewel at Belmont Park in Hempstead, New York, on June 7. ""You know what?"" Espinoza said, ""we'll get it done."" Matt Majendie contributed to this report.","Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome moves a step closer to Triple Crown .

"(CNN) -- Mexico heads the list of the world's most overweight industrialized nations. Fat chance you say? Exactly. Nearly a third of Mexican adults are obese, a recent United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization report says, topping even the United States, which comes in a close second at 31.8%. The United States has long been a fixture atop the chubby list. The culprit? High-calorie, low-cost, processed foods and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle as Mexican incomes rise and more people move into metropolitan areas. The danger, according to the World Health Organization, is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, degenerative joint diseases and some cancers. The obesity epidemic is a double whammy for Mexican children, who can be both malnourished and overweight. ""They are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense ... foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality,"" the World Health Organization reports. It's a growing problem -- and not just for Mexico. Since 1980, obesity rates worldwide have doubled. In 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults were overweight and 500 million were obese. The solution is simple but not always easy to accomplish, especially as nutritional options are limited in many parts of the world. The WHO recommends: . -- Limiting your intake of fats and sugars . -- Increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts . -- Engaging in regular physical activity: 60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes per week for adults . CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report .","Nearly 33% of Mexicans are obese, a United Nations report says .

"(CNN) -- Larry and Jane Glazer were alike in so many ways, from their individual successes in business to their shared loved of adventure -- and flying. The couple helped lead and reshape Rochester, New York, for decades. They were believed to be the only passengers aboard a small plane that flew Friday -- unresponsive and with its windows fogging over -- down the East Coast, over stretches of open ocean and over Cuba before crashing off the coast of Jamaica. The U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday called off its search for the plane's wreckage. While entrepreneurship was the bedrock of their business success, their impact on the city in upstate New York extended far beyond corporate offices and financial reports. Larry Glazer transformed swaths of the city beside Lake Ontario through a real estate firm that he led since 1970. In fact, he was profiled in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle newspaper in 2002 as one of the city's ""developers who shape our community."" His Buckingham Properties describes itself as ""Rochester, New York's largest and most diverse real estate development and property management company."" Jane Glazer made her mark as a business leader on her own, quitting her job as a math teacher in 1983 to start a firm called QCI Direct, selling microwave cookware through catalogs and then through the Internet, according to a Democrat and Chronicle profile of her in 2008. The online business now also sells home, personal care, cooking and cleaning products. QCI Direct employs 100 people and produces two national retail catalogs mailed to 35 million people annually, the firm's website says. ""Remarkable human beings"" with ""a very close knit family"" is how Heidi Zimmer-Meyer, president of Rochester Downtown Development Corporation describes the Glazers. ""Both of them (were) involved in job creation in this area and in his case rebuilding parts of the city, and it's just he has left an unbelievable legacy. You can see his fingerprints all over this community in a wonderful, very high impact way,"" Zimmer-Meyer said. Jane Glazer told Women Entrepreneurs Blog last April that she also found time to participate in a New York City Marathon, whitewater rafting and flying a plane. ""But being an entrepreneur is the one I keep pursuing. It challenges my mind, my level of energy, my ability to deal with people, and my love of adventure. And someday, who knows? Maybe I really will get to the finish line,"" Jane Glazer told the blog. Larry Glazer became a developer in a roundabout manner. Glazer was playing tennis one day after graduating from Columbia University with an MBA at 22 in the late 1960s when a tennis partner suggested they go into the real estate business by buying a two-unit house in Rochester, the newspaper said in another story about him in 2008. Glazer knew almost nothing about the real estate business. ""It was absolutely a fluke,"" Glazer, the chief executive of Buckingham Properties LLC, told the newspaper. ""He said, 'You want to go into business?' "" Glazer founded Buckingham Properties in 1970 and often worked 80 hours a week. His real estate empire even expanded to central Florida, where his firm has ownership in more than 300 acres of development property, the firm's website says. And, the website adds, he is an avid pilot. ""Larry spends some of his spare time on the ground -- gardening around his house with his wife, Jane; and some in the sky -- flying his plane,"" his profile says on the company's website. Glazer also served as president of the TBM Owners and Pilots Association and was an active board member in several local organizations, including the Jewish Home of Rochester. The plane carrying the couple and a pilot was nonresponsive as it flew south from Rochester and crashed into the Caribbean on Friday. It was purchased for $3.7 million by Larry Glazer's Buckingham Properties, according to aviation industry media reports. Said Zimmer-Meyer about Larry Glazer: ""He has been flying for a long time. And he loved to fly. Even one time I remember him telling me that he was flying to France to pick up a brand new plane and he was flying it back over the Atlantic Ocean all by himself. Brand new right off the line. I don't know how many planes he owned, but I do know that he loved flying and he flew often."" The company's website says the firm owns and manages ""more than 60 properties"" and is headed by co-founder, CEO and managing partner, Larry Glazer. Even before any official announcement on the fate of those aboard the small plane, the children of Larry and Jane Glazer said in a statement they were ""devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents."" ""They loved and appreciated the opportunity to help build the community of Rochester, and we thank everyone in the community for their expressions of support,"" the children said. CNN's Ray Sanchez and Rande Iaboni contributed to this report.","Larry Glazer helped reshape Rochester through his development firm since 1970 .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing a local election this weekend, the biggest test of his popularity since becoming Prime Minister in 2003. The polls are seen as a referendum on his popularity before the country's first direct presidential election this summer, in which Erdogan is widely expected to run. But things don't seem to be going smoothly. Just months after the damaging Gezi Park protests in Istanbul, Erdogan's government is now facing a wide-ranging anti-corruption probe. And to add to the misery, Turkey's economy, once hailed as a miracle, is slowing down, its currency is hovering around record lows against the dollar, and some of its firms are facing huge foreign debts. How did it get into this mess? Many developed countries struggled with growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Not so Turkey, which grew substantially over the last decade. Erdogan's government was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from Europe and emerging markets such as Russia and China. The rapid economic growth was largely fueled by cheap credit pouring into the country. As the crisis hit developed economies, investors turned to emerging markets which promised higher returns than depressed Western markets. For years, Turkey had enjoyed a foreign-funded construction boom. House prices had soared more than 50% since the end of 2009 and both the country's GDP and per capita income had increased threefold since 2003. But the party ended with the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing a scale-back in its stimulus program last summer. Suddenly, there was less cash available to invest. With more security in the U.S. economy, investors started pulling their money from the emerging markets. Turkey's growth slowed to just above 2% and inflation rose to 7.4% in 2013, well above the 5% target. The country's currency, the Lira, slumped further in January, which forced Turkey's central bank to adopt a radical approach and almost double interest rates from 7.7% to 12% -- a clear indication of the bank's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows. But for voters, this may not be good news. Higher interest rates are likely to slow down Turkey's economic growth. And as cash becomes less available and borrowing becomes more expensive, producers and business owners are likely to pass their increased costs to consumers, who will in turn see prices going up. Erdogan is aware of this and strongly opposed the bank's move to raise interest rates. He argued it would hurt Turkey's growth and blamed the Lira's recent tumble on the opposition and an ""interest rates lobby,"" saying it was the result of a conspiracy against him and his government. And while Turkey's $800 billion economy remains among the 20 biggest in the world, the IMF has warned it is not built on a sustainable model and remains too vulnerable to dangers outside its borders. Add to this another grim statistic: the country's poverty. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), one in five Turks live below the relative poverty line -- meaning their income is less than half of the country's median. That is one of the highest figures among developed countries, with only Mexico and Israel lagging behind. Turkey's strategic position means the country is the bridge between Asia and Europe. Its membership of NATO and candidacy to join the European Union reflect its importance. But the current unrest and uncertainty has already cost the country millions -- its stock market lost a third of its value last year alone. Foreign investors have been watching Erdogan's steps closely and to them, the result of this weekend's local election could be an indication of where the country's economy moves next.

"(CNN) -- With designs inspired by the nomadic warriors of the Middle East, Emirati fashion designer Khalid AlQasimi is making waves in fashion circuits across Europe. Founder and creative director of the haute couture fashion house ""Qasimi,"" the Central St. Martins graduate has wowed critics in both London and Paris, with his bold use of colors and architecturally inspired designs. With the likes of Lily Cole and Erin O'Connor showcasing his creations, it's been a whirlwind ride for the young designer who only established his fashion label two years ago. Born in the emirate of Sharjah, AlQasimi moved to the United Kingdom after being awarded an art scholarship at the age of nine. After school, he enrolled at the Architectural Association but after a three month trip to South America decided that his true love lay in design. Now, as AlQasimi gears up for the January launch of his menswear collection in Paris, he tells CNN how his homeland has inspired his work. CNN: What does the UAE mean to you? KQ: I'm from Sharjah which has a different ideology to Dubai. To me, Sharjah means calmness, peace and family. CNN: Where do you see the UAE heading? KQ: Sharjah is really pushing the arts. It's right at the forefront. The Sharjah Biennale has been going on for thirteen years. Sharjah's arts and culture program is growing and in the universities, so are science and technology. It's all about the new generation. CNN: What are your favorite places to go in the UAE? KQ: The Kasbah in Sharjah is a great place to go out in the evening. It has delicious international cuisine. The Sharjah Art Museum has a great array of contemporary art. I also love Souq al Arsha. That's one of the oldest souks in the Middle East. It's still ongoing with traditional handicraft and silverware. They have a sweet coffee shop in the middle. It shows the old way and how the old souks used to work. CNN: How has the UAE influenced your design? KQ: There's always this underlying influence of the UAE and Middle East in my design. The characters I design for are usually urban tribal warriors and nomadic explorers. The idea of dressing as art is part of our culture. The smoking of incense and the placement of the headdress -- there's a whole art to it. CNN: How has the UAE shaped your personality? KQ: Growing up in both the UK and the UAE has given me an understanding of both cultures. It's given me a thirst for knowledge and exploring and discovering other places. It's made me want to learn different languages and travel. CNN: What are your fondest memories of the UAE? KQ: The food, the smells, the stars at night. That's something that's really stuck with me. You can see the stars so clearly in Sharjah. I love going to the desert, lying on the dunes and watching the stars. I also miss the salty smell of the air and the light. There's an amazing quality to the light in the UAE -- the way it dazzles and bounces off the buildings. CNN: What differences do you see between the Emirates? KQ: Dubai is an economic hub, studded with contemporary architecture. Dubai has a bold view of where it wants to go, whereas Sharjah -- it's not necessarily retreating -- but it's concentrating more on its past. Sharjah wants to save its past. It wants to reconstruct and rebuild its old architecture. CNN: How does it feel to be from the UAE when most people living there are from overseas? KQ: Growing up, it was great being in such a multicultural surrounding. It gives the locals an understanding of what lies beyond the Middle East. Most people in the UAE speak multiple languages -- a minimum two and probably three and it's also given us a clearer understanding of self.","Upcoming fashion designer Khalid AlQasimi talks to CNN about growing up in UAE .

"(CNN) -- This week, 37-year-old Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo, an internet provider with many problems, although an audience isn't one of them -- the company claims more than half a billion people currently access its products a month, and Mayer told the New York Times she considers it ""one of the best brands on the internet."" Mayer also announced Tuesday that she is pregnant. She and husband Zack Bogue are expecting a baby boy in October. Read more: If Marissa Mayer can 'have it all,' can you? A Silicon Valley veteran, Mayer became Google's 20th employee in 1999, after completing a Masters in Computer Science at Stanford University. She leaves Google after 13 years, having heading up its search team and, for the last two years, leading location and maps services. This year, she also joined the board of retail giant Wal-Mart. Now, one of the most powerful women in the tech industry, Mayer regularly shares her philosophies on life and work. Here, we've gathered together some of the lessons that have helped Mayer on her way to the top. 11 fun facts about Mayer . Push through your uncertainty . ""I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that's how you grow. When there's that moment of 'Wow, I'm not really sure I can do this,' and you push through those moments, that's when you have a breakthrough. Sometimes that's a sign that something really good is about to happen. You're about to grow and learn a lot about yourself,"" she told CNN in April. Protect what's really important to you . ""I have a theory that burnout is about resentment. And you beat it by knowing what it is you're giving up that makes you resentful. I tell people: Find your rhythm. Your rhythm is what matters to you so much that when you miss it you're resentful of your work...So find your rhythm, understand what makes you resentful, and protect it. You can't have everything you want, but you can have the things that really matter to you. And thinking that way empowers you to work really hard for a really long period of time,"" said Mayer in Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this year. Work with smart people . ""It's really wonderful to work in an environment with a lot of smart people. One, I think because it challenges you to think and work on a different level,"" she said during a talk at Stanford University's Entrepreneurial Thought Leader Speaker Series in 2006. Keep some outside perspective . ""I've always loved baking. I think it's because I'm very scientific. The best cooks are chemists...

"(CNN) -- A 20-year-old woman whose aunt allegedly beat her and held her captive for a decade in the basement of a Philadelphia apartment building has sued the city, claiming her ordeal could have been avoided if officials had acted appropriately. Beatrice Weston alleges the city failed to ""properly train Department of Human Services workers in child placements,"" resulting in her being put in the custody of her aunt, Linda Weston, a convicted felon, a statement from her attorney Shanin Specter said. The complaint says the city of Philadelphia failed to release information about the aunt's criminal history. Linda Weston served eight years in prison for killing her sister's boyfriend in the early 1980s. In that case, the victim ""was held captive for an extended period of time, locked in a closet and he literally starved to death,"" Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said in October. Philly basement victim says he was kept in nailed-shut closet . Beatrice Weston suffered much of the same abuse, beaten with a baseball bat and forced to consume her own urine during the 10 years she was in her aunt's custody, according to her attorney . ""This would have been avoided if the city hadn't recommended that a convicted felon be given custody of a vulnerable, innocent child,"" Specter said. Mark McDonald, press secretary for Mayor Michael Nutter, said he could not comment on pending litigation. Linda Weston's attorney said she had not seen the complaint and most likely would not be representing her in any civil hearing. Beatrice Weston's case first came to light in October when she was found, along with several mentally disabled adults, in the basement of an apartment building where her aunt lived. Police said they believe it was part of a scheme to collect their Social Security checks. The complaint names two other defendants, Nefertiti Savoy, a social worker, and Richard Ames, an attorney who recommended Weston's placement. Linda Weston is set to go on trial in January on charges of kidnapping, assault, conspiracy, false imprisonment and other related counts to holding the four adults captive.

"(CNN) -- The United States on Wednesday announced charges against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, accused of orchestrating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and four others accused of involvement in the plot. ""If convicted, the five accused could be sentenced to death,"" the Defense Department said in a statement. Along with Mohammed, the others are Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin 'Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi. The charges allege that the five are ""responsible for the planning and execution of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa., resulting in the killing of 2,976 people,"" the statement said. Father of slain firefighter relishes trial . The five accused are charged with ""terrorism, hijacking aircraft, conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, and destruction of property in violation of the law of war. The convening authority has referred all charges to a joint trial."" Why Obama can't close Guantanamo . The convening authority, the Office of Military Commissions, referred charges to a capital military commission, the department said. ""Each of the five accused have been provided, in addition to their detailed defense counsel, learned counsel, possessing specialized knowledge and experience in death penalty cases, to assist them in their defense,"" the Pentagon said. The chief judge of the Military Commissions Trial Judiciary will assign a military judge to the case, and the five will be arraigned at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, within 30 days of service of the referred charges upon them. Wednesday's action is a refiling of charges against the accused conspirators. The military initially charged Mohammed in 2008, but President Barack Obama stopped the case as part of his effort to close the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Ten years of 'Gitmo' -- and more to come . Unable to close the center, Obama attempted to move the case to federal court in New York in 2009, only to run into a political firestorm. The plan was dropped after complaints about cost and security. Last April, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the five would face a military trial at Guantanamo Bay. The American Civil Liberties Union opposes the military tribunals. They ""are sure to be subject to continuous legal challenges and delays, and their outcomes will not be seen as legitimate. That is not justice,"" the group said Wednesday. ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said the administration is making a ""terrible mistake by prosecuting the most important terrorism trials of our time in a second-tier system of justice."" ""Whatever verdict comes out of the Guantanamo military commissions will be tainted by an unfair process and the politics that wrongly pulled these cases from federal courts, which have safely and successfully handled hundreds of terrorism trials,"" Romero said. ""The military commissions were set up to achieve easy convictions and hide the reality of torture, not to provide a fair trial. Although the rules have been improved, the military commissions continue to violate due process by allowing the use of hearsay and coerced or secret evidence.""","Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is the accused mastermind of the September 11 attacks .

"(CNN) -- Istanbul may be two millennia old, but there's nothing dated about its cultural scene. While the domed city is best known for its ancient attractions, it's also buzzing with a vibrant contemporary arts and design scene. Modern galleries, late-night music venues and chic fashion boutiques have cropped up in recent years, and Istanbul's status as a 2010 European Capital of Culture has given it a platform to showcase its vitality. CNN explores some of the most exciting hotspots of this global center of cool, from cutting-edge art galleries and boutiques to the clubs and lounges that make Istanbul a city that never sleeps.

"(CNN) -- Anything you can do, I can do better. That was the message from Lionel Messi to Brazil's boy wonder Neymar. Both players, teammates at Barcelona, have lit up this World Cup with four goals in their opening three games. But unlike Neymar, who at the age of just 22 has scored 35 goals in 52 international appearances, Messi has had to contend with critics who say he never delivers when playing in an Argentina shirt. Now, having scored more times in this tournament than his previous two World Cups combined, those opinions appear to have disappeared ahead of the last-16 tie against Switzerland. Two goals against Nigeria in Wednesday's 3-2 victory secured top spot in Group F against a Super Eagles side which qualified for the last 16 in second place courtesy of Iran's 3-1 defeat by Bosnia. ""Messi is one heck of a player,"" Nigeria coach Stephen Keshi told reporters. ""You can't take that away from him. He's blessed. I think there are other players in the Argentina squad who are very strong, but Messi is from Jupiter. ""We gave too much respect to the Argentinians and did not play our game in the first half. We played a bit more aggressive in the second half. Congratulations to the Argentina team, I wish them all the best in the tournament."" Messi left Argentina for Spain at the age of 13 -- a move which led many in his homeland to question whether he had taken on a Catalan identity by the time he grew into one of the world's greats. Surely that myth will be extinguished should Messi lead his country to its first World Cup triumph since 1986 -- and the signs are increasingly encouraging. He has now scored 42 goals in 88 international appearances while playing with an energy which suggests he may have been saving his best for last following a relatively poor season at Barcelona, which was interrupted by injury. His last-gasp goal which secured a 1-0 win over a valiant Iran was a moment of magic which will long be remembered. That goal, which came just moments after Diego Maradona -- arguably Argentina's greatest ever player -- had left the stadium, appeared to signal his arrival as the nation's new hero. Messi, who turned 27 on Tuesday, said his perfect birthday gift would be to win the World Cup -- and given his recent performances, it would take a brave person to bet against it. Unlike on Saturday against Iran, Messi required just three minutes to unpick the Nigerian defense in Porto Alegre. A sumptuous through ball by Javier Mascherano released Angel Di Maria and, when his shot was pushed onto the post by the Nigeria goalkeeper, Messi followed up to lash the ball high into the net. Nigeria, which hadn't conceded a goal in its previous two games, could scarcely have reacted better. Just over a minute later, a quick break allowed Ahmed Musa to find space on the left before he cut inside a curled home a delightful effort past the outstretched arm of Sergio Romero. A draw would have been enough to take Nigeria through to the next stage for the first time since 1998 but the Africans struggled to contain a rampant looking Argentina. Di Maria, a star of Real Madrid's European Champions League triumph, unleashed a fierce 30-yard drive which Vincent Enyeama, the Nigeria goalkeeper, did well to turn behind. Enyeama, who has enjoyed an impressive season with French club Lille, then denied Messi from 25 yards as the forward arrowed a free kick towards goal. But with the first half drawing to a close, he was beaten again as Messi curled home an exquisite effort from 20 yards with his wand-like left-foot. Nigeria could have been forgiven for beginning to fear the worst at the interval given Messi's moments of magic. But Stephen Keshi's men appeared reinvigorated after the break and Musa broke through the Argentina defense to level within two minutes of the restart. Nigeria, paired with Argentina for the fourth time in the World Cup, suffered narrow defeats in each of its previous three fixtures against the South Americans. But any thoughts that this would finally be its day were soon extinguished when Marcos Rojo bundled in Messi's corner just three minutes later. The mercurial Messi, having already tormented Nigeria for just over an hour, was then substituted by coach Alejandro Sabella -- either to give him a rest or out of sympathy for his opponents. As Messi walked off to a standing ovation and an almighty roar from the thousands wearing blue and white packed inside the stadium, the game appeared to meander somewhat. There was still time for Musa to threaten a hat-trick while Messi's replacement, Ricky Alvarez, should have done better with a headed chance late on. But with the news of Iran's demise filtering through from Salvador, Nigeria appeared aware of its qualification and a showdown with France in Brasilia on Monday. Iran, which fought so valiantly during the 1-0 defeat by Argentina last Saturday, required a victory to progress for the first time in its history, combined with a Nigerian defeat. But it was frustrated in its attempt by a Bosnia team, which despite already being unable to qualify for the knockout phase, appeared determined to go out of its first World Cup in style. Bosnia's 1-0 defeat by Nigeria, which riled coach Safet Susic after his team wrongly had a goal disallowed, left several players inconsolable at the final whistle. But there was little sign of a hangover and Edin Dzeko, the man whose effort was ruled out, finally gained the goal he so badly craved when he drove home from 20 yards. Roma's Miralem Pjanic added a second after the break before Reza Ghoochannejad pulled one back with 11 minutes remaining. But with Iran pushing forward for an equalizer, Avdija Vrsajevic rounded off a rapid move by firing in off the post to secure his country's historic first World Cup victory .","Lionel Messi scores twice for Argentina .

"(CNN) -- It's one of the most famous sets on television right now. On the hit CBS comedy ""The Big Bang Theory,"" a group of scientists and their friends and neighbors go through the ups and downs of nerd life, while surrounded by memorabilia that would make any collector drool. ""Being on those sets, seeing the detail and production design -- they're all authentic,"" actor Simon Helberg (Howard) told CNN while visiting the set as the cast and crew prepared to film this Thursday night's episode. ""Everything is 100% accurate."" Jim Parsons, who plays uber-nerd Sheldon Cooper, is not quite as informed on all manners science and comic books, but can appreciate the details. ""I know that clouds make rain and that Superman dated Lois Lane and after that, I kinda dry up for what else to say,"" he admitted. ""But you don't have to understand all of it to feel the excitement of so much creativity and passion and work and the objects on our set all vibrate with that kind of energy. It really informs the whole pace of the room."" The cast, as well as fan favorite guest star Wil Wheaton, spoke to CNN backstage (which is something of a museum of nerddom all its own, with toys and comic book character posters everywhere) about some of their favorite parts of the elaborate set, including some things viewers at home might not pick up on right away. (""The Big Bang Theory"" is from Warner Bros. Television, which is owned by CNN's parent company, Time Warner.) CNN: What's it like being constantly surrounded by all of these representations of nerd culture? Mayim Bialik (Amy): I'm a scientist, so I like all that nerdy stuff. That was one of the things that struck me was the attention to detail. Our set dressing and props department are really important to us, and that's important to the producers as well. Helberg: It's amazing to still discover new stuff in Sheldon's apartment. Kaley Cuoco Sweeting (Penny): It's like a theme park walking onstage. I've spent a lot of time in that living room set, so I know a lot of the stuff in there -- I like how the prop department lines the hallways with all the things we've used. It puts me in the mood when I'm here at work. Wheaton: I feel like I'm walking through my own house. I have a lot of the same action figures and comic books. CNN: What are some of your favorite pieces of the set? Johnny Galecki (Leonard): The ""Star Wars"" stuff brings me back because I was a huge ""Star Wars"" fan growing up as a kid. There's really two camps here: ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars."" I'm very much entrenched in the ""Star Wars"" camp. As a kid, I had dozens of ""Star Wars"" figurines. That's how I told stories and in a way I'm still doing that, using myself as the vessel instead of the figurine. Bialik: I'm a comic book person, I was raised in comic book stores -- when we have the comic book set, I spend my breaks in the comic book set. Once I saw ""Y the Last Man,"" and I was trying to explain it to Jim Parsons and I was saying ""This is a collected 'Y the Last Man,' I had to collect them all individually!"" He said, ""I don't care! (laughs) I play someone who cares but I don't really care."" Kunal Nayyar (Raj): I love the comic book store, that's the best, because I'm a huge ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" fan, and they have all these figurines from ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and I get to be a kid again. Wheaton: When we work in the comic book shop set, I want to take a lot of the books home with me. There are some incredible DC archive collections that are just used as set decoration. I walk in like Indiana Jones, ""This belongs in a museum."" Nayyar: We've had the sword from ""Game of Thrones"" and I love it and I want to pick it up, but I know if I destroy it, it's going to be $10,000. It's a heavy thing. Helberg: I am a big ""Game of Thrones"" fan -- that sword is a real sword and that was cool. There are also some very racy figurines -- these women are really decked out. One is sort of a sadomasochistic fever dream. Melissa Rauch (Bernadette): When we're doing stuff in Howard's room, there's a lot of action figures in there. I was always very intrigued by how detailed the action figures are, especially the women. They are very, very detailed -- they're like miniature blow-up dolls. Parsons: I do have a unique relationship with (Sheldon's spot) on the couch. We do a lot of scenes in that apartment set and, as an actor, one of the first things you figure out is where you will physically start a scene on the stage and, nine times out of 10, I start on the spot on that couch. It's as close as I think I'll ever get to Archie Bunker's chair. Cuoco Sweeting: I love being in Penny's apartment. Being in the kitchen, drinking wine, feels like what I do at home. Galecki: I have a bit of a superstitious tradition of decorating my dressing room with things the character would have, so I took quite a lot of set dressing for my dressing room. In Season 4, I thought this is enough. I started tripping over board games. CNN: Are there any little details that fans might not be aware of right away? Galecki: Guests are always interested in the stairwell, and that it only goes down about seven steps and there's a wall there. You'd think they would have given us more room. We really have to pack ourselves like sardines to be out of the camera's view -- the Hollywood magic that is never quite as glamorous as one might imagine. Cuoco Sweeting: People always ask if we eat the food (during scenes). I must be the only one who really eats the food. I save my appetite until we do those scenes -- I want to look real, man! Rauch: Wolowitz's sheets are the most comfortable sheets and the most comfortable bed. I love doing scenes in there -- it's like nap time! It's so comfortable. Bialik: One of my actual genetics textbooks is in the guys' apartment. Nayyar: At the back of the guys' apartment is a ""Star Trek"" communicator. You can't see it but it's a big deal. It's really cool -- if you look carefully enough you'll see it. Wheaton: One of my favorite things I noticed two seasons ago, is in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment, all the way upstage where the window looks out into Pasadena, they have action figures up there and one of them is Aquaman, who is articulated so he's doing the Vulcan ""Live long and prosper"" salute. And it's super-rad because it will never read on television. I think it's such an awesome little detail that of course one of these guys would have done that -- because I would have.","CNN visited the set of TV's hit comedy ""The Big Bang Theory""

"(CNN) -- I am an American, and I love my country, but I also love my heritage. I was born in Tampa, Florida, to Palestinian-American parents, but 70% of my family still lives in the West Bank, including my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. When I was 3, my parents decided to move back to Palestine -- a choice that changed the course of my life. The purpose of the move was for me and my siblings to learn Arabic and our family's culture. Yet, the four-year experience offered much more than that. We lived peacefully in Ramallah, a West Bank city just north of Jerusalem, when we moved there in 1997. My father built a home in Area C, an Israeli-controlled region of the West Bank. During the first two years, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was at a quiet period. Our lives were pretty normal. My older brother and I attended a private school operated by the American education system, and my two older sisters went to a French all-girls Catholic school. In our free time, our days consisted of shopping in Ramallah, taking cabs to Jerusalem and hiking mountains. In the summer of 2000, our lives were flipped upside down by the second intifada, or ""the uprising."" A 20-something-foot harsh concrete wall was constructed around the West Bank, there were checkpoints installed between towns and villages, and daily clashes between Palestinians and Israeli authorities interrupted our day. We no longer had the liberty to take cabs to Jerusalem, shop in Ramallah or hike in the mountains. Our sense of freedom was stripped away from us. My family soon discovered that living in fear and under occupation was dangerous and too hostile. So we decided to move back to the U.S. in 2001. My family's decision to leave was one that would thrust guilt on our shoulders for a time to come. Leaving our extended family behind in a war-torn country left us with feelings of sadness. Fearing daughter's Gaza border wedding . Living in occupation felt normal to me. It was moving back to America when I was 8 that felt like a culture shock. My life in America has been very different from my life in Palestine and is much different from the lives of Israeli and Palestinian youth today. Going to school in Tampa, my only morning worry was getting a decent grade on my homework. My cousins in the West Bank, on the other hand, are worried about grades too, but they also have to worry about checkpoints and random clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli authorities. The day the four children were killed while playing soccer on Gaza Beach, my friends and I were at St. Pete Beach playing volleyball. Unlike those children, we made it home safely to our families. As the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues, the world is watching with eyes wide open. In the U.S., public opinion has been varied. America's opinion about the conflict is split between both sides: Some support Israel; some support Palestine. But for me, I have a different perspective of the conflict. When terror hit America on September 11, I was filled with sadness, sorrow and anger. I thought, ""How could someone do this to my people?"" The anger lingered for a very long time and still does today. These past couple of weeks have also made me angry. Waking up every day, I would discover yet a higher death toll of Gaza civilians. I would turn on the TV to find limbs of Palestinians plastered all over the news. Sad and angry, once again I thought, ""How could someone do this to my people?"" Many Israelis are also victims of terrorism. I understand the fear and frustration they feel due to the conflict. No one should have to mourn a loss of a human life due to violence. For those of you without ties to the region, I ask you to look at it with a fresh perspective: The history of the Holy Land and the politics go far back, but please look at the humanitarian crisis. Think about the people instead. I think I speak for many Palestinian-Americans when I say I feel helpless in watching the continuous deaths of civilians in Palestine. My reason for writing this essay is to express my feelings about the conflict in order to help the Palestinian people -- my people -- in some way. Before leaving Palestine, I remember taking a walk with my mother in the hills of Ramallah. On the bottom of the hills was the West Bank barrier. Once we reached the top of the tallest hill, my mother grabbed my arm and pointed in the far distance. ""You see that city over there? That's Jerusalem. That's where I was born, where your father was born and where you are from. One day, we'll walk from here to Jerusalem. ... And no wall or soldier will stand in our way."" I hope to see that day.

The acclaimed author talks to CNN about the inspirations she draws from her homeland. CNN: What does India mean to you? Anita Desai: I may think of myself, after so much travel and so many dislocations, as ""stateless"" but the truth is that wherever I am, I am Indian, and wherever I go, I carry India with me. We are inseparable, joined at birth. CNN: How has the country inspired your work? AD: India is the source of all my work. It is my material. I have brought in other countries, other nationalities -- but always in their relation to India. CNN: How has India shaped your personality? AD: When I am in the West, I feel very Indian. When I am in India, I feel I have become very westernized. I suppose this means I now have a schizophrenic personality. CNN: Where is your favorite place to go in India? AD: The Himalayas. I was born there and never fail to feel exhilarated when I return to those heights. CNN: What do you miss most about India? AD: Friendship and family relationships. These can never quite be replicated or replaced -- the ease, the familiarity, the intimacy and above all, their history. So, yes, the sense of history, of everything being old, rooted in the past. CNN: How has India changed in your lifetime? AD: Oh, exponentially! I see India as in so many segments of time and experience -- the India (Old Delhi) I grew up in and went to school and university in, then the India (New Delhi) to which I returned as an adult with young children, trying hard to replicate the India I had once known but in a changed landscape. And now the India to which I return after spending more than 30 years away and which is so dreadfully unfamiliar and often uncomfortable that it is almost unrecognizable. CNN: What does the future hold for India? AD: I would have to be a seer to answer that and I am not one. Neither Indians who live in India nor Indians who live abroad and visit know the answer to that. All is chaos at the moment, caught between past and present, old and new, traditional and modern, changeless and changing.","Born in India, Desai is the daughter of a Bengali father and German mother .

"(CNN) -- Three of four former Vanderbilt University football players indicted on charges of rape Friday are now in police custody, according to Nashville Metro Police Department. The men were indicted in connection with the alleged rape of a 21-year-old student in a campus dormitory in June and are each facing multiple criminal charges, according to authorities in Tennessee. Charged are Brandon Vandenburg, 20, of Indio, California; Corey Batey, 19, of Nashville; Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland; and Jaborian McKenzie, 19, of Woodville, Mississippi, according to the Nashville Metropolitan Police Department. Police said each of the four men is charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. Vandenburg was taken into custody at Nashville International Airport as he flew back into the city, police said. He was then taken to the hospital for a state-mandated blood test before being transported to jail. There's no word yet on Vandenburg's bond. Police said McKenzie turned himself in at Nashville police headquarters Saturday morning. He also was taken for the mandatory blood test and is being held in jail on $50,000 bond. Late Friday afternoon, police officers arrested Batey at his Nashville home. He is being held on $350,000 bond. The former Commodore players are charged with raping an unconscious female inside Vandenburg's dorm room on June 23. The alleged rape happened in the Gillette House dormitory, police said. In a statement issued Friday the university said ""Our first thoughts are for the victim, a Vanderbilt student, and we convey to her and her family our deepest sympathies and sorrow. We will continue to offer her all of our services and support."" The incident first came to light when university officials checking the dorm's hallway surveillance recordings regarding an unrelated situation observed unusual behavior by the defendants, police said. That prompted a notification to campus police on June 26. That same day, Vanderbilt University Police called Nashville police into the investigation. Four days later, the four men were dismissed from the football team and suspended from the university amid an investigation. The university and city police announced the dismissals but did not identify the players at that time. Friday's indictments come after what police said was a nonstop investigation and ""tedious and painstaking work"" by detectives over the last six weeks. The university said in its statement that its highest priority is student safety and security, and the university is focused on preventing any future incident like this on campus. ""The charges brought today against the four former Vanderbilt football players allege conduct which is abhorrent and will never be tolerated,"" the statement said. An attorney identified in local media as Batey's lawyer could not be reached. It has not been determined yet whether the two men taken into custody Saturday had retained attorneys. Police said Saturday that Banks, the fourth man indicted, is still at large. Current, former Navy football players charged in sex assault .

"(CNN) -- Edgar Hernandez didn't expect to learn that he was pre-diabetic at age 16. When his mother burst into tears at the doctor's office, it hit him hard. He was 370 pounds and couldn't stand to look at himself. It was tough being a fat kid, but things became unbearable in high school. Edgar was seeing a therapist for depression symptoms. He was frequently bullied in gym class. Kids would point at his ""fat wobbling everywhere,"" especially as he struggled to keep up. ""I tried my best to ignore it. But there were times when I just gave in and started crying,"" said Edgar, who lives in a suburb of St. Louis and is now 18. Everyone in his family had a weight problem; his parents developed type 2 diabetes in their forties. But Edgar was the biggest. ""He would eat two really big burritos or sandwiches a day, packed with cheese, sour cream, a lot of bread, butter,"" his older brother Mario said. ""He would be watching TV, playing video games."" After receiving the sobering blood test result at the doctor's office, Edgar went home and cried. And then something new happened: He owned up to his weight problem. ""It was time to stop blaming others for my choices and make a choice to take responsibility,"" he said. He dried his tears, threw on his jacket and began jogging. He only got about half a mile before he stopped and threw up. That was a year and a half ago. Edgar, who is 5-foot-9, went on to drop nearly 200 pounds. He now weighs 185 pounds. He has traded his double-XL shirts and size 48 pants for medium T-shirts and 33-inch pants. It happened slowly at first. After that gut-impulse jog in November 2012, Edgar started walking before or after school. As he could, he added distance until he was walking about two miles a day. He started to incorporate running intervals until, months later, he could run a full mile. The weight began to come off, but the teen wasn't seeing as much progress as he had hoped. It was his older brother, Mario, who helped him kick the weight loss into high gear. Mario, who carried 235 pounds on his 5-foot-7 frame, was inspired by Edgar's will to change. He took Edgar to the grocery store and together they overhauled the family's pantry. Chicken breasts and fresh produce replaced the processed foods and sodas that were once the staple at home, Mario said. Edgar's typical breakfast became a peanut butter sandwich with honey and banana slices. Dinners usually featured a chicken breast with two cups of broccoli. He didn't have a specific diet or calorie count; it was all about portion sizes, the teen said. The brothers became each other's support. They started running together in January 2013, buying sweatpants and thermal gear to keep them warm in the Illinois weather. Mario has lost 70 pounds and continues to run alongside his brother, Edgar said. The brothers, who live at home with their parents, have seen their weight loss inspire some changes for the whole family, Mario said. The family has cut down on eating out -- once every couple of weeks, as opposed to four to five times a week. ""As a family, we go outside more, walk a little more. It shows because we have a lot more energy,"" Mario said. ""Even though other members haven't lost as much weight, maybe five pounds, you can see it in their faces."" These days, Edgar can't get enough of running. His favorite activities are heavy cardio and weightlifting. The teen even ran his first half-marathon in April, and he's planning another one soon. ""Running is what made me feel happy; I had gotten what they call 'runner's high' and now running has become a lifestyle,"" he said. Edgar has also found his calling in his new healthy lifestyle. He will start college at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville in the fall and plans to study exercise science. For Mario, watching his little brother shed the pounds at such a young age has been a source of pride. ""If you would have told me three years ago that he'd be running a half-marathon, I wouldn't believe you,"" Mario said. ""You see a completely different person that's a lot happier, has more energy and is more active."" Edgar couldn't agree more. ""I wouldn't even step out my door to get the mail before,"" he said. ""People don't see the dark, sad side of me anymore. They see a bright, happy kid."" For the people out there looking to lose weight, the teenager has the following advice: Don't put it off. If you say you're going to run, do it today, not tomorrow. ""Don't wait, because it will get worse,"" he said. ""You'll start putting it off until something serious happens and when something serious happens, it will change your life.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber is completely off the hook for an incident in which a Los Angeles woman accused him of trying to take her cell phone last month. But a Los Angeles prosecutor is expected to soon charge Bieber, 20, with vandalism in a separate incident, the egging of his neighbor's mansion, a source involved in the case told CNN on Monday. The Los Angeles city attorney decided Monday there was ""a lack of evidence"" to prosecute the singer for attempted robbery in connection with an argument with a woman at a miniature golf park last month, according to spokesman Rob Wilcox. The case was handed to the city attorney's office last week for consideration of a misdemeanor charge after the Los Angeles district attorney declined to file a felony charge. Justin Bieber avoids felony robbery charge in cell phone 'tussle' A criminal charge in the egging probe is coming as soon as Monday afternoon, a source told CNN. The Los Angeles County district attorney has been considering the case since February, when sheriff's investigators recommended that Bieber, be charged with felony vandalism for the January incident. The vandalism case is what lawyers call a ""wobbler,"" meaning the district attorney must decide if it will be prosecuted as a felony -- which could have much more serious consequences for the singer -- or as a misdemeanor. There was no indication which charge would be filed against Bieber, the source said. Justin Bieber: 'Don't believe rumors' A spokeswoman for the district attorney declined to confirm the report. ""When something happens, we will let everyone know at the same time,"" Jane Robison told CNN on Monday. The family living in the mansion next to Bieber's in an exclusive Calabasas, California, neighborhood accused the singer of tossing eggs from his yard onto their home. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detectives are pushing for a felony charge, based on the estimated $20,000 in damage caused by the eggs. Is Justin Bieber getting special treatment? Bieber's attorneys met with prosecutors in March to argue that since the egging was ""a silly prank"" and Bieber has no criminal record, it should be treated as a misdemeanor, two sources at the time said. Bieber, 20, has since moved from the neighborhood, selling the mansion to Khloe Kardashian. Bieber's drunken driving charge in Miami is also still pending, although a source close to that case said talks are under way to reach a plea deal to avoid a trial.

"(CNN) -- For the second time in just over a week, Facebook has done an about-face on a feature that has bothered some users for a while. Fewer automatic posts will be showing up in your News Feed telling you what a friend is listening to on Spotify, which level they just defeated on ""Candy Crush"" or when they've posted a filtered selfie on Instagram. The social-media giant has announced it will be giving those posts less clout in its News Feed algorithm -- the tool that decides which posts you're mostly likely to want to see -- while giving extra emphasis to actions your friends choose to share. So, to use the Spotify example, you'll be less likely to see an automatic post when a friend listens to a song but more likely to notice when they share a playlist they just created. ""We've found that stories people choose to explicitly share from third party apps are typically more interesting and get more engagement in News Feed than stories shared from third party apps without explicit action,"" Facebook's Peter Yang wrote in a post on the company's blog for developers. ""We've also heard that people often feel surprised or confused by stories that are shared without taking an explicit action. In the coming months, we will continue to prioritize explicitly shared stories from apps in News Feed over implicitly shared stories."" Yang said that app creators will have to start specifically request that actions from their app be automatically shared. ""If your app is currently publishing stories implicitly, we encourage you to consider these options instead,"" Yang wrote, listing tools that let users tell their friends what they're up to. They include a new tool that lets app users share their activity directly in Messenger chats (say, with all your friends who still play ""FarmVille?"") and the ability to add the ""Like"" button, already appearing on more than 10 million Web pages, to mobile apps. And Facebook is walking the walk, too. Instagram, which Facebook purchased in 2012, was among the first third-party apps to get rid of automatic posts. Reactions on social media have been largely positive, even if many posts have a ""What took you so long?"" feel about them. ""Great news to start my day. I am truly happy,"" wrote Lynda Appell, a Twitter user from Philadelphia. ""Hope Farmville's in there,"" Sarah-Jane Boden, founder of marketing group Soul Providers, added on the networking site. The change came less than a week after Facebook announced that all new users will have their privacy settings default to ""Friends Only"" and that existing users will get messages urging them to make sure their settings are where they want them. Critics have questioned Facebook's commitment to privacy over the course of its 10-year history, claiming the company would prefer users share as openly as possible -- which advertisers like -- than adjust their settings to be more private. But changes in recent months suggest the social platform has decided on a different tack. Last month, Facebook rolled out the ability to log in ""anonymously,"" preventing other websites and third-party apps from collecting data about you.","Facebook says automatic posts from apps are being de-emphasized .

"(CNN) -- Republicans and Democrats have entered into an impeachment frenzy over the past few weeks. The impeachment wars began when a small group of Republicans started to make noise about the possibility of impeaching President Obama. The most high profile of the bunch was former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. In her characteristic way of getting right to the partisan point, Palin published an article on Breitbart.com in which she said, without specifying the exact grounds for her argument beyond her sense of a ""lawless"" president, that, ""It's time to impeach."" Palin was not alone. Several Republicans in Congress had mentioned the possibility of impeachment in the spring, including Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert. On the Sunday morning talk shows, Majority Whip Steve Scalise refused to rule it out. Some observers believe that, even though he has denied the GOP will pursue this option, Speaker of the House John Boehner has fueled the fires by filing a lawsuit against the President over his use of executive power. Democrats have responded by using the threat of impeachment as a fundraising tool. They have blasted out a series of e-mails to supporters asking for money, warning that if Democrats don't do well in the midterm elections in November, the next two years will bring a revival of the late-1990s when House Republicans voted to impeach President Bill Clinton. In one of the messages from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the ""Red Alert"" warning said the speaker's lawsuit ""has opened the door to impeachment,"" according to the White House, and that the Washington Post confirmed Boehner refused to ""say impeachment is off the table."" Indeed, White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer said he would ""not discount the possibility"" of impeachment while the White House press secretary agreed there were some Republicans ""who are running for office, hoping that they can get into office so that they can impeach the President."" The parties are playing games with impeachment, an unfortunate and dangerous development. The impeachment process is meant to be a tool of last resort, a constitutional mechanism through which Congress has the capacity to remove a president who has engaged in criminal behavior, committing ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" When it is simply not possible to wait until the next presidential election to resolve the question of whether someone who has committed serious offenses should be in the White House, this is the only tool Congress has at its disposal. Forty years ago, Congress turned to impeachment when confronted with a president, Richard Nixon, who brazenly used executive power to obstruct an investigation into wrongdoing within his administration surrounding the break-in at the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex. Congress never reached the point of voting to impeach him, though they would have, only because Nixon resigned 40 year ago this week. At other times ""impeachment"" has been much more of a political tool. Often impeachment has been a threat used by opponents of a public figure. Starting in 1961, conservative activists famously carried signs calling for the impeachment of Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, whose court made landmark progressive rulings on issues like school segregation and the rights of crime suspects. ""Save Our Republic: Impeach Earl Warren,"" their banners said. During Reconstruction, ""Radical Republicans"" attempted to impeach Republican President Andrew Johnson for having violated the Tenure of Office Act. The real reason behind their drive to impeach was a frustration with Johnson's failure to enforce the Reconstruction Acts and disagreements with him over how to handle race relations in the post-Civil War period. Most famously, and most relevant to many Republicans who are terrified about their colleagues carrying this too far, the heated partisan climate of the 1990s culminated with the House Republicans voting to impeach President Bill Clinton for lying under oath about the facts in a case involving his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Senate Republicans pulled the Congress back from the brink of convicting Clinton and removing him from office. As Boehner and other Republicans remember, the impeachment backfired on the GOP as Clinton's approval ratings skyrocketed and theirs plummeted. During George W. Bush's presidency, some Democrats called for impeachment based on allegations he had misused executive authority and tricked the public into a war based on the false premise of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction. The current use of impeachment as a political tool comes at a time when all parts of the legislative process seem subject to politicization. Nothing seems to be off limits. In 2011, the nation witnessed how the decision to raise the debt ceiling, the routine process through which Congress agreed to pay for spending that they authorized, became a volatile political weapon used to extract compromises over spending cuts with the draconian threat of sending the nation, and the world, into economic chaos if Obama did not comply. Now we are seeing the same with impeachment, though still in the earliest of stages. But it is important for the leaders of both parties to push back and resist the temptation of reliving the 1990s and using this mechanism as yet another tool in the partisan wars. Fortunately, the nation has not needed to use the impeachment tool very often. Generally mechanisms such as congressional oversight and Justice Department prosecutors have been sufficient to contain presidential misbehavior. That doesn't satisfy the harshest Republican critics of President Obama. They claim he has misused executive power in making adjustments in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, such as delaying the employer mandate. Some also say he has failed to enforce immigration control legislation. Ironically, though Republicans stood by President George W. Bush when he deployed executive power on matters of national security and domestic policy, they now claim that President Obama is circumventing Congress in excessive fashion. The complaints about growing executive power are clearly worthy of debate. Indeed, both parties, who seem to love presidential power when they have it but hate it the rest of the time, should engage in a serious discussion about what has happened to the balance of power in recent decades. But thus far what the Republicans have alleged against President Obama does not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Yet as Nixon reminds us, it is not impossible to imagine a situation where the nation will need the impeachment process again. In 1986 and 1987, the Iran Contra scandal raised the impeachment question when it became clear that high-level national security advisers had consciously violated congressional prohibitions on providing aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. President Ronald Reagan ultimately was not impeached because there was no ""smoking gun"" showing Reagan knew the violations were happening. Yet the tool could have become essential. Impeachment will lose its legitimacy within the public if it becomes a totally politicized process. While it is foolish to imagine that it is possible to ever contain the forces of partisanship, there need to be some limits and political leaders need to draw some lines in the sand. As we remember the events that resulted in Richard Nixon having to step down, the anniversary should be a powerful and important reminder to our nation's leaders to keep their hands off the impeachment tool so that Congress can turn to it only in a true case of emergency.

"(CNN) -- What sounded like the most tragic of accidents -- a dad absentmindedly leaving his toddler in the car on a scorching Georgia day -- is now being treated by police as a horrific crime. Two new details were added to a revised Cobb County criminal warrant Tuesday: Not only did Justin Ross Harris put his son in the car minutes before arriving at work on June 18, but he also returned to his car hours later during his lunch break. Harris placed his son, 22-month-old Cooper, into a rear-facing child restraint in the backseat of his Hyundai Tucson after eating breakfast at a fast-food restaurant. He then drove to his workplace, a Home Depot corporate office about a half-mile away, according to the warrant. Read the criminal warrant (PDF) The 33-year-old father returned to the car during his lunch break, opening the driver's side door ""to place an object into the vehicle,"" the warrant states. Later that afternoon, around 4:16, Harris left his workplace near Vinings, outside Atlanta. Within minutes, he pulled into a shopping center asking for assistance with the toddler, who had been in the car for about seven hours at that point, the warrant says. Did Harris intend to kill his son? Besides felony murder, Harris was charged June 19 with first-degree child cruelty. On Tuesday a magistrate judge downgraded the lesser charge to second-degree child cruelty. Mark Gargaros, a CNN legal analyst, offered this interpretation of the downgrading of that charge Wednesday on ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""It's almost a concession that they don't believe, that the prosecutors don't believe they've got the evidence to say this is intended or premeditated,"" he said. The second-degree warrant says Harris ""did with criminal negligence causes (sic) a child under the age of 18 cruel or excessive physical or mental pain."" The earlier, first-degree child cruelty warrant said the crime occurs when a person ""willfully deprives the child of necessary sustenance to the extent that the child's health or well-being is jeopardized. ..."" ""There's a difference between negligence and gross negligence,"" Cobb Police spokesman Mike Bowman said at a press conference. ""The thing about the negligence is that it could happen to anybody. The gross negligence shows that there's some other circumstances revolving around this."" When a reporter directly asked if authorities think it's malice or negligence, Bowman said, ""I honestly don't have an answer for that question."" But in a seeming contradiction of the charge being downgraded, Cobb County Police Chief John House said Wednesday in a press release, ""The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation."" 'A distressed moment' Witness Dale Hamilton told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that an emotional Harris pulled into the shopping center after purportedly realizing he had forgotten to drop Cooper off at day care at 8:30 a.m. The day care is reportedly located at the Home Depot office where Harris works. ""Laid his son on the ground, started doing CPR trying to resuscitate him. Apparently the child wasn't responding,"" Hamilton told the station. Police saw a crowd, and when officers began to investigate, they saw the child on the ground. Once it became clear that Cooper was dead, Harris had to be physically restrained, police said. ""There were a number of witnesses -- passers-by in the area who observed basically the father in a very distressed moment,"" said Sgt. Dana Pierce of the Cobb County police. Added Hamilton, ""He kept saying, 'What have I done? What have I done?' And that's all that I could ascertain that he was saying."" Medical examiner opinion . Police seemed sympathetic at first, and Pierce told media that Harris apparently forgot the child was in the back of the vehicle while he was at work. The average temperature was about 80 degrees that day, but the mercury topped 92 at the hottest point in the day. Police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the child was pronounced dead at the scene. The child's cause of death was ""consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide,"" the Cobb County Medical Examiner's Office said, according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety release issued Wednesday. The release says the medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death. 'This could happen to anyone' The story of the hapless father making an innocent mistake quickly changed as police released more details. ""Within moments of the first responders getting to the scene and doing their job and questions began to be asked about the moments that led up to their arrival at the scene, some of those answers were not making sense to the first responders,"" Pierce said last week. ""I've been in law enforcement for 34 years. What I know about this case shocks my conscience as a police officer, a father and a grandfather."" When Harris was charged with felony murder and child cruelty, there was vigorous debate over whether the heartbroken father should be punished. Surely, he had suffered enough, many thought. A change.org petition was started urging authorities to release Harris. That petition was withdrawn Thursday, with this note explaining: ""I think that based on the recent developments this petition is no longer relevant. I still pray that this was truly an accident. If that is the case, the DA now knows that the community does not want Justin prosecuted on murder charges."" Atlanta area resident Erin Krans started a second change.org petition asking prosecutors to drop the charges. It has garnered hundreds of signatures and was still operational as of 8:30 p.m. Thursday. 'A happy baby' According to an obituary on legacy.com, Cooper ""was a happy baby. He loved to speak with anyone and made impacts on many people's lives in his short time."" The toddler loved cars and trucks and would tell them goodbye as he left parking lots, the obituary said, adding that he had just learned the color red. ""As we passed red vehicles he would tell his mommy and his daddy, 'Bye red car, bye red truck.' He was a joy and will always be cherished,"" it said. Last week, Harris pleaded not guilty to felony murder and child cruelty charges. He's being held without bond at the Cobb County Jail and is scheduled to appear before a county judge July 3. Cooper's mother, Leanna Harris, told CNN last week that she's been advised not to discuss the case with the media. ""We have been in communication with the mother throughout the investigation. At this time, I'm not at liberty to discuss her involvement. That's a part of the case our detectives are working on,"" Pierce said. Repeated calls to the father's attorney have not been returned, and a woman answering the phone at H. Maddox Kilgore's office said the lawyer would not be commenting at this time. Home Depot said through spokeswoman Catherine Woodling that, per company policy, Harris is on a leave of absence without pay. ""It is not appropriate to comment on any new developments in this active investigation. Like the rest of our community, we're deeply saddened by this tragic event and we continue to cooperate with authorities on their ongoing investigation,"" she said in an e-mail.

"(CNN) -- Megaupload users have gotten at least a two-week reprieve during which the file-sharing company says it hopes their files and other stored data can be retrieved, not deleted. The news comes days after a federal prosecutor said user data on the site, which is accused of knowingly hosting illegally pirated material, could be deleted as early as this week. Megaupload's attorney now says the companies that own the servers where the files are stored have agreed to wait while a solution is pursued. ""Carpathia and Cogent agreed to preserve consumer data for additional time of at least two weeks so #Megaupload can work with US on proposal,"" attorney Ira Rothken said late Monday on Twitter. One of those companies, Carpathia Hosting, said Tuesday that it's working with Internet-rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation to help users get their data back. ""Although Carpathia does not have, and has never had, access to the content on Megaupload's servers, the hosting provider wants to assist lawful users of the Megaupload service by promoting EFF and its nonprofit legal services,"" the company said in a statement. The company has created a website, megaretrieval.com, to help those users. Federal prosecutors on Friday had said files, presumably including perfectly legal ones, may be deleted, starting as soon as Thursday. ""It is our understanding that the hosting companies may begin deleting the contents of the servers beginning as early as February 2, 2012,"" U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride said in a letter filed in federal court. The letter, submitted Friday in the Eastern District of Virginia, says that government investigators had finished executing search warrants at centers where Megaupload and MegaVideo files are stored. MacBride wrote that the government copied some data but didn't remove any. Now that the search has been finished, the government no longer has access to the servers, he said. Seven people associated with the popular site were indicted this month on charges that they knowingly operated an ""international organized criminal enterprise"" allowing worldwide sharing of illegally pirated movies, music and other media. Attorneys for Megaupload, which is based in Hong Kong, have denied the charges. The indictment alleges the company has denied copyright holders an estimated $500 million and that those indicted have earned roughly $175 million in the process. Lost in the shuffle, though, may be millions of legitimate files stored on the site by its users. According to the government's indictment, Megaupload has claimed more than 180 million registered users in its five-year existence. While some of those users say they went to the site to look for movies, television shows and other material that may be copyrighted, numerous others have complained that they've lost access to personal and professional materials stored there. In the Carpathia statement, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the group is ""troubled"" that lawful users have ""had their property taken from them without warning and that the government has taken no steps to help them."" ""We think it's important that these users have their voices heard as this process moves forward,"" said Julie Samuels, a staff attorney at the foundation.","Companies have two weeks to save Megaupload files, lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- The attorney for Ohio State University's fired marching band director contends the university report that led to Jonathan Waters' firing was ""deeply flawed."" Waters, a former assistant band director and former sousaphone player in the marching band in the 1990s, was fired last week after a university investigation concluded he ""knew or reasonably should have known about sexual harassment that created a hostile environment."" ""The report is deeply flawed. Out of 225 band members, over an eight-week period, Ohio State University managed to interview exactly four, including the person who made the complaint, and three people to whom she referred the university,"" Waters attorney David F. Axelrod said on Monday. Axeldrod added that of the thousands of local OSU alumni, the university interviewed just five during its two-month investigation. ""With that sort of a skewed sample, the report does not accurately portray anything and cannot be relied on for the facts."" The report, released last Wednesday, described longtime traditions in the band like sexually explicit nicknames and something called the ""midnight ramp,"" in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear. The report alleged staff members, including Waters, were present for the annual event. Axelrod denied this allegation during an interview with CNN on Monday. ""They did not march on the field in their underwear. That's something, even in that area, the report couldn't get it right,"" he said. Axelrod says the so-called ""midnight ramp"" was not a mandatory event but a ""welcoming practice."" He described an e-mail he received from a former band member. ""No one who didn't want to participate had to participate. If you didn't want to march in your underwear, you didn't have to,"" the attorney said in detailing the e-mail. He went on to say the woman who sent him the e-mail ""wore a tank top and gym shorts when she marched in it."" ""I've gotten e-mail after e-mail from former band members saying exactly the same thing,"" Axelrod said.. An audio recording, purportedly of Waters yelling and cursing at a band member, surfaced on Sunday. On the tape released by Ohio State University, the fired band director is heard shouting at a member who contradicted him during practice. ""You ever do that again after we've given you a direct g*****n order, and you're done. Do you understand?"" Axelrod conceded Monday that Waters knew about some of the band's bad behavior, but he said Waters did ""everything he possibly could to end it."" ""You know he experienced inappropriate behavior as a rookie band member himself. He was deeply affected by it and that's why as band director he did everything he could to stop anything inappropriate,"" the attorney said. But the university didn't think Waters did enough in the 21 months he led the marching band, first as interim director, then as band director. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our students,"" OSU President Michael Drake said. ""We expect every member of our community to live up to a common standard of decency and mutual respect and to adhere to university policies."" The university has appointed former Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery to lead an independent task force to further investigate the situation and ensure steps are taken to change the band culture, Drake said. The Ohio State University marching band is considered one of the best college marching bands in the country. The band calls itself ""the best damn band in the land."" It shot to fame with an amazing halftime show tribute to Michael Jackson in 2013 that has garnered millions of YouTube views. CNN's John Berman and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","Attorney: OSU report on marching band ""sexualized"" culture is ""deeply flawed""

"London, England (CNN) -- Every week, Global Connections chooses two countries and asks you to find connections between them. Once again, thanks to all of you who took the time to post a comment on the Global Connections blog. Here are some of the connections that you found between Sweden and Malaysia, as well as some other highlights. We started the week by speaking to Craig Glenday , editor-in-chief of the Guinness Book of World Records. He told CNN's Becky Anderson that both countries share a passion for LAN (Local Area Network) parties -- playing computer games over a local network. And both countries are record breakers in this regard. Sweden holds the world record for the largest (11,000 people) LAN party, while Malaysia holds the record for the longest (around 40 hours). Khairol Idham sent an iReport saying that Malaysians love heavy metal bands  from Sweden. And lead vocalist with Swedish death metal band, Arch Enemy, Angela Gossow got in touch to say that the feeling is mutual. ""We love Malaysia and the fans there,"" she said, and looks forward to touring the country in 2011. Continuing the musical theme, CNN spoke to two of Sweden's biggest music acts of recent years. Pop princess Robyn said she was proud to be Swedish. Jose Gonzalez also gave Global Connections an insight into his upbringing in Gothenburg and his many musical influences. ""Ahmad Rithaudin Md Noor"" and ""Jonny"" contacted the blog and Kai Xun Hong sent an iReport to say that many people in Malaysia love the Swedish furniture store IKEA . Mei Mei Yap from Malaysia has created the brilliant ""IKEA Hacker"" blog, which features great ideas for how to customize your IKEA furniture. If you want to make speakers from salad bowls, or make a hamster run from a BILLY bookcase click here. ""Shamsul,"" ""Barbara,"" ""Elizabeth"" and ""Andrew"" all correctly pointed out that Malaysia and Sweden are home to some of the world's most beautiful island groups. Malaysia is part of the Malay Archipelago and Sweden has tens of thousands of islands -- 24,000 in the Stockholm Archipelago alone. ""Helena Svensson"" and  ""cyee"" correctly pointed out that both countries have monarchies. CNN's Becky Anderson found out that the connections run a bit deeper, when she spoke to Malaysian royal , Tunku Naquiyuddin and former marshal of the Swedish Royal Court, Elisabeth Tarras-Wahlberg. We also featured Malaysian teenager Nabil Jeffri, who became the youngest ever Formula One test driver recently when he conducted an aerodynamics test for Lotus Racing. CNN spoke to the 16-year-old and Lotus team boss and AirAsia CEO, Tony Fernandes about his prodigious talent. Finally, we explored the phenomenon of the Stieg Larsson ""Millennium"" tour in Stockholm, where tourists are flocking to follow in the footsteps of the late author's characters portrayed in his books and more film adaptations. Please keep your comments coming in and let us know if you can connect our next countries. We want to know if you can find links between Panama and the United Arab Emirates. Got any ideas? If you have, leave a message on the blog and we'll investigate the best on Connect the World this week. Happy connecting!","Did you find a link between Sweden and Malaysia?

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indians want their version of the American Dream. Even the Chinese Dream will do. And so they have voted for a man who promises more for less: more development and growth, with less government and red tape. For India's 1.27 billion dreamers, their new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a known commodity. His simple mandate is to do for India what he has done for the north western state of Gujarat in the last 12 years: conjure up Chinese-levels of growth and prosperity. But for Modi's counterparts in Washington, Beijing, and Islamabad, India's new leader is considered a wildcard. Will he be aggressive, or a dove? What is his foreign policy? Does he have a vision for India's place in the world? There's very little to go on. Modi has never addressed foreign policy at length; Indian campaigns rarely involve debates on world affairs. Few in New Delhi seem to have a clear sense of his plans. When I spoke with Arun Shourie, a former Indian minister now being touted as a top candidate to head the finance ministry, I got a telling response: ""Anyone who says they know Modi's plans, doesn't really know anything. The ones who know won't talk."" So let's start with the few signals we've received from the man himself. Reaching out to neighbors . Modi has certainly begun with a flourish, scoring a coup in getting his Pakistani counterpart to attend his swearing-in. On Monday, Nawaz Sharif became the first Pakistani Prime Minister in history to attend an Indian prime minister's inauguration. The two men were photographed exchanging a firm handshake. Modi later tweeted that Sharif had ""shared some very emotional things"" during their meeting. He elaborated with a story about how Sharif's mother became emotional when watching Modi's mother offering him sweets. (Read the series of tweets here) Modi's Twitter account also highlights his early attempts to strengthen ties with his new counterparts. After his election, he announced to his 4.38 million followers congratulatory messages from U.S. President Barack Obama, Israel's PM Netanyahu, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's Hollande, Russia's Putin, as well as leaders from New Zealand, Fiji, Qatar, Afghanistan and more. Japan got an especially lavish mention: ""Personally, I have a wonderful experience of working with Japan as [Chief Minister of Gujarat.],"" Modi tweeted. ""I am sure we will take India-Japan ties to newer heights."" Japan's PM Shinzo Abe follows only three people on Twitter -- Modi, of course, is one of them. Twitter diplomacy is not just about rhetoric -- there have been some early results, too. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse tweeted Sunday: ""As a goodwill measure on the occasion of @narendramodi's swearing-in, President instructs officials to release Indian fishermen in custody."" None of the above sheds light on what kind of vision Modi has, but it is indeed a refreshing marker of proactive engagement -- the opposite of India's foreign policy in years gone by. In an excellent essay in Foreign Affairs last month, Manjari Chatterjee Miller described how Indian foreign policy in the last 50 years has been characterized ""more by continuity than by change"" -- irrespective of the party in power. 'Non-alignment' India's relations with major powers have stayed stable. Broadly, there are two reasons behind this trend. One is India's historic pledge of ""non-alignment"": the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru founded the global Non-Aligned Movement, a group of states agreeing to not align with major powers. The other reason is India's neglect of foreign policy planning from the very top: civil servants get little-to-no instruction from the prime minister's office, and so have great levels of autonomy and wield significant power. The result is no clear vision from New Delhi, and a general stasis in India's relations with the world. It has often been pointed out that India has fewer diplomats than Singapore, a country with a population 1/250th the size of India's. India has consistently punched below its weight despite aspiring to be a global player. Will Modi change these trends? Again, it is difficult to read his mind. But turn again to what Modi has actually said. The writer Dhruva Jaishanker points out that Modi has repeatedly stated that foreign policy begins at home. This is not to suggest that Modi will be insular. Instead, his relations with other countries will be driven by business needs and a sense of realism -- perhaps similar, in theory, to China's relations with South Asian and African states. Many writers and commentators have expressed fears about Modi's foreign policy on two main fronts. First, that he will channel his brand of pro-Hindu nationalism into friction with Pakistan. Second, that he will use his prior history with Washington -- Modi's U.S. visa was revoked in 2005 over a never-before-used religious freedoms act -- as a reason to snub the world's biggest economy. On both fronts, we have no way of confirming those fears just yet. But with each passing day, we are witnessing an evolving Modi, a realist whose goal is to grow India Inc. and do business with anyone -- at home or abroad -- who can help achieve that goal. Modi's real test will be whether he can bring a longer-term vision to India's foreign policy planning. Will he keep New Delhi non-aligned? Will he pivot further East? Will he help fulfil Obama's prediction that India and the U.S. will form the 21st century's defining partnership? Only Modi knows the answers. But if Indian foreign policy has so far not been driven by the prime minister's office, I think we can now expect that strange quirk to change. For better or worse, Prime Minister Modi will take charge.","India's new prime minister has promised citizens growth and prosperity .
What's less clear is how Narendra Modi will approach foreign policy .
Modi has wasted no time connecting with other foreign leaders .
In the past India's foreign policy has been more about continuity than change ."

"(CNN) -- Passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight experienced an unexpected bump Sunday when the plane rolled off the runway after landing in Detroit. Flight 753 from Las Vegas was trying to turn onto a taxiway when it slipped off the pavement, according to the Wayne County Airport Authority. It's not clear yet what caused the plane to slide off course, spokesman Scott Wintner said. ""It was like a toboggan ride down the runway, and we just couldn't make the turn at the end, and we slid off the runway into the grass,"" passenger Steve Maranowski told CNN affiliate WDIV. The aircraft, carrying 153 passengers and six crew members, was pulled back onto the taxiway and towed to the gate, according to Delta spokesman Anthony Black. The plane was not damaged, and no one was injured, Black said. Passengers spent about two and a half hours on the taxiway, Maranowski told WDIV. ""The problem was they had to wait for the salt trucks, wait for the towing company, and wait for the operations to get it out,"" he said. Black said Delta and the airport will investigate to determine operating conditions at the time of the incident.","Plane slides off a taxiway after landing in Detroit .

"(CNN) -- It was Donald Trump's long-held dream. To build the best links golf course in the world in Scotland, as a tribute to his late mother who was born in the country. But it is fast turning into a nightmare for the billionaire business tycoon. After initial opposition to the project from environmental groups, Trump now has a green problem of his own, in the shape of an offshore wind farm. With the Trump International Golf Links ready for action from July, Trump has shelved plans for an adjoining hotel until a decision is made on the wind farm. Blowing in the wind: Trump to ditch $1bn Scottish golf resort? And he was in Scotland this week to accuse the government of luring him into his Â£1 bn project by telling him the offshore developemtn would never be built. He told CNN he plans to sue, unless the development is abandoned. ""If an administration that's previous gives a statement, and if you rely on that statement, and then you build and spend tens of millions of pounds in this case, building this great course -- if you do that and rely on certain statements, and the next administration say 'Well, we're not going to (do that)', then I think that is unfair.. ""I don't think that is good business. I think people looking to invest in Scotland will look at this and say 'Well, we'll invest some place else.' ""I will sue if they try to advance it further, I will be suing Scotland."" Trump said he would never have begun his project on the east coast of Scotland if he thought the mooted wind farm was a possibility. He says he received assurances from Alex Salmond at a dinner in New York back in 2007 that the offshore development, which is just a mile from his course, would not go ahead. Trump told the committee that pursuing the construction of wind farms could, in his opinion, be the ruination of Scotland. ""The last thing I needed was to build a course in Scotland,"" he told CNN. ""But the land was so incredible and in honor of my mother, who was born in Scotland, I thought it'd be a great idea. ""So I decided to do it and it came out even better than I thought."" Two groups of protestors gathered outside the Scottish parliament for Trump's visit -- those who support his opposition to wind farms, and those who claim his development has spoiled an area of outstanding natural beauty. But advocates of Scotland's policy of embracing renewable energy projects insist the government should not be blown off course by entrepreneurs like Trump. Niall Stuart, CEO of Scottish Renewables, insists the country's reputation for being at the forefront of the sustainable energy campaign must be maintained. ""Our government is absolutely committed to maximizing not just the environmental benefits of renewable energy but also the economic and employment benefits of renewable energy,"" he told CNN. ""Actually it's that political commitment to renewables that has put Scotland on the map internationally.""","Tycoon Donald Trump threatens to sue the Scottish government over wind farm plans .

"(CNN)  -- Serena Williams says she hopes to return to tennis in May or June after undergoing surgery to remove a blood clot from her lungs. The 29-year-old American -- who has not played a competitive match since winning her fourth Wimbledon title in July 2010 -- is recuperating after going under the knife at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Williams had emergency surgery on a haematoma on Monday after she was treated for a pulmonary embolism last week. Williams said in a statement: ""Thank you everyone for all of your prayers, concerns, and support. ""This has been extremely hard, scary, and disappointing. I am doing better, I'm at home now and working with my doctors to keep everything under control. ""I know I will be OK, but am praying and hoping this will all be behind me soon. While I can't make any promises now on my return, I hope to be back by early summer. ""That said, my main goal is to make sure I get there safely."" Williams' representative, Nicole Chabot, issued a statement confirming her client was now on the road to recovery. The statement said: ""Serena did indeed suffer from a pulmonary embolism last week, and the hematoma was another unexpected scare. ""Thankfully everything was caught in time. With continued doctor visits to monitor her situation, she is recuperating at home under strict medical supervision."" Williams, who is sixth in the list of all-time grand slam winners with 13 titles to her name, has been out of action after undergoing two operations on the right foot she injured on broken glass at a restaurant, putting her long-term future in doubt.

"(CNN) -- Last week a leaked draft of a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that climate change will have severe ramifications for the global food supply, making it harder for crops to survive and leading to rising food prices. This report, scheduled for publication in March, provides the latest evidence of the dramatic impacts that the shifting climate is already beginning to have on the planet and on human societies. Clearly, climate change is a global challenge unlike any other we face, which is why I, along with a small but growing number of progressives, support a unique and potentially surprising solution to it. It is time for policymakers to recognize that nuclear power must be a robust part of our nation's energy plan to reduce carbon emissions. These may seem like strange words coming from a liberal whose family has been active in progressive politics, and who grew up on a Wisconsin goat farm in a home heated by wood fires. Like many of my fellow progressives, I care deeply about the environment and the future of our planet, which is precisely why I do not think we should be reflexively shutting the door on a technology that may be able to help address global climate change. Energy production is the largest single contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Some people believe that we can solve climate change by reducing global energy demand and switching to solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. But, as I've seen first hand in Latin America, people in the developing world are consuming an increasing amount of energy as they seek to live the modern lives that we in the West enjoy. As a result, studies show that energy demand is actually poised to triple, or even quadruple, over the next century. As much as we might instinctively prefer renewable energy sources like solar and wind to meet this energy demand, last year solar provided a mere 0.1 percent of America's electricity, while wind provided just 3.5 percent -- and that is after at least $34 billion was funneled into clean energy projects from the Obama stimulus package. Meanwhile, 19% of U.S. electricity comes from nuclear power plants; that number rises to 60% among clean energy sources. We need all the help we can get from renewable energy, but it's a risky bet that wind and solar alone will be able to provide 100% of America's energy, let alone meet a global energy demand three times the size it is today. If we are going to address climate change and help the global poor live longer, healthier lives, then, we need to begin a vigorous public discussion about other low-carbon energy options that are quickly scalable -- including nuclear power. Whatever your view, this is a conversation worth having. My own interest in creating a dialogue about nuclear energy inspired me to become one of the backers of the independent documentary, ""Pandora's Promise,"" which chronicles the conversion stories of prominent environmentalists who have become pro-nuclear. In our sharply divided political culture, there is a real shortage of these kinds of conversations. I believe both sides of the spectrum desperately need to open up more actual conversations rather than shutting down ideas and possibilities. After the failures of cap and trade and the United Nations climate treaty, nuclear energy could be a place where left and right find common ground on energy. Only if we are willing to reexamine our previous assumptions, and open up new spaces for dialogue, will we have any chance of addressing our nation's many complex challenges. I know that many people, my fellow liberals in particular, are deeply skeptical about nuclear energy. But whatever you believe, I encourage you to do some research on nuclear energy -- and to do so with an open mind. After all, the root of the word ""progressive"" is ""progress,"" and I believe progress only happens with enough openness to arrive at new solutions. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- For more than half a year, super PACs and other third-party advertisers have aired misleading attacks against Republican Massachusetts incumbent Sen. Scott Brown and his probable Democratic opponent, professor Elizabeth Warren. (You can see a sample of these ads at FlackCheck.org.). By calling on these groups to stay out of their contest, Brown and Warren are attempting to do something about ""air pollution"" in their state. There's a way that Massachusetts viewers and TV and radio stations in the state can help them achieve that goal. The same option is available in the presidential contest, in which the leading Republican presidential contenders have called repeatedly on their third-party champions and challengers to forgo deception. Like those of Warren and Brown, their complaints are justified. In South Carolina and in Florida, the pro-Romney super PAC that calls itself ""Restoring Our Future"" wrongly accused former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of supporting legislation facilitating abortion in China and of being ""fined"" $300,000 for ethics violations when instead he was required to reimburse the costs of the investigation. The same pseudonymous group also invited the false conclusion that former Sen. Rick Santorum had voted to restore voting rights to felons who were still serving time. To this mix, in South Carolina the pro-Stephen Colbert super PAC that styled itself ""Making a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow "" added a funny but flawed ad that showed ""Mitt the Ripper"" shredding the names of companies that had met their demise under (here's the misleading part) someone else's watch. Romney's history at Bain elicited another third-party volley in Florida in the form of an American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees' (AFSCME) ad that wrongly attempted to enmesh the former governor in Medicare fraud at a Bain-owned company. Not to be outdone, the pro-Gingrich super PAC cloaked in the name ""Winning Our Future"" has trafficked out the false allegation that Romney's health reform in Massachusetts is ""government-run health care"" (a claim repeatedly debunked by fact-checkers) that ""sent costs spiraling out of control, hiking premiums, squeezing household budgets"" when, instead, as Politifact noted, ""cost increases for individual households are largely due to the fact that health care costs have been rising across the country."" While recent court decisions ensure that uprooting super PACS from the political landscape is a fool's errand, making their deceptive televised claims vanish is easier. The reason? Where, with some exceptions, TV and radio stations are required to air (and are barred from censoring) federal candidates' ads, no such requirements govern the messages of outside groups. And, significantly, stations have the right to insist on the accuracy of the ""independent expenditure"" ads they accept. So the answer to ""air pollution"" by super PACs is simple: Television and radio stations should just say no to misleading third-party ads. To increase their incentive to do so in a world where ad revenue bolsters the bottom line, viewers might want to tweet or blog (or send something once known as a letter) applauding responsible station action or decrying business as usual.

"(CNN) -- Almost a month after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared, searchers say pulse signals detected in the Indian Ocean provide the best hope so far for finding it. However, those same officials warn it will take time to confirm if the sonar pings come from the missing plane, meaning nothing is certain yet. The new information raises more questions about what the pulse signals mean and what happens now. Is this it? Maybe. An Australian ship using high-tech U.S. equipment has twice detected signals along the suspected flight path of the airliner off its country's western coast. Angus Houston, who heads the rescue effort, told reporters that a device called a towed pinger locator on the vessel Ocean Shield received signals similar to the kind that the aircraft's on board data and cockpit voice recorders would emit. The first detection, which occurred over the weekend, lasted more than two hours before the ship lost contact, Houston said. A second detection several hours later lasted 13 minutes, and more importantly, included two separate signals audible to the locator device, he said. Two signals could mean they came from the so-called black boxes, as expected. ""It's probably the best information that we have had,"" Houston said before immediately noting that ""we haven't found the aircraft yet; we need further confirmation."" A promising lead . Why this may be it . The signals reported were near the 37.5 kHz ""standard beacon frequency"" of the recorders, officials say. That frequency was chosen for use to avoid interference from other ocean noises as much as possible. In addition, the two pulse signals detected at the same time would be consistent with the two emitters on the plane. Also, the location where the signals were detected is along the missing plane's probable flight path, according to the latest analysis of its known direction and fuel capacity. Houston said the new information on the likely flight path helped narrow the search area. ""With the acoustic events that we're getting in the area, we are encouraged that we're very close to where we need to be,"" Houston said, later adding: ""This is quite an extraordinary set of circumstances that we're now in a very well-defined search area which hopefully will eventually yield the information that we need to say MH370 might have entered the water just here."" On Saturday, a Chinese ship detected a single pulse signal more than 300 miles further south, also near the most recently projected flight path. Houston said the distance made it ""unlikely"" the Chinese ship and Australian vessel detected the same signal, but added ""in deep water, funny things happen with acoustic signals."" Why this may not be it . From the beginning, search officials have stressed the long odds against figuring out where the plane might be without visible evidence such as wreckage. For now, all we have are some pulse signals, Houston said, and in the ocean, those could be from a number of things. ""This has been done without finding any wreckage thus far, and I think it's quite extraordinary and what I'd like to see now is us find some wreckage because that will basically help solve the mystery,"" Houston explained, adding that ""without wreckage, we can't say it's definitely here."" Next steps . Oceanographers note that the ocean is full of sonar sounds, including whale calls and signals emitted by research equipment left on the bottom to help find it later. While the frequency of the black box signals are intended to be unique, other sounds can cause confusion, they note. ""Unlike in air where sound travels in a straight line, acoustic energy -- sound through the water -- is greatly affected by temperature, pressure and salinity,"" explained Peter Leavy, commander of the military task force conducting the search. ""And that has the effect of attenuating, bending -- sometimes through 90 degrees -- sound waves. So it is quite possible and very hard to predict -- it's quite possible for sound to travel great distances laterally but be very difficult to hear near the surface of the ocean, for instance."" On Monday, U.S. Navy Commander William Marks told CNN from the search operation that the inability of the Ocean Shield's pinger locator to find the signals again more than a day since the last reception caused initial optimism to become ""more and more cautious."" What next? The Ocean Shield and its towed pinger locator continue to search the area where it detected the signals to try to hear them again. If they do, searchers would send out a Bluefin-21 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle with a more accurate sonar and possibly a camera for mapping and studying the the ocean floor, Leavy said. ""At the moment that's not deployed,"" he told reporters. ""The focus is on trying to reacquire the acoustic signal that they had"" by the end of Tuesday. Meanwhile, the website MarineTraffic.com indicated Monday that three ships were searching a spot further to the south where the Haixun 01, a Chinese patrol boat, reportedly detected pulse signals on Saturday. Another Chinese vessel and the HMS Echo of Britain's Royal Navy joined the Haixun 01 in the area, according to the website, which has been reliable in reporting the movements of search vessels. Officials had said they would send additional resources to help the Haixun 01 try to find the source of pulse signals it detected on the same 37.5 kHz frequency used by airplane recorders. A major question is how long the batteries in the recorders will last. They have a 30-day expectancy when activated, and the plane disappeared on March 8, which was 31 days ago. ""We're already one day past the advertised shelf life,"" Houston said. ""We hope that it keeps going for a little bit longer."" Relatives react . Confirmation that the signal comes from the Boeing 777 would mean ""the possibility of recovering the plane -- or at least the black boxes -- goes from being one in a million to almost certain,"" said Simon Boxall, a lecturer in ocean and earth science at the University of Southampton.

"London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past. The best-selling author of ""Wild Swans,"" an account of three generations of women in her family, Chang gained a following for her frank portrait of life in China in the 20th century. More recently, she's made waves with ""Mao: The Unknown Story"" -- the scathing, 800-plus page biography of the Chinese leader that she wrote with her husband, historian Jon Halliday. Born in 1952 in Sichuan, a province in China's southwest, Chang came of age during the height of the Cultural Revolution. She served briefly as a Red Guard and worked a variety of odd jobs in the countryside before turning to studying English. She left China for Britain in 1978 to further her studies and earned a doctorate in linguistics. She rose to literary fame after ""Wild Swans"" was published in 1991. ""Mao: The Unknown Story,"" which took a decade to research, was released in 2005. CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.  CNN: Your memoir and biography of Mao use different means to tell a story about China's recent history. Why is it so important to tell this story? Jung Chang: Well, it's very important to me. ""Wild Swans"" is the story of my family -- my grandmother, my mother and myself. I started writing the book after my mother told me the stories of her life and my grandmother's life. So those things are written primarily for myself. And then with Mao, there is still a lot of myth about him perpetuated in China today. I feel the Chinese don't know about the real man and the world still knows relatively little about him. I, myself, when I started writing the book in the early 1990s felt I didn't know all that much. I wanted to find out more, then tell the story to the world. CNN: Your books are banned in China. How does that make you feel? JC: I feel frustrated and very unhappy of course. The Chinese should be allowed to remember. What happened under Mao affected so many people's lives, and that sort of agony and that terrifying past has not been properly processed in people's memories. I think that's not healthy. But my books are published in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is still largely separate from mainland China, which is wonderful from my point of view as a writer. It means many copies have gone into mainland China from Hong Kong. CNN: China is such a rapidly changing country. What changes stand out most to you? JC: I think particularly in the initial years what stuck me most was the dramatic diminishment of fear. When I was growing up, we lived in fear all the time. People aren't living like that any longer. People are under the impression that China is what it is today because Mao had laid the foundation. Far from it. Mao held the country back. The dramatic change that happened after Mao died was because he had died. The force and the terror that held the Chinese back, was suddenly removed. Of course now there is a dramatic improvement in people's lives, in all aspects, not only material but in terms of personal freedom, the freedom of travel and lots of other personal freedoms. Of course, having said all that, there are still many things that frustrate me. There is still no freedom of expression in the public arena. Books are banned, including my books, which is intensely frustrating. CNN: What future do you see for the country and what do you hope for? JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time. People's lives will probably continue to improve slowly but there will still be repression in many ways. I hope, of course, for the obvious and the best -- I want people to enjoy the kind of freedom they do in Britain for example. From my point of view as a writer, I hope the country will find a way to talk about the past in an honest way -- to debate about the past without inhibition. CNN: What do you miss most about China? JC: I sometimes ask myself this question, but I realize I don't miss any particular thing. What I miss is something intangible. China -- as a culture, as a people -- is something that I care about. It is under my skin. But exactly what it is that makes me feel restless, I'm not sure. I guess I miss the whole place, the people who have been through so much and the country, which is so old and yet so young and energetic. It has experienced so much tragedy and yet remains so optimistic and upbeat. All these things make tears come to my eyes.","Jung Chang came to fame in 1991 for her account of life in Communist China .

"(CNN) -- Leave it to an old naturalist to make rivers sound sexy. ""The rivers flow not past, but through us,"" John Muir wrote in the 1870s, ""thrilling, tingling, vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies, making them glide and sing."" If only we still felt that way in 2014. Today, rivers aren't thrilling much of anybody. They're invisible. We don't travel by river, rarely visit their banks. We don't know their stories. That's most of us, at least. I've discovered as part of my reporting on rivers for CNN's Change the List project, that there remains a vital sect of pleasantly anachronistic River People. They're folks who don't mind smelling like mildew; who affix clips and carabineers to everything in sight; and who still value adventure over efficiency. Related: My trip down 'Apocalypse River' I learned many of you are among them. When I put out a request for readers to send in photos and stories about their favorite rivers, I wondered if anyone would respond -- if anyone still took photos of rivers, still cared about them. But, to my delight, 89 people have submitted stories on CNN iReport -- and dozens more have uploaded images to Instagram. You're people like Darren Palm, who sent in black-and-white photos of his grandfather catching salmon on California's Kings River; like Julee Khoo, who wrote that her trip on the Yangtze River ""will forever link me to my grandmother who was born and raised in China""; like Maureen Moore, who's photographed the Hudson River in New York when it's covered in ice and when it's teeming with boats; and Sandi Kubbs, a Polio survivor, who wrote that, ""who I became is intrinsically tied up with my life rowing up and down the Little Wabash."" If anyone is going to save our rivers, it's you. The good people at CNN iReport have compiled these submissions into a list of ""Our favorite rivers."" This list isn't clickbait, nor is it nature porn. For many, it's nothing short of a protest -- an assertion that a river-first view will lead to a better world. As rivers have become invisible, they've started to dry up -- and without much public alarm. The Colorado, the Rio Grande, the San Joaquin (which I recently spent three weeks kayaking). These mighty waters often fail to reach the ocean. And many others are gunked up with pollution. The Mississippi -- which one of you, Neal Moore, traveled from source to sea -- dumps so much fertilizer into the Gulf of Mexico that it creates an aquatic dead zone the size of Connecticut. We've strangled that river with so much concrete that it can't bring enough life-giving sediment to the coast. A football field of wetlands floats away each hour. We're trashing our rivers, but there is an antidote: Telling their stories. Thanks to all of you for honoring these precious waterways. And, if you see one that's missing, there's still time to tell us about your favorite river.","CNN compiles a list of ""your favorite rivers"" from submissions .

"(CNN) -- The aroma of rich coffee wafts through the air as Xolile Malindi leans behind the counter of House of Machines, a hip cafÃ© in the heart of Cape Town. Opposite him, a young customer approaches the bar, taking his wallet out to pay for his double espresso made of organic Arabica beans. ""Have you ever heard of this program called the SnapScan?"" Malindi, who is the coffee shop's day manager, asks quickly. ""You pay with your phone,"" he continues. ""A lot of places are using it in Cape Town -- it's quite amazing."" House of Machines is just one of dozens of stores here where customers can find SnapScan, an award-winning new digital mobile payment method developed in South Africa. The smartphone app, which is free to download, allows buyers to pay for goods using their phone, without having to worry about carrying cash or credit cards. How it works . Each SnapScan-connected store has a unique code that is linked to their bank account. When customers want to pay, they can scan the code with their SnapScan smartphone app, which then brings up the store where they are making the purchase. ""All you do is you type in the amount and punch in the PIN and press send and it's gone -- it's all done,"" explains Malindi. ""You've got your secret code (four-digit PIN), so if your phone goes missing for example, you don't have to worry about people using your phone,"" he adds. The transaction is complete with SnapScan charging the customer's debit or credit card for the amount they are paying -- similar to a normal card payment. Cutting-edge . Using your phone to pay for goods and services is nothing new in Africa, a continent where there are more than 720 million mobile phones. Services such as M-Pesa, the revolutionary Kenyan mobile payment system that allows people to bypass banks and pay bills, withdraw salaries and transfer cash electronically, have transformed the way people and business operate. Meanwhile, Africa's smartphone market is expected to double over the following four years -- at the moment, South Africa is reportedly the biggest smartphone market in sub-Saharan Africa, with a 19% penetration. And as smartphones increase, the paying methods are also becoming smarter. ""If you look at mobile payments specifically, Africa is actually one of the leaders in this space,"" says Kobus Ehlers, co-founder of the SnapScan app. ""SnapScan was developed in South Africa for the African market, so we try to find really local and relevant solutions and I think it's going to get a massive uptake,"" he adds. ""Technology in general is going to get a massive uptake in Africa as we don't have those legacy systems,"" continues Ehlers. ""People aren't used to using credit cards for example, they can skip right ahead and start using cutting-edge payment technology."" Cashless society . Right now, SnapScan is only available at formal merchants but the hope is that the e-currency could flow from the phones of customers to the accounts of informal merchants too. It can even be used to send remittances. Ehlers says that the hope of a cashless society is possible for Africa. ""Quite a large portion of people have access to a smartphone and by leveraging that technology we can provide payments that were previously impossible,"" he says. ""That really is an empowering thing for most people in Africa who haven't got access to formal infrastructure to provide those services."" John Campbell heads up the Beyond Payments division of Standard Bank, which partners with innovators such as SnapScan to create banking solutions. He says that lack of traditional infrastructure often leads to creative solutions. ""In other territories where that infrastructure was not available, that infrastructure has been leapfrogged by the use of mobile,"" explains Campbell. ""M-Pesa in Kenya is a good example of that, where money goes straight to your mobile -- your mobile number almost becomes your account number, that's effectively what happens."" Back in the House of Machines, Malindi keeps on introducing the new payment method to his customers. ""It's way better as opposed to using your credit card or cash,"" he says, adding that he was surprised to find out that SnapScan was a tech company that started in South Africa. ""I thought it's one of the things that we get from overseas,"" says Malindi. ""When I found out this is African-launched I was 'wow, here we go Africa, here we come, we're rocking the world!'""

"(CNN) -- A tropical depression that has brought flash flooding and landslides to the southern Philippines has left 45 people dead and displaced more than 260,000, authorities say. Nearly 900,000 people have been affected by the heavy rains brought by Tropical Depression Agaton, having lashed the country for days, says the country's national disaster agency, with more than 55,000 families currently in emergency shelter in 585 evacuation centers. Among those affected are survivors of November's Typhoon Haiyan, which left millions homeless in the Philippines, says relief organization Oxfam. Oxfam's Philippines country director Justin Morgan said in a statement that thousands made homeless by Haiyan had been evacuated from rain-collapsed tents and flooded makeshift shelters to avoid being left exposed to the elements by Agaton, including in the ravaged city of Guiuan, the first town in Haiyan's path. On top of the official death toll of 45, the Philippines national disaster agency said 68 people were injured and eight missing. Most of the deaths occurred in the regions of Caraga (19) and Davao (18), both situated on the southernmost island of Mindanao. Most of the deaths were by drowning or in landslides, the disaster agency said. More than 800 houses have been destroyed by Agaton, and nearly 1,300 partially damaged, while 50 roads and 25 bridges have been rendered impassable by flooding. READ MORE: Philippines gets more than its fair share of disasters . The current onslaught of bad weather began Friday when a low pressure area southeast of Guiuan developed into a tropical depression, with winds reaching 55 kilometers per hour (34 miles per hour) near its center. After drifting east and west over the south of the country, Agaton weakened to become categorized as a ""low pressure area"" Monday. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, PAGASA, said in an advisory late Wednesday that the ""low pressure area"" had dissipated. PAGASA said that Mindanao and the Eastern Visayas could expect isolated showers and thunderstorms, while strong to gale-force winds associated with the surge of the monsoon were predicted to affect the seaboards of Luzon and the Eastern Visayas. It advised fishing vessels not to go to sea in order to avoid the expected large waves. Over the last decade, the Philippines has consistently ranked in the top five most disaster-hit countries -- along with China, the United States, India and Indonesia -- according to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, or CRED. Sitting on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean, the Philippines is situated in the most active area for tropical cyclones, due to the surrounding expanse of deep, warm ocean water. Its more than 7,000 islands offer plenty of exposed coastline to the mercy of wind and rain, while its many mountains, dropping sharply to coastal areas, present a risk of landslides. Many buildings in the Philippines are not built to withstand a heavy battering from the elements. CNN's Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","Flash floods and landslides have left 45 dead in the Philippines in recent days .

"(CNN) -- This year's African cocoa harvest, which has just gotten underway, is looking bright. Warm weather is leading many to expect a bumper crop for the main harvest. But a number of problems in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer of cocoa beans, are casting a cloud over the longer-term supply outlook and leading to increasing volatility in cocoa prices, experts say. For years, the Ivory Coast, which accounts for 35 percent of the world's supply of cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate, has been the lifeblood of international chocolate manufacturers. According to the International Cocoa Organization, the Ivory Coast, officially known as Cote d'Ivoire, produced 1.2 million tons of cocoa in 2009-2010. Its annual output is nearly double that of its closest rival, Ghana. But in recent years, the West African nation has been struggling with production growth as a host of challenges -- from political strife to disease -- have threatened supplies. ""All analysts are looking into what's going on in the country,"" Laurent Pipitone, senior statistician at the International Cocoa Organization, told CNN. ""If you know what's happening in Cote d'Ivoire, you already have a rough idea of the global situation."" The last 10 years have seen cocoa crops in the Ivory Coast flat-line, while consumers' insatiable appetite for chocolate has increased. (In three of the past four years, world cocoa supply has failed to keep up with demand. The exception was in 2008-2009, when the economic downturn curbed demand.) Farmers in the Ivory Coast are still struggling with political instability. The country was split in two following a civil war in 2002 -- the south is controlled by the government while rebels control the north. According to William Guyton, president of the World Cocoa Foundation, this has delayed much needed reinvestment in the sector. ""One of the major reasons for declining yields on farms is the number of aging trees,"" he said, adding that there aren't enough supplies, such as fertilizers, available to farmers. There are also problems with pests and diseases, namely black pod, a fast spreading fungal disease that causes cocoa pods to blacken and rot. A third of the global cocoa crop is lost to diseases annually. Limited access to credit, as well as a shift among Ivorian farmers away from cocoa to more reliable crops such as rubber, or to jobs in the city, are additional challenges facing production, industry watchers say. Doubts about the Ivory Coast's cocoa production have led to increasingly volatile cocoa prices. ""If there's a bad cropping season, if there's an insect pest or fungal disease that goes through the Ivory Coast, that can impact the whole market,"" Guyton said. Recently, the market has attracted speculators who, betting that prices will rise, buy up cocoa stocks and store them to sell later. In a headline-generating move, London based hedge fund Armajaro took delivery of 240,100 tons of cocoa in July. That order accounted for around 7 percent of annual global production and caused cocoa prices to rise to their highest level in more than 30 years. The upward trend in cocoa prices has affected consumers, to a degree. In the past two to three years, most chocolate companies have increased their prices,"" Pipitone from the International Cocoa Organization said. But, he added, the chocolate sector is quite competitive so firms have been looking for ways to avoid passing on rising input costs to their customers. ""Companies don't want to lose market share, so there are some who have reduced the size of their chocolate portions to limit the price increase. Some have also changed their chocolate recipes, using less cocoa."" Pipitone doesn't expect any substantial increase in chocolate prices in the near term. ""This year and the next few, we don't need to be concerned that our chocolate bars will increase in price,"" he said. But he warned, further down the line there are key concerns supplies will not meet demand -- a problem the industry is trying to address by diversifying its supply away from the Ivory Coast and other West African nations and into countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam.","The Ivory Coast is the world's top supplier of cocoa, producing 35 percent of global supplies .
After increased cocoa production in the 1990s, production has flat-lined in the past 10 years .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- The death toll from a Russian coal mine accident has reached 52, with 38 people still missing, the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said Tuesday. ""The rescue operation to locate and recover the missing people is being carried out around the clock,"" Veronica Smolskaya, spokeswoman for the ministry, told CNN. More than 80 survivors are currently in hospitals, according to the Russian State Health authorities. Emergency Situation Minister Sergei Shoigu said more than 700 rescue workers are now combing numerous underground tunnels of the mine, and the plan is to complete the operation within the next 24 hours, according to the ministry's website. He was speaking at a special meeting of the rescue headquarters in Kemerovo region, which was also attended by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who traveled to the region Tuesday. Russian officials are still displaying hope and optimism in public, but several sources at the mine told Russian reporters on conditions of anonymity that finding anyone underground who survived the explosions would be a miracle. ""Hope is always the last one to die, but there is indeed little hope left,"" Sergei Cheremnov, spokesman for the local regional Kemerovo governor, told CNN on the phone from the site of the accident. Cheremnov also said the first six funerals took place Tuesday. Five miners were buried in the town of Mezhdurechensk itself, where the accident took place, and one was buried in the town of Tashtagol, also in Kemerovo region. The gas explosion in the Raspadskaya mine occurred around 8:55 p.m. Saturday (12:55 p.m. ET), when 359 people were working at the time. The mine is located near the western Siberian town of Mezhdurechensk, more than 2,300 miles east of Moscow, Russia. Almost 300 people were evacuated shortly after the explosion. More than 50 rescue workers had gone into the mine to recover the rest of the victims when a second gas explosion rocked the structure about four-and-a-half hours later, officials said, causing more fatalities and destruction. Dozens of miners and rescue workers were trapped as a result of that second, much more powerful explosion, and all communications with them were disrupted. Thick smoke and high methane concentrations in the mine prevented active rescue operations underground on Sunday and most of Monday morning, Russian officials said. The operation was further complicated by the very size of the mine: Raspadskaya is one of the largest in Russia's mining industry. It has dozens of underground tunnels with a total length of almost 200 miles, according to Kemerovo Gov. Aman Tuleyev. Putin said on Russian state television Tuesday the investigation is closely analyzing all possible clues to determine the cause of the blasts. ""When such disasters are investigated, attention is always given to studying all aspects of the problem, including the so-called human factor, which means unsafe handling of fire,"" Putin said while talking to victims' families. But once the groups of rescuers entered the mine after the first blast, he said, ""there could have not been any unsafe handling of fire or equipment. It's simply out of the question,"" he said. ""The second blast was the hardest."" The victims' families will be paid 1 million rubles (more than $33,000) in moral damages, and underage children of those killed in the accident will be paid a pension of 10,000 rubles (more than $330) every month until they reach the age of 18, the Russian government decided Tuesday. The injured will receive 400,000 rubles (more than $13,300), and miners sustaining light injuries will receive 200,000 rubles (more than $6,600). Local authorities and the management of Raspadskaya mine will also allocate money to those affected, in addition to the federal government. On Tuesday, the first working day in Russia following three days of the May 9 Victory Day holidays, the shares of Raspadskaya mine plummeted by 15 percent at the Moscow stock exchange.","Death toll from explosions at a Russian mine reaches 52 .

"(CNN) -- An oil painting by Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi has sold for $23.3 million at an auction in Hong Kong - a record price for Asian contemporary art. The 4-meter wide painting was sold to a private collector, who wanted to remain anonymous, after 15 minutes of tense telephone bidding at an evening auction held by auction giant Sotheby's on Saturday. Bidding started at $9 million. The 2001 work is a recreation of ""The Last Supper"" by Italian master Leonardo Da Vinci, which depicts the last meal between Jesus and the 12 disciples when Jesus foretold his betrayal by Judas. In Zeng's work, the religious figures have been replaced by young communists with red neckties. The figure replacing Judas wears a western-style yellow tie - symbolizing China's move toward capitalism, said Evelyn Lin, Sotheby's head of contemporary Asian art. ""The painting represents a transformative period in Chinese society,"" she said. Lin said the sale showed the market for Chinese art, which slowed significantly in 2012, was ""very healthy."" The previous record for a work by an Asian contemporary artist was a sculpture by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami that sold for $15 million in New York in 2008. The painting was sold by Swiss collectors Guy and Myriam Ullens de Schooten. They bought the work from a Beijing gallery in 2002.","Oil painting recreating ""The Last Supper"" sets record for Asian contemporary art .

"New York (CNN) -- Five people and five New York-based companies are accused of importing hazardous and counterfeit toys from China to sell in the United States. According to the 24-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn, seizures of merchandise over eight years included knockoff toys featuring popular children's characters such as Winnie the Pooh, Dora the Explorer, SpongeBob SquarePants, Betty Boop, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, Spiderman, Tweety, Mickey Mouse and Pokemon. ""It's safe to say we have seized thousands of toys,"" Lou Martinez, public affairs officer for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN. Queens residents Chenglan Hu, 51, Hua Fei Zhang, 52, Xiu Lan Zhang, 60, Guan Jun Zhang, 29, and Jun Wu Zhang, 28, were arrested Wednesday. It was not clear late Wednesday whether they had attorneys. The defendants were charged with importing and trafficking hazardous toys in violation of the Consumer Product Safety Act, importing toys bearing copyright-infringing images and counterfeit trademarks, smuggling and money laundering, according to the indictment. The indictment charges that from July 2005 through January 2013 the defendants operated under five different company names, changing the name of the toy company they were operating under after a number of Customs and U.S. Border Patrol searches, seizures and citations. The companies listed in the indictment include Family Product USA Inc., H.M. Import USA Corp., ZCY Trading Corp., Zone Import Corp. and ZY Wholesale Inc. ""They allegedly retooled their operations many times in order to avoid detection and despite repeated citations by the authorities, they continued to peddle counterfeit toys,"" Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breur said in a statement Wednesday. The defendants allegedly sold toys from a storefront and warehouse in Ridgewood Queens, as well as other spots throughout Brooklyn and Queens, according to court documents. Federal officers seized shipping containers entering the United States from China under these toy company names on 33 separate occasions, according to prosecutors. Seventeen of those seizures yielded toys with excessive lead content and phthalate levels, small parts that presented choking and ingestion hazards, and easily accessible battery compartments, officials said. Each seizure confiscated ""hundreds and hundreds"" of toys at a time, according to Martinez. Calls to prosecutors were not immediately returned. CNN national correspondent Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Federal indictment handed down in New York .

"London, England (CNN) -- With a glittering career on the pitch, Nwankwo Kanu is Nigeria's most iconic footballer.  Born in Owerri, the capital of the southern state of Imo, Nigeria; by the age of 17 Kanu was already far from home, playing for Ajax in the Netherlands. Africa's most decorated footballer has had a career spanning almost two decades. In this time he has captained the Nigerian side to win Olympic gold in 1996, won the European Cup with Ajax, the English Premier League title and FA Cup with Arsenal and scored the winning goal for Portsmouth in the 2008 FA Cup Final.  All this despite undergoing major heart surgery in 1996 after doctors spotted a faulty heart-valve. He has since established the successful Kanu Heart Foundation as well as the The Kanu Football Foundation to help young African footballers.  Now near the end of his career, Kanu talks exclusively to CNN about what he loves most about the country he represents on and off the pitch. CNN: What does Nigeria mean to you? Nwankwo Kanu: Nigeria is where I come from, it's part of my life and part of being who I am. I grew up in Nigeria and I think for me it means a lot. It means everything to me. The country has been blessed by God. It's a country where the population is big and they are hard working people and religious people. CNN: Where are your favorite places to go in Nigeria? NK: I love to go to the East, but also my town of Owerri. It's a very small town, a very quiet area, but the people they love enjoyment and it's all about life. They like to have fun and enjoy themselves to the fullest, but when it's late they go to sleep -- no violence, no negative things, it's all about positives. CNN: What do you miss most about Nigeria? NK: The people and the behavior of the people. You miss their way of life and the way they live, the enjoyment and their hardworking nature. I also miss the food -- the spicy food. The dish I miss the most is edikang ikong, which is like a vegetable soup -- very, very good for the system. CNN: How has Nigeria changed in your lifetime? NK: I think that every developing country keeps on developing. For a lot of years now, Nigeria has been growing and developing in terms of infrastructure and communications and it keeps growing. I think people are putting their heads together and trying to make things get better in the country. For me, it's getting better year by year. CNN: What does the future hold for Nigeria? NK: The sky is the limit. The future is bright. We have 150 million people and the way we are developing, I think the future is there for the younger generation who are coming up. The opportunities are there and the future is bright. People are always afraid of Nigeria and I don't think that idea of Nigeria is right or true. People can go and enjoy Nigeria, it's a very good and lovely country and we have good people with very good hearts who can welcome you.","Nigerian born striker Nwankwo Kanu is Africa's most decorated footballer .

"(CNN) -- Russia's seizure of Crimea last month may have unfolded with a lightning quickness, but Vladimir Putin and the West are now engaged in a much slower match of wits on a chessboard stretching across most of eastern Ukraine. Rather than going for checkmate, both sides now seem content to wait for the other to make a mistake. Putin made a strong first move by placing 40,000 troops on the border -- and separatists, who are not officially linked to Russia, on the ground in Ukraine. Now Moscow is waiting for the pro-Western government in Kiev to try to retake the parts of the east it has seemingly lost. In Russia's eyes, any such move from the capital would legitimize an overwhelming counterattack -- a re-run of the Georgia crisis in 2008, when President Mikheil Saakashvili lost his nerve, shot first, and prompted a Russian invasion. Putin's problem is time; he cannot wait forever to strike. Troops cannot remain ready for combat for many months at a time. Separatists in eastern Ukraine are lost without outside support, and may become nervous as time drags on without any glimpse of a light at the end of the tunnel. On the other side of the board are U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukraine's fledgling government. The biggest challenge for Obama and his German counterpart is to keep a united Western front. They need to uphold a credible threat of massive economic sanctions that could undercut the Kremlin's funding if it doesn't toe the line. But cracks in Western unity are visible everywhere. Europe may be concerned about Russian aggression in Ukraine, but the continent is dragging its collective feet on taking a more confrontational stance towards Putin. Some nations fear Russian pressure, especially on their energy supply. Many are nervous about the price their own countries will pay as a result of tougher sanctions. And nobody is sure yet whether they're ready to abandon the idea of Russia as a vital partner. Obama, on the other hand, is much more inclined to put the squeeze on the Kremlin. Washington is used to confrontation with Russia -- and with Putin, specifically -- and America is much less economically-connected with its old Cold War rival. American leaders aren't motivated solely by their concern over eastern Europe and Russia reasserting itself as a more aggressive and expansionist power. The U.S. also wants to assert key norms of international order -- namely territorial integrity and the principle to change borders only with the consent of all parties. Ukraine is also a welcome opportunity to signal to allies and rivals alike that America is not retrenching from its global engagements. The impact of the Ukraine crisis on China and the various territorial conflicts with its neighbors will also loom very large on the minds of policy makers in Washington. But whatever the differences among U.S. and EU leaders, the more they act in concert, the better chance they have to achieve their goal: beating back Moscow's attempt to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The West also needs to make sure that Kiev's interim government doesn't lose its nerve. As hard as it is for leaders to watch pro-Russian separatists take over their buildings, any large-scale operation in eastern Ukraine could give Putin the opportunity he may be waiting for: invasion with some kind of dubious pseudo-legal cover. It is difficult to say who is in a better position. Putin is a master tactician. Since his years as a KGB agent in Dresden in the 1980s, he has gained much expertise in finding and exploiting the West's weak spots. And he seems to have broad support at home for his confrontational brand of politics. Putin's weakness is his regime's economic dependency on the West. Without the steady flow of income from the sale of gas and oil, brought under control of the Kremlin, the regime would not be able to buy support at home and to finance costly and risky foreign policy adventures. The West has no appetite to confront Russia. But if Putin's tanks roll into eastern Ukraine out of the blue, without any pretense of legitimacy, he will turn Western opinion even further against him. This could give Merkel and Obama the necessary backing for tough sanctions. If he is to achieve his main goal, which is to prevent Ukraine from associating closer with the West, Putin will have to move fast. He probably needs to have some kind of Russian presence inside Ukraine (apart from Crimea), as control over separatists in the east alone might not be sufficient or sustainable. A full-scale crackdown by the Ukrainian government on separatists would give Moscow the cover to move some Russian troops as ""peacekeepers"" into eastern Ukraine. Once inside the country, another ""frozen conflict"" could be created which would destabilize the country and prevent Western attempts to help Ukraine to get on its feet. This would keep Putin's longer-term ambition -- to bring Ukraine into a Moscow-led alliance or federation -- very much alive. If the Kremlin comes to the conclusion that the West wouldn't respond to such a move with painful sanctions -- ones that would damage Putin's inner circle and be strong enough to sap major sources of income for the Kremlin -- Putin might choose to move along such lines or in other ways. But if the U.S. and EU demonstrate that they are truly ready to use economic warfare to counter the Russian military machine, the West may yet be able to deter Putin from going much further. Something has to give soon. READ MORE: Ukrainian mayor shot as West prepares sanctions . READ MORE: Five ways the Ukraine crisis could end .

"(CNN) -- Ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones are back on tour. The ""world's greatest rock 'n' roll band"" resumed its #StonesOnFire trek, part of its 50th-anniversary travels around the globe, with a show Monday night in Oslo, Norway. The group's tour had been put on hold since the March 17 death of Mick Jagger's girlfriend, fashion designer L'Wren Scott. Scott's death, which was ruled a suicide, stunned Jagger, who had been with the designer and former model since 2003. ""I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me,"" he said in a statement two months ago. Scott left her $9 million estate to Jagger, according to the late fashion designer's will. Though she had reportedly been having financial difficulties, a representative for Scott said, ""The figures quoted in the media regarding the financial status of LS Fashion Limited are not only highly misleading and inaccurate but also extremely hurtful and disrespectful to the memory of L'Wren Scott."" The Stones were in Australia at the time of her death, and the band canceled seven shows there and in New Zealand.

"(CNN) -- As anger grows over the continuing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, friends and family gathered Tuesday, united in grief, to pay tribute to the 11 men lost in the explosion of the drilling rig that triggered the underwater gusher. ""Today we gather here as a community -- a community that none of us ever wanted to be a part of,"" said Steven Newman, president and chief executive officer of Transocean, which owns the rig. ""A community of loss, of remembrance but also of hope and most of all a community of faith.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A pioneer, a preacher, an activist and an athlete were among 16 people who President Obama honored Wednesday with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Joe Medicine Crow-High Bird, the last living Plains Indian war chief, receives his medal from President Obama. ""This is a chance for me and for the United States of America to say thank you to some of the finest citizens of this country and of all countries,"" Obama told the audience assembled for the ceremony at the White House. ""At a moment when cynicism and doubt too often prevail, when our obligations to one another are too often forgotten, when the road ahead can seem too long or hard to tread, these extraordinary men and women, these agents of change, remind us that excellence is not beyond our abilities, that hope lies around the corner and that justice can still be won in the forgotten corners of this world,"" the president said. ""They remind us that we each have it within our powers to fulfill dreams, to advance the dreams of others and to remake the world for our children,"" he said.  Watch Obama award medals » . The Presidential Medal of Freedom, an annual award, was created after World War II when President Truman wanted to honor civilian service during the war.

However, Kennedy missed Wednesday's ceremony because of his ongoing battle with brain cancer, the White House said. His sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who died Tuesday, received the Medal of Freedom in 1984 from President Reagan. • Billie Jean King: With her victory over Bobby Riggs in the ""Battle of the Sexes"" tennis match in 1973, and in the years since, King has champion gender equality not only in sports but in all areas of public life. • The Rev.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Hammered by a nuclear accident at its Fukushima Daiichi power plant, Tokyo Electric Power Co. on Friday reported a net loss of 1.2 trillion yen ($15.4 billion) for the fiscal year that ended March 31. Tokyo Electric also announced it will decommission reactors Nos. 1-4 at Fukushima Daiichi. It also has canceled plans to build two other reactors at the site. In addition to the company's earnings, Tokyo Electric president Masataka Shimizu announced his resignation Friday, which must be approved by the board of directors at a June meeting. ""The accident compromised our confidence in the safety of nuclear power,"" Shimizu said. ""We have caused problems and anxiety to the public."" Managing Director Toshio Nishizawa has been tapped to replace the president. ""We are facing the gravest crisis in the history of the company,"" Nishizawa said. ""I feel the enormous gravity of the responsibility to assume the position of the president ... so I accepted the position."" Vice Presidents Sakae Mutoh and Makio Fujiwara also tendered their resignations, as did Director Tomijirou Morita. A restructuring plan was announced to boost company finances and help create more than a trillion yen in savings by selling off real estate, cutting pay and reducing staff. The Fukushima Daiichi plant has faced a series of setbacks since a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11. The disasters triggered a glitch in the plant's cooling system, and caused radiation to leak. As crews work to bring the problems under control, the government said this week it would compensate more than 78,000 displaced by the nuclear disaster. Tokyo Electric has made a down payment on compensation of 1 million yen (about $12,000) per household to some families. Some analysts say total compensation could amount to more than 10 trillion yen ($124 billion). The government has set no ceiling on the compensation and Tokyo Electric will be required to pay back the money spent out of a government-backed fund. The shadow cast by Fukushima Daiichi has inflicted yet-unknown losses on farmers, fishermen and shopkeepers. And looming compensation costs have darkened the future of Tokyo Electric, a $157 billion company that could still be driven into some form of government receivership by the nuclear disaster.

"(CNN) -- As many as 200,000 people -- most of them mainland China-based Taiwanese - are expected to return to Taiwan this weekend for an election viewed as critical to the future of an economy that has boomed thanks to warmer ties with Beijing. Taiwan does not allow absentee voting and the growing political clout of Taiwan's expatriate businessmen -- known as Taishang in Chinese -- will be a determining factor in elections that will set the tenor of the relationship with Beijing. ""Because of the closeness of the race, this election has the highest ever number of returnees,"" says Professor Ray-Kuo Wu of Fu Jen University, adding that estimates could be as high as 250,000 returnees. ""Corporate bosses have mobilized their employees to participate in these elections like never before. ""Hon Hai Precision is chartering six planes to get people back to vote and Formosa Plastics Group is another company that is helping employees return for the election."" With memories of the 2008 election still fresh, when incumbent Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang Nationalist Party was returned with just 30,000 of the 13 million votes cast, the Taishang are concerned that a change of government could stall the lucrative rapprochement with Beijing. Ma's chief opponent is Tsai Ying-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progress Party. Tsai has the chance to become the Taiwan's first female president, but her campaign to paint Ma's pro-Beijing policies as selling out Taiwan's sovereignty may cost her Taishang votes, analysts say. ""Taiwan is a democracy and, of course, the way that they vote remains to be seen,"" says Wu. ""But the pro-business and pro-Beijing campaign is something of a double-edged sword. The opposition DPP has been able to paint the president as someone whose policies have only benefited the big corporations."" Although Taiwan is called the ""Republic of China,"" and Taiwan has been de facto independent from the People's Republic of China since 1949 when the Kuomintang or Nationalist government lost the Chinese civil war and withdrew to Taiwan, Beijing considers the island a mere breakaway province. China has never ruled out the use of force against Taiwan to achieve reunification. If China uses military force against the island the United States could intervene under the Taiwan Relations Act, raising fears of a much wider conflict. Relations between Taiwan and Beijing softened in 2008 when the two governments opened trade, transport and postal services, allowing direct links for the first time. What had once been a daylong ordeal, where flights to Beijing had to be routed through Hong Kong, has become a short hop across the Taiwan Strait. Tourism has strongly benefited, with 30% of the 6 million foreign visitors arriving in Taiwan coming from mainland China. Exports, meanwhile, are enjoying a bonanza, hitting a record US$115 billion, up 35% from a year earlier. ""Economically, it's been a big boost for Taiwan,"" says Wu. For its part, mainland China, also drawn by the economic prospects of closer ties, has been content not to disturb the status quo, in marked contrast to earlier elections. In 1996, it reacted angrily to the first direct presidential elections in Taiwan believing that the favorite to win that poll, Lee Teng-hui, was advocating a separate identity and formal statehood for what Beijing has always dubbed a 'renegade province.' Prior to those elections, Beijing conducted missile tests in the Taiwan Strait aimed at intimidating voters and the United States moved two aircraft carriers into the region. Beijing's posturing created the opposite effect and Lee won the poll handsomely. Since then, Beijing has taken a hands-off approach, not wanting to upset what is settling into a strong economic relationship. ""The Taiwanese government has stated that the election is their domestic affair and, so far, there has been nothing overt in terms of opposition from Beijing's side,"" says Wu. Key to the current policy between Beijing and Taipei has been widespread support for the 1992 Consensus which enshrined the ""One China principle."" Under this agreement, both sides recognize there is only one China -- that both the mainland and Taiwan constitute China -- but it is up to each side to express their own definition of this. ""Traditionally business leaders have shied away from commenting on political issues,"" says Wu, adding that this election has been different in that Taishang have been more overtly partisan than in previous elections. ""But there's a recognition that there's a need to continue with the 1992 Consensus and that it's the best choice for Taishang in terms of the prosperity of Taiwan,"" he said.","Taiwan heads to the polls on Saturday to vote in presidential elections .

"(CNN) -- The teen who stunned the world of tennis Tuesday from Wimbledon's Centre Court, beating Rafael Nadal in an audacious, four-set victory laced with fun and brazen moves, has had his fairytale first Wimbledon brought to an close. Nick Kyrgios' run came to an abrupt halt Wednesday, with Milos Raonic, the No. 8 seed from Canada, disposing of the young Australian, 6-7 6-2 6-4 7-6. But the 19-year-old from Canberra's achievement will live on as one of the shocks of the tournament. To meet tennis world number one Rafael Nadal on the court at Wimbledon in his first appearance there, and to not only triumph, but to do so with an assortment of tricks, including an opening ace and a sublime between-the-legs flick that left the Spanish great dumbfounded, counts as a memorable introduction. ""Never did I think a week ago I was going to make the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in my first appearance,"" the wild-card entry, ranked 144 in the world, said in a press conference after taking this famous scalp. Heightened expectations . Until his win over Nadal, he was likely content to experience the tournament, play his Xbox -- which he brought with him from Australia -- and hang out with his father and sister, who accompanied him to London. He said he'd text his mother a smiley face after the press event ended. Now, expectations are somewhat heightened. On court, Kyrgios carries himself confidence and verve that belies his 19 years of age, as his unorthodox, Nadal-stumping shot clearly demonstrated. After besting the five-time finalist over four sets, the world has been alerted to Australian tennis' worst-kept secret, a serial winner -- and world junior number 1 -- at youth level who is taking his senior career in his stride. Many are tipping the right-handed, attacking baseliner as a future great of the game. It's not an Aussie fairytale without precedent, however. In 1996, at another Grand Slam event, a young Mark Philippoussis -- an Australian who also boasts Greek heritage -- knocked out then-number 1 Pete Sampras to reach the fourth round. ""That's what it reminded me of, where (Kyrgios) just didn't go away -- he kept going for the shots and kept coming up with the goods,"" Australian great Pat Cash told the Sydney Morning Herald. ""It was extremely impressive. It was amazing. It was almost faultless."" He started playing at six, and his background -- Greek-Australian on his father's side and Malaysian on his mother's -- is emblematic of multicultural, modern Australia, and currently divides his time between his hometown of Canberra and Melbourne, the spiritual home of Australian tennis. He's at home on grass -- something that cannot necessarily be said for his erstwhile opponent, who has endured a torrid time at Wimbledon in recent years. Becker comparison . After his phenomenal win over Nadal, comparisons are plenty, given the number of precocious talents who have graced Centre Court. But perhaps the most flattering is with the great Boris Becker, who as an unsmiling Teutonic 17-year old beat the South African Kevin Curren in the 1985 final, the first of his three Wimbledon titles. ""We keep saying 'who's the next guy?' and I think that we've found that guy,'' former Wimbledon champion and current commentator John McEnroe told the BBC. ""It was absolutely stunning, what he did to the world number 1. ""He absolutely believed that he was going to win this match, and he's acting, to me, like he can win this tournament. The last guy I saw like this... is Boris Becker. That young teenager, no fear whatsoever, no matter what comes my way I'm going to be better than them.'' McEnroe's confidence in Kyrgios' ability to go all the way may have fallen flat for now, but for a 19-year-old in his first pro season, defeating one of tennis' all-time greats still counts as a remarkable success, and he will be relishing his return to the scene in a year's time.","19 year-old stuns Rafael Nadal in Wimbledon matchup .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan has slapped new restrictions on green tea and plums from areas around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant because of lingering radioactive contamination from the ongoing disaster there. The latest government bans were prompted by the discovery of radioactive cesium-137 and -134 at concentrations higher than Japanese standards allow, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Thursday. Both are nuclear waste products: cesium-137 has a half-life of 30 years, while cesium-134 has a two-year half-life. The government has now forbidden the shipment of both fresh and dried green tea -- normally touted for its health benefits -- from Ibaraki Prefecture, southwest of the plant; from six towns in Chiba Prefecture and six towns in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo; and two in Fukushima Prefecture, where the crippled plant is located. In addition, Edano said, the government has banned the shipment of plums from three towns in Fukushima. The moves come nearly three months into the crisis at Fukushima Daiichi, the worst nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. One of three operating reactors at the plant melted down after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and the other two suffered extensive damage to their radioactive cores. Though no deaths have been attributed to the accident, the resulting contamination has forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people from towns surrounding the plant. In addition, restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated Japanese farmers and fishermen since the disaster began, though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks. The plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Co., has laid out a timetable for restoring normal cooling systems and fully shutting down the reactors by January. But Prime Minister Naoto Kan cautioned that people may not be allowed to return home immediately, ""even if these prospects are realized."" ""We might have to continue monitoring, and we need to maybe decontaminate,"" said Kan, whose government survived a no-confidence vote Thursday spurred by complaints about his handling of the twin crises. ""And for that, there may be some more time needed."" The disaster has spurred Japan to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy and tighten safety standards for existing plants. A preliminary report from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded this week that Japan underestimated the risks its nuclear installations faced from tsunamis, like the one that swamped the Fukushima Daiichi plant and knocked out its cooling systems. But the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency declared the country's response to the disaster ""exemplary,"" praising Tokyo Electric's operators for their ""brave and sometimes novel"" efforts to contain the crisis. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Radioactive cesium levels prompt new action by Japan .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- For Laura Dominguez, nothing tastes more like home than mate tea and dulce de leche, both typically Argentine flavors that she missed during the eight years she lived in Spain. In June, Dominguez, 36, moved back to Argentina because the economic situation in Spain was so dire that she didn't see strong prospects there for herself or her three young daughters. Dominguez worked as a waitress in the beach resort town of Blanes in the CataluÃ±a region. She says tourism there has dropped considerably in recent years, compared to when she first arrived in 2003 and could count on five steady months of restaurant work. ""I had a job, and I was one of the lucky few. Almost everyone I knew in Spain was unemployed,"" says Dominguez. Over the past three years, the tourist season has shrunk to two months; the domestic market has virtually disappeared and it's holidaymakers from Germany and Holland who are keeping any life in the industry, she says. ""There were scores of closed businesses in Blanes. They just kept closing and closing and closing. Construction sites were paralyzed. Nearby, entire towns were abandoned. It reminded me of Argentina during our last crisis,"" she says. Argentina's financial meltdown in 2001 -- when the country defaulted on $100 billion in debt -- is what sent Laura and thousands of other Argentines looking for a better life in Spain. The rowdy protests that took place on the streets of Buenos Aires a decade ago look similar to those currently taking place in Madrid and throughout Spain, where the latest unemployment numbers show that 21.5 percent of the Spanish population is jobless. When Spain holds parliamentary elections Sunday, current Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero will step down but, according to opinion polls, his Socialist Party is expected to be punished. Dominguez said she made the tough decision to leave Spain and uproot her three daughters -- ages 13, 9 and 7 -- because she was afraid of ending up homeless. Even with her own country's volatile economic history, she thinks Argentina's future is brighter than its past. ""I am from a country, Argentina, which has been in crisis for the last 30 years. The Spaniards are not accustomed to living in crisis. Argentines know how to live within our means. So this crisis is affecting all Spaniards terribly,"" she says. Spain and Argentina have always looked to one another in times of crisis. The largest Spanish community outside Spain resides in Argentina, and it's commonly believed that nearly half of all Argentines have Spanish blood. These close cultural and linguistic ties have always made Spain a popular destination for Argentine immigrants seeking financial stability that Europe had traditionally offered. But with Spain's bleak economic situation, and similar problems for its Eurozone neighbors, more and more Spaniards are now coming to Argentina. There are no official numbers on the amount of Spaniards who have immigrated to Argentina in recent years, but officials at the Spanish Embassy in Buenos Aires concede it is on the rise. ""I came to Buenos Aires because I lost my job in Madrid more than a year ago, and the situation in Spain is getting worse by the day. So I decided to try to take a different path and try my luck here,"" says makeup artist Paula Riofrio, 30. Riofrio arrived in September on a one-way plane ticket, and said she has already had several promising interviews for makeup and hair styling work in the Argentine fashion industry. ""We were always used to seeing Argentines move to Spain, but now it is the other way around. And honestly, I think more and more Spaniards will be coming here soon,"" says Riofrio. For Laura Dominguez, the decision to return home to Argentina has already been a good one. She found a full-time job at a well-known international bank, and is confident she will soon be able to afford to move her family out of her parent's apartment and into a place of their own. ""I feel lucky that I have a job and feel confident things will work out here for my family. But I will always love Spain and I hope it can recover soon,"" says Dominguez.","Argentinean workers in Spain are returning home for economic security .

Laura Dominguez said it was reminiscent of Argentina's 2001 financial meltdown .

"New York (CNN) -- Three of the five men wrongly convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a female jogger in Central Park in 1989 said Friday that a $40 million settlement with New York City cannot begin to replace all they lost. Surrounded by relatives, attorneys and community activists, the three men spoke at an emotional news conference on the steps of City Hall one day after the city comptroller announced the approval of a settlement in their civil rights lawsuit. They spoke of the degradation of being caught up as teenagers in one of New York's most notorious crimes, of watching their youthful dreams swept away forever in a sensational case that split the city along racial lines. ""You all don't really understand what we went through,"" said a tearful Kevin Richardson, who served about seven years in prison for a crime he did not commit. ""You tried to dehumanize us... but we're still here. We're strong. Nobody gave us a chance except the people that believed in us. People called us animals, a wolf pack... It still hurts me emotionally."" He added, ""Now it feels great to have a voice... All we wanted to tell you all was that we didn't do it."" The settlement still has to be approved by Judge Deborah Batts of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, where the men filed their lawsuit. City Comptroller Scott Stringer on Thursday said the settlement was ""a prudent and equitable solution for all parties to the lawsuit and closes a very difficult chapter in our City's history."" The settlement marks the end of a dark episode for the city, the close of case that became emblematic of rampant lawlessness. Five minority teenagers, who became known as the Central Park Five, were convicted in 1990.They were later exonerated after authorities agreed with their claims that they were coerced into making incriminating statements. ""I wake up every morning and put the gloves on and still want to fight because my childhood was taken from me,"" said Raymond Santana. Jr., who also served about seven years in prison. ""The opportunity to become a productive man was taken and instead you gave me prison."" He added, ""Today's supposed to be a joyful celebration and again I want to put the gloves back on. I don't know how to take them off. All I know how to do is ... speak against injustice and fight for somebody else who has been wrongfully convicted. It wasn't about the money. It was about the closure. It was about 12 years the city saying we're guilty."" The agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averages about $1 million per year of incarceration, a source with knowledge of the settlement told CNN last week. One of the men, Kharey Wise, served 13 years in prison. Two others -- Yusef Salaam and Antron McCray -- each served about seven years. Wise and McCray did not attend Friday's news conference. ""I don't know if I truly believe that this day would happen,"" Salaam told reporters. Jonathan Moore, an attorney who represented the men, said the judge was expected to sign off on the settlement within two weeks. ""It's a significant amount of money that represents ... an understanding by the city and by the people involved in this case that something wrong happened back in April of 1989 and they'll never admit it,"" he said. ""They should, if they ever want to cleanse their soul, but they'll never admit the reality of what they did."" On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old white Wall Street investment banker jogging through Central Park was raped, viciously beaten and left for dead. She would have no memory of the attack. That same night, a group of black and Latino youths had been in the park, throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people in a practice the media and law enforcement at the time called ""wilding."" An investigation led to the arrest of five teens who were accused of rampaging through the park in a ""wolf pack"" and preying on innocent victims. They were charged and convicted. ""If they had their way,"" Salaam told CNN in 2012, ""we would have been hanging from one of those lovely trees here in Central Park."" The victim, Trisha Meili, kept her identity hidden for 14 years until the publication of her book, ""I Am the Central Park Jogger."" ""I guess there are lots of theories out there but I just don't know and it's almost too confusing for me to understand,"" she told CNN in 2003, referring to the false confessions given by the five men. ""I've had to come to peace with it by saying: 'You know what? I'm just not going to know.'"" Three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms, one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when Matias Reyes, a serial rapist and murderer in 2001 confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone. DNA analysis later determined that Reyes was the perpetrator of the rape, and that hair evidence used in the boys' trials did not match.","Three of five men wrongfully convicted in Central Park rape speak of loss .

"(CNN) -- Apolo Anton Ohno has won eight Olympic medals -- two of them gold -- in short track speed skating, but he is also well known for helping people away from the rink. Ohno is the spokesman for SeeYourImpact.org, a nonprofit organization that not only lets people donate directly to someone in need, but also e-mails them to show exactly how their gift is making a difference. Ohno has been involved with CNN Heroes this year, serving on the Blue Ribbon Panel that selected the Top 10 Heroes. He recently sat down with CNN Entertainment senior producer Denise Quan to talk about CNN Heroes and his philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. Denise Quan: How did you come to be involved with SeeYourImpact.org? Apolo Anton Ohno: SeeYourImpact.org was first brought to me by a close friend who has been involved with philanthropic work for many years, and he said, ""Apolo, I know you are involved with a lot of different charitable organizations, but this is one that can help change billions of lives around the world."" I was always interested in affecting the lives within my community, and this is something that is the future of philanthropic giving, so I was very excited about it. At the end of the day it doesn't matter how much money you've made or how much money you are going to make, but how you can give back. Utilizing my success for a positive benefit, to help others, is something that really interested me. Quan: So what exactly does SeeYourImpact.org do? How does it work? Ohno: You go to the website and pick a geographic region and cause that we want to focus on. So let's say I want to focus on an area in India and I want to focus on malnutrition or running water. And I would say, ""I want to help this family out for the next six months and I want to donate this amount of dollars."" One hundred percent of the donations go directly toward the people who receive the gift, and ... within two weeks, you receive a picture of the family and a story about how it has impacted their lives. In the business of giving, people want to see how their money is being used and how it is going to affect the families, and this is a perfect and wonderful opportunity to be a part of that change for the greater good. You hear fantastic stories about Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and a lot of other people who give money towards these amazing charities, but there are really thousands of ways where everyday people can donate -- even if it is a very small amount of money -- and help someone else who is in need. Quan: Has your work with SeeYourImpact.org changed you? Ohno: It has really inspired me to be a better person. It's a way for me to constantly stay motivated to know there are other people out there who don't have the same resources or the same opportunities that I do. And it's up to me to be able to make sure that they can have something better. At the end of the day, it's things like SeeYourImpact.org and CNN Heroes that really are what life is really all about. Quan: So how did you become involved with CNN Heroes? Ohno: I was asked to be a part of the Blue Ribbon Panel that selects the Top 10 Heroes of the year. And I had watched ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" in the past, and it's a very popular show because it captures human emotion and spirit and it shows people doing extraordinary things for others. So it's an amazing opportunity for me to be a part of it, and it's an honor as well. Quan: So what's it like to select the Top 10 Heroes? What qualities did you look for? Ohno: To be honest with you, it was very difficult to choose. If I could give out an award to every single one, I would. But I think your own personal beliefs, causes and life's journey is what you kind of gravitate toward, so that's how it was with me. I was drawn to people who I could sort of sympathize with and understand why they are doing something or working toward this cause as opposed to another. I did a lot of the due diligence and research myself, alone -- hours just reading about the causes, the people involved and how they impacted lives. It made me happy to know that there are people out there who have really dedicated their lives toward helping others. It's pretty amazing to really see someone doing that. Quan: What is a hero to you? Ohno: I think a hero to me is someone who defies odds, who follows their own dreams and passions but also does something extraordinary and has dedicated their life toward something that's different -- helping others. And that's why these CNN Heroes are so amazing to me. To see them and to see exactly what they're doing and how they're impacting lives, that is a hero to me. It truly is. And it inspires me to want to be a better person.","Olympian says SeeYourImpact.org represents the future of philanthropic giving .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. In case you haven't read ""The Lorax,"" it's widely recognized as Dr. Seuss' take on environmentalism and how humans are destroying nature. Loggers were so upset about the book that some groups within the industry sponsored ""The Truax,"" a similar book -- but from the logging point of view. Dr. Seuss' widow, Audrey Geisel, accepted his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004. Another interesting fact: the book used to contain the line, ""I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie,"" but 14 years after the book was published, the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss creator Theodore Geisel, and told him how much the conditions had improved and implored him to take the line out. Geisel  agreed and said that it wouldn't be in future editions. 2. Somehow, Geisel's books find themselves in the middle of controversy. The line ""A person's a person, no matter how small,"" from ""Horton Hears a Who!,"" has been used as a slogan for anti-abortion organizations. It's often questioned whether that was Seuss' intent in the first place, but when he was still alive, he threatened to sue an anti-abortion group unless they removed his words from their letterhead. Karl ZoBell, the attorney for Dr. Seuss' interests and for his widow, Audrey Geisel, says that she doesn't like people to ""hijack Dr. Seuss characters or material to front their own points of view."" Mental Floss: 5 stories about Seuss himself . 3. ""If I Ran the Zoo,"" published in 1950, is the first recorded instance of the word ""nerd."" 4. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was written because Dr. Seuss thought the famous Dick and Jane primers were insanely boring. Because kids weren't interested in the material, they weren't exactly compelled to use it repeatedly in their efforts to learn to read. So, ""The Cat in the Hat"" was born. 5. Bennett Cerf, Dr. Seuss' editor, bet him that he couldn't write a book using 50 words or less. ""The Cat in the Hat"" was pretty simple, after all, and it used 225 words. Not one to back down from a challenge, Mr. Geisel started writing and came up with ""Green Eggs and Ham"" -- which uses exactly 50 words. The 50 words, by the way, are: a, am, and, anywhere, are, be, boat, box, car, could, dark, do, eat, eggs, fox, goat, good, green, ham, here, house, I, if, in, let, like, may, me, mouse, not, on, or, rain, Sam, say, see, so, thank, that, the, them, there, they, train, tree, try, will, with, would, you. 6. It's often alleged that ""Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!"" was written specifically about Richard Nixon, but the book came out only two months after the whole Watergate scandal. It's unlikely that the book could have been conceived of, written, edited and mass produced in such a short time. Also, Seuss never admitted that the story was originally about Nixon. That's not to say he didn't understand how well the two flowed together. In 1974, he sent a copy of Marvin K. Mooney to his friend Art Buchwald at the Washington Post. In it, he crossed out ""Marvin K. Mooney"" and replaced it with ""Richard M. Nixon,"" which Buchwald reprinted in its entirety. 7. ""Yertle the Turtle"" = Hitler? Yep. If you haven't read the story, here's a little overview: Yertle is the king of the pond, but he wants more. He demands that other turtles stack themselves up so he can sit on top of them to survey the land. Mack, the turtle at the bottom, is exhausted. He asks Yertle for a rest; Yertle ignores him and demands more turtles for a better view. Eventually, Yertle notices the moon and is furious that anything dare be higher than himself, and is about ready to call for more turtles when Mack burps. This sudden movement topples the whole stack, sends Yertle flying into the mud, and frees the rest of the turtles from their stacking duty. Dr. Seuss actually said Yertle was a representation of Hitler. Despite the political nature of the book, none of that was disputed at Random House -- what was disputed was Mack's burp. No one had ever let a burp loose in a children's book before, so it was a little dicey. In the end, obviously, Mack burped. Mental Floss: The Dr. Seuss quiz . 8. ""The Butter Battle Book"" is one I had never heard of, perhaps with good reason: it was pulled from the shelves of libraries for a while because of the reference to the Cold War and the arms race. Yooks and Zooks are societies who do everything differently. The Yooks eat their bread with the butter-side up and the Zooks eat their bread with the butter-side down. Obviously, one of them must be wrong, so they start building weapons to outdo each other: the ""Tough-Tufted Prickly Snick-Berry Switch,"" the ""Triple-Sling Jigger,"" the ""Jigger-Rock Snatchem,"" the ""Kick-A-Poo Kid"", the ""Eight-Nozzled Elephant-Toted Boom Blitz,"" the ""Utterly Sputter"" and the ""Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo."" The book concludes with each side ready to drop their ultimate bombs on each other, but the reader doesn't know how it actually turns out. 9. ""Oh The Places You'll Go"" is the final Seuss book published before he passed away. Published in 1990, it sells about 300,000 copies every year because so many people give it to college and high school grads. 10. No Dr. Seuss post would be complete without a mention of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" Frankenstein's Monster himself, Boris Karloff, provided the voice of the Grinch and the narration for the movie. Seuss was a little wary of casting him because he thought his voice would be too scary for kids. If you're wondering why they sound a bit different, it's because the sound people went back to the Grinch's parts and removed all of the high tones in Karloff's voice. That's why the Grinch sounds so gravelly. Tony the Tiger, AKA Thurl Ravenscroft, is the voice behind ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch."" He received no credit on screen, so Dr. Seuss wrote to columnists in every major U.S. newspaper to tell them exactly who had sung the song. Mental Floss: How cereal transformed American culture .

"San Diego (CNN) -- Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court after 191 years, is crusading to reverse what she says is an alarming decline in America's knowledge of democracy and announced an initiative Wednesday to educate children across the country. Asserting that democracy is not inherited at birth but rather learned in school, O'Connor founded the educational nonprofit group iCivics in 2009 to secure America's governance and prepare the next generation of citizens and leaders. On Wednesday, O'Connor announced an expansion of that program to include the Boys & Girls Club of America, which has almost 4,000 clubs serving 4.1 million youngsters. ""Many states around the country are no longer teaching or requiring civics education for young people,"" said O'Connor, 82. ""When I went to school -- and that was a long time ago, and I went to school in El Paso, Texas -- we had civics almost every year, and in fact, I almost got tired of it. ""But the fact of the matter is that every young person needs to learn how our government works at the national level, at the state level, at the local level and how they can be part of it,"" O'Connor said. O'Connor said her website, iCivics.org, was partnering with the Boys & Girls Clubs because of its vast network serving youths. ""It's a very big organization, and I want them to know and use -- and they want to know and to use -- iCivics because it's a great activity for young people,"" O'Connor added. O'Connor cited an Annenberg Public Policy Center national survey showing that only one-third of Americans could name all three branches of the U.S. government. ""I can't believe it,"" O'Connor said in in a speech at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America's national conference in San Diego on Wednesday. Then she added: ""Two-thirds of Americans can name a judge on 'American Idol,' and only 15% can name the chief justice of the United States,"" who is John Roberts. ""Civic knowledge can't be handed down the gene pool. It has to be learned,"" O'Connor told the gathering of 2,400 conference attendees. O'Connor said the American awareness of civics is ""on the decline."" ""It's putting our country at some risk,"" O'Connor said. iCivics offers free curricula and video games in public, private and charter schools in all 50 states and has counted more than 5 million game plays on its website, spokeswoman Kelly Landis said. The 16 video games are designed to teach students about civics, even asking them to play the role of president. O'Connor was a President Reagan appointee to the Supreme Court in 1981, and she retired from the nation's highest court in 2006.","NEW: ""It's putting our country at some risk,"" O'Connor says of declining civics knowledge .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving wildfire in eastern Arizona forced the evacuation Tuesday of up to 3,000 additional people, a Red Cross official said, as crews continued to battle the blaze. Residents living in areas south of State Highway 260 and east of Greer, including South Fork and parts of Eagar, have been told to leave their homes, fire officials said. The evacuees will join the estimated 2,700 people already on the road in eastern Arizona. ""We're probably in the range of between 5,500 and 5,700 people,"" said Mark Weldon, spokesman for the Arizona Red Cross. Fire fighters struggled Tuesday to gain the slimmest of advantages over the Wallow Fire that has already burned more than 300,000 acres. Just 10 structures have been lost. The fire produced dense plumes of smoke that were visible from space and thick enough to reduce visibility to less than a mile in some places, the National Weather Service said in an air-quality alert Tuesday. Authorities ordered the evacuations of the Arizona cities Greer and Sunrise on Monday. Meanwhile, New Mexico officials told residents in the town of Luna to be prepared to leave, according Terri Wildermuth, a spokeswoman for the Incident Management Team that is overseeing firefighting efforts. The Arizona blaze is beginning to threaten neighboring New Mexico, and spillover smoke pushed by high winds disrupted flights and prompted an air quality alert on the other side of the border, authorities said Tuesday. ""I'm starting to feel like I've been chain-smoking and all my cloths smell like I've been camping,"" said CNN iReporter Eric Place, who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico. ""Sometimes, not like huge flakes, but little ash particles, are visible."" In Arizona, the Red Cross has set up an evacuation center at Blue Ridge High School in Lakeside. So far, around 75 evacuees have checked into the shelter, said Weldon, though not everyone was expected to stay overnight. More than 2,000 firefighters are engaged in the fight against the fire, along with 20 helicopters, 141 fire engines, 46 water tenders and eight bulldozers, according to officials. The blaze remained at 0% containment Tuesday night. The National Weather Service warned critical fire weather, with low humidity and high winds, would continue at least through Wednesday in Arizona. The National Interagency Fire Center said similar conditions would heighten the risk of fires across the southwest, including Arizona, New Mexico, southeastern Colorado and west Texas. Some Arizonans displaced by the fire have second-guessed their decisions to leave their homes. Displaced resident Patrick Tureson told Phoenix-based CNN affiliate KNXV that life as evacuee is ""horrible."" ""I don't have a lot of hope right now,"" he said. Tureson said he and his wife, Randa, received a call from fire officials Sunday night recommending they abandon their Coyote Canyon home. ""We wanted to stay but ended up leaving because it was getting worse and worse,"" Tureson told KNXV. ""That fire was headed right towards me. It's just a bad situation."" The Wallow fire, which began May 29, has scorched 311,481 acres so far along the state's eastern border. Additionally, low humidity and high winds are fueling fires elsewhere in the state. That includes three separate blazes that have consumed 165,017 acres in the Coronado National Forest, one of which has been burning since May 8, according to InciWeb, an Internet state-by-state database of active wildfires and other disasters. Winds have also hampered the efforts of firefighters who've come to Arizona from across the United States to help battle the Wallow fire. That includes grounding planes that otherwise could be used to douse the flames from the air, Wildermuth said. On Monday, the size of the fire jumped 21% as it spread to more than 40,000 acres. ""We had a hard day today,"" Joe Reinarz, an incident commander, told those attending a town hall meeting in Greer on Monday. ""I don't know exactly where that fire is at this moment, because it is moving so fast."" ""Tomorrow, (the wind) is supposed to pick back up all through Thursday,"" he said. ""We've got two or three days ahead ... that will try all of us."" While there have been no significant injuries so far, officials and area residents complained of heavy smoke that has blanketed the area like fog.

"(CNN) -- One in four adults worldwide are ""deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes,"" the Anti-Defamation League announced, in releasing results of an unprecedented global survey. Nearly half have never heard of the Holocaust, and only a third believe historical descriptions are accurate, the survey found. Carried out by First International Resources and commissioned by the Anti-Defamation League, the survey included 53,100 adults in 102 countries representing 88% of the world's adult population. In native languages, it asked people whether certain traditionally anti-Semitic statements are probably true or false, including that Jews have too much power over international markets, global media, and the U.S. government; that they ""don't care about what happens to anyone but their own kind,"" and that ""Jews are responsible for most of the world's wars."" The survey then calculated how many believed that at least six of the 11 stereotypes were probably true. In the Middle East and North Africa, 74% did. In Eastern Europe, one in three did, and in Western Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, nearly one in four believed most of the stereotypes. Overall, 26% believed at least six of the stereotypes -- a figure representing an estimated 1.1 billion people. The most widely believed stereotype was that Jews are more loyal to Israel than to the countries in which they live. ""For the first time we have a real sense of how pervasive and persistent anti-Semitism is today around the world,"" ADL National Director Abraham Foxman said in a statement. ""The data from the Global 100 Index enables us to look beyond anti-Semitic incidents and rhetoric and quantify the prevalence of anti-Semitic attitudes across the globe. We can now identify hotspots, as well as countries and regions of the world where hatred of Jews is essentially nonexistent."" In Laos, only 0.2% of the adult population holds anti-Semitic views, the survey found. Also at the bottom of the list were the Philippines, Sweden and the Netherlands. In the United States, 9% of respondents believed the majority of the stereotypes. The highest levels were found in the Palestinian territories at 93% and Iraq at 92%. Yemen, Algeria, Libya and Tunisia were next. In Asia, less than a quarter of respondents had heard of the Holocaust and believed historical accounts are accurate. In sub-Saharan Africa, that figured dropped to 12%; in the Middle East and North Africa, 8%. Three quarters of the people surveyed said they've never met a Jewish person. That figure includes most of the people who believe a majority of the anti-Semitic stereotypes are probably true. Former NYPD officer charged with hate crimes in anti-Semitic vandalism .

"(CNN) -- Yes, they exist. And there might be more of them than you think. Fifteen percent of adults in the United States are not online, for reasons that range from lack of interest to fear of the unknown to not being able to afford a computer, says a new survey. And guess what? Almost all of them are OK with it. According to the report from the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 92% of respondents who said they aren't on the Internet also said they have no desire to be. The survey this spring used phone interviews with 2,252 adults who were 18 years old or older. It has a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. As in earlier Pew studies, it appears that older Americans and those with less education are the least likely to be online. Web usage was also slightly lower among rural Americans and Hispanics. Forty-four percent of adults 65 or older said they don't use the Internet. By comparison, only 2% of those between 18-29 said the same. But education was almost as strong a factor as age in the results. A full 41% of Americans who didn't get a high school diploma said they aren't on the Web, compared to just 4% who said they have a college degree. By far, the most popular reason given was some version of ""I just don't care about it."" More than one-third said they are ""just not interested,"" ""don't need it/don't want it,"" or ""think it's a waste of time."" Less popular, but interesting, reasons included not having a computer (13%), saying Web access is too expensive (6%) and being limited by poor eyesight or another physical disability (4%). For all the talk recently about Web security, government snooping and the like, only 3% of respondents said they don't go online because of worries about things like privacy, viruses, spam and hackers. Even among the offline contingent, the Web's broad reach was apparent. More than 4 out of 10 of nonconnected people said they'd asked a friend or family member to look something up or complete a task online for them, and nearly a quarter say they live in a household where someone else uses the Web.","Survey: 15% of U.S. adults say they aren't on the Web .

"(CNN) -- Somali pirates are not building palaces with swimming pools with the ransoms they collect from international shipping companies and hostages, but they are helping the local economy, a new report finds. ""There is a very clear trickle-down effect,"" said author Anja Shortland, of Brunel University in the United Kingdom, who based her conclusion on everything from satellite pictures to local cattle prices. High-resolution satellite imagery shows construction in the inland towns of Garowe and Bosasso, including radio towers, walls and new buildings, she said. She's not seeing much construction on the coast itself, she said. ""There are no light emissions on the coastal villages. But the settlements inland ... that's probably where the money is going,"" she said of the estimated hundreds of millions of dollars Somali pirates have claimed in the past several years. Shortland's report, ""Treasure Mapped: Using Satellite Imagery to Track the Developmental Effects of Somali Piracy,"" was produced for Chatham House, a British think tank. The waters off the largely lawless country have become one of the world's busiest piracy zones, with ever-bolder pirates in small, highly maneuverable craft seizing everything from small yachts skippered by retirees to oil tankers and cargo loads of heavy weaponry. They normally demand a ransom for the safe return of vessel and crew. Military operations have been launched to try to protect ships traversing the region, but attacks continue. And the ransoms are having ""a developmental effect"" on Somalia, said Shortland. The construction seems to be modest, she added. ""We don't see palaces, no swimming pools,"" she said. ""Consumption seems to be constrained by local norms on sharing."" She also said she had seen no direct evidence that the pirates were cooperating with the local al Qaeda-linked militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab -- although some experts believe they are. ""They're very clever businesspeople,"" Shortland said of the pirates, saying they knew that proof of links to terrorism could bring an even tougher international military response down on them. ""I haven't seen any proof.""","Satellite images show construction in Somalia, a new report finds .

"(CNN) -- Doc Watson, the bluegrass music legend from Appalachia who was renowned for his flatpicking and fingerstyle technique on the acoustic guitar, died Tuesday at a hospital in North Carolina, according to Mary Katherine Aldin of Folklore Productions, which represented the singer. He was 89. Watson, a Grammy winning musician who was blinded after birth, had been struggling to recover from May 24 colon surgery and then a followup procedure two days later. The Winston-Salem Journal had reported that Watson's family was called to his bedside Sunday at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center after he took a turn for the worse. The website of Folklore Productions, which is run by the singer's representative, Mitch Greenhill, had been providing updates on his difficult recovery. Watson, who jumped onto the music scene in the early 1960s, is considered influential among folk musicians for his brand of bluegrass, blues, country and gospel music. He won seven Grammy awards and, in 2004, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. He was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010. ""Watson's immense talent and spirit will be deeply missed, and our sincerest sympathies go out to his family, friends and all who were inspired by his music,"" said a statement from Neil Portnow, president/CEO of The Recording Academy, which awards the Grammys. Watson, whose mother sang around the house and whose father was a banjo player and vocalist who led the singing at their Baptist church, was a fingerstyle player who used a thumbpick for bass and a fingerpick for the treble strings -- a ""two-finger"" style that was self-taught. As a flatpicker, he used a traditional tear-shaped medium gauge nylon flatpick and was known for his speed, tone and precision -- with a little extra arm motion. Born Arthel Lane Watson in Stoney Fork Township, near Deep Gap, North Carolina, on March 3, 1923, Watson was blinded from an eye infection as a baby. He toured with his son Merle before Merle's death after a farming accident in 1985, and continually played at an annual festival called MerleFest in his son's honor. Watson got his nickname during a live radio broadcast. ""The announcer remarked that his given name Arthel was odd and he needed an easy nickname,"" according to a biography on the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame website. ""A fan in the crowd shouted 'Call him Doc.' The name stuck ever since."" Watson credited his own father for helping him get his start in music. ""One day he brought (a banjo) to me and put it in my hand and said, 'Son, I want you to learn how to play this thing real well,"" Watson told National Public Radio's Terry Gross in 1988. ""It might help you get through the world."" Watson was steeped in music as a child, from the time his mother held him in her arms at the Mount Paton Church and he listened to the harmony and shape-note singing of such songs as ""The Lone Pilgrim"" and ""There is a Fountain,"" according to a 1998 article in Flatpicking Guitar Magazine by Dan Miller. In 1947, Watson married Rosa Lee Carlton, the daughter of an old-time fiddler, and they had two children, Eddy Merle (named after Eddy Arnold and Merle Travis), born in 1949, and daughter Nancy Ellen, born in 1951. When his son died in 1985 at the age of 36 in the tractor accident, Watson was devastated and vowed to quit playing music -- an experience that would turn his life upside down. His son, a music partner, was ""the best friend I ever had in this world,"" Watson said, according to Miller's magazine article. According to Miller, Watson told Acoustic Musician magazine in 1997: ""The night before the funeral I had decided to quit, just give up playing. Well that night I had this dream. ""Now, usually I do have some light perception, but in this dream it was so dark I could hardly stand it. It was like I was in quicksand up to my waist and I felt I wasn't gonna make it out alive. ""Then suddenly this big old strong hand reached back and grabbed me by the hand and I heard this voice saying, 'Come on Dad, you can make it. Keep going.' Then I woke up. I think the good Lord was telling me it was all right to continue with my music. It's been a struggle, but I still have the love for the music,"" Watson told Acoustic Musician. That same year, 1997, Watson received the National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton. He also received an honorary degree from Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, where an endowment for Appalachian Studies is in his name, and he also received an honorary doctorate from the University of North Carolina at Asheville.

"CHONGQING, China (CNN)  -- At the Chongqing Children's Palace, experts are hoping to revolutionize child-rearing with the help of science. About 30 children aged 3 to 12 years old and their parents are participating in a new program that uses DNA testing to identify genetic gifts and predict the future. For about $880, Chinese parents can sign their kids up for the test and five days of camp. When Director Zhao Mingyou first heard about the technology earlier this year, he instantly knew it could be a success in China. ""Nowadays, competition in the world is about who has the most talent,"" said Zhao. ""We can give Chinese children an effective, scientific plan at an early age."" The test is conducted by the Shanghai Biochip Corporation. Scientists claim a simple saliva swab collects as many as 10,000 cells that enable them to isolate eleven different genes. By taking a closer look at the genetic codes, they say they can extract information about a child's IQ, emotional control, focus, memory, athletic ability and more. ""For basketball, we can test for height and other factors,"" said Dr. Huang Xinhua, a leading scientist on the project. ""We also test listening ability so that can tell us if (the child) might be talented at music."" Would you be happy to test your child? Have your say . DNA testing has been used more widely to determine susceptibility to genetic disease. The test can identify mutations in the genetic code that lead to certain disorders, allow patients to assess risk levels and decide whether they want preventative treatment. For example, the test can identify cancer genes that may make a woman more likely to develop breast or ovarian cancer. Some women have decided to have a mastectomy based on DNA test results and family history. But according to Chinese scientists, this is the first time the test is being offered to children in China to help discover their natural talents. For about $880, Chinese parents can sign their kids up for the test and five days of summer camp in Chongqing, where the children will be evaluated in various settings from sports to art. The scientific results, combined with observations by experts throughout the week, will be used to make recommendations to parents about what their child should pursue.  See photos of the summer camp and testing » . Dr. Huang said the testing can even help project careers down the road.   Examining one child's results, he told CNN: ""This child is very thoughtful and focused, so I suggest she go into management."" Clinical psychologist Dr. Rob Blinn said the DNA test can be accurate but only ""within a sort of limited field"" and that results will not be ""dramatic.""   ""You're not going to be able to predict that someone's going to be like the next Einstein. It's more like this person may have an IQ that's maybe 5 or 10 points greater than this other person because of the absence or presence of these particular genes,"" he said. Still, parents are convinced it will help their child. It is no secret that China's one-child policy often produces anxious and ambitious parents with high expectations for their only child. ""China is different from Western countries,"" said Yang Yangqing, the lab's technical director. ""There is only one child in our families so more and more parents focus on their children's education and they want to give them the best education."" Along with parents, the Chinese government is also interested in giving talented children an early start on their careers. Children as young as two are regularly hand-picked by the government to represent China on the international stage. Future gymnasts, musicians, and basketball players are sent to rigorous training camps and specialized sports schools, and sometimes paid a government salary. There has been speculation China's basketball hero, Yao Ming, was born of an arranged marriage between two well-known basketball players, in hopes of bearing an athletic superstar. Yao and his family have denied these reports. In an autobiography, Yao wrote that his parents actually discouraged him from playing the sport. ""My parents never wanted me to become a professional player,"" Yao wrote. ""They wanted a better life for me."" Yao did start playing when he was nine years old. Three years later, he moved into Shanghai's provincial sports academy where he lived and trained full time. ""My parents agreed only because playing basketball in a junior sports school can improve your chance of getting into college; it counts as extra points on the college entrance exam."" Yao's family reportedly received special stipends from the government to purchase extra food. His success story may well be on the minds of parents in Chongqing. ""It's better to develop her talents earlier rather than later,"" Chen Zhongyan said of her four-year-old daughter, who is attending the genetics camp. ""Now we can find when she is young, and raise her based on what her natural gifts are."" Her daughter, Lai Hongni, has already shown a strong aptitude for dancing, while four-year-old twin boys Luo Lianzhao and Dong Liangtong appear to be good at drawing. ""This way we can really understand our kids,"" said the twins' father, Mr. Dong, referring to the program. In the end, are these parents giving their kids a head start or taking a shortcut? Critics of the program said such analysis has frightening implications. ""Kids, especially at younger ages, they need to have fun, they need to enjoy themselves, they need to find meaning in life,"" Dr. Blinn said. ""They need to have rich deep emotional interchange with their families and parents."" ""Whether it's really good for a two- or three-year-old to be sent off to a camp to be genetically tested, you know, and put in this track so early in life, I have some real doubts about whether that's in the child's best interest,"" Blinn added. ""It seems to be more in the parents' best interest."" But Chen Zhongyan said: ""We only have good intentions for (our daughter). We think this will help her."" It is fair to say many of the kids in Chongqing looked like they were having fun, whether they were jumping on ping pong tables, drawing or playing interactive games. ""I want to be the president of China,"" said three-year-old girl, Liu Xiao Liao. ""Then people will be scared of me."" It seems that some of children may have grand ambitions all of their own.","Chinese summer camps DNA tests kids for natural talents .

"(CNN) -- Spain didn't get a mention in 2011's hotly debated ""New 7 Wonders of Nature"" roundup. So it just went ahead and cooked up its own list. The 7 Natural Wonders of Spain were announced in early June after a round of votes on the campaign's official website. More than 82,000 votes were cast to select the top seven out of 20 Spanish destinations. It's unclear an ancient gold mine counts as a ""natural wonders"" but the seven finalists make a stunningly scenic alternative itinerary to standard travel lists of heritage sites. ""Probably one of the least-known destinations for international tourists is Gaztelugatxe,"" campaign representative Sonia Rodriguez told CNN. ""In the case of Spanish tourists, the least known destinations are Las Medulas or the Lagunas de Ruidera Natural Park."" In the final stage of the campaign, organized by travel insurance company Allianz Global Assistance, a team of ""explorers"" will be picked to officially inaugurate a new tourist route around the sites. All travel expenses and a ""salary"" of â‚¬1,500 ($2,045) will be provided for each explorer to cover a two-week tour of all seven. The website will be accepting applications from Spanish speakers until June 30. The list of natural wonders includes: Gaztelugatxe, a small rocky island; Somiedo Natural Park, a mountain wildlife haven; Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park, a volcanic landscape in southern Andalusia; Las Medulas, an ancient gold mine; Lagunas de Ruidera Natural Park, a landscape of lakes; Fuente De, a gorge in the Picos de Europa mountains and As Catedrais beach, a stunning spot on Spain's northern coast.","More than 82,000 votes were cast to pick new natural wonders in Spain .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico City's thousands of stores went green Wednesday, as amended ordinances on solid waste now outlaw businesses from giving out thin plastic bags that are not biodegradable. Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags. The law affects all stores, production facilities and service providers within the Federal District, which encompasses the city limits. Nearly 9 million people live inside the district and another 10 million reside in surrounding communities that make up greater Mexico City. Mexico City becomes the second large metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw the bags. San Francisco in March 2007 enacted an ordinance that gave supermarkets six months and large chain pharmacies about a year to phase out the bags. Los Angeles is set to impose a ban if the state of California does not enact a statewide 25-cent fee per bag by July. About 90 percent of the bags used in the United States are not recycled. Bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries. China has adopted a strict limit, reducing litter and eliminating the use of 40 billion bags, the World Watch Institute said, citing government estimates. Although compliance has been spotty, violation of the law carries a possible fine of 10,000 yuan ($1,463), World Watch said. In Tanzania, selling the bags carries a maximum six-month jail sentence and a fine of 1.5 million shilling ($1,137). Mumbai, India, outlawed the bags in 2000 and cities in Australia, Italy, South Africa and Taiwan have imposed bans or surcharges. Ireland reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one. Some leading environmentalists are calling for a global ban on the bags. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says plastic bags are the second-most-common form of litter, behind cigarette butts. The bags are the greatest form of litter on the globe's oceans, the U.N. agency said in a recent report. The bags are also a major threat to ocean wildlife, causing the deaths of 100,000 sea turtles and other marine animals that mistake them for food. ""Thin-film, single-use plastic bags, which choke marine life, should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere,"" Steiner said in June. ""There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore, anywhere."" Mexico City, which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world, also is looking at improving its environment in other ways. The municipal government announced this month it will place more than 1,100 bicycles at 84 stations throughout the city for residents to use. Officials said they hope to increase bicycle use as a form of transportation to 5 percent, up from the current 1.2 percent.","Mexico City is Western Hemisphere's second large metro area to ban the bags .

"Washington (CNN) -- A damp and enthusiastic crowd of self-proclaimed ""Tea Party patriots"" gathered at the U.S. Capitol building Sunday for a second straight September 12 march on Washington. The collection of disparate groups and individuals, all supportive of the Tea Party movement, came together to protest what they consider to be out-of-control spending, excessive taxes and a government run amok. Under the theme of ""Remember in November"" -- a reference to the upcoming mid-term congressional elections -- they warned both Democrats and Republicans that it was time for the American people to take back Congress. ""There's only one power on Earth that is big enough to wreck this country, and that's big government,"" said former House leader Dick Armey, chairman of the FreedomWorks group that organized the rally. Quoting the film character Dirty Harry Callahan, Armey said ""a man's got to know his limitations,"" and added that it was time for the government to know its limitations. ""I believe we've gotten the Republican Party's attention,"" Armey said in reference to primary election victories by Tea Party backed candidates over mainstream GOP foes in Kentucky, Alaska and other states. Tea Party activists hope for similar success in Delaware on Tuesday, throwing their support behind candidate Christine O'Donnell in a GOP Senate primary against Rep. Mike Castle. Before Sunday's rally, activists marched along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Washington Monument to the steps of the capitol building despite gray skies and persistent rain. Signs reflected their socially conservative views, with some marchers carrying the Revolutionary War-era banner of a coiled snake and the slogan ""Don't Tread on Me,"" while other placards read ""Less Marx, More Jefferson"" and ""Big Government is Organized Crime."" ""Here we are in a battle for our lives and a battle for the future of this republic,"" FreedomWorks Director of State and Federal Campaigns Brendan Steinhauser told the crowd assembled before the march. Sunday's protest was the second September 12 rally in Washington, following a similar event last year. ""Only a few weeks before this important November election, send one more final message to the folks down the street in that dome behind us,"" Steinhauser encouraged the marchers. ""...We're tired of the way they've been acting in Congress. We're tired what the president has been doing and we've been telling them this for over two years."" As the march proceeded, a few hecklers along Pennsylvania Avenue taunted activists, yelling that they were missing in action when the Bush administration added to the nation's debt. Other hecklers urged Tea Party activists to go home. At the rally, the mention of top Democrats including President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi prompted loud booing from the mostly white, middle-aged crowd.","Rally proceeds in rainy weather .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Dominick Dunne, the former Hollywood producer and best-selling author known for his Vanity Fair essays on the courtroom travails of the rich and famous, died Wednesday in New York city after a long battle with cancer. Dominick Dunne wrote five best selling books and covered high society crimes for Vanity Fair. Dunne, who described himself as ""a high-class Zelig,"" was 83. Called ""Nick"" by his friends, Dunne was putting the finishing touches on his final novel, which he said he planned to call ""Too Much Money,"" when his health took a turn for the worse. He flew to Germany earlier this month for another round of stem cell treatments at the same Bavarian clinic where the late Farrah Fawcett was treated. He was hospitalized upon his return to New York, then sent home. As a correspondent for Vanity Fair magazine, Dunne was a fixture at some of the most famous trials of our times -- Claus von Bulow, William Kennedy Smith, the Menendez brothers, O.J. Simpson, Michael Skakel and Phil Spector. He discovered his magazine writing career in his 50s, through personal tragedy -- his daughter's murder.  Watch why Dunne says he started writing about crime » . He vented his anger at the legal system in ""Justice: A Father's Account of the Trial of his Daughter's Killer,"" following the murder trial of John Sweeney, the estranged boyfriend who strangled 22-year-old Dominique Dunne, in 1982. Sweeney spent fewer than three years in prison. Dunne's article was published by Vanity Fair and he accepted then-editor Tina Brown's offer to write full-time for the magazine. Calling himself a ""diarist,"" Dunne dropped bold-faced names as he spilled behind-the-scenes nuggets gleaned from courtrooms and dinner parties alike.  Watch more about Dunne's life » . ""It is fair to say that the halls of Vanity Fair will be lonelier without him and that, indeed, we will not see his like anytime soon, if ever again,"" said editor Graydon Carter in a tribute posted on the magazine's Web site. He bristled at one writer's oft-repeated description of him as ""Judith Krantz in pants."" He preferred to be known as a crime victim's advocate and frequently spoke at events sponsored by victims' groups. The fact he personally knew many of the people he wrote about set Dunne apart from other crime writers. Dunne wrote that he met music producer Phil Spector for dinner three times during the Simpson murder trial. ""He knew every detail of the trial and story,"" Dunne wrote. ""He carried a gun when we saw each other, but he never pulled it on me."" Spector later became a defendant in a trial Dunne covered. Dunne spoke to CNN in June, while promoting the DVD release of a documentary of his life called ""After the Party."" At the time, he said he was feeling well, happy, and hopeful the treatments were working. ""I'm pro stem cell,"" he said. But even then, he seemed to know he was in a race against time. ""I want to have one more best seller, before I cool,"" Dunne said. ""It's wonderful to have a best seller."" He said his personal story puts the lie to the claim by another high society writer, the late F. Scott Fitzgerald, that there are no second acts in life. ""This is the third act,"" Dunne said. ""I have a novel coming out. I finally got it finished in the clinic ... I'm calling it 'Too Much Money.' That's a hooking title."" Dunne looked back on his life during the hour-long lunchtime phone chat. He said he had just one regret -- his failed marriage to his wife, Lenny, who died in 1997. The couple divorced in 1965 but remained close. ""I loved that marriage,"" he said. ""Lenny was the love of my life. And yet I ruined it. I wasn't formed yet. The regret is that I hurt her."" Dunne had his own television show,  truTV's ""Power, Privilege and Justice."" Marc Juris, truTV's executive vice president, recalled Dunne as ""a master storyteller ... who always kept his eye on the human story behind the crimes."" Besides hosting his own show, Dunne appeared frequently on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""Dominick Dunne was one of the finest people I've known,"" King said. ""He was a terrific writer, a raconteur, and a familiar face on 'Larry King Live' for many years. He was a wonderful human being."" In court, Dunne always dressed impeccably, wearing dark jackets and gray flannels, sharply starched shirts complete with cufflinks, and club-style ties. He used a fountain pen to jot notes in small bound notebooks. He was unabashedly pro-prosecution, although he said he ""lost no sleep"" over Robert Blake's acquittal on a charge of killing his wife, and was troubled by Martha Stewart's conviction on lying to investigators about a stock deal.  Watch Nancy Grace's tribute » . When Simpson's acquittal was announced in 1995, Dunne's jaw dropped and the courtroom cameras caught his expression. It became an iconic image. Simpson later was found liable in a wrongful death suit and ordered to pay more than $33 million to the victims' families. Dunne had been battling cancer for several years -- a fight that became widely known when he collapsed in court last year while covering Simpson's Las Vegas armed robbery trial. He wasn't in court to see Simpson sentenced to prison. Dunne's life story reads like one of his novels. He was born to a well-to-do family in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1925; his father was a cardiac specialist. As a young man, Dunne attended Williams College and fought in the Battle of the Bulge, winning the Bronze star. He later found work in New York as a stage manager for ""The Howdy Doody Show,"" a popular kids' show when television was in its infancy. He moved to Hollywood, rubbing elbows with the biggest names in show business during the 1960s, and became a movie producer. But he soon became addicted to alcohol and drugs, hit bottom and became his own worst nightmare -- a nobody. He sobered up and retired to a one-room cabin in Oregon to write his first novel, then headed back to New York with just a suitcase and his typewriter. In 1985, Dunne wrote his first best-seller, ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles,"" loosely based on a society killing. That success was followed by ""People Like Us,"" ""An Inconvenient Woman,"" ""A Season in Purgatory,"" and, following the Simpson trial, ""Another City, Not my Own."" His brother, the late John Gregory Dunne, was an accomplished author and was married to Joan Didion, a wit and famous writer. In fact, Dunne has said, he was so daunted by their talent that it probably delayed the start of his own writing career by decades. Dunne is survived by his two sons, Alexander and Griffin.

"(CNN) -- All athletes have ups and downs in their career, but few have touched the troughs that Venus Williams has experienced. Having topped the tennis rankings, winning Wimbledon five times and her home U.S. Open twice, she has had to rebuild her career after succumbing to injuries and a debilitating autoimmune disease. But those rocky moments are providing a powerful motivation for the 33-year-old. ""I have to say I feel more confident on the court than I have in my life,"" Williams told CNN's Open Court ahead of the Miami Open which starts Wednesday. ""I think it's because I have really been to the bottom, so once you get that far down and you get back up, you realize you really have nothing to lose. "" Not since 2008, when she won her seventh grand slam on the grass courts of Wimbledon, has Williams tasted success at the sport's biggest events. She has struggled since being diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome -- an autoimmune disorder which causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels -- which she revealed publicly when pulling out during the 2011 U.S. Open. By the end of that year she had plummeted outside the top 100 in the world rankings and faded into the background as her sister Serena -- who had to recover from potentially fatal blood clots on the lungs -- strengthened her reputation as the leading force in women's tennis. While Serena has now won 17 grand slam titles, Venus has fought a very difficult battle -- coming to terms with her new condition, while trying to compete at the highest levels of the sport. Her hard work was last month rewarded in Dubai, where she collected the 45th WTA title of her career and helped to quash doubts over her ability to compete against the very best. A new vegan diet and an inexhaustible determination to overcome the syndrome has breathed new life into her tennis. Such is Williams' confidence that she has already set her sights on competing at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Now ranked 31st, she has a special relationship with the Summer Games, having won four gold medals including the singles title in 2000. The other three came after teaming up with her sister at Sydney, Beijing and most recently, London two years ago. And while the calling of the Copacabana may be some way down the line, Williams is adamant she'll be ready for Brazil. ""The Olympics have been the most special moment for me and Serena in our lives,"" she said. ""Playing doubles as well has been amazing. I get to play with my sister and we get along and support each other. ""So the Olympics is definitely on our radar. It's only a couple of years away -- we think we can get there.""","Venus Williams back in action at Miami Open this week .

"Vatican City (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI is distraught by news of a scandal involving allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in Germany, Germany's highest-ranking Catholic said Friday. Freiburg Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, president of a conference of German bishops, discussed the scandal in a meeting with the pope Friday. The archbishop said he did not believe that priests' celibacy caused the sexual-abuse problem. The pope later reaffirmed his support for priestly celibacy as well, telling a separate group that ""it is an expression of the gift of the self to God and to others."" Zollitsch's meeting with the pope unfolded against the backdrop of a growing scandal involving sex-abuse allegations in Catholic Church institutions in Germany. Nearly every day since the end of January, people have come forward to report cases of sexual abuse by Catholic priests in the nation. News reports put the number of cases at about 170. The scandal took a new turn Friday, when news broke that 30 years ago, Pope Benedict XVI -- who was an archbishop at the time -- approved providing a priest accused of child sex abuse church accommodations in his diocese so the priest could undergo therapy. The German diocese of Munich and Freising said in a statement Friday that the man who is today the pope was involved in the decision. The priest, who was not identified in the statement, was let go from church service in 2008, the statement said. The Vatican had no comment. After their meeting, Zollitsch said that the pope encouraged Catholic leaders in Germany to continue investigating the allegations. Zollitsch said he told the pope that he, too, is dismayed by the allegations of ""abuse and acts of violence."" ""I've already, a few weeks ago, asked for forgiveness to the victims and I would like to repeat it today,"" he said. ""We are ready to confront our responsibility, and we cannot be excused for what has happened,"" he said. ""It is not just a German problem,"" he said. ""It is a problem that concerns many countries."" Zollitsch has addressed the issue before. ""Sexual abuse weighs extremely heavily in the context of the church because children and youth put so much trust in priests,"" he has said. ""There must be no sexual abuse -- especially in the church.""","Pope distraught by Church sex abuse scandal, Germany's top Catholic says .

"(CNN) -- The on-going reports about child molestation in the Catholic church have led the public and the media to ask what causes someone to be sexually attracted to children. Scientists use the word pedophilia to refer to the sexual preference for children before puberty (usually, before age 11), and the word hebephilia, to refer to the sexual preference for children at puberty (usually, ages 11 to 14). Although there have been claims that child molestation is a result of homosexuality (or of celibacy), there is absolutely no basis in science for either conclusion. The scientific evidence instead suggests that pedophilia and hebephilia are caused by atypical brain development occurring near or before birth. MRI research has found very large differences in brain structure between men who have a sexual preference for children and those who have a sexual preference for adults. These differences were detected as regions of low density in brain tissue called white matter. White matter is what connects the various parts of the brain, enabling it to function as a whole. The white matter that is affected in pedophilia and hebephilia is the white matter that connects the parts of the brain that respond to sexual images. (Specifically, these regions were the superior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the arcuate fasciculus.) There does not exist any evidence that gay men share this feature of decreased white matter. In fact, there is some evidence that gay men have areas of more white matter than straight men, in at least some parts of the brain (called the corpus callosum). Also demonstrating that gay men have no more of a sexual interest in children than do straight men are studies that have measured sexual responses directly: There exists a test, called a phallometric test, in which a man is shown images of adults and children, both male and female, while he wears a device on his penis to detect even very small changes in blood volume. The procedure is routinely used with sexual offenders, and research has repeatedly shown phallometric testing to be one of the most -- if not the single most -- accurate predictor of who is the most likely to commit future sexual offenses. When regular gay men and regular straight men (not offenders) are tested, gay men respond to images of children in exactly the same way that straight men do: very little. Out of typical men, approximately two to three percent have a sexual preference for men rather than women, and out of pedophilic/hebephilic men, approximately 20 to 30 percent have a sexual preference for boys rather than girls. It is an error, however, to conclude from this that the two to three percent who prefer men are more likely than the others to break out of their preferences to contact a child sexually. That is, the offenses against boys are being committed by the 20 to 30 percent of pedophiles who prefer boys, not by the two to three percent of otherwise typical men who prefer men. The misconception that gay men pose a disproportionate risk to children comes from a misunderstanding of men's sexual preferences: Pedophilia is the genuine sexual preference for children. The evidence suggests that these are innate and immutable characteristics. Pedophilia/hebephilia is not a temporary state from which those who prefer boys can become typical gay men, nor from which those who prefer girls can become typical straight men. Nor is there any known route by which someone with a genuine sexual preference for adults can develop a genuine sexual preference for children, either girls or boys. Although it is reasonable to question why the Catholic priesthood appears to include so many pedophilic or hebephilic men, there is no scientific evidence that homosexuality is the answer, nor that fostering discrimination against gay men could be a solution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. James Cantor.

"(CNN) -- It can be argued that the biggest star of the Formula One season so far is not one of the six world champion drivers on the grid, it's not one of the legendary teams taking part -- it's not even one of their design geniuses. The biggest talking point this year is the humble tire. Not because it has extraordinary qualities never seen before in motorsport rubber; quite the opposite, in fact. Sole supplier Pirelli has purposefully provided product that breaks down quicker than ever. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher told CNN they are ""like driving on raw eggs."" The result has been seven different winners in eight races as drivers struggle to find the best way to conserve their allocation. ""One of the key points of the season is that Pirelli has been very aggressive and made tires to wear that much during a race,"" the Italian company's test driver Lucas di Grassi told CNN. ""When you decrease this grip level, when you decrease this contact by wearing the tire a lot, you cannot put the power down, you cannot brake, you cannot corner efficiently enough and you lose performance. ""It has been difficult for the teams to find the best strategy, and that has been key to all the overtakings and the excitement of the races."" Pirelli chief backs tire critic Schumacher . Di Grassi gave CNN an insiders' look into Pirelli's tires ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix at Silverstone. ""It has very little to do with a road car tire, actually,"" said the Brazilian, who had one season in F1 with the former Virgin Racing team (now known as Marussia) in 2010. ""This tire is made to produce an enormous amount of grip, five times more than a road car and to last much less. A road car can last for 30,000 kilometers and an F1 race is only 300. This tire is made to last between 100 and 150 km."" Schumacher is struggling to restore the dominance he had at Ferrari when Bridgestone dominated the F1 tire scene, though the 43-year-old German's third-placing in Valencia last month suggests he is finally learning to manage the rubber. Vettel offers support to under-fire Pirelli . Meanwhile, other lesser-known drivers are taking the chance to make their name on the circuit. Schumacher's Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg claimed his first career win in China, Williams' Pastor Maldonado did the same at the Spanish Grand Prix, while Sauber's Sergio Perez and Romain Grosjean of Lotus have earned their first podium placings. Former world champion Kimi Raikkonen has proven quick to adapt on his return to F1, but the driver who has taken the best advantage of the situation is Fernando Alonso. Faced with the prospect of a season struggling to compete in an ill-equipped Ferrari, the two-time titleholder has stunned experts by moving to the top of the standings with two wins and two other podiums while never finishing outside the top 10. F1 legend: Pirelli tires are dangerous . ""It's exactly what makes the difference between a world champion and a common racer,"" Di Grassi said. ""You can see that Alonso has done an amazing job to understand the tires from the beginning of the season until now. ""For a racing driver one of the most difficult things is to get the most grip out of the tire because you have to feel it, actually have to feel that corner before you arrive there, you actually have to feel that brake so you know how much speed you can carry -- and that's totally dependent on the tire performance. ""And on the other hand it is very difficult for you to understand how to go as fast as possible but also preserve the tire, sometimes to drive at 90-95% to extend the life of the tire."" Should Formula One be so unpredictable? Pirelli returned to F1 as sole tire supplier in 2011 in a three-year deal after Bridgestone ended its involvement in the elite division of motorsport. Its head of motorsport Paul Hembery admits there was a conscious decision to put tires in the limelight. ""We always have a tough job getting people to talk about tires. In a competition situation, battling another manufacturer, when you're winning no-one talks about you, but if you're losing you can be sure people will blame it on the tires!"" he said in an interview with the magazine of the Caterham F1 team, which CNN sponsors. ""In a control tire situation, such as we have, unless you're having issues with safety they don't get talked about at all. This was our way to try to become a discussion point of the weekend. It helps justify the investment you make in the sport."" Hembery said that, even without the Pirelli factor, the 12 competing teams are a lot closer in performance this year. ""In past seasons we have seen some cars, even at the front, having maybe a half-a-second to a second advantage over the next cars. This year that gap covers 15 or 16 cars. That we didn't foresee,"" he said. ""It's obviously very interesting to see so many cars in the mix. It's good that we're not sitting here with a third of the season over knowing who's going to win the championship."" Caterham's drivers Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov have yet to register a point this season, but the UK-based team's technical director Mark Smith has been enjoying the challenge. ""It provides an opportunity for us -- on a given day, on a given circuit, in the right ambient conditions -- to perform a little bit beyond where we are expected to perform,"" Smith said. So what can the drivers expect at Silverstone for Saturday's qualifying and the race on Sunday? ""It is one of the fastest tracks of the season and this means for the tires, a very high energy load, cornering, braking and acceleration,"" Di Grassi said. ""My top two tips are: use the soft compound for qualifying for optimum grip and best performance; and for the race, mix between the hard and the soft, also saving the tires as best they can, and attack at the right time.""","Pirelli's tires have become biggest talking point of Formula One season .

"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Oklahoma state Rep. Charles Key never bought the official version of what happened 15 years ago Monday at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Even though authorities prosecuted a small group of extremists, whose homemade bomb killed 168 people, Key claimed that there was a government conspiracy to hide the truth. He said at a 1998 news conference, ""It's obvious that there's more to this case than what some in the government want you to know."" Today, his distrust of the federal government is as deep as ever. Key stands for many of the issues that attract Tea Party protesters to a rally on the Capitol steps: less government, lower taxes and more liberty. ""I was talking about these issues before the Tea Party movement came into existence,"" he said. Using the rhetoric of colonial revolutionaries defying the British monarch, Key says today's federal government is ""dictatorial,"" on its way to becoming ""more of a tyranny."" Key's outspoken views once cost him his job. A retired IRS agent, John Nance, had worked in the Murrah building, knew many of the victims and was outraged over Key's claim that federal agents knew of the bomb plot and did not stop it. ""I couldn't believe that at all,"" Nance said. ""Having served with these people, I know there's no way somebody would have covered it up."" Nance beat Key in the 1998 GOP primary and went on to serve four consecutive terms in the state legislature before stepping down. By then, the raw memories of domestic terrorism on April 19, 1995, had been eclipsed by foreign terrorists on September 11, 2001. The time was right for Key to make a comeback. ""When I ran in 2006, the Oklahoma City bombing was not on the radar screen,"" he said. ""I have moved past it."" Key's former political nemesis also supports many of today's Tea Party positions. ""I believe the American people are fed up with the system and the robbery of our personal rights and privileges,"" Nance said. But he worries that a legitimate political debate will have an unintended consequence. ""My concerns are that there are going to be some radicals who are going to think it's OK to do things that are illegal, like killing people,"" Nance said, ""because they think it's going to be approved by the Tea Party movement or other people who are upset with the government."" It's just the opposite, Key said. ""If [the Tea Party movement] does anything, it's an avenue that people need to have so they can express themselves to the government"" without violence. Key warns that if there's another domestic terrorist attack like the one on the Murrah Federal Building, it will be the fault of the federal government. ""History tells us that it's government becoming too heavy-handed, going out of its proper role, is what fuels extremism,"" Key said. ""People get their buttons pushed, to put it one way. They get their buttons pushed, and some people will take violent actions."" Key's current agenda is inspired by the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which limits federal authority over the 50 states and over individual citizens. He legislative proposals include House Bill 2817, which would fund roads and bridges, not by taxing Oklahomans or selling bonds but by having state-chartered banks create their own money. Another proposal, HB 2810, the State Sovereignty Act, would have Oklahoma withhold federal excise taxes from Washington if the state legislature determines that the U.S. government has violated the Constitution. ""I understand that this legislation is different than your typical legislation,"" Key said. An editorial in The Oklahoman called the bills ""a waste of time"" and sympathized with residents of House District 90 ""if they're having second thoughts"" about re-electing Key. Is Key once again out of step with his constituents? He says no. ""I was elected to look out for their rights. That includes life, liberty and property."" But time is running out for Key. Assuming he is re-elected in 2010, he will become the victim of a populist anti-government movement from the 1990s: term limits. Under Oklahoma law, legislators are limited to 12 years. Even those who rail against the government.","Many of issues Rep. Charles Key stands for attract members of the Tea Party .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Robert Culp, the actor who rose to fame as secret agent Kelly Robinson on the groundbreaking 1960s TV series ""I Spy"" and later played Ray Romano's father-in-law on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" has died. He was 79. Culp died after falling on a sidewalk near a Los Angeles park, said his publicist, Dick Delson. Delson had no further details. The versatile Culp not only acted in ""I Spy,"" which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1968, he also wrote several episodes. The series, which also starred Bill Cosby as Robinson's partner (and, as their covers, trainer to Culp's globe-trotting tennis player), was the first to feature an African-American in a lead role; Cosby won three Emmys for his work. ""I never had so much fun in my life, never, before or since,"" he said of ""I Spy"" in a 2007 interview with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Archive of American Television. Culp and Cosby remained good friends after the series left air. But Culp could be hard on himself, he said -- material he channeled into Kelly Robinson. ""There are a lot of flaws in Kelly Robinson, much more than you see in the ordinary leading character on a TV show,"" he said. ""Those all come from inside. Those are all part of me."" Culp collapsed near the lower entrance to Runyon Canyon Park, a popular hiking area in Hollywood, according to a Los Angeles Police official. He was pronounced dead at a hospital a half hour later, Officer Rosaria Herrera said. It was unclear if the fall caused his death, and the coroner has opened an investigation, she said. Culp made the transition to motion picture actor with mixed success. He starred in 1969's ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,"" a talked-about film about spouse-swapping couples, as well as 1971's ""Hannah Caulder,"" opposite Raquel Welch, and 1972's ""Hickey & Boggs."" Later in his career, he also appeared in ""The Pelican Brief"" (1993). But he was most often seen on television, appearing in dozens of series episodes and TV movies over his 50-year career, starting with scores of episodes of Westerns and Golden Age dramas in the '50s and early '60s. His notable credits include a co-starring role in the series ""The Greatest American Hero"" and appearances on ""The Cosby Show,"" ""Columbo,"" ""Wings,"" ""Chicago Hope"" and ""Raymond."" Culp is survived by his fifth wife, Candace Faulkner. His five marriages produced five children and five grandchildren, according to his Web site. CNN's Jack Hannah and Alan Duke contributed to this report.","Culp, 79, gained TV stardom in 1960s with ""I Spy""

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A man who used to teach at a Roman Catholic religious order's schools in Spain has been arrested in Chile on suspicion of sexually abusing children, police in Spain and Chile said Tuesday. The suspect, Jose Angel Arregui Erana, was arrested in August 2009 in Chile, where he was teaching. He was held on suspicion of filming the abuse and possessing images of sexually abused boys, Jaime Jara, a Chilean cybercrime unit police commander, told CNN partner station CNN+ by telephone Tuesday. Jara said that the suspected crime of possessing the illegal images occurred in Chile but that the alleged sexual abuse of the students and the filming of it apparently occurred in Spain. Arregui, who is in his early 50s, was a physical education teacher in Spain and allegedly placed hidden cameras in gyms and bathrooms to film sexual abuse of the students, Jara told CNN+, a 24-hour Spanish language news channel based in Madrid. The allegations come against a backdrop of allegations of child abuse by priests in Ireland, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands in recent months. The suspect in the Spanish case does not appear to have been a priest, but a layman teaching in schools run by a Catholic order. ""The alleged events happened here, in Spain,"" a Spanish Civil Guard spokesman in Madrid told CNN. The spokesman, who by custom is not identified, said that Civil Guard investigators have been working on the case in recent months and that there has been more than one complaint from an alleged victim. But none of the alleged victims so far have been willing to go public about the events, which in some cases occurred years ago, the Civil Guard spokesman said. The religious order for which Arregui worked in Spain reacted with surprise and indignation Tuesday. But spokesmen for the San Viator congregation said neither they nor other members of the order were aware of the alleged abuse and had received no complaints. Ignacio Pelaez, a spokesman for the San Viator congregation in Madrid, said, ""It's surprising and of concern. They knew nothing about this. If they knew about this situation, they would have raised the matter or taken all measures to avoid it."" The suspect taught at various San Viator schools, including one in Madrid and another in the town of Basauri, in Spain's northern Basque region. ""We are more than surprised. We are upset, and we want this to be solved as soon as possible,"" said Juan Antonio Elgoibar, principal of the San Jose School in Basauri. ""And we want it solved in the best way possible."" The principal said his congregation has ""given all the facilities and help needed to all the members of the investigation team."" The Civil Guard spokesman said the small number of complaints from alleged victims had gone to police, not necessarily to church officials. A woman who lives in Basauri told CNN+ there on Tuesday, ""This is outrageous. ... So many times the Vatican says so many things ... but the reality is that they hardly talk about it and condemn it. ... It is outrageous."" The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Arregui worked at various San Viator order schools in Spain from 1979 through 2007, and that in addition to physical education, he taught language. He later moved to Chile to teach at the University of St. Thomas, in the capital city, Santiago, El Pais reported. The case is under investigation in a Madrid court, El Pais reported. CNN's Al Goodman in Madrid contributed to this report.","Suspect, Jose Angel Arregui Erana, arrested in August 2009 .

"(CNN) -- A video surfaces threatening the Winter Olympics. Russia's President vows the Games will be safe. Some U.S. lawmakers warn that they won't be. One thing was clear as debate over the situation surged on Sunday: security is a top concern, less than three weeks away from the competition. ""It's a very serious fear,"" Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told CNN's State of the Union Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that the Games, like any high-profile event, could be a target for terrorists. But, he said, Russia has a ""perfect understanding"" of the threat and how to stop it. As a transcript of his interview with half a dozen national and international broadcasters was posted on the Kremlin website Sunday, a video that surfaced online again highlighted the security situation. In the video, posted on a well-known Jihadi forum website, two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month's back-to-back bombings in the Russian city of Volgograd speak of those attacks and make an ominous promise. ""We've prepared a present for you and all tourists who'll come over,"" the video says. ""If you will hold the Olympics, you'll get a present from us for the Muslim blood that's been spilled."" Attack on transit hub fuels concerns . In the video, the men are dressed in black and standing in front of a black banner with religious verse that is typically associated with al Qaeda-linked extremists. Last month's attacks in Volgograd, a major transit hub about 650 kilometers (400 miles) away from Sochi, sparked concerns over security as the Olympics approach. The explosions targeted a train station and a trolley bus and claimed the lives of more than 30 people. In addition to the Volgograd attacks, there has also been violence in recent days in the southern republic of Dagestan -- the latest unrest linked to a long-running Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus region. Putin pledges stepped up security . Putin has pledged that visitors to Sochi for the Winter Olympics will be kept safe. ""We will try to make certain that the security measures are not intrusive or too conspicuous, so they are not too noticeable for the athletes, the Olympics' guests or journalists,"" Putin said, according to the interview transcript. ""But at the same time, we will do our utmost to ensure that they are effective."" Russia has plenty of experience in keeping international events secure, Putin said, pointing to the G8 and G20 summits as examples. ""Security is to be ensured by some 40,000 law enforcement and special services officers,"" he said. ""Of course, we will draw on the experience acquired during similar events held in other regions of the world and in other countries. It means that we will protect our air and sea space, as well as the mountain cluster."" U.S. lawmakers: Games aren't safe . But several U.S. lawmakers offered a different take Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. King, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he wouldn't go to the games himself, ""and I don't think I would send my family."" Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, also called on the Russian government to be more cooperative with the United States on intelligence sharing ahead of the games. ""Their level of concern is great, but we don't seem to be getting all of the information we need to protect our athletes in the Games. I think this needs to change, and it should change soon,"" Rogers said. When asked whether he thought Americans would be safe at the Games, former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden said he trusts Russia's ability to provide security. ""I think Americans will be quite safe,"" he said. Putin: 'No danger' for gay visitors . Russia's stance on gay rights has been another area of concern for many visitors. Russia has come under international pressure since its parliament passed a law last summer outlawing ""gay propaganda."" The legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality and has been widely criticized by Western leaders, who have called it archaic and discriminatory. But Putin defended it before journalists Friday, saying that the law was about protecting children. ""We have just recently passed a law prohibiting propaganda, and not of homosexuality, but of homosexuality and child abuse, child sexual abuse. But this has nothing to do with persecuting individuals for their sexual orientation,"" he said. ""So there is no danger for people of such nontraditional sexual orientation who are planning to come to the Games as guests or participants."" Russia has also been criticized over the limitations placed on freedom of speech at Sochi. The official protest site is about a 30-minute drive from the Olympic village and is difficult to find. But Putin said no visitors should fear problems if they protest, for example, over gay rights. Putin says gays 'can feel safe' at Sochi Winter Olympics . Putin: No corruption . The Russian leader also dismissed claims that corruption has pushed up the cost of the games, saying there was no proof that had occurred. When it won the bid in 2007, Russia said the Winter Games would cost $12 billion, but the government's website now cites the total cost as 1.5 trillion rubles ($45 billion.) ""I do not see serious corruption instances for the moment, but there is a problem with overestimation of construction volumes,"" Putin said. He suggested the problem was a universal one, where companies underestimate costs in the tendering process in order to win the project, and then push the price back up. But, he said, there was no evidence of anything that could be considered corruption, or ""theft of public funds with the help of state officials in whose hands these funds fall,"" in Sochi. ""If anyone has such information, give it to us, please. I repeat once again, we will be grateful. But so far there was nothing but talks,"" he said. Putin put the cost of preparations for the Winter Olympics at only 214 billion rubles ($6.4 billion) but acknowledged that the total sum, including the cost of major infrastructure projects, was much higher.

Boris Nemtsov, former deputy prime minister of Russia and a vocal critic of Putin, published a report last year describing the Sochi games as one of the most ""outrageous swindles"" in recent Russian history. He claimed that up to 60% of the final cost -- or $30 billion -- has been embezzled.

"Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform moved a major step closer to reality Monday when the Senate voted before dawn to overcome a Republican filibuster against a sweeping $871 billion health care bill. The procedural vote virtually ensures the bill's final approval by the chamber later this week. It would then be merged with the $1 trillion House version in what would be tough negotiations on President Obama's top domestic priority for 2009. A final bill requiring approval from both chambers would not be completed until after Congress returns in January from its holiday break. Obama hailed the Senate's overnight vote as an important victory for the American people. ""By standing up to the special interests who prevented reform for decades and who are furiously lobbying against it now, the Senate has moved us closer to reform that makes a tremendous difference for families, for seniors, for businesses, and for the country as a whole,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. iReport.com: Give your thoughts on the Senate health care bill . The influential American Medical Association, a traditional opponent of health care reform, announced Monday it supports the Senate bill. AMA President-elect Dr. Cecil Wilson joined Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats to call for changes that Reid said would help provide health care for ""all people, not just those who can afford it."" The 60-40 party line vote -- cast shortly after 1 a.m. -- kept Senate Democrats on track to pass the bill on Christmas Eve. They needed every vote in their 60-member caucus for the supermajority in the 100-member chamber needed to overcome the filibuster, and some senators extracted beneficial provisions for their states before agreeing to support the bill. Republicans have mounted a fierce campaign against the bill, using procedural tricks to slow debate and casting the measure as an unnecessary government intrusion into health care that will raise costs. Obama rejected Republican claims that the bill would add to the federal deficit, noting the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported the Senate plan would reduce the deficit by $132 billion over the first 10 years. If a combined House-Senate health care bill eventually wins final approval from Congress and is signed by Obama, it would be the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid over four decades ago. Republicans ripped the Democratic majority for passing the measure in the middle of the night and accused Democrats of ramming the bill through despite growing public opposition. ""Make no mistake: If the people who wrote this bill were proud of it, they wouldn't be forcing this vote in the dead of night,"" argued Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""Mark my words: this legislation will reshape our nation,"" he said. ""And Americans have already issued their verdict. They don't want it. They don't like this bill, and they don't like lawmakers playing games with their health care to secure the votes they need to pass it."" Read Dr. Sanjay Gupta's take on the health care bill . The unusual timing of the vote was a consequence of Senate rules, the determination of Democrats to pass the bill before adjourning for the holidays, and the GOP's willingness to use every possible legislative tactic to slow the bill's progress. Two more procedural votes this week also will require Democrats to win the backing of 60 members to break a GOP filibuster. Final passage of the measure, by contrast, will require a simple majority of 51 votes. To Democrats, Monday's vote signaled eventual victory on the Senate bill. ""The die is cast. It's done,"" New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer proclaimed. But compromises made to win the backing of moderate Democrats, such as Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, enraged many liberal Democrats and threatened to undermine support for the bill. Liberal Democrats are particularly upset with Reid's decision to abandon a government-run public health insurance option and an expansion of Medicare to Americans as young as age 55 -- ideas strongly opposed by Lieberman and other centrists. Top Democrats, however, argue that the Senate bill as currently written would still constitute a positive change of historic proportions. The legislation, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would extend health insurance to more than 30 million Americans currently lacking coverage while reducing the federal deficit.

"New York (CNN) -- Internet search giant Google is bracing for a fine that could top $500 million, after a federal probe of illegal online pharmacy ads placed on the website over the past three years, CNN has confirmed. Law enforcement sources tell CNN that federal prosecutors in Rhode Island, along with undercover agents from the Food and Drug Administration, are heading up a massive investigation aimed at showing Google knowingly took advertising money from websites selling highly addictive drugs without a legitimate prescription. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Providence told CNN he could ""neither confirm nor deny"" reports of the probe, and Google declined comment ""since this is a legal matter."" But in early May, Google filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying it was setting aside $500 million to potentially resolve a case with the Department of Justice. In its filing, Google stated only that the matter involved ""the use of Google advertising by certain advertisers."" If a fine of $500 million or higher is in fact imposed on Google, legal experts say it would be the largest such penalty in U.S. history. A recent study by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Southern California showed a significant expansion in treatment for prescription drug abuse from 2000 to 2007. During those years, the study showed, emergency room admissions for prescription drug abuse rose from 100,000 to 200,000. The study showed states with the greatest expansion of high-speed internet access also had the largest increase in admissions for treatment of prescription drug abuse. ""There's all sorts of drugs one can purchase illegally over the Internet,"" one of the study's co-authors, Dr. Anupam Jena, told CNN. ""So there's narcotics, like OxyContin and Percocet. And there's stimulant medications, sometimes used to treat ADHD -- attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. There are also ... anti-anxiety medications like Ambien or Ativan that people routinely use for the correct indications, but sometimes can be abused."" Furthermore, state regulators and watchdog groups say they have been warning Google and other search engines for years that online pharmacies have been allowed to operate without adequate supervision. Joseph Califano, the president and founder of Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, warned Google CEO Eric Schmidt of the problem in a 2008 letter. Califano, a former aide to President Lyndon Johnson and a Cabinet secretary under Jimmy Carter, told Schmidt that his research had found ""prominent displays of ads for rogue internet pharmacies in a Google search for controlled drugs."" ""This suggests that Google is profiting from advertisements for illegal sales of controlled prescription drugs online,"" Califano wrote. The company never responded, he said. ""I asked him, 'Please, you have to look at what's going on. Why are we having such an explosion of prescription drug abuse among teenagers and kids?'"" Califano, now 80, told CNN. ""Well, where do they get them?"" Califano warned that illegal online pharmacies are a pipeline for children who want to obtain drugs, and said Google ""can do something about this that nobody else can do."" CNN has been breaking news on this story of illegal online drug purchases for several years. In 2008, not long before Califano sent his letter to Google, CNN correspondent Drew Griffin was able to purchase the potentially addictive drug Percocet without seeing or talking to a doctor. He ordered the drug online and within a day, the pills were at the doorstep of his home, the prescription signed by a doctor in Tennessee he had never seen or met. For Califano, a longtime Washington insider, the ease and availability of online drugs is ""a crime."" ""To me, it's an example of putting profits over people,"" he said. ""That's what we're talking about here. And it's bad, really bad, because we're talking about kids."" Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"(CNN) -- Estela Carlotto's wish was to hug her grandson before she died -- a dream not easily granted to those like her who had a family member snatched at birth during Argentina's military dictatorship. During her nearly four-decade journey, she became the leader of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a famous group of Argentine activists dedicated to reuniting kidnapped babies with their birth families. And this week, she learned her wish will come true, when the Abuelas, as the group is known, announced that Carlotto's own grandson has been identified through a DNA test. More than 100 people have been reunited thanks to the efforts of the Abuelas, but the news that the search for the group's leader is fulfilled struck a strong chord in Argentina. ""He searched for me,"" Carlotto told reporters. ""What the grandmothers say came to be: 'They will come search for us just as we continue to search for them.'"" The kidnappings of children by government forces during Argentina's 1976 to 1983 military dictatorship is among the darkest chapters in a period commonly called the Dirty War. Unearthing mysteries of Argentina's Dirty War . Carlotto's daughter, Laura, belonged to an urban guerrilla group called Montoneros, according to the Abuelas. She was in her young 20s when she was arrested -- kidnapped, the activist group says -- and imprisoned in 1977. Laura was 2Â½ months pregnant when she was detained. On June 26, 1978, she gave birth at a military hospital to a son she named Guido. But afterward she was returned to her cell without her baby. Two months later, she was executed, according to the Abuelas. Her remains were exhumed and identified in 1985. The dictatorship left Estela Carlotto without a daughter, and in the dark about what happened to her grandson. But she has said in interviews that she never lost hope that he was alive. 2012: Former dictators found guilty in Argentine baby-stealing trial . ""He's beautiful,"" she told a reporter, her voice filled with the same tenderness of a grandmother doting a newborn's photo. But for the moment, details about her grandson's life remain few to protect his privacy. The 36-year-old man identified as Guido Montoya Carlotto is Ignacio Hurban, director of a music school in the city of Olavarria, about 220 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. According to the Grandmothers, Hurban had some doubts about his life story and in June initiated contact with the Abuelas with his suspicions. He submitted to interviews with the group as well as a DNA test that confirmed the match. A crowd of supporters burst into cheers when Carlotto retold the moment when she got the call that ""this is your grandson with 99.99% certainty."" It isn't clear when the man first had doubts about his origins, but the group mentioned that in the past he had participated in events for the Grandmothers. Among the first to call Carlotto after the news was revealed was Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Both women cried as they celebrated the outcome. And as for that long-awaited hug, Argentina's state-run Telam news agency reported that grandmother and grandson met for the first time Wednesday evening.

"Silverstone, England (CNN) -- If an unexpected fourth place at the Czech MotoGP two weeks ago had given Marc Marquez's rivals cause for hope, Sunday at Britain's Silverstone served as a reminder that his talents run deep. This was Marquez at his imperious best, as well as a fine advertisement for a sport that thrives on white-knuckle tension; in a scintillating contest, MotoGP's youngest ever champion roared back to form. His victory means only a disaster for the 21-year-old Catalan can prevent him lifting his second title well before the end of the season. Repsol Honda's record-breaking star began on pole after a typically impressive qualifying session, but quickly found himself playing catch-up to an apparently rejuvenated Jorge Lorenzo. The Movistar Yamaha rider seized his chance in warmer than expected conditions, taking an early lead as a fierce skirmish developed behind him. Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso had gatecrashed the Honda-Yamaha power party on the starting grid, and the Italian took his increasing confidence into battle with Dani Pedrosa and Valentino Rossi. Gradually the front five eased away from the chasing pack, but remained close enough to one another to throw up some heart stopping moments as positions changed lap after lap. The contest reached an electrifying climax in the final moments, with Marquez and Lorenzo diving into an uncompromising dogfight. When Lorenzo seized the initiative with just three laps remaining it looked as though the man from Mallorca might be able to hold on for the win. The two riders knocked fairings as their battle raged, before an audacious and fearless pass from Marquez fired the championship leader back to the front with two laps remaining. The champion held his lead to cross the line to claim his 11th victory from the 12 Grand Prix this season. Marquez was delighted with the win, having missed out to Lorenzo at Silverstone last year. ""With higher temperatures it seems that both Jorge and Valentino took a step forward,"" he said. ""Above all, Jorge, because he had a great pace and we were fighting right to the end. ""It was important to win, after missing out at Brno. I also had a score to settle from last year, when Jorge beat me on the final corner, so I am happy to be back on the top step of the podium!"" Lorenzo, meanwhile, revealed that he had struggled to maintain the same pace as his rival, and blamed their coming together for the loss of valuable momentum. ""I lost a lot of time when he (Marquez) touched me,"" he said. ""I knew that he was going to try to overtake me in this corner in first gear on the right, but I didn't let him enter. ""On the outside I opened the throttle and he touched me. In the next corner he touched me again as he went into the corner and I lost seven tenths of a second."" Even so Lorenzo was pleased with his second place. ""I made a really good start and pushed 100%, more than ever, so I am really proud of my riding,"" he said. Rossi -- who set a new outright record of 246 starts in the premier class of Grand Prix racing -- won the battle behind the leaders to take third from Pedrosa and a disappointed but philosophical Dovizioso. ""The result confirms the improvements we are making,"" the Italian said. ""Finishing the race less than ten seconds behind the leaders was almost a dream before the start, but instead we did it and we were always in with a fighting chance of finishing on the podium."" The home fans were left frustrated as one of their favorites, Tech3 Yamaha's Bradley Smith, was knocked out of contention by a cracked rear wheel. The Briton's tyre deflated as a result, forcing him into the pits. When he re-joined with a new wheel his chances of a point-scoring finish had gone, but he did manage to ride to within a lap of the leaders, to loud cheers from the stands. ""I tried to stay out and fight through it but it just got too dangerous to ride,"" Smith said. ""When we changed (the wheel), I proved that I have the pace for sixth. It was a good weekend up until the race and the team did a great job, but these things happen sometimes."" Tech3 could, however, console themselves with an outstanding performance from rookie Pol Espargaro, who forced his way into a highly creditable sixth position. Of the other top British talent, Scott Redding piloted his Open Class Gresini Honda to a solid tenth, but Ducati's Cal Crutchlow could only manage twelfth. The talented Coventry-born rider must surely be counting the days until he leaves for his new team, LCR Honda, at the end of an intensely trying season. The championship now takes a two week break before the San Marino MotoGP, with Marquez a titanic 89 points clear of Pedrosa, and Rossi a further 10 points back in third, with only six races remaining this season.","Repsol Honda's Marc Marquez back to winning ways at Silverstone .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs apologized on Thursday for causing ""confusion"" in communicating about the number of deaths caused by delayed care at its medical facilities, but said ""there was no intent to mislead anyone."" In a statement to CNN, the VA said two separate reviews were ""intertwined in written and oral statements leading to confusion. ... VA inadvertently caused confusion in its communication on this complex set of reviews that were ongoing at the time. For that, we apologize."" Earlier this week, House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller accused the agency of ""what appears to be an attempt to mislead Congress and the public"" by manipulating its account of the number of deaths. In a letter to the VA, Miller accused officials of giving questionable information on a fact sheet distributed to his committee at a briefing in April and consistently repeating that information in congressional testimony and to journalists. VA misled on number of deaths tied to care delays, congressman charges . Erroneous info repeated . The VA initially said it discovered 23 veterans had died after reviewing 250 million cases dating to 1999. It actually reviewed only 11,000 cases over a much shorter period, from 2010 to 2012, which may indicate there could be more deaths than what the agency has reported. Even former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki repeated the erroneous information during a news briefing on Capitol Hill. ""We went back in time 15 years. Out of that, we probably looked at 250 million consults. That was narrowed down to 76 institutional disclosures, of which there were 23 deaths that had occurred,"" Shinseki said. His comments came about two weeks before he resigned in May under pressure over the scandal over delayed care and findings that VA schedulers manipulated patient wait times. Obama signs VA overhaul . The VA apology comes on the same day President Barack Obama signed into law a $16 billion measure to address problems at VA medical facilities. Miller slammed the VA's response. ""Even though landmark VA reform legislation has been signed into law, it seems the same sort of dishonesty and deception that caused the VA scandal is continuing unabated at the Department of Veterans Affairs,"" Miller said in a statement. ""In briefings to congressional staff, in congressional hearings and in discussions with the media in April, top VA Central Office officials omitted key facts about a review of delays in VA care. ""VA officials let this false impression fester for four months until they were confronted about the scheme by Congress and the media. The department is now attempting to chalk all this up to a misunderstanding, but that explanation doesn't pass the smell test,"" Miller said. He added that it was ""a blatant attempt to mislead Congress, the press and the public, and we will not let it stand."" Miller said new VA Secretary Robert McDonald must find out who was behind it and fire them. Investigations of VA . CNN has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across VA hospitals across the country for nearly a year. Since August 2013, CNN has repeatedly requested records from the VA through the Freedom of Information Act, but the agency so far has not provided many key documents. A recent report compiled by the office of Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma found that more than 1,000 veterans might have died in the past decade as a result of malpractice or lack of care from VA medical centers. At his confirmation hearing in July, McDonald vowed to transform the embattled federal health care system. ""The seriousness of this moment demands urgent action,"" McDonald wrote in his testimony.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Will the recount state become the re-primary state? Will voters in Michigan have their say in picking a Democratic candidate for president? Michigan's Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm, shown in 2006, called for her state's delegates to be seated. Political leaders in Florida and Michigan are talking about making sure voters in their states are included when it comes to choosing the Democratic nominee. The discussions are unfolding amid a grueling, delegate-by-delegate fight between Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. The national Democratic Party stripped Florida and Michigan of their delegates to the national convention after the states moved up the dates of their primary elections. That means votes that were cast in primaries in those states will not translate into delegates awarded to one candidate or the other in the contest for the Democratic nomination for president.  Watch Florida's mounting frustration » . Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said the states can either come up with a new plan to choose a slate of delegates or appeal to the party's credentials committee when the convention opens in August. ""The rules were set a year and a half ago. Florida and Michigan voted for them and then decided that they didn't need to abide by the rules. When you're in a contest you do need to abide by the rules,"" he said Thursday on CNN's ""American Morning."" The national Democratic Party stripped Florida -- epicenter of the 2000 election debacle -- of its 210 national convention delegates as punishment for the state's decision to move its party primaries to January 29. Michigan received the same treatment after moving its primary date to January as well, losing its 156 convention delegates. On Wednesday, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican, and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, called on the Democratic National Committee to seat their states' delegations. They accused the party in a statement of silencing ""the voices of 5,163,271 Americans"" who voted in their primaries. ""It is intolerable that the national political parties have denied the citizens of Michigan and Florida their votes and voices at their respective national conventions,"" they wrote. Speaking on CNN's ""American Morning,""  Crist -- who signed the bill that changed Florida's primary date -- pointed fingers outside the state. ""People should be heard and not party bosses in Washington,"" he said. ""This is about common sense and people having the right to vote. It is unconscionable that people's votes will not count. They should count."" Wednesday night in Washington, Democratic House members from Florida and Michigan met for about an hour to talk about possibilities that would lead to delegations from those states influencing the outcome of the Democratic nominating contest. ""Both delegations feel very, very strongly -- adamantly -- that our delegations be seated at the national conventions,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz of Florida. Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan said he's not sure of the best way to resolve the dispute but that voters from Florida and Michigan should have their voters counted. ""I think the key is the voice of Michigan and Florida is heard and there's a procedure that is fair to the residents and fair to the two candidates,"" he said. Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan suggested Wednesday that his state could hold caucuses to select its delegates. Participants declined to say whether there is general agreement on a way forward -- for example, whether the two states should redo the votes there or use results from the previous primaries. They pledged to continue discussions, though no formal meeting has been scheduled. The national Republican Party also penalized Florida and Michigan, but cut each state's allocation in half rather than stripping them entirely. Because Arizona Sen. John McCain clinched the GOP nomination Tuesday night, any fight over seating Florida and Michigan's delegates will matter little to the GOP race. Clinton, the New York senator and former first lady, was the only leading Democrat to appear on ballots in Michigan and made a handful of allowed fund-raising appearances in Florida in the last days before the vote, while other candidates skipped the state. She won both contests. Now, as she trails Obama by 100-plus delegates, Clinton has called for the Michigan and Florida delegations to be seated at the party's convention in Denver, Colorado. The Democrats' next big primary is seven weeks away in Pennsylvania, where 158 delegates are at stake. Adding new contests to the mix could prolong the Democrats' heated battle for the nomination while giving McCain more freedom to focus on November's general election. Crist told CNN's ""Late Edition"" on Sunday that he supported holding another primary to resolve the dispute. But Wednesday, he said the state would not pay for a second contest. The Florida Democratic Party estimates that a new primary could cost as much as $18 million -- and Sen. Bill Nelson said the DNC should pick up the tab. ""There's no way the state legislature is going to fund another election when they are in economic cardiac arrest right now,"" said Nelson, a Florida Democrat. ""They are cutting payments to health care, education, social services and payments to the cities and counties. ""There's no way that they're going find an additional $18 million to fund another election, nor should they. This shouldn't be the burden of the taxpayers of Florida -- this should be the burden of the Democratic National Committee."" Party officials have said they will not pay for Florida to hold a new primary because they warned the state not to move up its primary. ""The Democratic nominee will be determined in accordance with party rules,"" Dean said. But he emphasized that his goal was to maintain party unity, and called the statement by Crist and Granholm ""good news."" ""We look forward to receiving their proposals, should they decide to submit new delegate selection plans, and will review those plans at that time,"" he said. But Nelson said the party's stance was unfair, since it was Republican lawmakers in Tallahassee and a Republican governor, Crist, who decided to move up the state's primary over the opposition of Democrats. If the state's decision to move the primary remains controversial, it pales in comparison to a bill two Florida state senators are discussing. Sen. Nan Rich, a Clinton backer, is proposing that the state remove the party's eventual presidential nominee from the state's ballot unless it seats Florida's delegates. ""That's one option,"" Rich said. Legal scholars say they doubt removing the Democratic or Republican nominee's name from the ballot would be constitutional. But state Senate Democratic leader Steve Geller said he had been approached by Republicans promoting the bill. Geller said it is a sign of how bitter the fight over the delegates has become and how deep the self-inflicted wounds are among Democrats, calling it ""a typical Democratic firing squad."" ""We're lining up in a circle,"" he said. ""Maybe we're aiming low and shooting ourselves in the feet instead, but this makes no sense to me."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Keeping global warming down to a level people can live with means cutting carbon emissions to ""near zero"" by the end of the century, even in an increasingly industrialized world, the top U.N. experts on the issue reported Sunday. That may be doable, but it will take ""substantial investments"" in everything from planting more trees to replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power sources like solar, wind and nuclear energy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced in its latest report. ""What this report clearly shows is that the challenges to resolve the global common problem are huge,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, a German economist and one of the lead authors of Sunday's document. ""But also this report shows that there are some steps to resolve this issue. I would say in that sense the report also outlines the challenges, but it provides hope -- modest hope."" Jennifer Morgan, the director of the Climate and Energy Program at the World Resources Institute, agreed. ""The report shows that the scale of change require to tackle climate change is massive, but the ability to solve it is possible,"" she said Sunday. ""We need to do it quickly, before it will get so expensive to respond that we may hit the points of no return."" Little time left to turn down the world's heat, U.N. says . 'Substantial investments' Edenhofer's modest hope will require more than tripling the share of electricity produced by renewable sources or nuclear power, along with refining the still-evolving technology of capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground. And it will take a coordinated global effort, likely including taxes on emissions, he said. No direct price tag was attached to that scenario, but Edenhofer said it would require ""substantial investments,"" and more delays just drive up the expected cost. The impact could amount to shaving the projected average growth of the global economy by six-hundredths of a percentage point -- from about 2% per year to 1.94% -- over the coming century. The total global economy was about $72 trillion in 2012, according to World Bank figures. ""We are clearly arguing that achieving these goals is a huge technological and institutional challenge. We are not saying this is a free lunch,"" Edenhofer told reporters from Berlin, where the final document was approved over the weekend. ""Climate policy is not a free lunch,"" he said. ""But climate policy could be a lunch worthwhile to buy."" In the United States, the second-biggest producer of greenhouse gases, a boom in natural gas along with conservation efforts, more renewable energy and a steep recession combined to reduce carbon emissions by about 10% in the last decade. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who in February called the issue ""the greatest challenge of our generation,"" said Sunday's report is an economic opportunity. ""So many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper, more readily available, and better performing than they were when the last IPCC assessment was released less than a decade ago,"" Kerry said in a written statement. ""These technologies can cut carbon pollution while growing economic opportunity at the same time. The global energy market represents a $6 trillion opportunity, with 6 billion users around the world."" Minds must change, supporter says . But addressing the issue involves more than technological changes, said Morgan, who worked as a review editor for one of the chapters of the report. ""It is about shift of mindsets of political leaders and business leaders to step it up and have the will to implement changes,"" she said. Despite more than two decades of efforts to restrain carbon emissions, not only are emissions still going up, they're going up faster than ever, Edenhofer said. Though there's been an increased emphasis on generating power from renewable sources, the use of coal has gone up in the past 10 years, he said. Limiting the projected increase in global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F) over preindustrial times will require cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by 40% to 70% by 2050 ""and to near zero by the end of this century,"" the IPCC concluded. Sunday's report is the third part of a benchmark U.N. assessment that comes out every six years. The first, in September, reaffirmed the science behind the warming of the planet; the second, at the end of March, warned that chances to limit the increase in temperatures are slipping away, with the world's poor expected to bear the worst of the effects. Morgan said it will be important to craft solutions that are fair and take care of those people who are being impacted already or soon will be. Blueprint for national leaders . The reports are aimed at guiding world leaders as the United Nations attempts to work out a new treaty to limit emissions in 2015. Previous rounds of talks have been strained by disputes among the biggest emitters -- China, the United States and European countries -- and poorer countries whose populations could see the worst impacts first. About half of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age has been produced since 1990, the scientists behind Sunday's report concluded. On the current path, global average temperatures could go up anywhere from 3.7 to 4.8 degrees C (6.7 to 8.6 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100. That would produce a world with higher sea levels, deeper droughts and more intense storms, along with oceans made more acidic by the absorption of carbon dioxide, with impacts on vital marine life that ""we cannot estimate at this point in time,"" IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri said. There's ""a broad set of technologies"" that could be deployed to head off that future, Edenhofer said -- many of which are listed in the report. And the document points to potential benefits of the effort, including cleaner air and healthier populations. One of the most controversial is carbon capture and sequestration technology, which would reduce smokestack emissions and put the carbon dioxide in storage. But the technology is expensive. ""It's not fully proved yet in terms of being commercially viable, but it looks like it has the most promise of all, because it can be coupled with lots of sources of carbon dioxide and essentially be used to neutralize them,"" said Charles Kolstad, a report co-author and an environmental economist at Stanford University. If paired with renewable bioenergy sources, it could lead to net negative emissions, he said. Act now, environmentalists say . Other leaders of some of the world's biggest environmental groups called the report a positive one. ""The IPCC is clear that acting on climate change is possible, beneficial and affordable,"" said Samantha Smith, the head of the World Wildlife Fund's climate and energy program.

She said the report should convince investors ""to pull your money out of dirty fossil fuels and put it into renewable energy and energy efficiency."" Morgan said individuals can also do that by seeking greener power sources and ways to save energy, and by keeping a close eye on where they invest their 401(k) plans and other savings vehicles. She also said it would be a a challenge for her organization to make sure that people see there is still hope.

"(CNN) -- Like a first love or a first car, a first computer can hold a special place in people's hearts. For millions of kids who grew up in the 1980s, that first computer was the Commodore 64. Twenty-five years later, that first brush with computer addiction is as strong as ever. Millions of Commodore 64s were sold in the 1980s. ""There was something magical about the C64,"" says Andreas Wallstrom of Stockholm, Sweden. He remembers the day he first laid eyes on his machine back in 1984. ""My father brought it home together with a tape deck, a disk drive, a printer, and a couple of games...I used to sneak home during lunch to play [on it] with my friends.""  Learn about the components of the C64 system » . Wallstrom is the webmaster and designer for C64.com, a Web site dedicated to preserving the games, demos, pictures, magazines and memories of the Commodore 64. C64.com visitors are mostly nostalgia seekers -- men in their 30s looking to download their favorite childhood games. Emulators let them play the games without having a machine. Popular downloads include ""Boulder Dash,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" and ""The Great Giana Sisters."" ""It may have not been the most sophisticated computer, but it did have a lot of personality and it was lovable and remains loveable,"" said Harry McCracken, vice president and editor in chief of PC World. Often overshadowed by the Apple II and Atari 800, the Commodore 64 rose to great heights in the 1980s. From 1982-1993, 17 million C64s were sold. The Guinness Book of World Records lists the Commodore 64 as the best-selling single computer model. The computer featured 64 kilobytes of memory (a lot for 1982), a huge index of games, a sophisticated sound chip, and a relatively parent-friendly price -- $595. On Monday, the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, will celebrate the C64's 25th anniversary. Computer pioneers will reflect on the C64's achievements and contribution to the industry. Jack Tramiel, the founder and CEO of Commodore, will attend, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and William C. Lowe, father of the IBM PC. ""It was the right machine for the time,"" said McCracken. ""The Commodore 64 did a lot to popularize computers."" Sold in shopping malls and discount stores and not just small computer stores -- the norm for the time -- the C64 became many people's gateway into the world of computers, said Brian Bagnall, author of ""On the edge: The spectacular rise and fall of Commodore."" ""It was so new,"" Bagnall said. Users could play many games and also learn the programming language of computers -- BASIC. Jim Park, 39, a software developer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, got his start on a C64 in 1984 when he was 16. Park learned to program motion-graphics synchronized to dance music and ran a BBS, an electronic bulletin board system, the precursor to the Internet. ""I really lucked out that something so obscure and nerdy has turned into the modern business and pop-culture phenomenon that it has,"" he said. Wallstrom said it was the simplicity of the C64 that made it so great. ""You switched it on and it was there, ready for input in a second. Programming on the C64 was straightforward because you got to command the processor directly. You had full control of the whole computer...that is something you don't have with any modern PC."" Still, the C64 had an uneven reputation. It was widely considered clunky, its BASIC outdated and graphics weak in comparison to the Apple II and Atari 800, according to McCracken. And then there was the quirky floppy drive. ""It was pitifully slow,"" Bagnall said. ""It was big and noisy. It sounded like a Gatling gun when it was trying to load stuff."" The floppy drive took so long to load, the music would play before the game did, recalls Rob Kramer, artistic & business director of Productiehuis ON, a production company based in the Netherlands. ""These tunes would get stuck in your head,"" he said. In 2006 Kramer came up with the idea of having an orchestra play the music from the games. ""We found this crazy orchestra that plays on the street. It's full of young people in music school. They are in their 20s and they'd never played a Commodore 64. For them it was like 'Wow, this is great stuff.' "" The 12-piece C64 Orchestra has played at churches, musical venues and festivals. The compositions run 4-6 minutes. The crowds are mostly fans of the C64. ""They really dig it,"" Kramer said.  Watch how I-Reporters are using the C64 today » . Kramer described the music as haunted. ""There's a lot of tension, and it repeats itself. It takes you places where normal classical music doesn't.""  Watch as the orchestra plays » . The classical ensemble released a CD in Europe featuring the original computer and orchestral versions of ""Delta,"" ""Commando,"" Monty on the Run,"" ""International Karate"" and more. The CD will be available in the United States on January 15. By 2007 computing standards, the Commodore 64 is a dinosaur. A relic of the past, long made obsolete by the march of time. But the C64 isn't dead. It's very much alive -- on gaming Web sites, through music and in the memories of millions who owned and loved them. ""Computer nostalgia is something that runs pretty deep these days. The memories that people have of this machine are incredible,"" McCracken said. Twenty-five years ago computers were an individual experience; today they are just a commodity, he said. ""I don't think there are many computers today that we use that people will be talking about fondly 25 years from now.""

"(CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge kicked off a nine-day Southeast Asia tour Tuesday with a viewing in Singapore of an orchid named in honor of William's late mother, Princess Diana. Diana never saw the orchid, which was christened the ""Dendrobium Memoria Princess Diana"" a month after her death in a car accident in Paris in 1997. William and his wife, Catherine, also had an orchid -- the ""Vanda William Catherine"" -- named after them at Singapore's National Orchid Garden, their first stop on a tour to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee. The royal couple also viewed the ""Dendrobium Queen Elizabeth II"" orchid, named for William's grandmother -- who has now ruled the British Commonwealth for 60 years -- on her visit to the country in 1972. Orchid-naming is Singapore's way of welcoming important guests. The National Orchid Garden is also home to orchids named after state dignitaries including Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher -- not to mention celebrity orchids such as the ""Dendrobium Jackie Chan."" ""Singapore has a longstanding tradition of naming orchids after important guests,"" said Poon Hong Yuen, the CEO of the National Parks Board. ""It is especially significant that we are able to name an orchid after Their Royal Highnesses, having named orchids after Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as well as the late Princess of Wales,"" said Poon. William and Catherine' will also visit the Commonwealth nations of Malaysia, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu on their tour of the region.","William and Catherine view orchids named for Diana and the queen in Singapore .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Twenty Greenpeace activists entered a nuclear reactor compound in eastern Spain early Tuesday and several of them climbed a refrigeration tower to protest the use of nuclear power, a Spanish official and Greenpeace spokeswomen said. The security breach occurred at the Cofrentes nuclear power plant at the town of Cofrentes in eastern Valencia province, where the activists painted the word ""peligro,"" which means ""danger,"" high up on the tower. A spokeswoman for the Spanish government's main office in the Valencia region said the ""vital"" parts of the nuclear plant were not affected, were tightly secured and were operating normally. A plant security guard was ""slightly injured"" by the activists as they entered. The guard was treated at the plant medical facility, the government spokeswoman said. Greenpeace activists maintained a running blog on the environmental organization's website about the events, writing that the Greenpeace team entered the plant around 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET) and that six of them scaled the 125 meter, or 400 foot, tall refrigeration tower. The government spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified, said there might have been as many as 14 Greenpeace activists up on the tower. Others on the ground were quickly identified by security personnel and sent to a local courthouse. Cofrentes, one of eight nuclear reactors in Spain, started operations in 1984. But its current 10-year operating license expires next March 20, Spain's nuclear regulatory body, the Nuclear Security Council, said on its website. Greenpeace has long been known for its stance against the use of nuclear power. Government officials did not immediately comment on how the activists managed to breach security at the Cofrentes plant. Due to previous Islamic terrorist attacks in Madrid and elsewhere in Europe, the Spanish government has repeatedly said it has a fine tuned security plan for its nuclear plants and other installations, such as dams, that are considered a priority to the nation's security. Spain in 2007 generated only about 20 percent of its electricity from nuclear power; the rest coming from coal, renewable wind, solar and other sources.","Greenpeace activists breach security at nuclear plant .

"(CNN) -- Just days after he was released from a Louisiana prison for a murder he said he didn't commit, Herman Wallace has died, his legal team said Friday. Wallace -- one of the ""Angola 3"" inmates who protested what they said were injustices at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola -- died Friday morning at age 71 after a fight with liver cancer, his legal team said. Wallace spent decades in solitary confinement after being convicted in 1974 of killing a guard at the Angola prison. He was released Tuesday after a judge vacated his murder conviction and sentence. ""Herman endured what very few of us can imagine, and he did it with grace, dignity, and empathy to the end,"" his legal team said in an e-mailed statement Friday. ""Although his freedom was much too brief, it meant the world to Herman to spend these last three days surrounded by the love of his family and friends,"" the team said. ""One of the final things that Herman said to us was, 'I am free. I am free.'"" Ordering Wallace's release Tuesday, U.S. District Chief Judge Brian A. Jackson in Baton Rouge ruled that women were systematically excluded from the grand jury that indicted Wallace in the 1972 slaying of guard Brent Miller at Angola. Wallace, who was serving an armed robbery sentence at the time of Miller's death, and other witnesses claimed Wallace was in another part of the prison when Miller was killed, his legal team said. Jackson declined to address Wallace's other claims, including an allegation that the state knowingly used false testimony and withheld exculpatory evidence at trial. Wallace was in solitary confinement at Angola until 2009, when he was moved to Hunt Correctional Center. He remained in solitary until he was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer this summer, according to one of his attorneys, Nick Trenticosta. The ""Angola 3"" who protested conditions at Angola were Wallace, Albert Woodfox and Robert King. Woodfox, like Wallace, was convicted in Miller's death. Before the guard's killing, Wallace and Woodfox tried to work to improve conditions at Angola, protesting bad sanitation and guard brutality, Wallace's lawyers said. They also tried to stop what they said were the rape of young men by fellow inmates, the lawyers said. Wallace founded a Black Panther chapter at the prison. Both Wallace and Woodfox claimed they were targeted because of their activism as Black Panthers. King, convicted in 1973 of killing a fellow inmate, was transferred to Angola just weeks after Miller was killed. Even so, he was investigated as a possible ""conspirator"" and put into solitary confinement alongside Wallace and Woodfox, according to the documentary ""In the Land of the Free."" King's conviction was overturned in 2001, and he was freed. Wallace and Woodfox, who remains in prison with appeals pending in his case, ""endured very restrictive conditions, including periods of 23-hour cell confinement,"" according to Amnesty International USA. As recently as this year, two death row inmates at Angola testified in court about being subjected to ""indescribable"" heat where they were held. The testimony was part of a lawsuit against the prison alleging that authorities placed inmates with pre-existing medical conditions at risk, the New Orleans Times Picayune reported. CNN's Jason Hanna, Phil Gast, Joe Sutton and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Herman Wallace was in solitary confinement in Louisiana for more than 40 years .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes a filmmaker makes a documentary to have an impact on a national issue, and the finished product impacts him in profound and lasting ways as well. This is what happened to Jose Antonio Vargas. The 33-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has written and directed a powerful film about the immigration debate, a broken system, the separation of families and his own life story. ""Documented"" airs Sunday, June 29 at 9 p.m. ET on CNN. Vargas became ""undocumented"" without his consent. When he was 12 years old, his grandfather brought him to the United States from the Philippines illegally so that he could have a better life. The young man wasn't privy to the scam until, at 16, he went to the Department of Motor Vehicles for a driver's license and his permanent residency card was rejected as bogus. From there it was one lie after another as Vargas went to college and then in pursuit of a career. His grandfather may have started the fraud, but the young man became an accomplice. ""His lies became my lies,"" Vargas told me, in recalling his grandfather. ""I claimed to be a citizen to get a job."" Vargas: Undocumented and hiding in plain sight . In fact, Vargas got a whole string of jobs, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, the Philadelphia Daily News, the Huffington Post and the Washington Post. In June 2011, in a 4,600-word essay for the New York Times Magazine, he came out as an illegal immigrant. Since 2012, Vargas and the nonprofit organization he founded called ""Define American"" have been battling the ""i-word."" They pressure newspapers and media companies not to use the phrase ""illegal immigrant."" As someone who has championed the rights of immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- since the early 1990s, against Republicans and Democrats alike, I haven't felt the need to fall in line. Besides, many liberals who say ""undocumented"" ignore the fact that President Barack Obama has deported 2 million whatever-you-call-them. That's phony progressivism. Judge: Immigration courts dealing with death penalty cases in traffic court setting . Today, unable to work for a payroll check without a Social Security number, he supports himself through freelance writing and paid speeches, performing more than 200 speaking engagements in 45 states in the last three years. Vargas learns as much from his audiences as they learn from him. Not all of it is positive. ""The level of misinformation is shocking,"" Vargas said. ""I knew it was bad but I didn't know it was that bad. People don't know we pay taxes, that many of us have been here for more than 10 years, that it is not a border issue, that this is not just a Latino and Mexican issue. They don't know a lot."" Vargas is disillusioned with President Obama's refusal to use executive power to stop deportations, especially since the immigration debate is going nowhere. This week, Illinois Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, the leading champion for immigration reform in Congress, declared it a lost cause for the rest of the year and said that he would focus on pressuring Obama to use executive power. ""There is no intellectual honesty and no sense of moral urgency,"" Vargas said about the immigration debate. More than 20 years ago, the plan was for Vargas' mother to follow him. But she couldn't get out. And he has spent most of his life trying to overcome a sense of maternal abandonment. Still, as we see in the film, the bond between a mother and her child is more powerful than borders. We get the impression that the first thing Vargas would do if his status were ever regularized would be to board a plane to Manila to see the woman who amputated a part of herself so that her son could have a life with more hope and less misery. 'I didn't know I was undocumented' The timing of the film is perfect. Today, as tens of thousands of children stream across the U.S.-Mexico border into the Southwest from Central America -- children who, if the Department of Health and Human Services gets its way, could be coming soon to a relocation center near you -- many Americans wonder how it is that parents could send their children off alone on a dangerous journey toward an uncertain future. A Jewish friend, sympathetic to the parents, reminds me that at least now the kids have a future. It's been done before, he said, during the Holocaust when parents snuck their kids out of Europe. People were willing to never see their children again, as long as the little ones were delivered from evil. Vargas reminds us all that -- far from being some sort of aberrant behavior -- it's what we would expect parents to do. ""I think of my mom, who to me, represents all the parents of the undocumented, who make the sacrifice to get a better life for their kids,"" he said. ""When I was a kid, and really until my mid-20's, I suffered from depression and I made the mistake of blaming my mother for not coming with me."" Now Vargas understands that his mother acted out of love. After all that he's been through, he also understands -- better than most Americans -- the intricacies of the immigration issue. And thanks to this indispensable film, so can the rest of us.","The film ""Documented"" airs on Sunday, June 29 at 9 p.m. ET on CNN .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed into law a $42 billion bill to aid small businesses Monday, saying it would create jobs by providing tax credits and helping banks increase loans. ""It's going to cut taxes. It's going to make more loans available for small businesses. It's a great victory for America's entrepreneurs,"" Obama said to applause at the White House signing ceremony. While the bill's major provisions had backing from both parties, it took months of legislative wrangling to work it out. The Senate approved it on a 61-38 vote last week, with two Republicans breaking a GOP filibuster to join the 59 Democrats in supporting the measure. The House then voted 237-187 on mostly partisan lines to send the bill to Obama's desk. Obama noted the political battle in his remarks Monday, saying the relief provided by the measure was ""needlessly delayed"" by Republican senators until last week. ""At this difficult time in our country, it's essential that we keep up the fight for every job, for every new business, for every opportunity to strengthen this economy,"" Obama said. Republicans eager to deny Democrats any advantage ahead of the November congressional elections have criticized the measure. ""Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to help end the uncertainty that is crippling job creation and hurting small businesses,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week. ""Instead it puts taxpayers on the hook for even more bailouts."" After the signing ceremony, Democratic governors and House members lauded Obama for getting the measure passed. ""I assure you we would not have this bill without this president,"" said Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, adding that the measure would help small businesses expand and help entrepreneurs launch new businesses. ""Most minority businesses are small businesses,"" Green said. The Financial Services Roundtable, a group of the nation's largest financial institutions, had supported the bill. ""Small businesses are the linchpin of our nation's economic growth and well-being,"" Steve Bartlett, the group's president, said last week. The Small Business Jobs Act authorizes the creation of a $30 billion fund run by the Treasury Department that would deliver ultra-cheap capital to banks with less than $10 billion in assets. The idea is that community banks do the lion's share of lending to small businesses, and pumping capital into them will get money in the hands of main-street businesses. Another provision aims to increase the flow of capital by providing $1.5 billion in grants to state lending programs that in turn support loans to small businesses. The state programs have proven themselves to be efficient, targeted and effective, but with many states struggling to balance their budgets, the programs are going broke. The bill would also provide a slew of tax breaks that will cost $12 billion over a decade, according to a preliminary estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. The breaks aim to encourage small businesses to purchase new equipment, to incentivize venture capital firms to invest in small businesses, and to motivate entrepreneurs to start their own business. CNN's Catherine Clifford contributed to this story.","NEW: Obama touts bill as a job-creator at signing .

"(CNN) -- Wealthy wannabes and 24-carat gold millionaires mingled at the Billionaire Club's Monaco Grand Prix after party, Sunday. Mercedes race winner Nico Rosberg will have found his name top of the guest list for the post-race poolside soiree at the Fairmont Hotel, which overlooks the circuit's famous hairpin. The club, presided over by former Benetton and Renault team boss Flavio Briatore, is designed to serve up a neat cocktail of all that the Monte Carlo race weekend has come to represent -- racing, glamor, hedonism and wealth. ""This is a dream for lots of people for one night,"" Briatore told CNN. ""The moment you're in, you are a VIP for us. ""It makes no difference if you're the top actor in America or wherever, for us everybody is the same."" Briatore's Billionaire Life brand is selling a luxury lifestyle and the historic race around the principality -- a playground for the rich and famous -- is the perfect backdrop for some of the world's estimated 1,645 billionaires to blow off steam. ""Billionaires and the ultra-wealthy cross the globe like migratory birds and Monaco is one of the key events,"" David Friedman, president of wealth intelligence firm Wealth-X, explained to CNN. ""There is a cultural template in racing. If you contrast Formula One with Nascar for example, where the origins really came from running moonshine across State lines during the Prohibition, the DNA of F1 is so different."" Briatore agreed: ""Everybody wants to be at this race from the sponsors to the celebrities. The Billionaire Club is the center of this event, this party and all this celebrity. ""All the drivers are there Sunday night,"" he promised. After attending Sunday's royal grand prix gala dinner, hosted by Monaco's Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene, Rosberg, who was raised in Monaco, might have opted to head home to his Monte Carlo pad for an early night. For others the midnight to dawn party at the Billionaire Grand Prix Gala kept on swinging. The evening promised world-famous DJs, special performances and inestimable bottles of champagne to quench the thirst of revelers. The Billionaire Club, which stages a four-day fiesta in Monaco, aims to emulate a billionaire lifestyle, but that does not mean you have to have billions in the bank to get in. ""If he's a billionaire but he's a billionaire that spends no money -- we are not interested!"" Briatore quipped. ""The name was a kind of provocative name so everyone can remember. You don't need to be a billionaire. ""It is not a rip-off, it's the same price as everything else in Monaco, nothing dramatic."" The club may not be for billionaires per se but it does have a minimum spending policy. The price starts from $4,000 for a standard table. The majority of tables at the Monaco event are reserved for Billionaire Club members and returning guests with 10% held back for what Briatore describes as ""last-minute friends."" The club also has another reputation, also synonymous with F1, for attracting beautiful girls. It employs 20 girls to act as ambassadors, welcoming guests and circulating on the dance floor. The 64-year-old is almost as famous for dating supermodels -- he counts Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell among his exes -- as he is for his motorsport career. ""Last year, the DJ told me that he'd never seen so many good-looking girls and good-looking guys in one club in his life!"" Briatore proudly explained. But are looks really another prerequisite for the Billionaire Club's Monaco guests? ""I don't care about physically beautiful if people dress up elegant,"" said Briatore, who gained early success franchising Benetton clothing stores in the U.S. ""If somebody is tall, somebody is short, somebody is fat, somebody is skinny... the people try their best to look very, very good. People dress up."" The Monaco GP may be a honey pot for the beautiful and famous -- Star Wars creator George Lucas, actor Benedict Cumberbatch and pop sensation Justin Bieber all turned up for the race -- but it is wealth and influence that grease the wheels of F1. Powerful global brands such as Red Bull, Mercedes, Hugo Boss, Tag Heur and Shell are intrinsic to the millions and millions of dollars required to run an F1 team. The 19 grands prix on the sport's globetrotting calendar can be as significant as boardrooms for striking business deals. ""So many of the sport's sponsors are high end brands,"" explains Friedman. ""F1 has created this whole ecosystem of luxury brands, investors, ultra-wealthy individuals and fast cars."" Most members of the Billionaire Club just want to have fun into the small hours but some will undoubtedly be mixing business with pleasure in Monaco. ""We don't ask what their job is,"" says Briatore of the estimated 4,000 guests who attended his bash in Monte Carlo. ""Sure it's a lot of business people and a lot of wealthy people. ""There are multiple languages spoken in the Billionaire Club with international people from China, America, Italy and Poland -- it's crazy."" Movers and shakers do not have it all their own way in Monaco. Believe it or not, it is possible to party in Monte Carlo on a budget. When the race is run, partygoers can simply carry a bottle of beer and a fromage baguette straight on the circuit, raising a toast to the race winner at the Rascasse corner or along the rim of Hercule harbor. Even high roller Briatore recognizes there is a market for the billionaire lifestyle on a budget. For the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix, he launched Twiga Monte Carlo, a lounge bar, club and restaurant, with an open door policy and free entry to most of its events. ""Everybody wants to be a billionaire for one night,"" he declared. ""Including me!""

"(CNN) -- Was there ever any doubt? When it mattered most, the man which this Brazilian team's quest may depend on, delivered once again. Neymar, the face of this World Cup, scored his fourth goal in three games to book his country a date with destiny and Chile in Belo Horizonte on Saturday. The 22-year-old, for so long hailed as the savior of Brazilian football, has not disappointed at a time where the likes of Portugal's World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo have flattered to deceive. While Lionel Messi has rescued Argentina, Neymar's 35th goal in 52 international appearances gives an insight into how crucial his role is likely to be in the next few weeks should Brazil go all the way. His two goals and further strikes from the much maligned Fred and substitute Fernandinho ensured Brazil claimed a 4-1 win over Cameroon and secured top spot in Group A. Mexico, which defeated Croatia 3-1, took second place and will now face the Netherlands in Fortaleza on Sunday. But the night belonged to Neymar -- the man who scored the 100th goal of this tournament in his country's 100th match World Cup match. Brazil will need its talisman to provide his magic once again when it meets Chile, a team which it knocked out of the tournament four years ago in South Africa. Jorge Sampaoli's men will represent a far more difficult proposition than a Cameroon side which briefly threatened to cause embarrassment by drawing level at 1-1. But Neymar, having already netted the opener, then took charge by scoring his side's second and guiding Brazil home. Cameroon, thrashed 4-0 in its previous game by Croatia and already out of the tournament, was hardly supposed to represent the most difficult of challenges. Leading through Neymar's 17th minute strike, Brazil allowed Cameroon back into the contest as its cumbersome defending was once again exposed. Just minutes after Joel Matip's header had been deflected onto the crossbar, Cameroon leveled to silence those packed inside the Arena Pernambuco. Allan Nyom escaped down the right and after beating the non-existent challenge of Dani Alves, crossed for Matip to tap home from close range. Suddenly, from a carnival of color and celebration, a dark cloud hung over Brazil's World Cup dream. But any negativity was soon washed away by a rampant yellow swagger which ripped through the very heart of the Cameroon defense. Neymar, the chief tormentor, was afforded far too much room and after leading the defenders a samba-like dance, he unleashed a fine effort which wrongfooted the goalkeeper. Suddenly Brazil was rampant. Neymar threatened a third when his powerful effort was tipped away by Charles Itandje, while Hulk failed to hit the target after a wonderful flowing move. The interval offered little respite for Cameroon and within five minutes it fell further behind when the previously luckless Fred converted David Luiz's cross to net his first goal of the tournament. Fernandinho, the Manchester City midfielder, added a fourth with six minutes remaining to ensure Brazil finished top on goal difference from Mexico. ""Maybe we tried to hurry things a bit too much early on, when we scored our first goal and let anxiety get to us,"" Brazil's coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said after the match. ""We need to show more calm and composure. Fortunately we ironed out some flaws at half-time and after the break we used the ball better again."" El Tri had threatened to usurp the host nation at the top of the table after putting Croatia to the sword in Recife. After a goalless first half, Rafael Marquez, the first man to captain his country at four World Cups, headed Mexico in front with 18 minutes remaining. Andres Guardado rounded off a slick counter attack soon after to double his side's advantage before Manchester United star Javier Hernandez added a third. It was a just reward for Mexico, which hit the crossbar in the first half and was denied what appeared to be a blatant penalty with the game still goalless. ""(We'll) have a few more great days yet,"" Miguel Herrera, the Mexico manager said. ""There is still room for improvement. We stayed calm and maintained our focus, that was the key to success."" Croatia, which could have qualified with a victory, pulled a goal back through Ivan Perisic but was then reduced to 10 men when Ante Rebic was sent off. Mexico will now face a Dutch side which won all three of its group games and reached the final in South Africa four years ago.","Brazil defeats Cameroon to seal top spot in Group A .

Today, the Florida public relations account executive can speak calmly about her close encounter with death four years earlier. ""The notion of dying seemed so simple at that moment, which was an interesting change from how complex life and its challenges usually can be,"" says Mosovich. Yet not much has changed in her life since -- although she vows to never run river rapids again. While near-death experiences (NDEs) were once thought to be rare, researchers now estimate that about a third of those who come close to death, or approximately 5 percent of the American population, experience an NDE, according to Dr. Bruce Greyson, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia Health System. In an article published in the journal Perspective in Biology and Medicine, Greyson describes NDEs as ""profound psychological events with transcendental mystical elements typically occurring to individuals close to death or in situations of intense physical or emotional danger."" Cause and effect . What causes NDEs remains unclear. Dr. Sam Parnia, author of ""What Happens When We Die,"" thinks that NDEs are hallucinations brought about by the brain shutting down, or a comforting psychological phenomenon summoned up by patients as death approaches. Parnia bases this conclusion on his studies of patients who have been declared clinically dead (usually considered the point at which cardiac function ceases) and been brought back to life. Other researchers have linked NDE-type events to a wider variety of circumstances, including fainting, serious illness and the time just preceding a potentially catastrophic occurrence like a car accident. Then there is Dr. Kevin R. Nelson, professor of neurology at the University of Kentucky. His research has led to a theory that people who go through a near-death experience may be experiencing the ""intrusion of the R.E.M. (rapid eye movement, when most dreams are believed to occur) stage of sleep during a wakeful crisis."" Nelson, who interviewed 55 people who underwent an NDE, found that in 60 percent of the cases, the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness were not as clearly delineated as they are in other people. ""You can be awake and asleep simultaneously,"" says Nelson. ""In some people, it's not an either-or situation."" The spiritual side . For some, near-death experiences take on a spiritual significance that can be life- changing. Whether you believe these moments have actually brought you closer to a higher power or are, instead, the result of some physiological reaction in the body, may depend on your background. ""We don't know much about these near-death experiences,"" says Dr. Harold Koenig, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and head of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University Medical Center. ""From a physiological standpoint, it's possible that (the brain shutting down) creates the sensation of the bright light and a tunnel, and that's interpreted in terms of spiritual significance . ""It's a common phenomenon... but it's hard to study because the experiences aren't subjective, you can't verify them, and they are self-reported,"" Koenig adds. Most religious groups don't have a position on near death experiences, explains Sandra Yocum Mize, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Dayton. ""There is, for example, no official Catholic position on near death experiences,"" she says. ""However, they are recognized as profoundly transformative in a spiritual sense."" ""Many people... feel that by not dying,"" says Yocum Mize, ""that they have been spared for a purpose, and that their life is a special gift they must treasure."" That's the case with Mary Lin, a marketing professional from Prescott, Arizona, who plans to go back to school so she can better train her voice to ""transform"" her audiences through her singing. Lin's near-death experience occurred while hospitalized for a serious illness almost four years ago. ""I felt like I was on a ladder coming up to the light and was filled with a feeling of surrendering to a 'presence,'"" says Lin. ""I felt like I was ready to leave, but I sensed a resistance."" Lin says she went into a ""deep communion with her soul."" After four days, she remembers receiving a ""message"" that her life's work was to use her talents -- Lin is a writer, artist, dancer, and singer -- for healing. ""When I focus on using my voice for service, it is an arresting experience for me,"" says Lin. ""This is what I was sent back here to do. Without my near-death experience, I wouldn't have known this."" E-mail to a friend . LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers.

"(CNN) -- It is time to stop focusing on the next month and start focusing on the years to come. Syria is not a chemical weapons crisis any more than a country whose problems can be solved by supporting the rebels. Like many of the countries in the Middle East -- Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia and Yemen -- it has already been destabilized by a mixture of population pressures, weak economic development, authoritarianism, corruption, failed governance, and deep ethnic and sectarian divisions. It will take years for them to achieve stability and move along some path toward growth and development. Getting rid of Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons will be a major challenge. Al-Assad is likely to resist, and delay. An ongoing civil war is scarcely the ideal environment for a complex nationwide effort in arms control. Russia is likely to put al-Assad's survival before pushing Syria toward full compliance and to oppose any use of force. The November deadlines for even initial compliance are politically and militarily necessary, but may not be workable in practice. Destroying, neutralizing and moving all the weapons is a task of unknown scale and difficulty with no resources now in place. Reports that Syrian officials have turned over materials to prove the August 21 chemical attack was carried out by the rebels only further complicates matters. Added to that, the return of U.N. chemical inspectors to Syria in the coming days means that attempts to coordinate the task of disarmament will be further delayed. These developments aside, what is more important is the fact that any effort to deal with Syria's chemical weapons does not have any clear impact on a civil war that has almost certainly killed 120,000 Syrian civilians, driven some 2 million out of the country, and displaced well over 4 million. Syria's economy is crippled, with high levels of youth unemployment and underemployment. Some 20% of the population has lost a home, a job, or a business. Education is badly disrupted in a country where one-third of the population is 14 years old or younger. Medical services and every other aspect of social and physical infrastructure have been badly damaged. None of these problems can be solved until the civil war is solved, and it cannot be solved by partition, which would divide the country into unworkable economic zones based on religion, ethnicity, anger or hatred. An al-Assad victory would leave a seething majority of Sunnis under a dictator who could only survive by using repression at the cost of recovery, development, human rights and freedom. A rebel victory could deprive Alawites and minorities of their rights and bring Islamist extremists to power who would most likely repress the nation's moderate Sunni majority. The United States cannot solve any of these issues from the outside. It can push for the full destruction of the chemical arsenal and an end to the far more lethal use of conventional force against civilians. It can counter the aid to Assad from Iran and Russia by providing arms and training to the moderate parts of the rebel forces. It can push for negotiations that will put a moderate unity government in place. It can continue to provide humanitarian aid, and if a stable government does emerge, it can aid in the process of recovery and development that will take years. In practice, the United States must pursue this course over the years for both humanitarian reasons and self-interest. A violent, polarized Syria is a breeding ground for extremism and terrorism. It threatens allies like Israel, Jordan and Turkey. It is worsening the divisions and violence in Lebanon and Iraq, and giving Iran a major new zone of influence and growing ability to threaten our Arab allies in the Gulf and the world's oil exports. At the same time, however, the U.S. must carefully ration its aid and military resources. Syria is not as important as the crisis in Egypt or Iraq. Iran is much more of a direct threat. Yemen and Iraq are both far more of a center for al Qaeda than Afghanistan and Pakistan. Bahrain is a key ally and the center of our naval operations in the region. Tunisia needs help in becoming a real and stable democracy. Morocco and Jordan are allies that also need aid, and Israel's security is a constant concern. In short, Syria is just this month's crisis in a region where the Arab Spring has become at least a decade of violence, religious conflict, threat to development and progress, and where the United States can neither solve a single problem quickly nor take a single risk of disengaging from an effort to help. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Cordesman.","Anthony Cordesman: None of Syria's problems can be solved until its civil war is solved .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A man convicted of stalking singer Madonna, and who once threatened to knife her, was arrested Friday, a week after he escaped from a Southern California mental hospital, police said. Robert Dewey Hoskins, 54, had walked away from Metropolitan State Hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of Norwalk on February 3, police said. He had served a 10-year prison sentence for stalking the ""Material Girl,"" police said, and a court order requires him to be in a facility receiving mental health treatment until the end of August 2012. Los Angeles Police Sgt. Mitzi Fierro told HLN's Nancy Grace that she hadn't been told whether any new charges will be filed against Hoskins. ""At this point they are returning him to the facility, and I believe that will be determined by the detectives who will investigate -- number one, his ability to walk away from the facility and, number two, if he violated anything from that point on,"" Fierro said. The facility he was in is not secured, and it was unclear Friday whether Hoskins escaped or walked out on his own, investigators told CNN. He was receiving treatment to get acclimated to society again and was supervised by a civilian staff and not officers, detectives said. Because of the court order, Hoskins was deemed an ""escapee,"" detectives said. Investigators had been looking for him in the Long Beach area because some of his arrest records come from that community, detectives said. Prior to his arrest Friday, Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins ""is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies."" Hoskins may have taken a bus to the Long Beach area, police said. He stalked Madonna all over California in the early 1990s, CNN affiliate KCAL reported. He threatened to cut her from ""ear to ear"" if she did not marry him, the affiliate reported. He was arrested in 1995. The following year at his trial, Madonna -- born Madonna Louise Ciccone -- testified that Hoskins repeatedly scaled the fence of her home and made her have nightmares, the affiliate reported. Fresh off her Super Bowl halftime performance, Madonna is set for a world tour to be launched in Tel Aviv, Israel, on May 29. The European portion of the tour will have 26 shows, including stops in London, Paris, Milan and Berlin. The North American portion of her worldwide extravaganza also includes 26 cities, with the first stop in Philadelphia on August 28.

"(CNN) -- German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt, whose nearly priceless collection was confiscated because it was suspected to contain pieces looted by the Nazis, died Tuesday and left the masterpieces to a Swiss museum. One day after Gurlitt's death at the age of 81, the Museum of Fine Arts Bern announced that Gurlitt had named it ""his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir."" The news came as a surprise, the museum said Wednesday, because Gurlitt had never had any connection to it. The museum's directors are delighted at the news, they said in a statement, but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection. Gurlitt had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks, his representative said in a statement. Gurlitt grabbed the attention of the art world when German prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his Munich apartment in 2012, including works by Picasso and Matisse. The collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud, but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the Nazis. Just last month, part of the collection was returned to Gurlitt as part of a deal with Germany's cultural authorities and the Bavarian Justice Ministry. Under the agreement, works owned by Gurlitt that were not under suspicion were returned to him. Those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original Jewish owners or their descendants if a claim is proven. Gurlitt's representative said that with the art collector's death, the investigation into the collection ceases. The court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case. Among the staggering haul found in Gurlitt's Munich, Bavaria, apartment in early 2012 were paintings by Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Oskar Kokoschka, Canaletto, Pierre-August Renoir, Franz Marc and Gustav Courbet. Gurlitt had said he never suspected that the collection he inherited from his father might include stolen artworks. Thousands of pieces of art condemned as ""degenerate"" by the Nazis were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s. Other works were stolen from Jewish families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country. Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, who was part Jewish, survived the war as one of only four ""degenerate art"" dealers permitted by Adolf Hitler.","Cornelius Gurlitt died Tuesday at the age of 81 .

"(CNN) -- The tobacco industry was once a well-funded behemoth in American politics, and while Big Tobacco's power is slowly eroding, its influence is far from gone. Once President Obama signs the new tobacco bill, the tobacco industry will be subject to federal regulation. President Obama on Monday signed a bill that gives the Food and Drug Administration power to regulate the manufacturing, marketing and sale of tobacco. Anti-tobacco activists champion the legislation as a historic step forward for public health, but even some who have fought tobacco concede that the tobacco companies scored some wins in the final legislation. ""It's a great victory for the public health community, but I would not overestimate the demise of the tobacco industry and their ability to lobby,"" said Paul G. Billings, vice president of national policy and advocacy for the American Lung Association. In the past century, the tobacco industry has been distinctive in its ability to avoid coming under the authority of the FDA, while almost every other consumer product has been subject to federal regulation. Congress voted in 1965 to require all cigarette packages to carry warning labels, a warning that was made under the surgeon general's name five years later. The legislation Congress approved this month, known as the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, would give the FDA power to ban candy and fruit-flavored cigarettes, widely considered appealing to first-time smokers, including youths. It would prohibit tobacco companies from using terms such as ""low tar,"" ""light"" or ""mild,"" require larger warning labels on packages that show pictures of the effects of tobacco use and restrict advertising of tobacco products. It also would require tobacco companies to reduce levels of nicotine in cigarettes. Similar legislation, introduced by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, more than a decade ago, failed to make it through Congress. Patrick Reynolds, whose grandfather founded the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., said the passage of the bill ""marks the diminished clout of the tobacco lobby on the Hill."" Stanton Glantz, a longtime anti-tobacco advocate and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, said the public health community has made ""gigantic progress"" over the past few decades, but he sees the FDA bill as a win for Philip Morris USA, the nation's biggest cigarette company. At last week's annual National Conference on Tobacco or Health, a large anti-tobacco gathering, in Phoenix, Arizona, Glantz said only about half of the room applauded when it was announced that the legislation passed. ""People were talking about making lemonade out of lemons,"" he said. ""Basically, the public health people cut a deal with Philip Morris."" Philip Morris, which is owned by Altria Group Inc., was the only major tobacco company to endorse the legislation, although the company has expressed some First Amendment reservations about parts of it. Glantz argues that the legislation legitimizes the tobacco industry at a time when ""legitimacy was being lost."" His biggest complaint: The bill creates a 12-member advisory board through which all regulations will flow. Tobacco industry representatives will hold three nonvoting seats. ""Putting three guys on this committee would be a little bit like putting three mobsters on the Department of Justice committee on organized crime,"" Glantz said, echoing the sentiment of other strong tobacco-control advocates. R.J. Reynolds said one of its early objections to the legislation was that Philip Morris had a role in crafting it. ""The only way a company can grow is at the expense of another,"" said Maura Payne, vice president of communications for Reynolds American Inc. Philip Morris argues the bill won't create a commercial advantage for it and instead will create a framework for an emerging market of ""reduced-harm products."" ""For adults who use tobacco products who want to avoid the health risks of smoking, the best thing for them to do is quit,"" said William Phelps, a spokesman for Altria. ""Our goal would be to design the best products that we can and then, under federal authority, make those products available to adults who do not quit.""","President Obama signs bill putting tobacco under FDA legislation .

"(CNN) -- The strongest contender to become the next Pakistani prime minister is hardly a newcomer to the country's political stage. Nawaz Sharif, 63, has had a long and rocky career that includes two stints as prime minister during the 1990s, ordering Pakistan's first nuclear tests, a showdown with the nation's powerful military, time in jail and years of exile. After spending the past several years in opposition to the governing Pakistani People's Party (PPP) -- which has struggled to tackle the country's crippling problems of militant violence, chronic power shortages and a flagging economy -- Sharif now has a shot at another stint in office. But observers say his positions on key issues such as Islamic extremists and relations with the United States remain vague, raising uncertainty about what kind of approach he would take if his Pakistani Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) were to succeed in forming a government in the national assembly following general elections this weekend. There is also concern about his relationship with the military's top generals, who still maintain a strong influence on Pakistan's foreign and security policies. Interventions by the military ended Sharif's terms as prime minister in 1999 when Pervez Musharraf, the head of the army at the time, overthrew him in a coup. In a dramatic fall from grace, Sharif ended up in jail, convicted of hijacking charges for trying to stop a plane carrying Musharraf from landing. He then went into exile in Saudi Arabia and didn't return to Pakistan until 2007, when he teamed up with the PPP to force Musharraf from office. ""It's a big question whether he can coexist with the military,"" said Zahid Hussain, a veteran Pakistani journalist and author. ""He hasn't forgiven or forgotten what happened to him."" All about the economy . Sharif's campaign has focused on the economy, which seems to matter the most to many Pakistanis. The nation ranks 146th out of 186 countries in the United Nations' human development index, a measure of living standards, health and education. Under the slogan ""Strong Economy -- Strong Pakistan,"" Sharif is playing to his image as a flag-bearer for private industry and entrepreneurship. Part of a prominent industrial family, he took steps to liberalize the economy during his time in office in the 1990s through measures such as privatizing state-run companies. ""Generally, the business lobby has more confidence in his ability to fix the economy and solve some of the trickier problems, particularly the energy crisis,"" said Raza Rumi, director of policy and programs at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani research organization. His party has built conspicuous infrastructure projects in recent years in its political stronghold of Punjab, which is home to more than half of Pakistan's 180 million people and the biggest source of elected seats in the National Assembly. It's also the country's industrial and agricultural heartland. The Taliban question . While his economic credentials appear stronger than those of his main rivals, critics have picked up on his apparent reluctance to take a strong line against violent extremists, notably the Pakistani Taliban, who have carried out relentless, bloody attacks in the area bordering Afghanistan. ""He criticizes terrorism, he criticizes the use of force, but he will not criticize a specific organization by name,"" said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst focused on defense issues. ""He will not criticize the Pakistani Taliban by name."" Sharif was not available for an interview for this article. But Irfanullah Khan Marwat, a veteran Pakistani politician who recently joined the PML-N, said that the party is in favor of holding talks with the Taliban. ""We as a party oppose extremism, we oppose bloodshed,"" Marwat said. ""And we think any and every solution lies with who is sitting across a table and coming to an understanding."" The politics of fear . Sharif's party's cautious stance on the Taliban and other militant groups results from political expediency and fear, according to Rumi, who is also the editor of The Friday Times, a weekly newspaper. Religious conservatives, some of whom sympathize with extremist groups, make up an important part of Sharif's core vote, Rumi said. During his time in office in the 1990s, Sharif caused alarm among more secular-minded Pakistanis by pushing through legislation that sought to introduce aspects of Sharia law. And since the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during campaigning for the 2008 elections, a lot of Pakistani politicians are afraid of well-organized, merciless militants like the Taliban, according to Rumi. The killing of Bhutto is still being investigated by authorities, but the Taliban and other militant groups have between them carried out dozens of deadly attacks on campaigners for the current elections. Uncertainty over relations with U.S. An unwillingness to continue the fight against insurgents could put a Sharif government at loggerheads with the military and also strain already difficult relations with the United States, a key prop for Pakistan's shaky public finances. Sharif has openly questioned Pakistani-involvement in the American-led ""war on terror."" But observers note he may adapt his approach if he becomes prime minister. ""He had good working relations with the United States in previous terms,"" Rizvi said. ""My feeling is he will still have good relations. Once he gets into power, then he has to change."" For its part, the United States says it has no preferred contender in the elections. ""We do not support any particular political party or any individual candidate, and we look forward to engaging the next democratically elected government of Pakistan,"" Patrick Ventrell, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said last week. A new approach to New Delhi? Sharif has also raised eyebrows by vowing to improve ties with Pakistan's archrival, India. The two nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars since their partition at the end of British colonial rule. One of those wars, in 1999, led to the military coup that drove Sharif out of office. In a recent interview with the Indian broadcaster CNN-IBN, Sharif said he would carry out an investigation into the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, which killed more than 160 people. India blames the Pakistan-based group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for carrying out the attacks, accusing Islamabad of not doing enough to pursue its members. The group has denied responsibility. Democratic progress . If a new Pakistani government is successfully formed from the elections this weekend, it will be the first time in Pakistan's history that the country has democratically transitioned from one elected administration to another. One of the reasons for that, analysts say, is that Sharif and his party took a pragmatic approach to being in opposition, despite their differences with the governing PPP and its leader, President Asif Ali Zardari, Bhutto's widower. It's a far cry from the 1990s, when Sharif and Bhutto worked constantly to undermine each other's governments, resulting in instability and interference from the military. The 21st-century Sharif, mindful of his overthrow and exile, appears more committed to upholding democratic, civilian government and not providing the military with an excuse to step in, according to Rumi. ""That by itself was a very promising development,"" he said. The trouble with coalitions . The big question, however, is how effective any government that emerges from the elections will be. Although several opinion polls have put Sharif's party in front, a great deal of uncertainty remains over how many seats it will end up with in the assembly. Observers say there's a strong chance that both parties will fall short of an overall majority, resulting in a scramble to form a coalition with smaller parties. The most prominent and potentially game-changing of the smaller parties is cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), a new player in national elections. Analysts are finding it hard to predict how many seats PTI candidates might secure, especially after Khan was seriously injured in a fall at a campaign rally this week. If his party wins enough seats, the former captain of the Pakistani cricket team could find himself the kingmaker in its parliament. But any coalition government may struggle to formulate strong policies on the critical issues Pakistan faces, even under an established figure like Sharif. That could leave other institutions with room to exert their influence. ""Theoretically, the prime minister is in charge,"" Rumi said. ""In practice, the military is more powerful."" CNN's Aliza Kassim and Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","Nawaz Sharif, a frontrunner in Pakistani elections, has been prime minister twice .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Barry Bonds' former trainer was freed Friday from the prison where he's been held since he refused to testify in the baseball legend's perjury trial two weeks ago. With the jury now deliberating the perjury and obstruction of justice case against Bonds, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ordered Gary Anderson to be released. Illston found Anderson in contempt of court on the first day of trial testimony when his lawyer informed her that he would not take the stand to answer questions about Bonds' steroid use. It was the third time Anderson chose jail time over testimony. He was sent to prison for several weeks twice before when he refused to appear before a federal grand jury investigating Bonds. The absence of the trainer's testimony hampered the government's case against Bonds, who is charged with lying under oath when he testified about his steroids use in 2003 before the grand jury that was investigating an alleged sports doping scandal involving Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative. Bonds, 46, allegedly lied about knowingly taking performance-enhancing drugs and about being injected by anyone but his doctors. The jury of eight women and four men are deciding Bonds' fate in a San Francisco federal courthouse less than two miles from the ballpark where Bonds broke Hank Aaron's major league home run record in August 2007. The three perjury counts and one count of obstruction of justice could each carry a 10-year prison sentence upon conviction. A fourth perjury charge was dropped by prosecutors Wednesday. A prosecutor argued Thursday that Bonds lied because he knew the truth about his steroids use would ""tinge his accomplishments"" and hurt his career. ""His secret was so powerful that he couldn't admit it, wouldn't admit it,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Nedrow said in his closing arguments. Bonds' defense lawyer, during his closing arguments Thursday, asked jurors to acquit him because of a technical oversight by prosecutors -- an argument the government quickly rebutted. The judge's instructions to the jury say Bonds can found be found guilty only if his lies could have affected the grand jury's decisions and that Bonds knew it, defense lawyer Allen Ruby said. But none of the 25 prosecution witnesses presented evidence about what decisions the grand jury made or what they might have made, Ruby said. ""Who told us about the grand jury at all?"" The Internal Revenue Service agent who started the federal investigation into the distribution of performance-enhancing drugs testified that Bonds' false testimony affected his work, but Agent Jeff Novitzky was not part of the grand jury, Ruby said. ""I know that this is a little technical,"" Ruby said. ""I don't apologize for that. Every word of the law matters."" The judge also instructed jurors to rely only what they heard from witnesses in the trial and not use their prior knowledge of the grand jury process, he said. ""The government is trusting you to do what you are forbidden to do, and fill in the gaps,"" Ruby said. Prosecutor Matthew Parrella, in his rebuttal, said Novitzky's investigation and the grand jury probe were ""one and the same."" The jury can also read the indictments the grand jury issued in 2004 and the grand jury transcript in which ""the issues are fleshed out,"" Parrella said. Ruby told jurors that Bonds acknowledged to the grand jury that he used the substances known as ""the clear and the cream,"" but at the time of his testimony, even investigators didn't know what was in them. Bonds told the grand jury he thought Anderson was giving him flaxseed oil, Ruby said. Nedrow, in his closing, said it was ""implausible"" that Bonds would take drugs ""and really not know what they were."" A urine sample given by Bonds in the summer of 2003, just months before his grand jury testimony, tested positive for anabolic steroids, he said. The defense argued there was another sample taken weeks earlier that tested negative for the drugs. Defense lawyer Cristina Arguedas, in her part of closing arguments, accused prosecutors of ignoring crimes by witnesses in exchange for their testimony against Bonds. ""They will forgive it if that person will say something bad about Barry Bonds,"" Arguedas said. Bonds' former girlfriend, Kimberly Bell, testified for the prosecution that she witnessed physical and emotional changes in Bonds that the government argued were indications of steroids use. Bell testified during the trial that she had committed perjury when she told the same grand jury in 2003 that she had not noticed Bonds' shrunken testicles. Bell also admitted she had committed mortgage fraud by lying on a home loan application, Arguedas said. During court testimony last month, Bonds' childhood friend Steve Hoskins, who worked for a decade as his assistant, said he tried to persuade Bonds to stop using anabolic steroids in 2000 and 2003. Bonds' defense lawyer argued that Hoskins' cooperation with the government was motivated by bitterness over Bonds firing him and by a desire for protection from prosecution for allegedly stealing money from Bonds. Prosecutors played an audio recording that Hoskins secretly made in the San Francisco Giants locker room of a conversation with Anderson about the hazards of steroid usage. Bonds' defense attorney suggested that Hoskins made the recording only after Bonds dismissed him in March 2003. Hoskins acknowledged that he leaked the details of the recording to investigative reporter Lance Williams, who included it in his book about the scandal, ""Game of Shadows."" While he never witnessed Bonds being injected with anabolic steroids, Hoskins said he saw Bonds and Anderson emerge from a bedroom with a syringe during spring training in 2000. Bonds complained to him that year that steroid injections ""were making his butt sore,"" Hoskins said. In his 21-year major league career, Bonds also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001, when he hit 73. He did not officially retire after he was indicted, but he never played another game.","Bonds' trainer is ordered freed two weeks after he refused to testify .

Sabi Sand -- South Africa's oldest private game reserve -- is now spending half of its annual maintenance budget on security to protect the endangered rhino. Sabi Sand conservationist Andrew Parker told CNN that defense costs could become ""unaffordable."" ""There's no question we're fighting a counter insurgency war here,"" he said. ""As much as we increase the risk, all it will do is it will drive up the price of the horns, it will raise the stakes, the poachers will become more organized and better prepared to fight."" It's a problem across South Africa, but despite investment and innovation, unmanned drones, sniffer dogs and increased security have all failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughters, as poachers hunt the herbivores for their horns. Read this: Drone ranger -- unmanned plane to spy on rhino poachers . Decimated by illegal poaching, the endangered rhino has increasingly come under attack in recent years. In South Africa alone, the government is estimating 1,000 killings for 2013, while last year there were 668 slaughters. But poaching rhino horn is a lucrative industry with much of the loot sold on to the affluent classes in Asia, particularly China and Vietnam, where it is believed by some that the horns can cure cancer and boost virility. With a kilogram fetching up to $20,000, a single horn weighs around 10kg, according to a report by Moses Montesh, a professor in criminology at the University of South Africa. However, exact prices are hard to measure with some saying a kilogram is more valuable than gold by weight. Montesh told CNN that some of the crime syndicates, getting rich off their relentless poaching, even include former army and police officers. He said: ""In some instances evidence suggests that private game operators are involved in rhino poaching. These guys are very familiar with all military and poaching techniques."" Montesh suggested that the South African armed forces could have a role to play in deterring poachers. He added: ""Currently our defense force is not involved in any military operation. I think this is an opportunity to keep our army active. The use of military drones can be handy."" Read this: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . But Julian Rademayer, author of ""Killing for Profit,"" told CNN the crime syndicates, based in Mozambique and operating across the border in South Africa, are out of reach of the authorities. ""You've got two levels, the syndicate crime that is untouchable,"" he said, ""and then you've got poachers being recruited in very impoverished communities in Mozambique and they're cannon fodder to the syndicates."" With poaching operations growing ever more sophisticated, the South African government has considered a radically different approach. In July, the government, led by President Jacob Zuma, openly backed a plan for a legal one-off sale of part of its billion-dollar stockpile of rhino horns in an effort to cripple the market. The government's thinking was that it could flood the market by selling stockpiled horn and regulating trade. The move, advocates say, would send the current sky-high prices tumbling, thus remove the incentives for poaching, and ultimately help prevent further mass killings of the species. But Kelvin Alie, director of wildlife crime and consumer awareness at the International Fund for Animal Awareness, told CNN legalizing the rhino horn trade could be ""disastrous."" ""A failed experiment such as this could result in the decimation of rhino populations,"" Alie said. ""We should not even consider talking about satisfying demand, and especially not about flooding markets, when we have no idea of what demand is, particularly given recent rises in consumption."" Alie called on governments to make illegal rhino horn trading a priority in order to protect the animal. He added: ""An integrated enforcement strategy among police, wildlife, military, judges and custom officials is needed to effectively combat the trade.""

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Baseball legend Barry Bonds was convicted Wednesday on one count of obstruction of justice, but a mistrial was declared on three counts of perjury after jurors reported they could not reach agreement. Jurors said they found Bonds to be ""evasive"" in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes, but they said that it was not proven that he lied when he said he had not knowingly used steroids. The judge declared a mistrial on the three perjury counts after the jury said they were deadlocked on the charges in their fourth day of deliberations. Bonds, 46, was tried in a San Francisco federal courtroom, less than two miles from the ballpark where he broke Hank Aaron's major league home run in August 2007. Time.com photos: The evolution of Barry Bonds . Lawyers will be back in court on May 20 to debate whether Bonds should be retried on the perjury counts. A date for sentencing on the obstruction of justice conviction will also be set on that day, the judge said. Bonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of the BALCO investigation that targeted employees of a California drug testing laboratory and Bonds' personal trainer Greg Anderson. The testimony that led to Wednesday's conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds if Anderson ever gave him ""anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with."" Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors ""ever touch me,"" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson. ""That's what keeps our friendship,"" Bonds testified. ""You know, I am sorry, but that -- you know, that -- I was a celebrity child, not just in baseball by my own instincts. I became a celebrity child with a famous father. I just don't get into other people's business because of my father's situation, you see."" A juror, who identified herself only as Jessica and who would not give her last name, told reporters they agreed unanimously that Bonds was ""not directly answering the question, just kind of evading the question."" The jury came one vote short of convicting Bonds on the perjury charge that he lied when he told the grand jury that no one but a doctor ever injected him with a syringe, they said. One juror did not believe the testimony of Kathy Hoskins, Bonds' childhood friend and personal shopper, who testified that she witnessed Anderson injecting Bonds. ""She was believable for 11 of us,"" a male juror, who identified himself as Steve but who also would not give his last name, told reporters. ""We were very, very close."" SI.com: Key questions in wake of Bonds verdict . There was one key government witness none of the jurors believed -- Bonds' ex-girlfriend Kimberly Bell, juror Jessica said. ""We were very against Kim Bell,"" Jessica said. ""She wasn't as much sure in her answers and she seemed to be attacking Barry instead of just giving her own honest testimony,"" Bell testified that she noticed Bonds' testicles were shrunken, which prosecutors argued was a sign of steroids use. Most jurors were divided 9 to 3 on the question of whether Bonds lied when he said he did not knowingly use steroids, the jurors said. ""The evidence that he did steroids might have been there, but did he knowingly do steroids was the question and we couldn't prove that beyond a reasonable doubt,"" one woman juror said. ""There was just a piece of the puzzle missing."" Defense lawyers argued that Bonds' thought the creams and ointments Anderson was giving him were made of flaxseed oils. Prosecutors were hampered in making their case because of the refusal of Anderson to testify against Bonds. With Anderson not taking the stand, prosecutors were unable to show jurors calendars that allegedly kept track of Bonds' steroid usage. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston found Anderson in contempt of court on the first day of trial testimony when his lawyer informed her that he would not take the stand to answer questions about Bonds steroid use. He was released the day jury deliberations began. Bonds' legal troubles began in 2003 when he was subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand jury investigating the illegal distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to athletes. Bonds was told he was not a target of the investigation, which was centered on the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, known as BALCO. His personal trainer, Greg Anderson, was a target. ""All he had to do was tell the truth,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Nedrow said in his closing arguments last week. Bonds lied to the grand jury because he knew the truth about his steroids use would ""tinge his accomplishments"" and hurt his baseball career, Nedrow said. ""His secret was so powerful that he couldn't admit it, wouldn't admit it."" The grand jury transcript showed that when he was asked about anabolic steroids before the 2003 baseball season, he said he had not knowingly used them. He did acknowledge using substances Anderson gave him known as ""the clear and the cream."" Nedrow argued that it was ""implausible"" that Bonds would take drugs ""and really not know what they were."" A urine sample given by Bonds in the summer of 2003, just months before his grand jury testimony, tested positive for anabolic steroids, but another sample taken weeks earlier tested negative for the drugs. The San Francisco Giants star ended his 21-year major league career in 2003 with 762 home runs. He also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001, when he hit 73. Jurors had to decide if they believed the testimony of Steve and Kathy Hoskins, two former childhood friends who worked for Bonds during the years he allegedly used steroids. Defense lawyer Allen Ruby argued that the Hoskinses were motivated by bitterness toward Bonds after he fired them and later accused Steve Hoskins of stealing. A federal criminal probe of Steve Hoskins was dropped after he became a prosecution witness, the defense argued. Steve Hoskins, Bonds' assistant and sometimes business partner for a decade, testified that he tried to persuade Bonds to stop using anabolic steroids in 2000 and 2003. Hoskins testified that he had several conversations with Bonds' doctor about the ballplayer's steroids use, but that doctor denied it when he was called as a prosecution witness. While he never witnessed Bonds being injected, Hoskins said he saw Bonds and Anderson emerge from a bedroom with a syringe during spring training in 2000. Bonds complained to him that year that steroid injections ""were making his butt sore,"" Hoskins said. Hoskins secretly recorded a locker room conversation with Anderson, Bonds' trainer who allegedly gave Bonds' steroids. Jurors who spoke to reporters said they completely ignore the muffled audio recording since it did not have a clear ""chain of evidence"" and they were unsure if it had been edited. Bonds' defense attorney suggested that Hoskins made the recording only after Bonds fired him in March 2003. Steve Hoskins' sister, Kathy Hoskins, worked for Bonds his personal shopper until the spring of 2003. She testified that she was in Bonds' bedroom packing his suitcase for a road trip in 2002 when Bonds told Anderson to ""stay right here."" He then lifted his shirt and Anderson injected him in his ""belly button"" with a syringe, Kathy Hoskins said. ""'This is Katy. That's my girl. She don't say nothing to nobody,'"" Kathy Hoskins said Bonds assured his trainer. Defense lawyers argued she lied about the injection incident to support her brother's testimony. Bonds' lawyers also tried to discredit the testimony of Bonds' former girlfriend, who described physical and emotional changes in Bonds that prosecutors contended were evidence of steroids use. Kimberly Bell testified in the trial that she noticed Bonds suffered testicular shrinkage, but she had told the grand jury in 2003 that she had not seen any shrinkage. The eight women and four men on the jury heard 25 prosecution witnesses over two weeks, but the defense rested last week without calling a witness.","NEW: Jurors find Bonds ""evasive"" in his grand jury testimony .

"London (CNN) -- The maker of a fake bomb detector that investigators say put lives at risk was sentenced Thursday to 10 years in prison by a London court. James McCormick, 57, marketed his ADE 651 units to government agencies and private companies around the world, including in Iraq, with sales exceeding $50 million by his own admission. However, independent tests showed the device has no better than a random chance of finding a golf ball, much less a bomb. British police say the device -- the ADE standing for ""Advanced Detection Equipment"" -- is really a novelty golf-ball finder with the label removed. Read more: Fake bomb detector maker made millions from trick . Judge Richard Hone at the Old Bailey court said he was taking the rare step of passing the maximum possible sentence because of McCormick's ""cavalier disregard for the potentially fatal consequences of his fraudulent activity."" McCormick was convicted last month on three counts of fraud. He was sentenced to 10 years on each of the counts, to run concurrently. Half of the 10-year term must be served before he's eligible for release on parole, the judge said. While specific cases of death or injury as a result of the use of the devices can't be proved, their sale was a ""callous confidence trick,"" the judge said. ""The jury found that you knew the devices did not work, yet the soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere believed in them, in part due to your powers of salesmanship and in part the extravagant and fraudulent claims made in your promotional material. ""After a six-week trial, I am wholly satisfied that your fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to innocent individuals."" Explaining his decision to hand McCormick the maximum possible sentence, the judge focused on the scale of the fraud and its potentially deadly consequences. McCormick was the driving force and sole director of his company, ATSC, and with a small number of employees sold well over 7,000 devices to the Iraqi government and other international agencies for between $2,500 and $30,000 per unit, the judge said. One invoice showed total sales in excess of $38 million to Iraq over a period of nearly three years, he added. Police investigators believe it cost McCormick less than $60 to make each device. In some places, the fake detectors remain in use and are a continuing danger to life, Hone said. ""Soldiers, police forces, border customs officers, hotel security staff and many other users trusted their lives to the overpriced devices sold by you, which were no more than plastic components with a disconnected antenna with a capability of detecting explosives no better than random chance,"" he said. ""Your profits were obscene, funding grand houses, a greedy and extravagant lifestyle and even a yacht."" McCormick also has shown no remorse for his actions, the judge said. He made millions from the sale of the devices and used the proceeds to fund a luxurious lifestyle. Ahead of the sentencing, a defense lawyer for McCormick told the court that there was no evidence that vehicles carrying bombs passed through checkpoints where his devices were in use. McCormick was not responsible for any attacks, his lawyer said, and any number of devices could not protect the people of Iraq. Superintendent Nigel Rock, of Avon and Somerset Police, told reporters outside the court that the next step for investigators would be to ensure that all the proceeds from McCormick's criminal activities are seized. Rock described him as a shameless con-man who had personally pocketed millions of dollars from his scam. But it wasn't just a good sales line that allowed McCormick, over a 10-year period, to become wealthy from a fraudulent device. An Iraqi general has been jailed for procuring the ADE 651 through ""unauthorized"" channels. British police believe that McCormick paid off officials to buy the ADE 651 in bulk.

"(CNN) -- A West Virginia man has been indicted in the murders of three Alexandria, Virginia, residents over a decade. A grand jury returned a 10-count indictment against Charles Severance, 53, for the shooting deaths that investigators determined earlier this year were linked to one killer. Ballistic tests showed bullets that killed music teacher Ruthanne Lodato on February 6, 2014, are similar to those in two earlier suburban Washington killings, police in Virginia said in March. The slayings alarmed the community located across the Potomac River from the nation's capital, raising concerns a serial killer might be responsible. Police have said a gunman knocked on Lodato's door late that morning and began shooting. The 59-year-old woman died, and her mother's caretaker was seriously wounded. The survivor helped provide a sketch of the suspect. The previous victims were also prominent in the area. Nancy Dunning, once married to Alexandria's sheriff, was killed in December 2003; and Ron Kirby, director of transportation planning at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, was gunned down last November. Alexandria's Commonwealth Attorney Bryan Porter said he would not seek the death penalty for Severance, although he did not elaborate on that decision. Severance is being held without bond in the Loudoun County, Virginia, jail.

"(CNN) -- At age of 52, it might be too late to re-visit your beliefs and principles in order to change them. When you see the regression from where we were, to the situation now and realize the dream you have been working towards has moved almost entirely out-of-reach, you feel tired, hopeless, and less motivated to recharge yourself. I was born in Gaza in 1962 to a refugee family who had been expelled from their village ""Sawafir"" in the then British --mandate of Palestine. Five years later, in June 1967, Gaza was occupied by Israel, which meant that I grew up under the occupation. When you live under occupation, your national ambitions become clearer and stronger. I promised myself that I would do my utmost to contribute to achieving peace and freedom for our people and region through talks and debates. In 1987, at the age of 27, I took part in the first intifada, which I viewed as largely peaceful, with boys and girls throwing stones at well-equipped Israeli soldiers. Through that struggle, we succeeding in winning the hearts and minds, not only of the international community but also many Israelis themselves; who became advocates for our right to have a free and independent Palestinian state. I learned, to some extent, what freedom meant when I took my first plane trip, flying to London via Tel Aviv in 1993. I had been invited by Amnesty International in my capacity as the founder of the organization's Palestinian branch. I wrote articles and appeared on television and radio to promote human rights and non-violent struggle; I was invited to address Israeli audiences and receive Israeli citizens in Gaza itself. I also stood as a candidate in the first Palestinian parliamentary elections in 1996. Then, my dream of being a free citizen in a free state grew and flourished, but over time it gradually became weaker and weaker. Twenty years ago, how to make peace with Israel was a daily topic for the Palestinian people. It was very normal to see tens of Israelis citizens walking freely along Gaza streets, shopping and making conversation. On the other side of the border, an influential Israeli camp was advocating making peace with the Palestinians. Nowadays, ""peace"" is perhaps the least used word in Gaza's daily lexicon, replaced as it has been by the terms; tanks, F16, killing, shelling, rockets and revenge. And in Israel, politicians and groups compete to see who will be more aggressive towards the Palestinians. This is demonstrated by the success of the extreme right in politics. Twenty years ago, more than 80,000 Palestinian workers went to Israel every day to work alongside Israelis, acting as ambassadors for co-existance. Twenty years ago, it was common to see the slogan and fliers ""PEACE NOW"" on cars and at shops and restaurants. Making peace with the Palestinians appeared to be a priority for the Israeli public. Recently, the Israeli government built a huge wall separating Israel from the Palestinian territories. Now that Israeli citizens cannot see us any more, it seems they have lost sight of our reality. And the reality has been deteriorating. When the Israelis began building separation walls in the late 1990s, many of its citizens were being killed by suicide bombers. In September 2000, the second intifada erupted with a far more violent face than its predecessor. Hamas won the election in 2006 and took control from Fatah forcibly in June 2007, prompting Israel to blockade the Gaza Strip, which created humanitarians crises. Since then Israel has declared three wars against Gaza, in 2008, 2012 and now 2014. Meantime, Hamas and other resistance movements continue to launch homemade rockets into Israel's cities. Within the new reality, the Israelis and Palestinians are unable to see/meet/talk/interact with each other. I always say, it is easy to fight someone you don't know and/or have no mutual interests with, but you cannot make peace with someone unless you know them well and share interests. This is why it has been easy for the new generations on both sides -- Israeli and Palestinians -- to fight each other aggressively. They have never met and they don't see the benefit of living peacefully. Nowadays, they communicate from a distance through rockets, bullets, shelling, guns -- instead of physically interacting. The generations of both sides have been taken hostages by the conflict, they consume and waste their energy and resources to make the other's life more difficult. Both generations have to work harder to find the lost opportunity, which is hidden underneath scene of the conflict; they have to be educated to look differently. Regional cooperation . In today's globalized world, the problems have become cross-border despite being perceived as local. Regional cooperation is needed. Both Israelis and Palestinians suffer severe water shortages, pollution, population growth, radicalism, unemployment. But while the cost of conflict to both is huge, the profit of peace would be much higher. In addition to the waste of their own resources, the Palestinians have received billions of dollars of aid in the past 20 years since the Oslo accord, while Israel receives U.S. aid assistance of about US$3 billion every year. Some of the international aid and the local resources are spent in fueling the conflict, though it would make a huge and positive difference to people's lives if such huge amounts were instead used in developmental projects. Both the Israeli and Palestinian governments might be able to reach a peace agreement, but achieving culture of peace remains distant. I have never thought to leave Gaza or to emigrate, though I have always easy access to such a possibility. I believe that Gaza is in need of an ""agent of change."" I have been and I wanted to continue to be such an agent of change. But I feel tired, hopeless and less motivated to recharge myself. What is Israel's endgame in Gaza? What is Hamas' endgame in Gaza? How do we get a cease-fire to end the bloodshed in Gaza?","Omar Shaban was born to a Palestinian refugee family and grew up in Gaza .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will participate in a full day of discussion with African leaders Wednesday, turning the conversation to ""overall prosperity"" in the third and final day of the African Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. A White House official told CNN that the President will highlight the ""complex security challenges"" African countries face and how the United States can support them. The panel discussion is focused on ""Peace and Regional Stability,"" one of three in which Obama will participate at the U.S. State Department Wednesday. ""U.S. assistance seeks to enable African governments to protect civilians, strengthen security forces that respect human rights, and move away from the need for costly outside intervention. The discussion also will broach ways to build African capacity in terms of peacekeeping, counterterrorism, and maritime security, among other areas,"" the White House official told CNN. 5 reasons Obama's Africa leaders' summit matters . In May, the President announced plans for a Counterterrorism Partnership Fund that would allow the U.S. to train and support countries fighting to eradicate terrorists such as al Qaeda and bring peace to African nations such as Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Mali, and particularly in Nigeria, against the threat of Boko Haram. Administration officials have suggested that the drawdown of troops in Afghanistan could be used to pay for this effort. Earlier in the week, the summit brought together heads of state from Africa and top White House officials -- Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden -- who addressed leaders on issues from economic development to human rights, as well as government corruption and transparency. Obama will focus on these issues in a separate panel at the State Department centered on governance. Bill Clinton: America has 'barely scratched the surface' on African investment . The theme of inclusiveness will color this discussion as the President discusses ways to encourage sustainable growth and root out corruption. ""The United States is a committed partner to those working to build vibrant, democratic societies,"" a White House official told CNN. ""Many African nations have made demonstrable progress instituting democratic reforms, though political institutions in many countries remain fragile.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to competitive eating, Maurizio Capocchiano clearly has a fire in his belly -- as you'd expect from the reigning champ of the Chilli Eaters' Marathon. ""I was weaned on chilli, my mom used to sprinkle it on my baby bottle to stop me from sucking it,"" he says proudly. Held in the picturesque cliffside town of Diamante in southern Italy, the marathon is the eye-watering highlight of an annual Chilli Pepper Festival that celebrates obsessions with super-heated seasoning in the surrounding Calabria region. Last year Capocchiano gulped down 560 grams (19.7 ounces) of diavolilli, the so-called ""little devils"" that are typically the hottest peppers found in Italy. His dream is to beat the record of 800 grams, a feat that will cap a lifelong passion for piquancy. Hot tea . ""I started loving peppers when I tried Penne all'Arrabbiata with spicy tomato sauce -- delicious,"" he says. ""Now I put tons on all pasta and sometimes even in my tea."" Capocchiano and nine other challengers will be closely monitored by a panel of judges and doctors as they attempt to shovel as many 50-gram dishes of finely cut chilli peppers as possible down their inflamed throats. No water is allowed, only olive oil and bread are on hand to turn the heat down. The red yellow and green hot peppers are fresh from the fields, picked by Diamante's women. Male and female fire eaters of all ages compete in the marathon, seated at a big table in front of the public. The winner is treated to a week's free hotel stay for two in a local resort and to a personal driver who picks them up at the airport. ""Just like a rockstar,"" says Capocchiano. Competition is tough. Participants train all year round, taking part in local eating contests. Only the best get to go to Diamante. Victory, says Capocchiano, requires a cool head and a stomach of asbestos and steel. ""A tongue or throat on fire will not always stop you. The tricky part is making your tummy accept all that chilli: the peppers create gastric juice. You need a good dose of meditation to keep the chilli in your belly."" Another hazard, chilli seeds stuck between teeth, have been known to drive participants to quit the marathon and reach for a toothpick. Unpleasant side effects . Giovanni Polimeni, a former winner, last year flamed out after swallowing chilli dishes too quickly. ""I wanted to beat the record so in the first minute I devoured three plates of peppers. My intestine started grumbling and I had to slow down."" Due to these unpleasant side effects he's been forced to give up competing and now only eats chilli for pleasure. Thousands of spectators and chilli addicts from all over the world are drawn to the marathon. ""We've had foreign participants, too. It's nasty but it's also fun to watch other people stuffing their mouths, turning red and suffering like hell"", says Enzo Monaco, the festival's organizer. Beyond the competition, the chilli festival features food fairs, cooking shows, spicy movies, satirical performances, chilli-inspired jewelry and fashion and street jazz mixed with local music called Taranta. There's even a beauty contest aimed at selecting Miss Chilli -- who, predictably, is deemed the hottest woman in town. It doesn't stop there. Chilli love and sex potions and herbal cures are also on sale, making use of the pepper's supposed aphrodisiac powers and antiseptic ability to tackle colds and bronchitis. Calabria, the region surrounding Diamante, is Italy's kingdom of chilli and is famous for its tangy cuisine. Chilli aphrodisiacs . ""Peppers here rule,"" says Monaco. ""People add chilli to all their dishes, even to a cup of milk and fruit salad."" During the September 10-14 festival, city walls and houses are literally covered in red, green and yellow chilli pepper braids. They're seen as a good luck charm and, according to local belief, they scare demons away. A museum and an academy have been founded to study and promote chilli culture and tradition with branches across Italy. ""We're spicy people and love all things spicy -- meaning erotic, hot, strong, healthy, extraordinary. Chilli pepper is Calabria's brand. Life without chilli is plain boring,"" says Monaco. The local signature dish is spaghetti with fried garlic, oil and peperoncino. Chefs in Diamante have created new versions of it by adding bread crumbs and anchovies. Penne with N'Duja salami also tops the menus. Bars serve ""Afro,"" an aphrodisiac cocktail made of chilli, orange peel and citron. ""Locals believe it really increases sexual desire"", says Monaco. Silvia Marchetti is a freelance journalist and writer based in Italy.","Southern Italian town of Diamante hosts annual Chilli festival every September .

"(CNN) -- A passerby pushed a would-be suicide jumper off a bridge in southern China because he was angry at the jumper's ""selfish activity,"" Chinese media reported Saturday. It happened Thursday in the city of Guangzhou as Chen Fuchao threatened to jump off Haizhu Bridge, China's Xinhua news agency reported. The bridge has gained a ""macabre"" reputation with 11 jumpers having thrown themselves off the bridge since the start of April, Xinhua said. Traffic was held up for nearly five hours and a crowd gathered as Chen sat on the bridge, threatening to jump, Xinhua reported. Chen wanted to kill himself because he had 2 million yuan ($294,000) in debt after a failed construction project, Xinhua reported. Lian Jiansheng, 66, who was passing by the bridge, offered to talk Chen down, Xinhua said. Police refused, but Lian broke through the police cordon and climbed to where Chen was sitting. Lian greeted Chen with a handshake, then pushed him off the bridge, Xinhua said. Chen fell 26 feet (8 meters) onto a partially-inflated emergency air cushion, damaging his spine and elbow in the fall, Xinhua said. He is now recovering in a hospital. A photographer documented the sequence of events. The photographs show Lian, dressed in a T-shirt, shorts and socks, saluting to the crowd after pushing Chen off. ""I pushed him off because jumpers like Chen are very selfish. Their action violates a lot of public interest,"" Lian told Xinhua. ""They do not really dare to kill themselves. Instead, they just want to raise the relevant government authorities' attention to their appeals."" Police took Lian away after the incident, Xinhua said. It did not say whether he would face any charges.","Happened in Guangzhou as Chen Fuchao threatened to jump off Haizhu Bridge .

"Kathmandu (CNN) -- Aubrey Sacco from Colorado went trekking alone in Nepal, against her parents' advice, and disappeared. That was three years ago. There has been no trace of her despite many searches. A breakthrough in her case came this week when Nepalese police arrested two men who hail from the region where she vanished. ""We assume that she has been murdered,"" police said Saturday. The 16-year-old and the 22-year-old suspects are from Langtang, about 60 miles north of Kathmandu. They are in custody on suspicion of the alleged crime, chief Anurag Kumar Duwedi said. Lack of witnesses, records baffle dad searching for Nepal hiker . Sacco's family had been worried there would be no serious investigation despite their offer of a $25,000 reward for any information on her. Her father, Paul Sacco, a brother and one of their friends flew to Nepal to scour mountain trails after she vanished in April 2010. They had no luck, and what they heard from locals in the beginning discouraged them. They told them that if they did know something about the case, they would not share it with authorities. Sacco's parents have made three trips each to Nepal to search together with military and police for any sign of her, her mother Connie said. They have hired private detectives to help on the ground over the past three years, but the trail went cold. ""No leads, no evidence of any sort,"" she said. Missing hiker's dad puts sorrow into song . Sacco went on the trek in the Langtang National Park after graduating from college. She was 23 at the time. She was living up to her motto, ""glitter the world,"" on a five-month trip through South Asia, her family says. The artist and musician first taught yoga to vacationers in Sri Lanka. Later, she went to India, studying yoga and volunteering to help schoolchildren with art and music. She preferred staying with villagers as opposed to high-end places, Connie Sacco said. She looked forward to volunteering in Nepal. Read more: Climbers, sherpas make peace after Everest Fight .

"(CNN) -- An independent Scotland would retain Queen Elizabeth II as head of state, keep the pound sterling currency, and remain within the European Union, according to a policy document presented by Scotland's devolved government Tuesday. The release of the draft plan -- known as a white paper -- comes ahead of next year's referendum on independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The September 18 2014 referendum will allow Scots a straight yes-or-no vote on staying in the union. If they vote yes, the country's first independent election would be held on May 5, 2016, according to the white paper. Releasing the ""Scotland's Future"" document in Glasgow, Scotland's First Minister and Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Alex Salmond said ""Scotland's future is in Scotland's hands."" ""This white paper is the most detailed blueprint that any people have ever been offered anywhere in the world as a basis for becoming an independent country,"" he said. ""It puts beyond doubt that an independent Scotland would start from a position of strength -- in fact become independent in more promising circumstances than virtually any other nation in history."" But Better Together campaign leader and former British finance minister Alistair Darling said it was ""a fantasy"" to say Scotland could leave the UK but keep all the benefits of UK membership. ""The white paper is a work of fiction. It is thick with false promises and meaningless assertions. Instead of a credible and costed plan, we have a wish-list of political promises without any answers on how Alex Salmond would pay for them,"" the Scottish lamaker said. In his presentation, Salmond highlighted what he said was Scotland's ""underlying economic strength."" ""An independent Scotland could have the eighth-highest economic output and the tenth-highest national income per head of population in the whole of the developed world,"" he said. The plan says over the past 32 years, Scotland has contributed more tax per head of population than the UK as a whole and on independence would continue to have healthier public finances than the UK. But the country would retain the pound sterling as its currency as part of a ""formal Sterling Area,"" it says. Monarch . Other key points outlined in the paper including maintaining Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as Scotland's official head of state. It says an independent Scotland would have a points-based immigration system, targeted at Scotland's particular needs and would ensure that British citizens ""habitually resident"" in Scotland would automatically be considered Scottish citizens. Existing Scottish citizens would have the right but not the obligation to hold a Scottish passport. Foreign policy . The paper says an independent Scotland would establish its own network of overseas embassies and consulates but would have a ""close and constructive"" relationship with the rest of the UK on many foreign policy issues. The government's policy is to remain inside the European Union, the paper says. ""Following a vote for independence, the Scottish Government will immediately seek discussions with the Westminster Government and with the member states and institutions of the EU to agree the process whereby a smooth transition to full EU membership can take place on the day Scotland becomes an independent country."" Defense . An independent Scotland would make ""an early agreement on the speediest safe removal of nuclear weapons a priority,"" the paper says. ""This would be with a view to the removal of (Britain's nuclear deterrent program) Trident within the first term of the Scottish Parliament following independence,"" the paper says. Scotland would negotiate with NATO to become an independent and non-nuclear member of the defense alliance, it said and would commit to a Â£2.5 billion ($3.38B) defense budget, building to a total of 15,000 regular defense personnel. ""We are prepared to negotiate arrangements for the continued use of defense infrastructure in Scotland by UK forces and vice versa, at least for a transitional period,"" it added. The Act of Union joined Scotland and England in 1707 and Scotland is currently governed under the umbrella of the British government in Westminster in London, alongside Wales and Northern Ireland. Westminster returned some autonomy to the three nations, and gave them the right to form their own parliaments, in the late 1990s. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Salmond, signed a deal in October 2012 paving the way for Scots to vote on independence from the United Kingdom.

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson wanted to live forever. Just a year and a half before his death, I conducted what ended up being the last major interview with the reclusive Jackson in his suite at the Carlyle Hotel in New York City. And his words stopped me. ""Let's face it. Who wants mortality? Everybody wants immortality,"" he told me that warm September afternoon. ""You want what you create to live, be it sculpture or painting or music. Like Michelangelo said, 'I know the creator will go but his work survives. That's why to escape death I attempt to bind my soul to my work.' That's how I feel. I give my all at work. 'Cause I want it to just live."" Most of us remember where we were when we heard that he was dead. I was mowing the lawn at my house outside Chicago when I got the first call. In fact, I got several calls and texts with the bulletin -- first from TMZ and then from the Los Angeles Times -- that he had died. But it wasn't until I heard CNN's Wolf Blitzer announce it at 6:28 p.m. ET that I finally believed it. Michael Jackson was dead. Sure, I was shocked when I heard the news that the King of Pop had left the world. But, in a way, I was not all that surprised. Jackson, even as troubled as he was, had given his all to the world during his 50 years on the planet. And now he was in the hands of history. Just before that interview for Ebony magazine, I watched his youngest son, Blanket, then 7, politely greet me at the hotel room door and his father quickly correct him -- ""Blanket, you shake with your right hand, not with your left"" -- and in that moment I saw what those kids meant to him. It was indeed his children -- Prince, now 17, Paris, now 16, and Blanket, now 12 -- who gave us those dozen or so extra years of Michael Jackson's life. Jackson was a true father, and those kids were his heart. He lived for them. They gave his later life meaning. Never mind those images of a newborn Prince Michael II dangling from that hotel balcony in Berlin, or pictures of the kids wearing masks while being shuttled around by their dad. Away from the cameras and publicists and crowds, Jackson was about as regular a father as someone like him could be. That's why it was even more tragic that he died just four days after Father's Day. So, five years later, it is those kids who stand to benefit most from his immortality. If the lawyers and accountants and Uncle Sam get out of the way -- The Associated Press reported that more than $91 million of the $600 million his estate has earned since his death has gone to taxes and licenses, and another $32 million went to lawyers and the executors of his estate -- the three children and his mother will do quite well for the rest of their lives. As a musical wonder at age 8, he and his brothers defined a genre of music in the '70s. When he left the Jackson 5 and went on his own in the early '80s, he did it again with his ""Off the Wall"" and ""Thriller"" albums, shattering just about every record held to date. He sold out concerts around the world, rescued a stalled music industry and single-handedly put MTV on the map -- ""Nobody had ever seen anything like that,"" legendary superproducer Quincy Jones once told me, after the ""Thriller"" video debuted on the fledgling music network. ""That album sold something like a million and a half copies per week after we put that video out."" Still, when Jackson died, he had amassed nearly a half billion dollars in various debts -- to banks, bodyguards and other creditors, Forbes reported. That debt had largely been wiped out in the first year following his death, due to huge posthumous CD sales and film proceeds. In the last year alone, his estate has seen a slew of projects: . -- ""Xscape,"" a new album of never-before-released Michael Jackson songs reproduced by executive producer L.A. Reid debuted at No. 2 on the U.S. charts last month. -- ""Michael Jackson One,"" a Las Vegas Cirque du Soleil extravaganza featuring his music and dance moves, and ""The Immortal World Tour,"" a slick companion show that is now traveling the country, with more than 500 performances so far. -- Numerous books, documentaries and the film ""This Is It"" have tried to capture Jackson's life. The latest book, ""Remember the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days,"" by two of his bodyguards, just hit bookstores. Michael Jackson's legacy: Music, family and 'What if?' Even a makeup-stained chair, allegedly from Jackson's rented Holmby Hills mansion where he died, just went on sale on eBay with a starting price of $30,000. In death, everybody still wants to get paid by Michael Jackson. In the past five years there have been lawsuits -- his mother, Katherine Jackson, sued promoter AEG Live, claiming more than $1 billion in damages. She said the promoter was liable for the star's wrongful death, but a jury ruled against her last year and she collected nothing. There have been tragedies -- Michael Jackson's daughter, Paris, who took his death the hardest, found herself in a hospital bed last year after reportedly trying to slit her wrists. She later recovered. And there has been drama. Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, was convicted on involuntary manslaughter charges for causing the star's death as a result of an overdose of the powerful surgical anesthetic propofol. He was released in 2013, two years early, due to prison overcrowding. But through it all, Michael Jackson somehow lives on. Thinking back to that last conversation with him, I didn't know when I sat down next to him on that burgundy couch that his last words to me would be prophetic. ""To escape death I attempt to bind my soul to my work."" Michael Jackson, through his work, wanted to live forever. And, based on what has happened in the five years since he died, he might just make it.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Sandiaga Uno is without doubt one of Indonesia's richest men. With an estimated personal wealth of $400 million dollars and assets valued in the billions, the 41-year-old's climb to the top is an inspiration to many budding entrepreneurs. Yet this father of two, from humble beginnings is not interested in promoting his own story but rather that of his country and its enormous potential. Dressed in a green batik shirt, a patriotic gesture to the rich cultural heritage of Indonesia, the businessman knows how lucky he is. From his high-rise office building in downtown Jakarta, Uno speaks of the sacrifices his parents made to send him to university in the United States. It was there he discovered an interest in business that led him to a job in Canada. But his dream of working overseas came to an abrupt end when the company he was working for collapsed, putting Uno out of a job. He was forced to return home, but the timing couldn't have been worse with Asia in economic meltdown from the 1997 financial crisis. Struggling to provide for his family, Uno decided against the odds to set up his own business and with four staff in a tiny office, Saratoga Capital was born. Twelve years later it is one of Indonesia's largest investment firms employing more than 20,000 people. Uno believes failure is just as important as success and while he admits there were plenty of hard knocks he was confident his gamble would pay off in the long term. ""I knew when Asia came out of the crisis energy would be in high demand. So we started getting serious looking at those opportunities,"" he said. And now it is energy that is his primary focus; investing in coal, oil, gas, toll roads, plantations and shipping ports. Indonesia is going through an enormous economic boom thanks partly to its valuable natural resources. Indonesia's stock market is outperforming its neighbors and the region. Growth is expected to reach 6 percent this year and an emerging middle class is fueling domestic demand. Despite all this success, Uno believes the country's wealth is not being evenly distributed. Around 40 million of the country's 242 million people still live below the poverty line and Uno describes this as a recipe for disaster. ""Basically if we are not careful the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer and the gap will be the next embryo of the next unrest. So we as businessmen need to make sure the wealth is spread more equally,"" he said. Uno is extremely passionate about the future of Indonesia and while he will talk up the country as the next place to invest along side China and India, he's acutely aware and critical of its pitfalls. He says corruption is the number one problem holding his country back, a view shared by many in the international community. He says to have sustainable growth Indonesia must be attractive to foreign investors. ""I think the government is on the right track in stamping out corruption; it's moving in the right direction. But the speed and pace is not satisfactory, I think people want to see more,"" he said. Another major problem is infrastructure and for Uno this has become his ""personal crusade"". He says anyone who visits the nation's capital Jakarta is greeted by a dilapidated international airport followed by gridlocked roads. His companies have $20 billion to invest in infrastructure projects. ""The money is there, we just need the government to sort out the land acquisition problem among other things which will require changes in the law and then we can start building the infrastructure Indonesia so desperately needs,"" he said. Earlier this year, Uno was invited by U.S. President Barak Obama to attend an Entrepreneur's Summit in Washington DC. He describes how impressed he was with the U.S. President who spoke to him in Bahasa and believes the leader of the free world knows just how important Indonesia has become. Uno says his wealth brings power -- he regularly has the ear of his president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono -- but insists it's not about money or the people you brush shoulders with. His motivation to succeed is much greater than that. ""I see all these paradoxical situations. Indonesia has the 18th largest economy but we're ranked 122 in the world for ease of doing business. It doesn't gel and it really ticks me off. We should do better,"" he said. ""We are so rich in resources but we can't even produce. For example we produce coca but don't have chocolate factories. We produce crude palm oil but we don't have perfume or soap industries. So we're just exporting our raw materials without being able to process it. I think in the next four to five years Indonesia must be able to generate that expertise.""","Sandiaga Uno is one of Indonesia's wealthiest businessmen .

"(CNN) -- Slim Whitman, the high-pitched yodeling county music singer whose productive career spanned decades, died Wednesday, his son-in-law told CNN. He was 90. The singer-songwriter, born Ottis Dewey Whitman Jr., died of heart failure at Orange Park Medical Center in Florida, Roy Beagle said. Whitman gained fame in Europe as well as the United States. ""Love Song of the Waterfall,"" which a Country Music Television biography calls his ""breakthrough"" hit, was released in the early '50s. His next single ""Indian Love Call"" brought him stardom, according to the bio. ""Whitman joined the Grand Ole Opry, and then went to Britain in 1956 as the first country singer to play the London Palladium. Throughout the late '50s and early '60s, he had a string of British hits, including 'Tumbling Tumbleweeds,' 'Unchain My Heart,' and 'I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen,"" the bio said. He gained cult status after he filmed a TV commercial that touted a released of his top greatest hits, a compilation that was a great success. ""Between 1980 and 1984, Whitman had a small run of minor hits, highlighted by 1980's number 15 hit 'When.' In the late '80s, he returned to television-marketed albums, releasing Slim Whitman: Best Loved Favorites in 1989 and 20 Precious Memories in 1991. During the '90s, Whitman recorded infrequently but continued to tour successfully, particularly in Europe and Australia,"" CMT said. His music was featured in the 1996 film ""Mars Attacks!""

"(CNN) -- Brazil had promised there would be a time where the world would finally see a special player. He wears a yellow shirt emblazoned with the number 10 and produces moments of magic which mere mortals can scarcely dream of replicating -- unless on their games console. He's 22 years of age -- a player with quick feet, a mind which sees each and every move before his opponents have drawn breath, a player who can score a goal when for all the world it appears impossible. What Brazil didn't promise is that he would wear the yellow of Colombia -- and his name is James Rodriguez. While Neymar might be the face of this World Cup, Rodriguez is the man that football fans have fallen for. His two strikes propelled Colombia to a 2-0 victory over Uruguay and into its first ever World Cup quarterfinal where it will play Brazil and made him top scorer in the tournament with five goals. It promises to be some occasion in Fortaleza where the two 22-year-old stars will take to the same field -- but if Rodriguez reproduces this performance, Brazil will surely be heading out. In Colombia, they call him ""El Nuevo Pibe"" -- the New Kid -- the man who takes on the mantle of former Colombian great Carlos Valderrama. Valderrama, known as ""El Pibe"" is widely acknowledged as the greatest Colombian to have kicked a ball -- though even he expects that to change. This contest was an example of the New Kid rising to the top. Sometimes you witness something so special that it's difficult to imagine quite how it came to pass. Perhaps on Friday night, Rodriguez went to sleep and dreamed of how he'd score the perfect World Cup goal. But even then, as the moon looked down upon Rio de Janeiro, it is doubtful that Rodriguez would have envisaged scoring a goal so perfect that it will no doubt be played over and over for years to come. Make no mistake -- Rodriguez's volleyed strike, which would have caused a gasp and a sharp intake of breath from those watching around the world, was a moment never to be forgotten. That will be clear once kids across Colombia, Brazil and indeed across the world, begin trying to recreate the goal scored by football's latest sensation. It would be wrong to call Rodriguez a new star -- he moved to French club Monaco from Porto last year for around $65 million. But his emergence on the international stage has captured the imagination of those who have yet to witness the talented playmaker in action. His two goals helped secure Colombia's place in Friday's quarterfinal against a Brazil side which sneaked past Chile courtesy of a penalty shootout victory. While it may be the host nation, Brazil will surely feel more pressure and anxiety at the thought of facing this Colombia team -- a side which plays with a style and swagger which Luiz Scolari's men have so far lacked. That everyone who walked out of the Maracana after the game was speaking about Rodriguez was a testament to the player but also ensured another star name was temporarily forgotten at least. After all, much of the lead up to the game had focused on one man -- a man who was nowhere to be seen. Luis Suarez, banned for four months from all football and suspended for nine international games following his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, may have been absent from the Maracana, but his shadow loomed large. Uruguay's players gathered in the dressing room to take photos of themselves holding his shirt, while the entire country has remained defiant in the defense of its hero. FIFA confirmed to CNN that the Uruguayan Football Association will appeal Suarez's ban -- but he will certainly take no further part in this World Cup. Instead, back at home in Uruguay, he could only watch on as his teammates were brushed aside by a vibrant, exciting and hugely talented Colombian side. Colombia, playing in its first World Cup since 1998, has produced some of the most eye-catching football witnessed so far -- an impressive feat given the absence of Falcao, the team's star striker. Led by Rodriguez, this is a team which oozes flair, adventure and style while still ensuring the backdoor remains slammed firmly shut. The Monaco playmaker had already scored in each of the three group games -- but none of those goals match the finish he produced to give his side a 28th minute lead. When the ball popped up to him, some 20-yards from goal, most would have expected Rodriguez to control the ball, take it down, and possibly have an effort on goal. What nobody expected, nor thought possible was what happened next. Rodriguez took the ball on his chest, allowed the ball to drop, and then unleashed a volley which flew past Fernando Muslera in the Uruguay goal, hit the underside of the crossbar, and nestled in the back of the net. It was thing of beauty -- a goal which took the breath away. As Rodriguez ran away to celebrate with what has become an almost traditional dance, Uruguay appeared stunned by what had just occurred. With its own talisman missing, it was Colombia's which began to dictate the game. Rodriguez, appearing at his first World Cup, plays with a poise and experience which belies his years. Each and every time the ball arrives at his feet there is a buzz, a hum, around the stadium which greets the way he controls the ball, whenever he shifts it right, moves it left, or finds a teammate. But it's not all about Rodriguez. Pekerman, who led Argentina to the quarterfinals in 2006 where it was beaten by Germany, has molded together a team which thrills and excites each time it takes the field. Its second goal was a case in point -- a wonderful team move which led to Rodriguez slotting the ball home from close range after Juan Cuadrado had headed the ball back across goal. That goal, which arrived five minutes after the interval, killed off any hopes Uruguay might have had of launching a comeback. It briefly rallied late on with David Ospina in the Colombia goal forced to make saves from Cristian Rodriguez and Maxi Pereira, but its late pressure proved futile. Instead, Uruguay's players will fly home where Suarez will no doubt be waiting for them and wondering what might have had happened had he been able to play. But for all the talk of absent stars, it was the name of a new one which will undoubtedly be the new focus of this World Cup. He's only 22. He plays in yellow and he produces moments of magic which bring football fans to their feet. He's not Neymar though -- no. He's James Rodriguez -- and he's coming for Brazil.","Colombia to face Brazil in World Cup quarterfinal .

"London, England (CNN) -- How much does it cost to renovate an ""uninhabitable"" wing of a 17th century palace to make it fit for a future king and queen? Now we know: £4.5 million ($7.6 million). That's what the British taxpayer has put toward the refurbishment of Apartment 1a, Kensington Palace, which recently became the official residence of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George. But the true cost is higher, because the couple also put in hundreds of thousands of dollars of their own money for additional improvements. For example, public money was used to renovate the existing kitchen, but Catherine and William wanted a second ""family kitchen,"" which they paid for themselves. A royal spokesperson said: ""Kensington Palace has a working kitchen provided by the Sovereign (public) Grant to support receptions and other public events which might be hosted there. There is also a much smaller family kitchen paid for privately by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge."" The general rule applied to the project was that basic works would be paid for from the public purse, and anything beyond that would be covered by the Cambridges themselves. It was a major renovation. The apartment was last lived in by the Queen's late sister, Princess Margaret, but in recent years was used as office space. It needed updating and reshaping into a family home. Asbestos was discovered throughout the building, so in the end, nearly everything was stripped out internally, and even the roof had to be replaced -- all to exacting standards to meet historic building regulations. The name ""1a"" downplays the grandeur of the property, with its more than 20 main rooms and expansive garden. But what's it like inside? Well, we haven't been allowed in to see, but a Royal Household source describes ""a very ordinary level of furnishing."" And added: ""It's not opulent."" The project was subject to the normal competitive tendering processes, and an independent quantity surveying firm confirmed to the Household that the costs are ""commensurate with building projects of a similar size, sensitivity and complexity."" It won't be open to the public though, which begs the question: Why are they paying for it, especially when the Cambridges are also renovating a private home outside London? The Household source confirmed that the apartment would be used for official engagements, which means invited guests and, presumably, media will get a chance to see inside. The Queen received £36.1 million ($61.3 million) from the British Government for the 2013-14 financial year in what's called ""The Sovereign Grant,"" and it covers the costs of her public duties and the upkeep of palaces including Kensington. There's a major backlog of repairs throughout the estate -- 40% of it isn't up to standard, according to the Household source. Most of the services in Buckingham Palace date back to 1949. So was Kensington Palace given priority over other repairs? ""Yes, in that we needed it for occupation,"" said the source. The figures have been revealed in the Royal Household's Annual Report and Accounts, which also showed Prince Charles spent nearly £250,000 ($425,000) on a private jet to Nelson Mandela's funeral. The Household source says there was massive demand for charter flights by heads of state to attend and that was the cost to charter at that time. ""This was the only realistic way of getting him there in time."" The palace points out that the cost of the monarchy is 56p (95 cents) per head of the British population, but that doesn't cover the vast costs of security for the palaces and individual members of the royal family. The Royal Household source notes: ""The cost of security is a cost of terrorism rather than a cost of the monarchy."" And that, they point out, is something they cannot control.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- An Israeli airstrike killed two men in Gaza City on Friday afternoon, Palestinian medical sources said -- an attack that the Israeli military says targeted people involved in recent rocket attacks against Israel. The Israeli aircraft fired at a vehicle about 3:15 p.m., killing the two men, the Palestinian sources said. Israel's military said the strike in northern Gaza targeted two men who ""were involved in the rockets launched at Israel in the passing week."" The men ""were also involved in several terror attacks against Israel over the past few years and were planning further attacks against Israel and its civilians,"" the military said. Palestinian security sources said the men were affiliated with the Tawhid Brigades, a radical Islamist group. The Israeli military said that 30 rockets were launched from Gaza toward Israel in the last two weeks. No injuries were reported in Israel, though the military said one of the rockets landed in Gaza, killing a girl and wounding another there. Explosive used against Israeli tank . Earlier Friday, an explosive device was used against an Israeli tank near the border with southern Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian sources said. Israeli forces responded with tank fire aimed at ""lookout posts used to guide the attack,"" an Israeli Defense Ministry official said. The official confirmed one hit.

"(CNN) -- According to a recent U.N. report, insects could be a solution to some of the world's food and health problems. They're nutritious, eco-friendly and abundant. Many countries already consider them a staple part of their diets. So if we're all to start consuming locusts and scorpions, we can start in Southeast Asia for guidance. They're a common sight in Bangkok. Come nightfall, at any given outdoor market or busy road there will usually be at least one vendor with a pushcart loaded up with insect snacks, making many tourists squirm and others lick their lips. Maybe you're in the mood for some fried crickets. Or perhaps it's the pile of bamboo worms that has you salivating. These bug vendors serve up to a dozen varieties of insects, which are usually fried in vegetable oil then sprayed with soy sauce to add some zing. To locals, and some expats, these foods are not out of the ordinary -- they're part of the many meals on offer. Though most tourists prefer to munch on bugs for the shock value and to try something different -- check me out on Facebook/Instagram, how crazy am I? -- locals enjoy them for the flavor. ""Customers often like to eat fried insects while drinking beer, as a healthy and exotic replacement for popcorn or peanuts,"" one vendor says. More on Thailand's fried bugs: A guide to Thailand's edible insects . Similar markets and food carts exist throughout Asia and other parts of the world. Take some of the options at this Beijing night market -- fried scorpions, centipedes and locusts. Going back to that U.N. report, it says 2 billion people around the world consider insects a delicacy or even a dietary staple. Insects are generally high in nutritional value and beat out both meat and fish in protein content and quality. They're also rich in fiber and healthy micronutrients including copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium and zinc. This makes insects the ideal food of the future, the U.N. says -- not just for the above parts of the world but globally. They will help promote health, wealth and a better environment and go some way to addressing current and potential food shortages.

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez illustrated why he is one of the world's most controversial soccer players on Sunday as he bit an opponent before going on to save his club from defeat with a last-gasp goal. The Liverpool star showed his best and worst sides in a controversial 2-2 draw with Chelsea, and he potentially faces another long suspension after his assault on Branislav Ivanovic. Suarez, the English Premier League's top scorer, wrestled with the Chelsea defender and then clearly sank his teeth into the Serbian's arm. The incident was not seen by referee Kevin Friend, who shrugged off Ivanovic's angry protestations. Suarez later apologized on his Twitter account. ""I'm sad for what happened this afternoon, I apologize Ivanovic and all football world for my inexcusable behavior. I'm so sorry about it!!"" wrote Suarez. Among his Twitter followers is former boxing champion Mike Tyson, who infamously bit off part of an opponent's ear in 1997. It is not the first time Suarez has bitten an opponent -- he was suspended for seven matches in late 2010 after an incident while playing for Dutch club Ajax, two months before joining Liverpool. He was also banned for eight matches after racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra in October 2011, and former Liverpool captain Graeme Souness said after the Chelsea match that the 26-year-old is in ""last-chance saloon."" Souness, one of the match analysts for UK broadcaster Sky Sports, said the club needed to take strong action after an incident which reflects badly on one of the world's most famous teams. ""People will be talking about this for a long, long time and it's going to show Liverpool in a very bad light -- especially in this week of all weeks, the anniversary of Hillsborough,"" said the 59-year-old, referring to the 24th anniversary of the stadium tragedy where 96 people died after a crush during a match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. ""It can't happen again. I firmly believe this puts him in the last-chance saloon as a Liverpool player -- the board have to see it that way because they're risking everything this great football club stands for,"" added Souness, who was a player during Liverpool's glory days of the 1970s and '80s and later managed the club. Liverpool's current manager Brendan Rodgers refused to criticize Suarez in his postmatch interview with Sky, saying he had yet to see the incident and that he would review it later. ""I'll make an honest appraisal on it and comment afterwards. It's not for me to make any rash comments or predictions now,"" said Rodgers, who claimed Chelsea's former Liverpool striker Fernando Torres had elbowed his defender Jamie Carragher in the face. The Spaniard was booked for that challenge. Rodgers later added on Liverpool's website: ""Having reviewed the video footage and spoken to Luis, his behavior is unacceptable and I have made him aware of this."" Rodgers' predecessor Kenny Dalglish was widely criticized for publicly defending Suarez during the Evra case, and after the punishment was handed out by the FA. Another former Liverpool player, Jamie Redknapp, said that the actions of Suarez -- who has often been criticized for diving on the pitch -- were ""indefensible."" ""There is that madness-genius gene in him because as a player he's exceptional, with people talking about him being player of the year, but what he did today, is indefensible,"" said Redknapp, also a Sky analyst. ""Even the staunchest Liverpool supporters cannot look at that and think that's alright. ""Why on earth would you want to take a chunk out of someone's arm when you are on a football field? That is an absolutely incredible act of brutality. It's madness."" Liverpool, owned by the U.S. Fenway Sports Group, insisted it would take internal action against Suarez. ""His behavior is not befitting of any player wearing a Liverpool shirt and Luis is aware that he has let himself and everyone associated with the club down,"" said managing director Ian Ayre. ""We will deal with the matter internally and await any action from the FA."" The incident overshadowed former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez's return to Anfield with Chelsea, but the Spaniard refused to comment on Suarez -- instead complaining about the near seven minutes of time added on that allowed the striker to head an equalizer for his 23rd EPL goal of the season. ""Six minutes and 45 seconds is difficult to explain. We need to analyze why we didn't stop the cross and they scored, but in the normal circumstances we would have finished the game,"" Benitez said. Suarez had earlier set up second-half substitute Daniel Sturridge to make it 1-1 after Oscar's first-half headed opener, but then inexplicably handled the ball in his own penalty area to allow Eden Hazard to put Chelsea in front again from the spot. The draw dented Chelsea's chances of qualifying for next season's European Champions League, leaving Benitez's team in fourth place -- a point behind Arsenal and one ahead of Tottenham. Tottenham had earlier stunned second-placed Manchester City 3-1, a result that means Manchester United can wrap up a record-extending 20th English title with four matches to spare. Victory in Monday's home match against relegation-threatened Aston Villa will end City's Premier League reign, as manager Roberto Mancini ponders what has gone wrong this season. ""I can't believe that we lost this game because we played very, very well for 80 minutes,"" the Italian manager said after Spurs came from behind to score three late goals. ""This is our problem this year, when we have chances we don't score."" Samir Nasri gave City the lead in the fifth minute, but Gareth Bale set up Clint Dempsey's equalizer with 15 minutes to play before substitute Jermain Defoe cut inside visiting captain Vincent Kompany and lashed in a right-foot shot. Bale, returning after an ankle injury, then wrapped up the win with his 18th league goal this season. City's only hope of silverware this season is the FA Cup, with the final against Wigan on May 11 as Mancini seeks to win back the trophy he lifted two seasons ago. ""We needed to win because we want to get second position and to have a better life for the next week, but we didn't deserve to lose -- we deserved to win,"" he said. ""The championship was finished three or four weeks ago, they deserved to win it. I think that it's important for us to win as many games now as we can.""","Liverpool's Luis Suarez bites the arm of a Chelsea opponent in Sunday's 2-2 draw .

"(CNN) -- Violence between competing unions at South Africa's mines is threatening to weaken Africa's largest economy. On Wednesday, the world's top platinum producer, Anglo American, suspended all of its operations in Rustenburg, South Africa due to ""intimidation"" of its workers. Striking workers are also halting operations at some gold mines. The move follows strike-related violence at Lonmin's Marikana mine in August that left 44 dead. What triggered the violence? The 34 miners in the Lonmin mine in Marikana, South Africa, died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete-armed workers striking for higher wages. The shootings came after deaths earlier in the week, including those of two police officers who were hacked to death. The violence exploded when police shot at striking rock drillers in the ""Easterns"" area of the Marikana mine. Tensions have been high in part because of the presence of competing trade unions, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Read more: Inquiry launched into mine shootings . The mine, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg, is operated by Lonmin, which is listed on both the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and is the world's third largest platinum producer. The bulk of its 28,000 employees work at the mine, and around 23% belong to the AMCU. The violence has prompted some people to draw parallels with the country's days of apartheid rule, which ended in 1994. South African's president, Jacob Zuma, has opened an inquiry into the incident. What is behind the conflict? Rivalry between the AMCU and the NUM is widely blamed for feeding the violence. The AMCU, which has expanded rapidly this year at the expense of NUM, is seen as the more militant union and has been linked to aggressive tactics to win wage increases. It has gained ground in an environment where workers have been dissatisfied with improvements in quality of life since the end of apartheid, particularly for those in the lower wage brackets. At Marikana, 3,000 rock drill operators at the mine stopped work as they tried to force an increase in their wages, from ZAR5,400 ($648) a month to ZAR12,500 ($1,500) a month. Tensions increased over the following days, with AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa declaring the members were prepared to ""die here"" if necessary. The stand-off later escalated into violence, leaving 34 dead, 78 injured and 259 arrested on various charges, according to South Africa National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega. The violence follows other fatal incidents including a six-week strike at Impala Platinum (Implats) in February, which left three dead, and an attack on Aquarius Platinum in August which also left three people dead. The push for higher wages comes after the AMCU was ""clearly emboldened"" by a strike at Implats' Rustenberg mine in February which resulted in a 125% increase in wages, analysts at Eurasia Group noted. The outcome set a ""problematic precedent for platinum companies in South Africa,"" Africa analyst Mark Rosenberg said. Alison Turner, analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co, said the emergence of the AMCU ""represents the single biggest risk to the platinum sector, particularly as many of the incidents in which the AMCU has been implicated have involved violence."" According to Rosenberg, however, violence at Marikana could prove to be detrimental to the union's aggressive recruitment strategy. Who is to blame for the Marikana shootings? While union rivalry is being blamed for the friction, it is unclear who triggered the first shots at Marikana, which is one of the country's bloodiest incidents since the end of apartheid in 1994. Police have said they were bringing in barbed wire to fence the miners, and used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse them. According to Phiyega, a militant group of strikers then fired on police who said they were forced to use ""maximum force"" to defend themselves. Video from the incident shows police shooting for some minutes at protesters, kicking up dust. When the dust clears, several bodies are shown lying on the ground. The video appeared to show the police response was ""very forceful,"" Turner said. The South African Institute for Race Relations said that policemen randomly shot into the crowd with rifles and handguns. ""There is also evidence of their continuing to shoot after a number of bodies can be seen dropping and others turning to run. This is reminiscent of the Sharpeville massacre in 1960,"" the institute said. In a press conference Phiyega said it was not a time for placing blame, but ""a time for us to mourn."" Late last month, a regional prosecutor charged 270 of the platinum miners with the murder of their colleagues, who are believed to have been shot by police. However, the charges are being dropped. What do the unions say? The two implicated unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. AMCU general secretary Jeff Mphahlele told CNN the union could not be blamed. ""We are a peaceful organization and we do not condone violence,"" he said. Mphahlele said police initially shot at the protesters from behind, although when asked if they shot first he said: ""I was not there,"" adding: ""The killing of those people was not necessary."" He said Mathunjwa's reference to being prepared to die was in response to fears the police would attack. Frans Baleni, head of the NUM, said Monday that its members were under siege. ""Our members have been attacked, and that cannot be said to be clashes or rivalry, it is pure criminality,"" he said. Is the government tarnished? The NUM is a close ally of the country's ruling African National Congress and its inability to stop the violence and weakened role is expected to drag on Zuma, according to Rosenberg. The immediate impact is likely to be Zuma's pitch for re-election to head the party in December, he added. Re-election is ""significantly less likely"" Rosenberg said. While there is no formal challenger to the role yet, this could spur the emergence of one, he added. People are no longer willing to sit and wait around for the ANC to deliver, Rosenberg said. ""They are becoming more and more impatient and they're becoming more and more violent as a result."" What is the impact on Lonmin? Lonmin has so far missed out on around $75 million in lost production, and the workers haven't been paid for a month. The company said last week that a ""peace accord"" had been signed, but key unions had not agreed to the deal. Lonmin acting CEO Simon Scott said the company and unions have agreed to ""negotiate to address the wage demands within a legal framework."" He added, ""We simply ask that those negotiations happen in an environment free of intimidation and violence."" The company has previously announced its chief executive Ian Farmer had been diagnosed with a serious illness and was in hospital. It was unrelated to the mine incident.

"(CNN) -- Fashion season is once again upon us. Celebrities, trendsetters and buyers across the world will adorn the front rows of countless runways as the sartorially elite reveal their style edicts for the season ahead. But what is it like to rub shoulders with fashion's finest? Over the next week, CNN's African Voices is teaming up with Ethiopian supermodel, designer and maternal health advocate Liya Kebede to offer an exclusive insight into her multi-faceted world. Kebede will post a daily diary of her life on Instagram showing us mere mortals the events she attends, meetings she's involved in while reflecting on how her roots have shaped the woman she is today. Then we'll gather the diary together and release it in interactive form next week. But if you can't wait until then, follow Kebede throughout the week via the hashtag #CNNAfrica on Instagram and Twitter. Who is Liya Kebede? Born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1978, Kebede had been attending the French Lycee when she was scouted by a French film director and so began her rise to the top. Upon finishing her education, she joined a Parisian modeling agency before moving to Chicago and then New York. When she hit the Big Apple, there was no turning back. In the fall of 2000, the multi-talented designer and future director Tom Ford handpicked Kebede to walk the catwalk for his autumn/winter Gucci collection. It was the big break Kebede had been waiting for. A year later, she would sit for prolific photographer Patrick Demarchelier for Harper's Bazaar, feature as cover girl on numerous fashionista bibles including Vogue and tread the runways for Chanel, Dolce and Gabbana, Burberry and Fendi, to name a few. Despite the supermodel success, Kebede has never forgotten where she came from. When an opportunity arose to launch her own fashion line, Lemlem -- meaning ""to flourish or bloom"" in Amharic -- in 2007, Kebede drew inspiration from her native land. She embraced the traditional hand-woven style from back home, in the hope of offering employment and business opportunities for the country's long-established weavers, and incorporated it into her collections. Returning to her roots . Kebede also works tirelessly to put a spotlight on the needs of millions of mothers and newborns in Ethiopia through her philanthropy, The Liya Kebede Foundation, launched in 2005 alongside her appointment as a World Health Organization goodwill ambassador, a role she held until 2011. The Foundation supports training, and education about safe birth delivery services with the aim to substantially reduce preventable deaths in communities like the ones she grew up near.. As a mother of two, it's a cause close to her heart. ""When I went back to Ethiopia, I wanted to do something. I wanted to give back,"" Kebede previously told CNN, ""Here we are today. But in a hundred years how do you want the world to be? Everybody should get together to make the world a better place."" A supermodel, businesswoman, philanthropist, activist and mother -- that's a lot of hats and Kebede will show us just how she manages to do it all.","Liya Kebede is an Ethiopian supermodel scouted in Addis Ababa while at school .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia inmate, found dead in prison where she was serving a life sentence for killing her boyfriend and husband with antifreeze, apparently committed suicide, authorities said Wednesday. Autopsy results on Julia Lynn Womack Turner showed she died from the ""toxic effects of the prescription medication propranolol, a blood pressure medication that Ms. Turner had been prescribed,"" according to Georgia's chief medical examiner. Investigators found no evidence of injury or foul play and the prison death is being classified as a suicide, Dr. Kris Sperry said. ""Toxicology studies revealed that Ms. Turner had a lethal level of this drug in her blood indicating that she had ingested an amount well above the prescribed dosage,"" Dr. Sperry said. Turner, who went by Lynn, was serving a sentence of life in prison without parole in the Metro State Prison for women in Atlanta. She was found unresponsive in her cell on the morning of August 30, and medics could not revive her. Lynn Turner was convicted of murder in the deaths of her husband, police officer Glenn Turner, and her boyfriend, firefighter Randy Thompson. Both men were poisoned with antifreeze. Glenn Turner died March 3, 1995, from what was initially thought to be an irregular heartbeat. A week later, Lynn Turner moved in with Thompson, with whom she had begun an affair several months earlier. But it was not until Thompson died in 2001 under similar circumstances that authorities exhumed the body of Glenn Turner and performed another autopsy. In both cases, the men had exhibited flu-like symptoms before being taken to the emergency room. They both died less than 24 hours after they left the hospital, from what a coroner initially identified as heart failure. Further examination, however, revealed traces of ethylene glycol, a byproduct of antifreeze, in both of their bodies. Lynn Turner was convicted of killing her husband in 2004, then convicted in 2007 of killing Thompson. Cobb County, Georgia, prosecutors labeled her a ""black widow"" who murdered both men for financial gain. After her husband's death, Lynn Turner received more than $150,000 in benefits and interest from his life insurance and pension. She received about $36,000 in benefits as a result of Thompson's death. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Medical examiner: Turner died from a blood pressure drug overdose .

That selfie Ellen DeGeneres took at the Academy Awards had nothing on this. This was a game of thrones for the baseball gods. This was a Topps bubblegum-card collection come to life. Rickey Henderson. Andre Dawson. Don Sutton. Robin Yount. Billy Williams. Rollie Fingers. Dave Winfield. Lou Brock. And more. Living legends of the game, mortals who made it to the shrine of the immortals, all but a precious few (like Yogi Berra) having felt well enough to attend this yearly ceremony in person -- holy cow, practically everybody who was anybody was there. Except for one. Yep, yet again, no Pete Rose. Rose, the man with 4,256 hits (first on the all-time list). The man with 15,890 plate appearances (also first) and 14,053 official at-bats (also first). The man who got on base 5,929 times (also first). The man who played in the World Series six times and made 17 All-Star teams. The man who isn't in the picture. Isn't in the Hall of Fame. Isn't welcome in this exclusive club. Oh, he was there in the town of Cooperstown, all right. Very visibly, in fact. Maybe you saw him if you were among the tens of thousands who made a pilgrimage to the village overlooking Lake Otesaga to see the stars come out. Maybe you saw 73-year-old Pete Rose autographing bats and balls for a fee as he sat in front of a rack of red T-shirts emblazoned with: ""Vote Pete Into the Hall of Fame."" Except you can't vote for Pete. No one can. I understand this all too well because I can't vote for Pete, either, and I'm a genuine voter. I actually have a small say in this. I get a Hall of Fame ballot in the mail. I can vote for as many as 10 names on each year's list or as few as none -- my call. I do not vote for Pete Rose, alas, because I cannot. His name is not on the ballot. And write-in votes are neither permitted nor counted, a waste of ink. I can vote (or not) for Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Rafael Palmeiro, Sammy Sosa, certain guys who once seemed to be sure things, but, like front-runners in political campaigns, fell out of favor by the time voters got their ballots. I can vote (or not) for Alan Trammell, Lee Smith, Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and others who have been on the ballot for multiple years without success, guys who still have time to be reassessed and accepted into the game's highest society. Pete Rose, though, is a no-go. He is persona non grata, an ineligible receiver of votes, banned for life. He is not a sympathetic figure. He erred in a way few in baseball have erred. He made bets on games while still in uniform, which was (and still is) strictly prohibited. Rose did not bet against his own team, as some of the similarly disgraced 1919 Chicago White Sox did, but his gambling habits broke a code of conduct, violated a set-in-stone rule and earned him a ""lifetime"" ban that Rose was tagged with after a Major League Baseball internal investigation in 1989. Complicating matters, Rose spent close to 15 years denying all allegations until fessing up in a book he wrote in 2004. Furthermore, he was slapped with a five-month prison sentence and a thousand hours of community service for two felony counts of evading income tax. In 1991, the board of baseball's Hall of Fame placed the name of Pete Rose on the ""permanently ineligible"" list. His is the only name on it. By this point, you have made up your own mind, as so many of us have. You are from one of two camps. One is the ""hasn't Pete suffered enough?"" one. The other is the ""Pete got exactly what he deserved"" one. I occupy the former. In my opinion -- with utmost respect for all who feel otherwise -- a life sentence is unduly harsh. We live on an Earth in which past sins can be forgiven, in which those who commit crimes do their time, pay their debts, then pray for a drop of milk of human kindness. A case could be made that Pete Rose needn't be crucified for what he did, that it wouldn't kill the game of baseball to finally let him off the hook. They say gambling is a sickness, an addiction, like liquor or drugs. They tell us gamblers need help. In the same breath, they tell us funny stories about the Hall of Fame baseball greats who bar-hopped all night, came to the park drunk, played with a hangover, hahaha, what a guy. Oh, that Babe. Oh, that Mickey. It is, of course, a Hall of Fame also occupied by an accused gambler or two, by a wife-beater or two, a philanderer or two, a racist or two, a cheater or two, a rule-breaker or two. Just as today's voters continue to debate who did and didn't demonstrate exemplary character, we could argue whether Pete Rose must be forever bound by ""rules are rules,"" or if rules, as some have been known to say, are made to be changed. I pictured baseball's giants posing for that picture. Gaylord Perry. Roberto Alomar. Goose Gossage. Eddie Murray. Wade Boggs. Jim Rice. A hero here, a hero there. A man missing here, a man missing there, Hall of Fame hallowed figures Ralph Kiner and Tony Gwynn having lost their lives this year. Everybody who showed up to smile for the camera deserved to do exactly that. Each one had stature. Each had acceptance. Each belonged to the club. Pete Rose belongs. Make it so.","Pete Rose broke all kinds of records, made 17 All-Star teams .

"(CNN) -- A new doctor has declared Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling mentally fit after a comprehensive medical examination in Las Vegas over the weekend, CNN confirmed through a source with knowledge of the situation. The exam was conducted by Dr. Jeffrey Cummings, a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic and one of the top dementia and Alzheimer's disease specialists in the country, according to the source. Cummings determined Sterling has no signs of dementia and no lack of mental capacity, but he did show signs of MCI, mild cognitive impairment, which is common in people Sterling's age, the source said. Sterling is 80 years old. The testing, arranged by one of Sterling's attorneys, lasted more than an hour, the source added, and found no indication Sterling can't manage his business affairs. The latest medical exam follows a previous diagnosis by two other doctors, engaged by his estranged wife Shelly Sterling, that determined Sterling is mentally incapacitated. Cummings, the source said, has agreed to testify at the trial over Sterling's mental capacity, which is scheduled for July 7th. Shelly Sterling filed a lawsuit in a dispute over the sale of the team with her estranged husband, asking a Los Angeles court to uphold her deal to sell the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. She contends her husband is incapacitated by the onset of Alzheimer's or another brain disease. The couple co-owns the basketball team. If one of the trustees is declared mentally incapacitated, the other becomes the lone trustee, according to records. His wife used that provision to negotiate the deal with Ballmer. Sterling's attorneys are due in court Monday afternoon for a hearing on legal jurisdiction in the case. They also plan to ask for a postponement in the start of the trial. Donald Sterling made national headlines in early April when a website leaked a phone recording of Sterling making racist comments to a friend. After the recording surfaced, the NBA banned him for life and fined him $2.5 million.

"(CNN) -- Uganda's government institutions will lose U.S. funding as punishment for a law signed earlier this year by President Yoweri Museveni that makes some homosexual acts punishable by life in prison. In addition, the White House said Thursday that Washington will cancel a planned military exercise with Uganda and deny entry to certain Ugandan citizens, including those ""involved in serious human rights abuses, including against LGBT individuals."" The United States will not end its humanitarian support for Uganda or its cooperation to stamp out the Lord's Resistance Army, led by the elusive Joseph Kony. ""We will seek to advance these interests even as we continue -- in Uganda and around the world -- to oppose discriminatory practices and champion human rights for all,"" read the statement by White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Uganda's anti-homosexuality act, first introduced in 2009, originally included a death penalty clause for some such acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. Museveni signed the bill into law in February, two months after Uganda's Parliament passed it after replacing a death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality."" This includes acts in which one person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors, according to Amnesty International. The law calls for the imprisonment of those who counsel or reach out to gays and lesbians -- a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Museveni's position on the law changed several times before he signed it. At one point, he said he wouldn't sign the bill, describing homosexuals as ""sick"" people who needed help, not imprisonment. He said he changed his mind after scientists had determined that there is no gene for homosexuality and that it is merely a choice to embrace abnormal behavior. Museveni told CNN in February that he believes sexual behavior is a matter of choice and gay people are ""disgusting."" Ugandan granted bail in first gay sex trial since tough new law .

"(CNN) -- One of the comedians who was riding in the limo bus with Tracy Morgan during a fatal accident this weekend says the actor ended up unconscious on top of him after the wreck, CNN affiliate WABC reported Tuesday night. The station spoke with Harris Stanton, the only one of the five survivors from the limo who has been released from the hospital. The collision killed comedian James McNair, who performed under the name Jimmy Mack, and injured four others on the bus. Morgan suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg. Stanton didn't realize the van had flipped after it was hit early Saturday on the New Jersey Turnpike. He asked a WABC reporter how many times the limo rolled. He said he was sitting facing Morgan when the accident occurred, which blindsided them because the van had no windows where they were seated. ""When it stopped, Tracy was on top of me and I didn't see anyone else,"" Stanton said. ""I was just saying, 'help me, get me out of here.'"" Morgan moaned but never appeared to be conscious, he said. Stanton sustained a broken wrist and a bruised ankle. A fiancee's plea . Morgan's fiancee, Megan Wollover, asked fans Tuesday to stop speculating about his health after false rumors that he could lose his leg surfaced. ""The concern for his well-being has been overwhelming, but Megan is respectfully asking that the media await official word through these channels before speculating (mostly inaccurately) on his condition,"" Morgan's publicist, Lewis Kay, said in a statement. ""Rumors about amputating his leg are completely fabricated."" Morgan underwent surgery for his broken leg Sunday and is likely to remain hospitalized for several weeks, Kay said Monday. There was no change in his condition -- critical but stable -- on Tuesday, Kay said. ""This recovery will be arduous and we hope that you can be patient during this difficult time,"" Kay said in an earlier statement. Comedian Ardie Fuqua and Jeffrey Millea were also injured in the accident. The truck driver who police say caused the accident has been charged with vehicular homicide and assault by auto. According to a criminal complaint, Kevin Roper, 35, had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. He failed to notice traffic slowing in front of him and hit Morgan's bus despite trying to swerve out of the way, police said. Roper, a driver for Walmart, posted $50,000 bond and was released from jail Saturday night. Walmart said in a statement that it believed Roper was operating within federal rest guidelines, but said it would take full responsibility should the investigation show its truck caused the accident. Morgan, 45, was a regular on ""Saturday Night Live"" for seven years. He later received an Emmy nomination for his role in the comedy series ""30 Rock,"" in which he played Tracy Jordan, an exaggerated version of himself.
